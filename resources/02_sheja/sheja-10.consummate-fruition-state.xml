Thus, the manifest states of realization associated with the five paths and the ten spiritual levels develop stage by stage. On the basis of this process being brought to completion, nirvāṇa as is it understood in any of the three spiritual approaches[662] (especially the nonlimited state of supreme enlightenment[663]) is made evident. Hence we have Book 10, a developmental analysis of the consummate fruition state. This book includes four parts that give detailed treatments reaching a definitive conclusion about the fruition in the cause-based dialectical approach; reaching a definitive conclusion about the more common spiritual attainments of the mantra approach; reaching a definitive conclusion about the consummate fruition in the Vajrayāna; and reaching a definitive conclusion about the specific fruition according to the tradition of the Early Translation School of the secret mantra approach.

Given that nirvāṇa is the fruition to be attained through any of the three spiritual approaches, if I explain it in a general fashion it can be considered in three ways: nirvāṇa as the natural state; nirvāṇa as a state of cessation; and nonlimited nirvāṇa.
Concerning the first case, the Source Verses on Sublime Intelligence states: [4.170.b]
What is expressed in language is faulty
because the finite range of ordinary mind is faulty.
Unborn and unceasing,
the actual nature of phenomena is equivalent to nirvāṇa.[664]
In accord with this verse, the suchness of phenomena is a state of complete purity by its very nature.
Concerning the second case, nirvāṇa as a state of cessation is twofold. There is a nominal aspect, as the Compendium of Abhidharma states:
“In what way are there representational states?” one might ask. There are those states of cessation that come about when the mundane phase of the spiritual path weakens one’s karmic potentials. Therefore, the Blessed One spoke of these as nirvāṇa by way of association, as a foreshadowing.[665]
Accordingly, states of cessation that are attained through one’s devoted intent are the nominal aspect. Authentic states of cessation are those attained through the paths of seeing and meditation. The same source states:
“In what way are there authentic states?” one might ask. There are those states of cessation that come about when the sublime intelligence of a spiritually advanced person completely eradicates one’s karmic potentials.[666]
This, furthermore, has two phases: an incomplete one and a complete one. The former is described in the same source:
“What is the incomplete phase?” one might ask. There are those states of cessation that come about through the paths of training, that is, those that are considered the fruition of either the level of a stream-winner or a nonreturner.[667]
Thus, this phase includes all states of cessation that are associated with the paths of training. The complete phase is also described in the same source:
“What is the complete phase?” one might ask. There is that state of cessation that comes about through the path of no more training, that is, which is considered the fruition of an arhat.[668]
This phase includes all states of cessation associated with the path of no more training. Furthermore, depending on the developmental stages of the individual spiritual approaches, it can include both kinds of arhats: those who experience residual traces and those who do not.[669]
Concerning the third case, that of nonlimited nirvāṇa, due to the influence of the sublime intelligence and compassion of buddhas and bodhisattvas, this is nirvāṇa [4.171.a] that does not fall into either extreme of conditioned existence or personal salvation.

In its essence, the perfect state of complete buddhahood, the consummate fruition state, is imbued with three supreme properties. There is a supreme degree of elimination, in that one dimension of buddhahood is that it is completely purified of the two kinds of obscuration and the habitual patterning that underlies these. There is a supreme degree of realization, in that timeless awareness vividly perceives the entire range of what can be known, with nothing left out. There is a supreme degree of motivation, for on the strength of this realization benefit is ensured for countless beings in ways that are constant, pervasive, and spontaneous. the Ornament of Manifest Realization states:
In three ways (the most sublime motivation toward all beings, elimination, and realization),
this is known to be specifically endowed
with three naturally occurring properties.[670]

“Why is the term ‘buddhahood’ used?” one might ask. The term “buddha” (awakened and expanded[671]) refers to the fact that one has awakened from a state of ignorance (which is comparable to the state of sleep), while one’s mind has expanded to embrace the two aspects of what can be known.[672] As is said:
Because there has been an awakening from the sleep of ignorance
and because the mind has expanded to embrace what can be known,
buddhahood is an awakened and expanded state, comparable to a lotus.[673]

A twofold process of spiritual development consists of bodhicitta as the motivation and the six transcendent perfections as the enactment. [4.171.b] The two kāyas are attained once this process is complete. That is to say, for the sake of developing one’s merit, one acts to ensure benefit for other beings; the rūpakāyas[674] are attained as the result of the full maturation of this reinforcement. For the sake of deepening one’s experience of timeless awareness, one cultivates meditative absorption; dharmakāya is attained as the result of thus divesting oneself of distortions. As the Precious Garland states:
The rūpakāyas of buddhas
are born of the development of merit.
Dharmakāya, in brief,
is born of deepening the majestic experience of timeless awareness.[675]

In which environment, then, is buddhahood accomplished? In the pinnacle pure realm of supreme Akaniṣṭha,[676] which completely transcends the three realms,[677] dharmakāya makes itself evident on the basis of the sambhogakāya, whereupon the nirmāṇakāyas simultaneously demonstrate the way to enlightenment in the one billion world systems of a three-thousandfold universe. The Journey to Śrī Laṅkā states:
In the delightful realm of Akaniṣṭha Ghanavyūha,
beyond the immaculate abodes,[678]
the completely awakened Buddha awakened to buddhahood.
It was an emanation who awakened to buddhahood in this world.[679]
This categorization of three kāyas is a definitive enumeration that was seen to have value. The two rūpakāyas constitute the most excellent benefit for oneself and others, while dharmakāya constitutes their support. As Maitreya states:
The three kāyas exemplify benefit for oneself and others, [4.172.a] as well as the support thereof.[680]
In other sources, it is explained that dharmakāya constitutes one’s own benefit and is ultimate reality, while the rūpakāyas constitute benefit for others and are relative. Of these latter kāyas, the sambhogakāya manifests for those to be guided whose perceptions have been purified, while the nirmāṇakāya manifests for those whose perceptions have not. Thus, the first of the three kāyas is the support for the latter two, and these two are developmental, such that one is in turn the support for the other.[681]
Furthermore, these kāyas do not exist in actuality and are not manifest in the sense that all the limitless obscuring influences of adventitious distortions have been eliminated. Yet they are forever unchanging and so do exist in a sense, constituting as they do the direct experience of the limitless basic space of phenomena. In accord with how they are thus held to be, the kāyas bring the appreciation of an inexhaustible store of wealth. As is stated in the Ornament of the Sūtras:
Those that do not exist in actuality and yet do exist in some sense
are said to be “not manifest yet manifest.”
This statement concerns different contexts.
Because there is enjoyment of all one could desire, they constitute liberation.[682]

As for the derivation of the term “dharmakāya,” in Ascertaining the Conditioned and Unconditioned a passage is cited from the detailed commentary on the sūtra Advice to a King:
The dimension of the actual nature of phenomena is the stratum of authentic being, or dharmakāya. This is because it constitutes the “embodiment” of all phenomena, [4.172.b] in the sense that it does not stray from being the nature that is the suchness of all beings. And it is a “stratum,” or kāya, due to its being the basis for all positive qualities, whether mundane or transcendent.[683]
This accounts for the method of explaining that the term derives from dharmatā-kāya, with the -tā suffix eliminated.[684]
As for its characteristics, the basic space of phenomena, which is endowed with all inexhaustible qualities of enlightenment and is completely pure by nature, serves as the very essence of being itself, free of all adventitious distortions and endowed with twofold purity.[685] This is svabhāvikakāya (the dimension of the very essence of being itself), or dharmakāya. As the Ornament of Manifest Realization states:
The svabhāvikakāya of the Sage
is the attainment of whatever properties are not subject to degeneration,
is completely pure in every way,
and is by nature characterized by these properties.[686]
and the Summary of the Mahāyāna Approach states:
…Svabhāvikakāya is the dharmakāya, the dimension of true being, of all tathāgatas because it constitutes mastery of all phenomena.[687]
If we analyze these aspects, dharmakāya is endowed with eight characteristics: it is even, profound, ever-present, unitary, authentic, pristine, utterly lucid, and concomitant with the perfect richness of being. It is even because there is no distinction between all buddhas with respect to dharmakāya; it is profound because it is difficult to realize, being free of all elaboration; it is ever-present because it is unconditioned, and so unborn and unceasing, not involved in a linear time frame; it is unitary because it is indivisible, for basic space and timeless awareness are not things that are separate; it is authentic because it is incontrovertible, being beyond the limitations of speculative value judgments; it is pristine because it is free of the distortions of the three levels of obscuration;[688] it is utterly lucid because it is nonconceptual awareness focusing on its own nonconceptuality; and it is concomitant with the perfect richness of being [4.173.a] because it serves as the basis for the sambhogakāya, which is the epitome of the vast qualities of enlightenment.

Although there can be no division in essence, according to some methods of explanation the following classification is given: Once both the afflictive and cognitive obscurations have been removed on the spiritual paths, immediately in the wake of the vajralike samādhi, they have all been vanquished; this is the perfection of the process of elimination, which constitutes svabhāvikakāya. Timeless awareness of all that can be known, that is, of things in all their multiplicity and of their real nature just as it is, brings direct perception and thorough comprehension of the characteristics of all phenomena exactly as they are; this is the perfection of the process of realization, which constitutes dharmakāya.
This is so because svabhāvikakāya is characterized as emptiness, which is to say, the nature of all phenomena, a nature that is free of all elaboration and completely pure; dharmakāya is characterized as completely pure timeless awareness that perceives that to be the case, so that these are, in a sense, perceived object and perceiving subject.

As for the derivation of the term “sambhogakāya,” the Ornament of Manifest Realization states:
Because there is thorough appreciation of the wealth of the Mahāyāna approach,
this is held to be the sambhogakāya of the sages.[690]
That is, it is sambhogakāya since it constitutes the basis for the perfect enjoyment of all states of realization that pertain to the Mahāyāna approach; or alternatively, since it expresses the Mahāyāna teachings because of that perfect enjoyment.
As for what characterizes sambhogakāya, in the environment of Ghanavyūha within the realm of supreme Akaniṣṭha, it constitutes a dimension of enlightened form that is adorned with major and minor marks of perfection, [4.173.b] and that together with bodhisattvas and other spiritually advanced beings thoroughly and solely enjoys the teachings of the Mahāyāna approach in an uninterrupted way. As the Ornament of Manifest Realization states:
As for this embodiment of the thirty-two major marks
and eighty minor marks of perfection,
because there is thorough appreciation of the wealth of the Mahāyāna approach,
this is held to be the sambhogakāya of the sages.[691]
If we further distinguish these characteristics, we can consider the sambhogakāya’s retinue, realm, embodiments, attributes, teaching, deeds, spontaneous presence, and absence of independent nature. That is to say, the retinue that shares the sambhogakāya’s enjoyment consists entirely of bodhisattvas on the tenth level of realization. The realm in which such enjoyment takes place is that of Akaniṣṭha Ghanavyūha. The embodiments that experience such enjoyment are Vairocana and the rest.[692] The attributes with which these embodiments are endowed are the thirty-two major and eighty minor marks of perfect form. The teachings that are enjoyed so completely are solely those of the Mahāyāna approach. The deeds that constitute the enlightened activity of the sambhogakāya are those such as the prophesying of how bodhisattvas, as children of the victorious ones, will attain enlightenment. The spontaneous presence of sambhogakāya refers to the fact that the deeds and other such characteristics happen spontaneously, without effort, as though from a wish-fulfilling gem. The absence of independent nature in sambhogakāya refers to the fact that while these embodiments and other manifestations appear in all their variety, like rainbows they do not constitute anything identifiable.[693]
If we discuss the sambhogakāya according to its fivefold certainty,[694] it is said that the certainty of environment is that it is Akaniṣṭha; the certainty of essential qualities is that they are the major and minor marks of perfect form; the certainty of time frame is that it is one of constant presence, until saṃsāra has become naught; the certainty of retinue is that it consists of bodhisattvas on the tenth level of realization; and the certainty of the teaching is that it is solely that of the Mahāyāna approach.
Thus, sambhogakāya is endowed with eight characteristics.[695]

If we analyze the sambhogakāya purely on the conventional level, we can distinguish the greater sambhogakāya that manifests in Ghanavyūha [4.174.a] and the lesser sambhogakāya that manifests in the Akaniṣṭha of the immaculate abodes.[696] Alternatively, these are considered, respectively, the actual sambhogakāya (that is, the abiding mode) and the nominal sambhogakāya (the manifest mode).[697]
In general, learned masters have three interpretations concerning the sambhogakāya. Some are of the opinion that all buddhas of the three times have but one sambhogakāya, and that a second is absolutely out of the question. Others (who feel that such an interpretation resembles the claims made by non-Buddhist holders of extremist views) hold that the sambhogakāyas of buddhas are entirely distinct from one another. Still others state that there is a gradation of sambhogakāya into greater and lesser.
For our purposes, the better methods of explanation are the former and the latter of these three interpretations. Moreover, the Ornament of the Sūtras states:
Buddhas, within incorruptible basic space,
accord with their former embodiments,[698]
yet their bodies are nonexistent, like space,
so buddhahood is neither a unity nor a plurality.[699]
As this passage explains, there is no single autonomous body, and so there is no need to apply this argument any further, to cases of corporeal bodies.[700]
The sambhogakāya, moreover, manifests to bodhisattvas on the tenth level of realization the way that a reflection appears in a mirror, apparent yet lacking any independent nature, and thus serves as the “bridge” to dharmakāya. Being the natural manifestations of the perceiver’s own consciousness, the appearances of sambhogakāyas (from the eyes to the entire form) do not constitute the usual physical structures (from the sense organ of the eye to the whole structure of the body). Given that this is the case, the sambhogakāya is beyond materiality, for what is material cannot possibly exhibit such ongoing and constant presence.
Furthermore, in his marvelous treatise the Presence of Timeless Awareness, the venerable Indrabhūti points out that if one posits some enlightened embodiment that is not one of timeless awareness, since such a body would be something subject to destruction, it would logically follow that timeless awareness was as well. As the treatise itself states:
If one holds that the timeless awareness of buddhas
has a form and is manifold,
then nirvāṇa must also be destructible.
Since a body is something subject to destruction,
then timeless awareness would have to be destructible as well. [4.174.b]
Therefore, it makes no sense for the kāya of the timeless awareness
of buddhahood to be subject to destruction.[701]
Sambhogakāya is classified as having two aspects, constituting buddhahood’s own natural manifestation and a manifestation within the perceptions of bodhisattvas.

The meaning of the term “nirmāṇakāya” is that it implies the certainty of transformation into something else because it constitutes a body that by its nature is an emanation. As the master Daśabalaśrīmitra explains:
Nirmāṇakāya constitutes the enlightened embodiment that is ensured by the very process of an emanation being emanated.[702]
As for what characterizes nirmāṇakāya, to further distinguish its characteristics, we can consider its support, cause, realms, time frame, nature, edifying function, maturing function, and liberating function. That is to say, the support of nirmāṇakāya is dharmakāya, which never wavers. As for the cause, nirmāṇakāya develops out of the supreme compassion that undertakes to benefit limitless beings. The realms of the nirmāṇakāya consist of the entire range of all pure and impure realms in all their variety. The time frame is for as long as saṃsāra endures. The nature of the nirmāṇakāya is that it consists of the forms of three kinds of emanations: of skill; of birth; and of enlightenment. The edifying function of the nirmāṇakāya is that it ensures that beings in ordinary worlds yearn for, and strive toward, one of three kinds of enlightenment[703] in whatever way is appropriate to any given being. The maturing function is that it ensures that those who have begun a spiritual path completely mature in their personal development. The freeing function is that it ensures that those who have been completely matured through its positive influence are freed from the bonds of conditioned existence.
Thus, nirmāṇakāya is endowed with eight characteristics.

If we analyze nirmāṇakāya manifestations, they are of three kinds: nirmāṇakāyas of skill; nirmāṇakāyas of birth; and sublime nirmāṇakāyas. [4.175.a] When the time is right, these nirmāṇakāyas point toward nirvāṇa and act so that those to be guided are brought into contact with the state of complete freedom. As the Ornament of the Sūtras states:
Through constantly demonstrating skill, birth,
and supreme enlightenment and nirvāṇa,[704]
the nirmāṇakāya of buddhahood
is the supreme means for complete liberation.[705]
With respect to the foregoing, there are nirmāṇakāyas of skill, such as the lute player emanating in order to guide the gandharvas;[706] nirmāṇakāyas of birth, revealing themselves as hares and antelopes, for example;[707] and sublime nirmāṇakāyas of supremely enlightened teachers such as Śākyamuni, who carry out such actions as the twelve deeds. The two former kinds are nirmāṇakāyas who have not yet fully matured, while the latter kind is the nirmāṇakāya that has fully matured. This distinction between “not yet fully matured” and “fully matured” is by way of making a precise distinction—of specifying what constitutes complete maturation or not—rather than merely stating things in all-or-nothing terms of maturity.

In the Mahāyāna treatise the Highest Continuum, the essence of the kāyas is discussed in terms of being the perfection of immaculacy, presence, bliss and constancy, and the three kāyas are spoken of as each being characterized as having five attributes.
That is to say, although mind itself, completely pure by its very nature, previously functioned as the basis for habitual patterning, once one has awakened to buddhahood this no longer serves as a basis for such patterning; rather, there is twofold purity, which constitutes the perfection of a sacred immaculacy.
As long as there are conceptual thoughts, mind itself has for the time being the nature of something overlaid with habitual patterning but never itself falls under the derivative influence of those conceptual thoughts, and so it is a sacred presence. The perfection of this quality of sacred presence entails the subsiding of all conceptual elaboration concerning a “self” existing or not existing.[708]
In the most literal sense of the term, conceptual thought based on one’s perceptions has ceased from the eighth level of realization onward. [4.175.b] But one’s nonconceptual perceptions are experienced as the manifestation of the animate and inanimate universe; this constitutes the most subtle level of suffering, the epitome of what by nature is the coordinating faculty of ordinary mind. The perfection of sacred bliss lies in cessation of this subtle level along with its cause (that is, the nonrecognition of pure awareness that is the context for habitual patterning) because this entails the cessation of all suffering, together with its causes.
The consummation of meditation lies in the equalness of conditioned existence and ultimate peace (which is to say, the absence of any true variation between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa), and so there is the discovery of the nature of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa being that of equalness. This constitutes the perfection of a sacred constancy since it is impossible for this situation to change for as long as space itself endures.[709]
Wherever these four “perfections” are complete, there is the kāya of buddhahood; which is to say, these are complete with respect to any of the kāyas from the point of view of the abiding mode of that kāya.
Dharmakāya is characterized as having five attributes: it is unmade; it is unassessable from any dualistic perspective; it is unerringly genuine; it is pure of any obscuration; and it is utterly lucid by its very nature.
Sambhogakāya is characterized as having five attributes: communicating through speech; being manifest as form; engaging uninterruptedly in enlightened deeds; acting through a process of spontaneous accomplishment; and being free of any manifold nature (even though the deeds of the three kāyas may appear to be manifold).
Nirmāṇakāya is characterized as having five attributes: presenting the path to peace; ensuring the maturation of those to be guided; ensuring the outcome of prophetic statements; presenting forms that carry out a variety of enlightened activities in an ongoing way, in whatever way is necessary to guide beings; and manifesting within the perception of someone else’s consciousness.
There are explanations in which it is stated that the two rūpakāyas constitute aspects of buddhahood, other explanations (such as that found in the Holy Golden Light)[710] that they do not, and even other statements to the effect that buddhahood does not exist at all. But learned masters who understand the key points of the teachings accept these all as provisional, definitive, and ultimately definitive statements, respectively.

Of the three distinctive features that pertain to the three kāyas, that of equalness is as follows:
(1) equalness pertains to the dharmakāya of all buddhas, in that there is no arbitrary division within the basic space that is its support;
(2) equalness pertains to the sambhogakāya of all buddhas, in that there is no arbitrary division with respect to their enlightened intent;
(3) equalness pertains to the nirmāṇakāyas of all buddhas, in that their enlightened activity shares a common purpose.
The Ornament of the Sūtras states:
These entail equalness due to support,
enlightened intent, and enlightened activity.[711]

The distinctive feature of constancy is as follows:
(1) as for dharmakāya, since it epitomizes freedom from origin and cessation in ultimate reality, there is constancy due to its very nature;
(2) as for sambhogakāya, because there is an uninterrupted enjoyment of the richness of the dharma, there is constancy in that this is not subject to impairment;
(3) as for nirmāṇakāyas, even though they disappear, they reveal themselves again and again, so that while they are alike in being discontinuous individually, there is constancy in the continuity of the function they perform because this does not fade with time.

These entail constancy due to nature, uninterruptedness, and continuity.[712]

Furthermore, it should be understood that the two rūpakāyas occur due to the coming together of three factors: the blessings of dharmakāya; the perceptions of those to be guided; and the embodiments themselves, which are produced through previous aspirations.

The meaning of the term is discussed in the Two-Volume Glossary:
Dharma-dhātu-viśuddha is Sanskrit for the Tibetan chos kyi dbyings rnam par dag pa (the completely pure basic space of phenomena). This refers to what gives rise to, and is the source of, the qualities of spiritually advanced beings (qualities such as powers and states of fearlessness) and serves as the context for these qualities. Thus, the basic space of phenomena (the state of suchness) is clear of, or purified of, adventitious obscurations, both afflictive and cognitive, which are like clouds in their adventitiousness. Being like the clear and cloudless vault of the sky, this is termed “the completely pure basic space of phenomena.”[713]
As for its essential qualities, this aspect of timeless awareness is such that basic space and pure awareness cannot be divided, as things distinct from one another, for there is nothing subject to origination in the first place, location in the interim, or cessation in the final analysis. It is free of the three levels of obscuration, for it does not constitute some object that falls within either of the two extremes of misinterpretation (that is, exaggeration or denial).[714] It does not constitute an object for conceptual thinking, for it is by its very nature free of the distortions that produce such flawed thinking. The completely pure basic space of phenomena is the incontrovertible nature—the suchness—of all phenomena. [4.177.a] It serves as the proximate cause that gives rise to all the qualities of spiritually advanced beings, and is the very epitome of what all tathāgatas ultimately constitute. The Highest Continuum states:
Without beginning, middle, or end, undifferentiated,
without the two extremes, free of the three levels of obscuration, immaculate, and nonconceptual—
the realization of what is the nature of the basic space of phenomena
is perceived by the yogic practitioner resting in meditative equipoise.[715]

The meaning of the term is discussed in the Two-Volume Glossary:
Ādarśa-jñāna is Sanskrit for the Tibetan me long lta bu’i ye shes (mirrorlike timeless awareness). Since the completely pure basic space of phenomena involves no elaboration, it is free of all concepts based on a framework of perceived objects and a perceiving subject. The term refers to the fact that, with the transformation of consciousness as the basis of all ordinary experience,[716] the reflections of all phenomena manifest to this awareness, just as anything and everything is reflected in a polished mirror.[717]
As for its essential qualities, due to the fact that this aspect of timeless awareness involves no fixated perception of what pertains to an “I,” there is at all times knowledge of the limitless sense objects, perceived as clearly as are reflections in a mirror. So there is no delusion concerning all that is knowable, nor is this awareness dependent on the experiencing of the images of these sense objects. As the Ornament of the Sūtras states:
Mirrorlike timeless awareness involves no sense of “mine.”
It is constant, knowing without in any way fragmenting.
Undeluded concerning all that is knowable,
it nevertheless is never biased toward them.[718]

The meaning of the term is discussed in the former source:
Samatā-jñāna is Sanskrit for the Tibetan mnyam pa nyid kyi ye shes (timeless awareness as equalness). Initially, on the first bodhisattva level, when completely pure meditation on the significance of suchness leads to actual realization,[719] there is no longer any division experienced between “self” and “other,” for the realization is one of their equalness. One then trains in higher and higher bodhisattva levels until, on the level of buddhahood, nirvāṇa that is not static or limited is attained. At that point, the afflictive aspect of consciousness has undergone a transition, [4.177.b] being transformed into an aspect of timeless awareness that is termed “timeless awareness as equalness.”[720]
As for its essential qualities, on the paths of training[721] one meditates on the equalness of self and other. One’s experience of this equalness becomes purer and more familiar, leading to the attainment of nonlimited nirvāṇa. Then there is knowledge of the equalness of all of conditioned existence and the peace of nirvāṇa. As the same source states:
Timeless awareness as equalness is held to derive
from pure meditation on all beings which,
once one has attained a nonlimited state of peace,
is held to become timeless awareness as equalness.[722]

The meaning of the term is discussed in the former source:
Pratyavekṣ(aṇ)ā-jñāna is Sanskrit for the Tibetan so sor rtog pa’i ye shes (discerning timeless awareness). With the transformation of consciousness as the coordinating mental faculty,[723] this awareness serves as the ground for all powers of recall and all states of meditative absorption, stability, and equipoise.[724] Since this is timeless awareness that appreciates all that can be known without hindrance, it serves as the cause for a great downpour of spiritual teachings to rain down, for various kinds of doubt to be eradicated, just as gems such as sapphires shine with their luster.[725] This is what is termed “discerning timeless awareness.”[726]
As for its essential qualities, this awareness cognizes and discerns individual objects of knowledge in all their multiplicity (that is to say, both their general and their specific defining characteristics) without confusion, appreciating them effortlessly; and it is endowed with limitless avenues of expression, as powers of recall and meditative absorption. As the same source states:
Discerning timeless awareness
is never hindered with respect to all objects of knowledge.
It is entirely like a treasure trove
of meditative absorption and powers of recall.[727]

Kṛtyānuṣṭhāna(-jñāna) is Sanskrit for the Tibetan bya ba grub pa’i ye shes (timeless awareness as ensured fulfillment). With the transformation of the avenues of consciousness associated with the five sense faculties of vision and so forth, this awareness serves as the basis for benefit to be ensured for many beings in all world systems, through an immeasurable variety of skillful means. [4.178.a] This is termed “timeless awareness as ensured fulfillment.”[728]
As for its essential qualities, this awareness constitutes knowing how to ensure benefit for beings through a manifold display of skill in means, in order that those to be guided may be completely brought to spiritual maturity throughout limitless world systems. As the same source states:
Timeless awareness as ensured fulfillment

</d>
<d e="2">
Timeless awareness as the basic space of phenomena is authenticated by one’s thorough involvement in an enormous process of eliminating faults, due to such factors as the maturation of the habitual patterns that develop when one hears spiritual teachings. The Summary of the Mahāyāna Approach states:
Consider the habitual patterns[730] associated with hearing teachings (whether of a small, middling, or great degree) to be the seeds of dharmakāya.[731]
And as the Ornament of the Sūtras states:
Whenever the seeds of the afflictive and cognitive obscurations, which have been constantly reinforced for a very long time,
are utterly destroyed by a thoroughgoing process of elimination on a very vast scale,
there is perfect buddhahood itself, the attainment endowed with the transformation of positive qualities;[732]
and that is gained through the path of timeless awareness, the infinite embrace of nonconceptual and utter purity.[733]
In similar ways, mirrorlike timeless awareness derives from one’s hearing and retaining many spiritual teachings; timeless awareness as equalness, from one’s meditating on the equalness of oneself and others; discerning timeless awareness, from one’s clearly presenting authentic spiritual teachings, and timeless awareness as ensured fulfillment, from one’s acting for the welfare of others. As the Ornament of the Sūtras states:
From retention, from an appreciation of equalness,
from a clear presentation of authentic spiritual teachings, [4.178.b]
and from the accomplishment of what is to be done,
these four aspects of timeless awareness are derived.[734]

With respect to consciousness as the basis of all ordinary experience, the transformation of one’s experience of its empty aspect constitutes what is termed “timeless awareness as the basic space of phenomena,” while the transformation of one’s experience of its lucid aspect constitutes “mirrorlike timeless awareness.” The transformation of one’s experience of the afflictive aspect of consciousness constitutes “timeless awareness as equalness.” The transformation of one’s experience of consciousness as the coordinating mental faculty constitutes “discerning timeless awareness.” The transformation of one’s experience of the five sense consciousnesses constitutes “timeless awareness as ensured fulfillment.” As the master Candragomin states:
Whatever constitutes consciousness as the basis of all ordinary experience
becomes mirrorlike timeless awareness itself.
Furthermore, as for awareness as the basic space of phenomena,
some hold this to be the very essence of being itself.
The transformation of the afflictive aspect of consciousness
is described as “timeless awareness as equalness.”
As for discerning timeless awareness,
this is consciousness as the coordinating mental faculty.
Because the avenues of consciousness associated with the five sensory faculties
completely appreciate all meaningful objects of experience,
whatever constitutes these avenues of consciousness brings attainment
of timeless awareness as ensured fulfillment for the sake of all ordinary beings.[735]
Concerning the significance of the transformation that takes place, it is said that
the seed of conditioned existence is ordinary consciousness.[736]
Or, with respect to the characteristics of ordinary consciousness as a component of perception, it is said that
ordinary consciousness, which is corruptible,
is consciousness as a component of perception, and the support for rebirth.[737]
But these citations are not relevant here because the continuity of such ordinary kinds of consciousness is transmuted into the very essence itself of timeless awareness uncontaminated by afflictive states. The process is analogous to base metal being transformed into gold by the philosopher’s stone.

Of the five aspects of timeless awareness, the two of awareness as the basic space of phenomena and mirrorlike awareness pertain to dharmakāya. The two of awareness as equalness and discerning awareness pertain to sambhogakāya. Awareness as ensured fulfillment pertains to nirmāṇakāya. The subsuming of these five aspects of timeless awareness within the three kāyas is discussed in the sūtra the Level of Buddhahood. [738]
Concerning the issues of whether or not timeless awareness exists on the level of buddhahood and of how knowing takes place through timeless awareness, there have been any number of Indian and Tibetan authors, the vast majority of whom have developed theories through their intellectual investigations. But if we consider things from the perspective of ultimate reality, because this timeless awareness of buddhahood transcends the scope of the ordinary intellect, it is free of all limitations imposed by conceptual elaboration of its existing or not existing, of its being or not being anything. As well, the sūtra the Request of Suvikrānta-vikrami [739] states that timeless awareness is free of both existence and nonexistence.
Regarding the way in which this timeless awareness knows what is knowable, the actual nature of phenomena is known such that it is not something manifest,[740] while the Middle Way source the Two Levels of Truth goes on to state:
Devoid[741] of things that are conceptually imputed,…
.. . all that is produced dependently is perceived by an omniscient one.[742]
As this passage indicates, relative reality is known in the way that it manifests, but merely as the manifestation of the interdependence of causes and effects, not as something theorized by philosophers through intellectual investigation.[743] There is also knowledge of the aspect of one’s individual conceptual imputations manifesting in one’s own mind; this is analogous to the way in which someone with the supernormal ability to perceive the minds of others can be aware of a dream occurring in the perception of someone else who is dreaming.
Therefore, because the way in which timeless awareness knows all that is knowable lies beyond the realm of intellectual speculation, it cannot be fathomed by the ordinary imagination of the majority of mundane minds. As is stated in the Journey to Śrī Laṅkā:
One’s individual self-knowing timeless awareness
is not within the realm of those who engage in intellectual speculation.[744]
And in the Detailed Commentary on Valid Cognition:
The investigation of forms, as well as mind,
as things that can be characterized as perceived objects
pertains to those with ordinary impure minds; [4.179.b]
but the realization of a yogic practitioner is inconceivable to the ordinary imagination.[745]
When one adopts the perspective of relative reality, if the term “timeless awareness” is applied to ordinary mind and mental events, no such timeless awareness exists because all such confusion has come to an end. But if one considers that this awareness knows all that can be known, without exception, there is awareness present because the kāya of a transformed state of being has been attained.[746]

The qualities of perfect buddhahood are limitless and cannot truly be quantified, but if we were to summarize all of them, they would fall within two categories. There are some thirty-two qualities that derive from the fruition that simply consists of a divestment from distorting influences; these qualities are primordially indivisible from dharmakāya, the ultimate dimension of buddhahood that is the consummate expression for one’s own welfare. And there are some thirty-two qualities that derive from a process of complete maturation, these qualities develop gradually and are present in the rūpakāyas, the relative dimension of buddhahood that is the consummate expression for the welfare of others. In the Highest Continuum we find such statements as the following:
One’s own welfare and that of others constitute, respectively,
the kāya that is the ultimate dimension of enlightened being and,
dependent on that, the kāyas that are the relative dimension.
Due to the processes of divestment and complete maturation,[748]
the qualities of enlightenment can be analyzed to be some sixty-four in number.[749]

The single power that is the timeless awareness of a tathāgata can be further analyzed into ten powers on the basis of what constitutes the focus of the knowing involved. These ten powers that are ensured with buddhahood are as follows:
(1) the power of knowing what is appropriate (for example, the attainment of desirable results due to the natural consequences of positive actions undertaken with a firm resolve based on one’s previous arousal of bodhicitta and the bodhisattva vow) or inappropriate (for example, the attainment of an undesirable result due to the foregoing circumstances);[750]
(2) the power of knowing the inevitable consequences of karma (that is, due to the demonstration of the results of karma, knowing that the actions that any individual being commits create karma, the effects of which are experienced within the stream of that same individual’s consciousness);[751]
(3) the power of knowing the greater or lesser capacity of beings (that is, through teaching the dharma to beings in accord with their capacities, knowing their individual capacities for faith, and so forth);
(4) the power of knowing the temperaments of beings in all their variety (that is, by relating to their individual temperaments, knowing the distinct types of individuals who follow the three spiritual approaches[752]);[753]
(5) the power of knowing the aspirations of beings in all their variety (that is, by relating to their individual aspirations, knowing the various aspirations of beings, for example, whether they aspire to some state that is still corruptible, or to one that is incorruptible);[754]
(6) the power of knowing paths that lead to all destinies (that is, through being familiar with all spiritual approaches, knowing all the paths that lead anywhere, to saṃsāra or nirvāṇa;[755]
(7) the power of knowing all modes of being, whether those of deeply ingrained afflictive states or those of completely refined states of enlightenment (that is, due to immersion in meditative absorption, knowing all states of meditative stability, modes of liberation, and so forth);
(8) the power of recalling former lifetimes (since what is positive never ceases to have effect);[756]
(9) the power of knowing death, transition, and rebirth (due to the clairvoyance that comes from such factors as one’s altruistic motivation toward other beings);[757] and
(10) the power of knowing the state of peace in which all that is corruptible has come to an end (due to the teaching of the dharma for the purpose of putting an end to all that is corruptible).[758]
In the foregoing ways, these ten powers are comparable to a vajra because they overcome obscurations such as the nonrecognition of pure awareness, such that awareness can never again be fragmented by these obscurations.

That is to say:
(1) There is fearlessness in the experience of all phenomena from the perspective of manifest enlightenment. [4.180.b] Buddhas have such knowledge, and even thorough comprehension, of all phenomena that there is no way for anyone in the world, no matter how powerful, to dispute this by saying, “Such is not the case.” This is called “[fearlessness in] consummate realization.”
(2) There is fearlessness in the end of what is corruptible. All that is corruptible, such as desire and attachment, has come to an end. Therefore, for buddhas (who can attest to that) there is no way for this fact to be disputed. This is called “[fearlessness in] consummate renunciation.”
(3) There is fearlessness in declaring which factors obstruct the spiritual path. Since buddhas see directly that such factors as sensory pleasures and attachment to personal salvation constitute spiritual obstacles, there is no way that the declaration that this is so can be disputed.
(4) There is fearlessness in proclaiming the path of the will to be free. Because buddhas see directly that complete freedom is gained through the factors that contribute to enlightenment, and through no other factors, there is no way that anyone can dispute the declaration that this is so.
The first two states constitute the consummate expression of one’s own welfare, while the latter two constitute the consummate expression of others’ welfare. Due to these four states of fearlessness, a buddha teaches the dharma to a retinue without fear or anxiety, and so is compared to a lion.

There are six qualities only buddhas possess that fall under the heading of conduct, six that fall under the heading of realization, three that fall under the heading of enlightened deeds, and three that fall under the heading of sublime intelligence. These are the eighteen distinctive qualities that are not shared by śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and others. Though directly perceptible to others, these qualities have no tangible forms but belong to the realm of what is unconditioned, analogous to space, which is distinct from the four elements.[759]
The first kind of qualities are those falling under the heading of conduct. Arhats can behave with confusion, such as walking in the path of a mad bull elephant; they can speak without real purpose, using jokes and sarcasm; [4.181.a] they can forget something they have memorized; they do not rest in meditative equipoise during postmeditation; they entertain ideas of conditioned existence and the state of peace having truly distinct natures; and they rest in a state of apathy, without examining those to be guided. On the other hand, (1) in the physical conduct of tathāgatas, there is no confusion, such as would cause them to tread unwittingly on a snake. (2) In the words they speak, there is no lack of real purpose, such as the uttering of meaningless words. (3) In the way their minds work, there is no loss of memory, for they can recall their deeds and words over long periods of time without any distortions due to afflictive states. (4) There is no point at which they are not resting in meditative equipoise, for their enlightened awareness is constantly engaged at all times, in meditative equipoise and postmeditation. (5) There is no idea of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa being distinct from one another, for they have gained consummate realization of the equalness of conditioned existence and the state of peace. (6) They do not rest in a state of apathy, without examining those to be guided, although the possibility exists that they might forego intervening once they had examined them, if there were no benefit to doing so. These are the six qualities that fall under the heading of conduct.
The second kind of qualities are the six falling under the heading of realization. Since they still possess a residual degree of cognitive obscurations, arhats can experience a diminishment of their will and the rest of the six factors. On the other hand, tathāgatas have eliminated absolutely every cognitive obscuration. For them, therefore, there is none of the complete diminishment that a lack of attainment would entail, not in (7) their diligence,[760] or in (8) their mindfulness,[761] or in (9) their faculty of sublime intelligence,[762] or in (10) their will concerning these three,[763] or in (11) the complete freedom that is their fruition,[764] or in (12) the enlightened perspective of timeless awareness associated with that fruition state. These are the six qualities that fall under the heading of realization. In enumerating these qualities, one may follow the intent of different sūtras. Thus, the Prajñāpāramitā literature refers to two of them as “meditative absorption” and “complete freedom.” Other treatments refer to “meditative absorption” and “the enlightened perspective of complete freedom.” And the Highest Continuum, drawing on the sūtra the Request of the Girl Ratnā,[765] refers to “complete freedom” and “the enlightened perspective of complete freedom.”[766] [4.181.b] In cases where meditative absorption is not included, the intention is that this quality is already included in the foregoing discussion of there never being a point at which buddhas are not resting in meditative equipoise.[767]
The third kind of qualities are the three falling under the heading of enlightened deeds.[768] These are referred to in the Highest Continuum:
Their actions are preceded by timeless awareness….[769]
That is to say, the physical, verbal, and mental actions of arhats are sometimes morally positive and sometimes morally neutral. On the other hand, all the (13) physical, (14) verbal, and (15) mental deeds and activities of tathāgatas are motivated entirely by timeless awareness, and so are “preceded by timeless awareness” as the causal motivation at the outset. These deeds take place in conjunction with timeless awareness and “follow in the wake of timeless awareness” as the motivation for the duration, and so they are entirely positive morally. Such are the three distinctive qualities of enlightened activity, unshared by others.
The fourth kind of qualities are the three falling under the heading of sublime intelligence.[770] The pristine awareness of arhats cannot be experienced through strength of mind alone but entails some degree of attachment and does not constitute realization of everything; it is, therefore, somewhat impeded in its functioning. On the other hand, tathāgatas realize all that there is to be known through strength of mind alone, and so they have attained the unobscured enlightened perspective of timeless awareness that involves no wishful thinking, unattached to and unimpeded concerning things that (16) occurred in the past, (17) will occur in the future, and (18) occur in the present. Such is their distinctive timeless awareness, unshared by others.
From among the four schools of Buddhist philosophy,[771] the inclusion of such qualities as the lack of real purpose in these eighteen distinctive qualities is the explanation according to the Sautrāntika school. The Treasury of Abhidharma states:
The distinctive qualities of buddhahood
are eighteen: the powers and the rest.[772]
Here it is referring to the explanation according to the commentaries in the Vaibhāṣika system, which enumerates these eighteen as being the ten powers, the four states of fearlessness, the three distinctive applications of mindfulness,[773] and great compassion.[774]

In a more extensive treatment of the qualities that pertain to dharmakāya, the ultimate dimension of enlightenment, the Ornament of Manifest Realization, in its section dealing with the fruition of dharmakāya,[775] speaks of twenty-one categories of incorruptibility.
(1) The first category is that of the factors that contribute to enlightenment. These factors, which fall under the heading of the enlightened form of the tathāgatas, begin with the applications of mindfulness and continue up to the eightfold path of noble ones. When one is an ordinary being, these factors are not evident, for the partial power deriving from the process of divestment is anything but fully developed. But this is not so for buddhas, for whom it is fully developed and there is freedom from distortions. Then these factors are subsumed within the basic space of incorruptible timeless awareness; in fact, this principle applies to all of the categories of the incorruptibility of timeless awareness.
(2) The second category is that of love and the other immeasurable attitudes, which for beings other than buddhas bring about rebirth among the Brahmā gods.[776]
(3) The third category is that of the eight modes of complete liberation.[777] Two of these are called “the mode of liberation in what has form regarding what has form” (that is, the way one regards external forms while still thinking of one’s inner consciousness as something having form[778]) and “the mode of liberation in what has no form regarding what has form” (that is, the way one regards external forms while no longer thinking of one’s inner consciousness as having form[779]). There is one mode called “the mode of liberation in beauty,” which consists of one’s having direct experiences, through one’s physical senses, of what is attractive by nature and remaining completely focused on those experiences.[780] There are four modes called “perceptual processes” focusing on space, consciousness, nothingness, and neither perception nor nonperception.[781] And there is one mode called the “cessation” of perception and sensation.[782] [4.182.b]
(4) The fourth category is that of the nine successive stages of meditative equipoise. These are the states of equipoise associated with the four levels of meditative stability associated with the realm of form; the four states of equipoise associated with the formless realm;[783] and the “equipoise of cessation.”[784]
(5) The fifth category is that of the ten states of total immersion: in the perception of earth, water, fire, air, blue, yellow, red, white, infinite space, and infinite consciousness.[785]
(6) The sixth category is that of the eight sense fields that eclipse ordinary perceptions.[786] The first four of these include two that are said to eclipse one’s perceptions of external forms while one is still thinking of one’s inner consciousness as something having form (that is, one looks at external forms and perceives them individually as either small or enormous); and two that are said to eclipse one’s perceptions of external forms while one is no longer thinking of one’s inner consciousness as something having form (that is, one looks at external forms and perceives them individually as either small or enormous). The latter four are said to bring states of perception that eclipse all others; that is to say, while no longer thinking of one’s inner consciousness as something having form, one perceives everything as a blue field, a yellow field, a red field, or a white field. In brief, one attains the power to arrest the perceptions that beings in similar circumstances share of the four elements and four basic colors and to cause these perceptions to disappear. These are states of meditative absorption that cause one to see the whole world as though made entirely, or solely, of something like gold, or to be totally immersed in such a perception.

(7) The seventh category is that of the absence of afflictive states, that is, whatever constitutes the “meditative absorption that uproots” the harmful flow of these afflictive states in the minds of others.
(8) The eighth category is that of sublime intelligence born of aspiration.[787] In actuality a buddha’s mind is free of all that can be characterized by ordinary conceptual elaboration and never wavers from having such a nature. But with respect to those who are to be guided by a buddha and view things in terms of their ordinary characteristics, [4.183.a] it also entails the fulfillment of aspirations to overcome their desires and attachments and resolve their doubts. Thus, the timeless awareness of tathāgatas engages in activity for the sake of beings in all circumstances, for as long as saṃsāra lasts. It also entails knowledge, once the state of complete freedom has been gained, that engages in activity for the sake of beings in all circumstances.[788]
(9) The ninth category is that of the six levels of deeper discernment. These are:
(a) “divine sight, ” that is, the clairvoyant ability to see all the physical bodies that any and all beings will take upon their rebirth after death in their present lifetime, no matter how near or far they are from one;
(b) “divine hearing,” that is, the clairaudient ability to hear and understand all manner of sounds and languages and codes;
(c) the knowledge of the different states of others’ minds, that is, the telepathic ability to know all the thoughts and underlying habitual patterns, both major and minor, in the minds of beings;
(d) the ability to perform physical miracles, such as knowing how to make one’s body shine resplendently, fly, multiply or decrease in number, become more or less attractive, move on water, or pass through solid earth;
(e) the recollection of former lifetimes, that is, recall of what rebirths beings experienced prior to the present one and what actions they committed in those former lifetimes; and
(f) the “knowledge of the exhaustion of all negative factors,” that is, the knowledge that such exhaustion has taken or is taking place and that the experience of unborn timeless awareness has been attained, through one’s being aware of the steps by which the factors to be eliminated on the paths of seeing and meditation have been removed or have yet to be.
(10) The tenth category is that of the four states of authentic discernment.[789] These are:
(a) the authentic discernment of spiritual teachings, that is, teaching the eighty-four thousand spiritual approaches of the dharma as myriad antidotal methods, in accord with the different inclinations of ordinary beings;
(b) the authentic discernment of meaning, that is, knowledge of both concepts and their implications, with respect to what characterizes phenomena in general (that they are impermanent, contribute to suffering, are empty, and lack any independent nature), as well as what characterizes them on the more ultimate level (that their nature is unborn and unceasing);
(c) the authentic discernment of language, that is, knowledge of the languages and terms used by ordinary beings and a lack of any ignorance concerning the underlying meanings of these words; and
(d) the authentic discernment of poise, that is, the unhindered ability to teach the dharma and resolve doubts. [4.183.b]
(11) The eleventh category is that of the four aspects of complete purity: body, attention, mind, and timeless awareness.[790]
(12) The twelfth category is that of the ten kinds of control. As explained before,[791] these are:
Control over longevity, mind, material objects, activity,
rebirth, devoted intent, aspiration,
miraculous powers, timeless awareness, and phenomena.[792]
Of these ten kinds of control, the first three are the results of generosity; those over activity and rebirth, of discipline; that over devoted intent, of patience; that over aspiration, of diligence; that over miraculous powers, of meditative stability; and the last two controls, of sublime intelligence. On the paths of training, one experiences approximations of these controls; the actual controls pertain solely to the level of buddhahood.

(13) The thirteenth category is that of the ten powers.
(14) The fourteenth category is that of the four states of fearlessness.
(15) The fifteenth category is that of the three factors that need not be closely guarded,[793] which concern the fact that the physical, verbal, and mental conduct of tathāgatas is completely pure of any confusion. Thus, the nature of buddhahood is such that it does not involve any mistaken conduct, nothing that one would be anxious about others knowing, or that would involve any such attitude as, “I am ashamed of or embarrassed by this, and so will conceal it so no one will know.”
(16) The sixteenth category is that of the three applications of mindfulness. When a tathāgata teaches the dharma, there are those who wish to listen with devotion; those who do not wish to listen; and those who are ambivalent, at times devoted and at other times not. In such cases, a tathāgata is entirely devoid of any responses, respectively, of attachment, anger, or some combination of emotional reactions, and so is said to “rest in the mindfulness of impartiality.”
(17) The seventeenth category is that of the actual nature that does not entail forgetfulness, which is to say, does not constitute a state of oblivion. This ensures that enlightened deeds for the sake of ordinary beings take place in a timely manner, in whatever way is necessary to guide beings under any circumstances. Thus, it is a characteristic of these deeds that it is impossible for them to be delayed beyond the appropriate situation.
(18) The eighteenth category is that of the authentic overcoming of habitual patterns. [4.184.a] This is due to the elimination of the potentials for what are, in essence, the afflictive and cognitive obscurations.
(19) The nineteenth category is that of supreme innate compassion for beings; this refers to what is called an “altruistic attitude” toward all limitless beings.
(20) The twentieth category is that of the eighteen distinctive qualities, that is, qualities that are not shared with spiritually advanced beings of lesser development.[794]
(21) The twenty-first category is that of omniscience, which is to say, knowledge of anything and everything, the omniscience of the fruition state.[795]
The foregoing categories are explained as pertaining to the nature of dharmakāya, which is complete freedom from all states that involve factors to be eliminated.

Of the two kinds of rūpakāya, sambhogakāya is comparable to the moon shining in the sky, while nirmāṇakāya is comparable to the moon’s reflection in water. Although these manifestations appear in all their variety in response to those to be guided, they do not in essence constitute anything that can be found to exist as such. As for the qualities that are due to a process of maturation, there are thirty-two major marks of perfect form and eighty minor marks, as well as the qualities of enlightened speech.

(24) due to their thoughts having been without deceit, their eyelashes are glossy and even, like those of an ox;
(25) due to their having praised what is praiseworthy, their faces are lovely and free of blemish, and between their eyebrows are urṇas, formed of single white hairs coiled in a circle thirty-two times;

(31) due to their having involved everyone (themselves and others) in the practice of meditative stability, their bodies are large but well proportioned, like the proportions of a fully grown banyan tree;[800] and
(32) due to the buddhas’ being wholly noble ones, unrivalled, and supreme seers, their bodies are strong, endowed with the power of Nārāyaṇa.[801]

The eighty minor major marks are as described in the Ornament of Manifest Realization:
The Sage has (1) nails that are copper colored, (2) glossy, and (3) raised;
fingers[802] that are (4) round, (5) wide, and (6) tapered;
(7) veins that are inconspicuous and (8) without knots;
(9) inconspicuous ankles; (10) equal-sized feet;
the gait of (11) a lion, (12) an elephant, (13) a bird, (14) and a bull;
(15) a gait that tends to the right;
(16) an elegant gait; (17) an erect posture;
a physique that is (18) well rounded, (19) smooth as though polished, (20) and evenly proportioned;
a body that is (21) clean, (22) soft, and (23) pure;
(24) marks of perfection in their entirety;
(25) a large and noble body structure; [4.185.b]
(26) an even gait; (27) eyes that are both perfectly formed;
a body that is (28) exceedingly youthful, (29) unimpaired, (30) full fleshed, and (31) very firm and solid;
(32) exceedingly well-defined limbs;
(33) clear and unobscured vision;
a belly that is (34) rounded, (35) smooth, (36) without folds, and (37) firm;
a navel that is (38) deep and (39) spirals to the right;
(40) a form that is beautiful when viewed from any side;
(41) impeccable behavior;
a body that is (42) free of moles and blemishes;
(43) hands as soft as cotton;
palm lines that are (44) deep, (45) long, and (46) clearly outlined;
(47) a face that is not too long;
(48) lips as red as a bimba fruit;
a tongue that is (49) supple, (50) slender, and (51) red;
(52) a voice like thunder;
(53) a pleasant and gentle voice;
canine teeth that are (54) cylindrical, (55) sharp, (56) white, (57) equal in size, and (58) tapered;
a (59) high-bridged nose that is (60) extremely pure and clean;
(61) eyes that are long from corner to corner,
with (62) thick lashes and (63) pupils with the luster of lotus petals;
eyebrows that are (64) long, (65) soft, (66) glossy, and (67) made up of hairs of equal length;
(68) long and well-muscled arms;
(69) ears of equal size (70) with completely unimpaired hearing;
a brow that is (71) well formed and (72) broad;
(73) a large head;
hair that is (74) as bluish-black as that of a bumblebee,
(75) thick, (76) soft, (77) not tangled, (78) not unruly,
and (79) fragrant with a scent that captivates people’s hearts;
and (80) the adorning marks of the “endless knot,” auspicious emblems, and the swastika.[803]
These are held to be the noble minor marks of a buddha.[804]
Of the foregoing points, “nails that are …raised” means that they are not sunken; “inconspicuous ankles” means that the ankles joints do not protrude outward; “equal-sized feet” means that they are of the same length, width, and thickness. Buddhas walk with “the gait of a lion” because their splendor overwhelms humans and other beings who live on the surface of the earth; with “the gait of an elephant” because their splendor overwhelms nāgas [4.186.a] and other beings who live beneath the earth; with “the gait of a bird” (that is, a swan or an eagle) because their splendor overwhelms beings who fly through the air or otherwise live above the earth; and with “the gait of a bull” because they lead their retinues. The “marks of perfection” are clearly and fully evident “in their entirety.” Their bellies are “firm” because they are broad yet lovely. A buddha’s “navel …is deep” (that is, deeply inset), and the wrinkles therein “spiral to the right” (that is, in a clockwise direction). A buddha’s face is not marred by the flaw of being too large, and a buddha’s voice is not marred by the flaw of being too faint. A buddha’s two “eyebrows …are long” because they meet, and a buddha’s “brow …is well formed” because it is wide without being protruding, and the hairline is symmetrical. A buddha’s palms and soles are marked with designs of the endless knot, of wheels with seven concentric rims adorned with a series of auspicious emblems, and of squarish patterns in the shape of revolving swastikas. The remaining points are easy to understand.
One might ask, “What kind of things do these marks constitute in their very essence?” There are different opinions concerning this question. According to those who follow the śrāvakas schools,[805] these marks are part of the realm of physical forms, which is to say, they are phenomena constructed of minute particles, and in their very essence are inanimate matter that exist as meaningful objects external to the perceiver. According to the idealist philosophers,[806] in terms of their essence these marks constitute meditative absorption in conjunction with the cooperative influence of sublime intelligence, while in terms of their function they are said to create impressions in the perceptions of those who are to be guided by buddhas; thus these marks constitute only external appearances induced in the conscious awareness of those to be guided.[807]
However, in the present explanation, we need to use some classification of these marks as being in some sense things with form within the realm of conventional designation. In a similar vein, those Madhyamikas whose position accords with that of the Yogacāra[808] analyze these marks in detail, feeling that they constitute manifestations that have validity on the relative level. To analyze these marks in accord with their interpretation:
To say that these marks are “mind’s own natural manifestations”
is not something that ordinary individuals could understand;
nevertheless, that fact that they can see these as having form [4.186.b]
is something that holds meaning for them.[809]

As for the enlightened activities of perfect buddhas, these do not involve ordinary factors in the slightest, neither a specific thought (such as “I will carry out this or that activity”) nor any deliberate effort. Rather, they come about through the force of the previous processes of arousing motivation and developing aspirations on a vast scale. In this sense, these activities take place in the same way that rays of light shine from a wish-fulfilling gem without effort, or that the four principles of the dharma are taught through the sound of the great drum of the gods without deliberate thought being needed. Whatever the individual temperaments, attitudes, acumen, and latent potentials of those to be guided, the limitless and miraculous display of enlightened form, speech, and mind occurs in such a way that inconceivable benefit for those to be guided is effortlessly and spontaneously accomplished.
The orb of the sun has no bias and makes no distinction as to whether it will shine or not; still, its reflection appears simultaneously in all vessels filled with water, whether pure or impure, in accordance with the circumstances in each case. Similarly, the enlightened deeds of buddhas (whether physical, verbal, or mental) are without bias or distinction in the slightest, but manifest simultaneously to those to be guided, in accordance with each one’s individual fortune, whether excellent or inferior.
Countless rays of the sun’s light are integrated and converge to perform a single task, such as causing a lotus blossom to open. In a like fashion, the timeless awareness and enlightened activity of all buddhas are integrated and converge to guide each and every ordinary being.
Within the realm of space, which is not created through circumstances, things that are created through circumstances come into being and cease to be uninterruptedly. In a similar way, even though the awakening to perfect buddhahood takes place within incorruptible basic space, enlightened activity takes place when the time is right for anyone to be guided but does not take place if the time is not right. This is the way in which the enlightened deeds of buddhas are forever uninterrupted.
In countless realms throughout the ten directions, and for as long as saṃsāra endures, [4.187.b] some buddhas appear as awakening to manifest enlightenment, some appear as turning the wheel of the dharma, and some appear as passing into nirvāṇa. Thus, benefit for those to be guided is ensured in any way that is appropriate, by means of a myriad array of skillful methods.
Depending on the respective heights of mountains, the rays of the rising sun may reach them in stages. Similarly, for those to be guided whose fortune is most excellent, or inferior, the enlightened activity of buddhahood will affect them to certain degrees, in accord with each individual’s fortune.
Due to ordinary beings’ merely seeing buddhas, their welfare is ensured in five ways that are completely protective, that is, they are protected from harm, from lower states of rebirth, from any lack of skillful methods, from the sufferings of the three realms, and from inferior spiritual approaches.

In essence, the enlightened activity of victorious ones is an uninterrupted array, equal to space in its extent, of whatever activity is necessary to guide beings in any way necessary. Through its threefold miraculous display,[812] countless beings to be guided are brought to the basis for the spiritual path (the approach that brings rebirth in the higher realms of gods and human beings); to the actual path (of accumulation, linkage, and the other paths); and to the consummate result (the fruition states of the three approaches). Therefore, to summarize, it can be subsumed under the two principles of its spontaneous accomplishment and its uninterruptedness. Concerning the former, the Highest Continuum states:
“For whom? By whom? By what means of guiding?
When? and where?”
Since they do not entertain such concepts,
the sages are always spontaneously present.[813]
Concerning the latter principle, the same source states:
Because their certainty concerning their release was for the sake of others,
because they saw the similarity between themselves and ordinary beings,
and because their enlightened deeds are not yet complete,
their deeds are uninterrupted as long as saṃsāra lasts.[814] [4.188.a]

The results of meditating on the two stages of the path of secret mantra are summarized as twofold, more common or sublime; the earlier stage[815] leads primarily to the more common attainments, while the later stage[816] leads primarily to the sublime attainments.
In the Guhyasamāja cycle, these are described as two kinds of attainment: attainments of mantra and the attainment of timeless awareness. The Subsequent Tantra states:
Spiritual attainments such as invisibility
are explained as being “ordinary.”
But the attainment of buddhahood itself is said by the buddhas
to be “the sublime attainment.”[817]
Alternatively, it is explained that the lesser spiritual attainments are those of the four kinds of enlightened activity, the middling those of the eight major siddhis, and the most sublime that of buddhahood. The Illuminating Lamp states:
The purpose is also to be explained:
there are rituals of pacification and other activities,
likewise the eight siddhis,
and buddhahood, moreover, which is the most sublime.[818]
As for the way in which these two kinds of attainments are arrived at through the two stages of practice, the Subsequent Tantra of the Guhyasamāja cycle, for example, states:
Due to this distinction between the more common and the sublime,
it is held that there are two aspects[819] to spiritual practice:
the four vajras (in the more common cases)
and the six branches (in the most sublime case).[820]
In the Kālacakra cycle, it is said that a single attainment comes from following the path of the seven empowerments, while three attainments (that is, karmamudrā, jñānamudrā, and mahāmudrā) come from following the path of the higher empowerments.[821] [4.188.b]
Having followed the path of the seven empowerments, those who have thus gained such states of spiritual attainment as those associated with the sword and pills can, in that very body, pass freely through the realms of gods and human beings, even flying through the air. They are capable of benefiting, and even annihilating, beings by using mantras of awareness. If these siddhas show their forms among human beings, these can actually be seen. They delight buddhas, bodhisattvas, spiritual heroes, and yoginīs,[822] who on the basis of this take these siddhas under their care. The siddhas then follow the path of the higher empowerments, and so gradually awaken to buddhahood. Since these siddhas are masters of awareness through material means, if they are deprived of such objects as their swords or pills, they cannot fly through the air, just as the goddess Manohari could not fly if deprived of the gem on the crown of her head.[823]
Then there are those whose spiritual attainments, such as the enjoyment of space, come from relying on the practice of karmamudrā. They, too, accomplish an enormous purpose for the sake of beings, benefiting or annihilating others through the power of mantras of awareness. Having delighted buddhas, bodhisattvas, ḍākas, and ḍākinīs, these siddhas cultivate the meditative absorption of the stage of completion, and so are gradually brought to buddhahood. If these siddhas, whose accomplishment comes from the practice of karmamudrā, move among human beings, even though they show their forms, they cannot be seen directly by others because they are imbued with the qualities of powerful mastery, such as subtlety and lightness.[824] However, they do act for the sake of beings by emanating numerous forms.
Those who gain states of spiritual attainments associated with form by relying on the practice of jñānamudrā [4.189.a] become equal in status to gods in the realm of form. They do not move among human beings—indeed, their forms are not within the scope of others’ senses. However, on the strength of their actual states of meditative stability, they act for the sake of beings in the realm of desire through their numerous emanations. In his commentary on the Compendium of Abhidharma, the master Jinaputra[825] states that these siddhas rely on the actual mental states of meditative stability without having to pass through the preparatory stages. Eventually these siddhas, too, are gradually brought to buddhahood through the meditative absorption of the stage of completion.
Those of the keenest acumen are been described in the lines, “When mind has been brought under control, subtle energy is also brought under control.” In this way, within the sole context of mahāmudrā one brings the functioning of mind under control and so brings the functioning of what supports it[826] under control. The analogy of a gem versus an ordinary stone illustrates how buddhahood is made fully evident.[827] This is the interpretation of the venerable Rangjung[828] and his followers.

As for these activities, the Vajra Pavilion refers to the four aspects of deity yoga:
Through a process of benefiting, there is pacification.
Vajrasūrya is enrichment.
Vajradharma is called “power.”
It is Vajrasattva who slays.[829]
It also refers to the four underlying attitudes with such lines as:
Pacification with a peaceful attitude…[830]
and the four basic activities described as the four guidelines of the mantra approach, as it were, with such lines as:
At the conclusion, svāhā is pacifying…[831]
In addition, there are secondary ramifications of each activity, in fact an entire vast range of alternatives. In the case of pacification, there are many kinds of pacifying activity, such as addressing illnesses and demonic influences. In the case of enrichment, there are many kinds of enriching activity, which focus on longevity, merit, wealth, and the like. In the case of exercising power, there are many kinds of activity, such as exercising power for controlling rulers or populaces, or for summoning. In the case of forceful intervention, there are many kinds of wrathful activity, such as slaying, banishing, scattering, and paralyzing.
Alternatively, some eight major activities are discussed: pacifying, enriching, exercising power, summoning, slaying, banishing, driving mad, and paralyzing. In the fourth section of the later chapter of the tantra Vajra of Delight,[832] some eight activities are discussed: that is, activities of exercising power, forcefully intervening, destroying the forces of one’s enemies, banishing, slaying, summoning, pacifying, and enriching.
As for the “twelve major activities,” the source tantra of the Cakrasaṃvara cycle states:
Exercising power, summoning, scattering,
slaying, banishing,
baffling, paralyzing,
numbing, and (in a similar fashion) planting the kīla dagger,
rendering mute by robbing the power of speech
(and likewise deafening and blinding),
rendering sterile,
and changing one’s own form:
these are the twelve major activities.[833]
Rendering someone mute and so forth can be considered to be one kind of activity, [4.190.a] that of “impairing the faculties.”[834] Then, even though there is no specific mention of pacifying activity in this listing, it can be added (since it is discussed often in earlier and later parts of the text) to give a total of twelve.
The foregoing is just a sampling. There is a vast range of enlightened activities; the Vajra Ḍāka,[835] for example, speaks of more than a hundred stages of activity.

If those who have gained the final degree of the path of accumulation then apply themselves to the short-term pursuit of this lesser degree of more common spiritual attainments, by engaging in conduct once they have attained the phase of meditative warmth, they can, without difficulty, become masters of awareness through material means, such as attaining the five levels of deeper discernment and the eight siddhis.
As for these eight siddhis, the Request by the Four Goddesses states:
Eight material means are explained as being secondary:
the siddhis of pills and eye medicine,
the siddhis of seeing underground and the sword,
flying through the air, invisibility,
immortality, and curing illness.[836]
Alternatively, the Ocean of Ḍākas lists these as follows:
The sword, eye medicine, pills,
foot ointment, alchemical powers,
magical boots, mercury, seeing underground:
the wise seek to accomplish these siddhis.[837]
Or, as the Vajra Pavilion states:
The accomplishments of eye medicine, of foot ointment,
of the sword, and of seeing underground,
of pills, of the enjoyment of space,
of invisibility, and of alchemical powers.
Those who are masters of awareness, world rulers,
or summoners of young holy women are practitioners who delight me[838]
and gain these vajra states of spiritual attainment.[839] [4.190.b]
The intent underlying this passage from the Vajra Pavilion is as follows: By applying medicine to the eyes, one can see the three worlds;[840] by applying ointment to the feet, one gains fleetness of foot, by brandishing the sword, one can fly through the air; by revealing mineral treasures or vases of wealth hidden underground, one can satisfy the wants of beings; by placing pills in one’s mouth, one can become invisible, unseen by anyone, or transform one’s shape at will, like a yakṣa spirit (the aforementioned power of changing one’s form falls into this category); by smearing a drop of certain materials on one’s forehead, one can become invisible, so that nobody can see one; one’s lifespan rivals that of the sun and moon, one’s body becomes like that of a sixteen-year-old, and one can transform base metals such as iron and copper into gold (these three are termed “alchemical powers,” and so there are references to “alchemical powers of longevity, body, and wealth”). As for summoning young women, this means that by accomplishing practices focusing on yakṣī spirits, one induces them to grant whichever of the eight siddhis one wishes. In this regard, when one considers the practice of the yakṣī spirits to be the general practice for attaining these great siddhis, one arrives at the total of eight by counting the siddhis of pills and invisibility as one, and counting those of alchemical powers as three; but if one counts the practice of the yakṣī spirits as a specific siddhi among the eight, one arrives at the total of eight by counting the siddhis of pills and invisibility as one, counting the alchemical powers of longevity and the body as one, and counting the alchemical power of wealth (that is, the power to turn base metals into gold) as one siddhi on its own.
Those who, on the basis of the foregoing, become masters of awareness, or world rulers, or those who gain the enjoyment of space, are considered among those with the most sublime siddhi.

In the “Chapter on Spiritual Accomplishment” in the concise version of the glorious tantra the Wheel of Time, we find the following:
The sword, the magic power of touch, the most powerful vital force, the nectar-laden fruit, the pills, the magic potion, [4.191.a] eye medicine,
and foot ointment and wooden-soled boots: may you grant me these eight siddhas of the world![841]
And in the “Chapter on Timeless Awareness”:
In places beneath the earth, beyond the base of the central mountain of the universe, the eight great siddhis are truly to be found.
To the east are the sword, the most powerful “taste,” the nectar-laden fruit, the pills, the eye medicine, and the magic potion.
To the south are the glorious articles for fleetness of foot, an inexhaustible trove of treasures on the perimeter of the maṇḍalas.[842]
These passages refer to the eight great siddhis. Let us identify these one by one. Whoever bears the sword of siddhi is capable of feats of movement, such as flying through the air. The magic power of touch derives from a special substance that gives one the ability to transform ordinary rocks, or anything else one touches, into gold and other precious substances. The “most powerful vital force” refers to an alchemical substance that is a product of one’s spiritual attainment and that brings whoever ingests it a lifespan equal to that of the sun and moon and other benefits. The “nectar-laden fruit” is also a reference to alchemical powers deriving from spiritual attainment. The pills allow whoever ingests them to enjoy feats of movement, such as flying through the air. The magic potion is ointment, prepared such that it allows one to become invisible. The eye medicine allows whoever smears it on the eyes to see treasures buried underground. The foot ointment and wooden-soled boots both bring the attainment of fleetness of foot.
An alternative version of these eight siddhis is found in the source tantra of the Cakrasaṃvara cycle:
Seeing underground, moving through space, the sword,
annihilation and benefiting,
pills, eye medicine, treasures,
and fleetness of foot (or alchemical powers).[843]
The foregoing are just a sampling. There are masters of awareness of the five family types, or of ordinary weapons and other insignia; masters of awareness who ride such mounts as swans, garuḍas, or bulls. [4.191.b] There are masters of awareness with wealth, who enjoy, for example, the seven attributes of royalty.[844] In ideal cases, there are those who can reanimate corpses; there are those who can bind gods, demigods, nāgas, yakṣas, rākṣasas, and other beings to their service; as mentioned previously, there are world rulers who can bind the daughter of Brahma[845] to their service. There are masters of awareness of mantra syllables and naming mantras. There are discussions of countless such cases of siddhis that are dependent on something or someone other than the siddha. In brief, however, these are all subsumed within the categories of masters of awareness through material means, masters of awareness in physical bodies, or masters of awareness with wealth.

As for the intermediate degree of the more common siddhis, those who have gained the final degree of the path of accumulation practice karmamudrā, one-pointedly cultivating the experience of the unity of bliss and emptiness, thus attaining the more common phase of meditative warmth, and then engage in conduct. With such attainment, they become masters of awareness in the realm of desire; that is, their physical bodies are of equal status to those of gods in the realm of desire, they can employ myriad mantras of awareness and siddhis, and they gain power over longevity.
This is also referred to as the state of a master of awareness in a physical body, albeit a body endowed with the eight qualities such as subtlety and lightness.[846] In this context, “subtlety of form” means subtlety in the sense that these masters can send forth emanations of anything whatsoever in the inanimate world (such as a tree, or even a forest) and cause these emanations to dissolve. “Lightness” means they can send forth, and cause to dissolve, emanations of myriad forms of animate beings. “True attainment,” or “governance,” means they can send forth and dissolve both the foregoing kinds of emanations. “The ability to move everywhere”[847] [4.192.a] means they can go anywhere at will. “Extreme clarity” means they are worthy of being honored by all bhūta spirits. “Serving as a source of all that is wished for” means they ensure that, as much as is wished for, all that is provided. “Reliability” means that stable joy and satisfaction are ensured since whatever attainment they have allows them to further attain whatever they wish. “Having mastery”[848] means they have the power to annihilate or nurture beings.
Alternatively, subtlety refers to the transformation into a rainbow body, and lightness to the fact that these masters can manipulate at will all the elements of earth, water, fire, air, and space since their bodies are not physically obstructive (by virtue of not being composed of coarser particles of matter). In this alternate explanation, the remaining qualities are as before.
Thus, since these masters are endowed with the foregoing eight qualities of powerful mastery, even if they move among human beings in this lower realm of desire, they cannot be seen by ordinary people; but it is said they benefit beings through their myriad emanations.

The greater degree of more common siddhis is that enjoyed by masters of awareness of the realm of desire. Based on the strength of their miraculous powers, they move from one pure buddha realm to another, receiving teachings from nirmāṇakāyas. They are close to attaining the first bodhisattva level, or else resemble those who dwell on that level.
And there are those who, when engaging in conduct, focus entirely on the unelaborate mode and become what are termed “masters of awareness of the realm of form.” Their bodies are equal in nature to those of any of the gods from the Brahmakāyika realm up to that of Akaniṣṭha.[849] They possess the eight qualities of powerful mastery, but these are far superior to those discussed previously, being those such as extreme subtlety. [4.192.b] The actual bodies of these masters are not found within the realm of desire, but they act for the benefit of beings through their myriad emanations.
Thus, masters of awareness through material means or in physical bodies engage in conduct that is motivated by their intention to attain the more common siddhis. In the short term, this could be a hindrance to their attainment of the most sublime siddhi, so that in this single human lifetime alone they would not attain that most sublime siddhi. But since they also gain power over longevity, they can eventually awaken to buddhahood while still in this very body. It is with this understanding that masters of the past who emphasized the stage of development (especially Śrīghoṣa) made statements such as the following:
Through this very same path of masters of awareness,
one gains the state of a master with power over longevity.
And it is said that one attains buddhahood
through this very same longevity of a master of awareness.[850]
Given that these siddhis are accomplished on the basis of a process followed from the outset, those involved in the tantric approach who practice the stage of development must accomplish them by relying on such methods as mantra repetition, fire rituals, sacred substances, and physical yogic exercises. For those who are involved on a more inner level with the most sublime attainment, however, it is explained that these siddhis are attained simply through meditative stability, without reliance on such aids as substances.
The minor activities such as pacification and enrichment can be attained in fairly short order by one’s relying on deity yoga and practicing mantra repetitions and recitations to the requisite degree. But as for these major siddhis, those involved in the tantric approach begin by carrying out both the more ordinary and the distinctive methods of spiritual practice and engaging in conduct for six months. If, after this time, these siddhis still have not been attained, it is explained that the practitioners once again carry out the aforementioned practice and engage in conduct for six months, repeating this cycle two or three times over, until the siddhis are attained. If even this does not lead to the siddhis being accomplished, they carry out intensely wrathful methods as described in the teachings and thus ensure that they will definitely attain the siddhis.

In general, the term “Khecara” signifies simply one’s body flying through the air,[851] whether due to recognition of awareness through tantric practice, or consumption of the flesh of one reborn seven times as a brahmin,[852] or the circumstances of one’s rebirth due to the power of karma. But the term “Khecara” in conjunction with the siddhis that derive from one’s practice on the stage of development (both the most sublime siddhi and the greater siddhis) is what I am specifically explaining at this point. It can be treated in two ways: as a greater state and lesser states.
In the first place, then, there is the state of Khecara endowed with the eight qualities. These eight are discussed in the Frond of Pith Instructions:
The subtlety of a body composed of extremely subtle particles; the lightness of that body; its pervasiveness throughout the three worlds; the attainment of the qualities of buddhahood; the experiential field of timeless awareness; the gaining of stability in that; the bringing of all beings under one’s influence; and one’s rebirth into a consummate state that ensures all that is wished for. As is said:
These are:
subtlety of form, lightness to the touch,
pervasiveness, true attainment,
extreme clarity, reliability,
endowment with power, and a consummate state ensuring all that is wished for.[853]
The eight qualities of powerful mastery are described as subtlety of form and the other aspects: that is, extreme subtlety, lightness, extreme magnitude, the ability to move everywhere, the state of being worthy due to one’s clarity, the exercise of mastery, and the ability to abide wherever one wishes.
The present eight qualities and the aforementioned eight mundane qualities of powerful mastery are simply called by different names; [4.193.b] they are identical in meaning. As for “subtlety” and “lightness,” for example, the terms and their meaning are the same in both cases. The aforementioned quality of “governance” corresponds to either “pervasiveness” or “magnitude” in this present case because the meaning of all three terms lies in the quality of pervading the three worlds. One should understand that similar correspondences exist in the case of the other qualities.
In actuality, this greater state constitutes the consummate fruition of the stage of development and the full experience of the realization of the stage of completion, so that one trains to further one’s realization on the path within a naturally manifesting realm of complete purity.

The lesser states of Khecara are seventeen associated with the realm of form, six associated with the gods of the realm of desire,
and the indeterminate one associated with the human realm, which can be seen by pure yogic practitioners.
One may arrive there without discarding the physical body, or having discarded it,

Some reach there through meditation; because this involves engaging in meditative stability

There are many versions of the lesser state of Khecara, but if these are summarized into different types, they pertain to the seventeen states of the realm of form, the six classes of gods in the realm of desire, and the indeterminate state of Khecara in the human realm.
Of these, the state of Khecara in the human realm is such that, while one remains in the world of human beings, other ordinary people are unable to see one, although it is possible that a few truly remarkable individuals may be able to see and meet with one.
As for the state of Khecara in the realms of the gods, there are six states of Khecara associated with the six classes of gods in the realm of desire. In whichever of these one is able to experience, one enjoys the respective wealth of that state and a lifespan equal to, or even longer than, the gods in that state. This principle applies in a similar fashion to the realm of form, so that there are sixteen or seventeen further states of Khecara.
In all of the foregoing cases, there are two options, depending on whether one has discarded one’s physical body or not. In cases in which the physical body has not been discarded, moreover, [4.194.a] there are two further cases: those who attain the state of Khecara through the power of their cultivation of the spiritual path, and those who are led to the state of Khecara through the power of yakṣī spirits, siddhas (that is, masters of awareness), or others. The latter case is simply temporary; regardless of what circumstances one experiences (whether higher or lower) or how long these last, this is not a case of “taking a firm stance.”[854]
As for the state of Khecara to which one traverses through the power of meditating on the path of profound practice, whether one has discarded the physical body or not, one’s body is refined into what is, by nature, a body of light, while one’s meditative stability becomes sublime. Therefore, one progresses along the spiritual path, and so this is known as “the state of Khecara in which one takes a firm stance.”

That is to say, the path that brings about spiritual accomplishment consists of the processes of developing one’s merit, upholding discipline, and deepening one’s experience of timeless awareness. All three of these processes are imbued with incorruptible timeless awareness, and accomplished without bias, circumscribed boundary, or limitation. This leads to the fruition of buddhahood itself; this is the fruition aspect of tantra.
This aspect, moreover, can be considered in both an actual and a purely nominal sense. The actuality is referred to as the consummate, or most sublime, spiritual attainment, that of mahāmudrā. This term is interpreted as follows:
In the first moment one attains utterly unchanging bliss and experiences the form endowed with the potential for all manifestations[855] that one integrates with this bliss); whatever one experiences undergoes no fluctuation. Rather, due to what has always been the very essence of being, just as it is, [4.194.b] this state continues as such constantly, for as long as space itself endures. Furthermore, one does not ever fall outside that context. By virtue of the foregoing, the term “seal” ( mudrā) is used. The term “supreme” ( mahā) is used because this is endowed with three supreme factors: the elimination of flaws, realization, and ordinary mind. Hence, the term “mahāmudrā.”
As for the term “fruition aspect,” here this signifies that those who strive for the consummate result, the most sublime of all sublime states, find that this alone constitutes the perfection of any and all of their intentions. The qualifying phrase “of tantra” is used because this fruition is forever uninterrupted.
Thus, we have the expression “the fruition aspect of tantra, mahāmudrā.”

One might ask what the fruition aspect of tantra (that is, mahāmudrā, the most sublime spiritual attainment) constitutes in essence. Once the practice of vajra yoga[857] has been carried out to its conclusion,
(1) the “breath” (that is to say, the movement of the 21,600 subtle energies in the body) ceases;
(2) the masculine energy (that is, the downward movement of the lunar energy[858]) is arrested and becomes stabilized at the very crown of the head; and
(3) the feminine energy (that is, the upward movement of the solar energy[859]) is arrested and becomes stabilized in the glans penis.[860]
At that point, these energies then dissolve into, and merge as one with, what is figuratively termed the “heart center”—that is, timeless awareness, or mind (which is to say, ordinary consciousness) that is utterly lucid by its very nature. This gives rise to:
(1) “the moon free of obscuration,” that is, bindu[861] as the vajra of enlightened form;
(2) “the sun free of obscuration” (poetically termed “the aspirate”[862]), that is, the feminine rajas energy as the vajra of enlightened speech; and
(3) “Rāhu free of obscuration,” that is, mind as the vajra of enlightened mind.
The indivisibility of these three vajras is Vajrasattva: Vaṃ is the syllable of supreme bliss (and the figurative term for the indestructible bindu); E is the syllable of emptiness endowed with the most sublime of all attributes of cessation,[863] within which the bliss abides such that there is an unchanging state of “equal taste.”[864] Due to the attributes through which this expresses itself (that is, the properties of enlightened form [4.195.a] and the unchanging bliss of enlightened mind), it is said to be “endowed with the most sublime of all attributes.” Given the indivisibility of these attributes, there is primordial unity, which is the timeless awareness of buddhahood, fully evident. This has two dimensions: from one’s own perspective, the ultimate kāya of enlightened mind; and from the perspective of others, the more relative kāya of enlightened form. The source tantra of the Kālacakra cycle states:
Within the syllable E, the realm of space,
is found the bliss of all buddhas.
As for the syllable Vaṃ, Vajrasattva,
through the yogas of enlightened form, speech, and mind,
Bindu, the lunar, masculine rasa energy, is enlightened form;
the “delineator,”[865] the solar, feminine rajas energy, is enlightened speech;
the syllable A is the “bringer of darkness,”[866] extolled as enlightened mind.
These dwell completely within the realm of the space of E.
Through the yogas of enlightened form, speech, and mind,
within the maṇḍala of enlightened form, speech, and mind,
through the presence of enlightened form, speech, and mind,
the three realms abide as the very embodiment of purity.[867]
This is also discussed at length in the Vajra Garland, the explanatory tantra of the Guhyasamāja cycle.

An enumeration of synonymous terms for this fruition aspect of tantra (that is, mahāmudrā, the most sublime spiritual attainment, the embodiment of the timeless awareness of the tathāgatas) is given in the first synoptic section of Stainless Light, which speaks of some twenty primary terms:
Nonduality, nonvacillation, indivisibility,
desire, utter unchangeability, supreme passion,
not tangible, not nontangible,
timeless awareness, courageous mind, total positivity,
absence of afflictive states, supreme afflictive states,
innateness, glory, awakened mind, bearer of bindu,
Glorious Wheel of Time, vajra,
yoga that is the very epitome of skillful means and sublime intelligence.[868]
In addition, in a number of tantras (such as those of Vajradhara, Kālacakra, Hevajra, Cakrasaṃvara, [4.195.b] and Guhyasamāja), the deities, maṇḍalas, mantras, mudrās, states of meditative absorption, timeless awareness, and other topics discussed constitute, in their ultimate sense, many variant expressions of this fruition aspect.[869] And Reciting the Names of Mañjuśrī speaks of this kāya of primordial unity as being describable by, for example, ten thousand synonymous terms.

It can be determined that the fruition aspect of tantra is twofold: the actual fruition and the nominal results. The actual fruition is that of supreme Vajradhara, the powerful state of mastery over all family types. The nominal results are those of the illusory body and of an ordinary being who has realized primordial unity. The latter case is the flawed embodiment of one who is still on the path of training, while the former is the flawless embodiment of timeless awareness of one who has gained the path of no more training. The illusory body is also termed that of “a master of awareness” and “rainbow body”; it constitutes a complete transcendence of the three realms.

Given that the causes that bring about the state of primordial unity that involves no more training are the developmental aspects contributing to manifest enlightenment, the working basis for these causes is the impure illusory body.
That is to say, the ground for spiritual accomplishment is the genuine body that constitutes the unity of subtle energy and mind. What ensures the accomplishment is the isolation of mind,[870] which is to say, the consummate anticipatory experience of utter lucidity.[871] This ensures that the three avenues of consciousness are imbued with bliss and stabilized, which leads to the special manifestation in the mind of the form of the deity. Even the subtle energy that supports the bliss expresses itself in the form of the deity and the two merge.[872] However, since the afflictive obscurations have not yet been eliminated, this basis is termed “the impure illusory body.”

In essence, this fruition aspect of tantra constitutes the timeless awareness that epitomizes the path of seeing (in which something new is seen that was not seen previously) and in which the potentials for the eighty overt patterns of thought have been eliminated; that is to say, timeless awareness in which dualistic perceptions have ceased. In conjunction with this awareness is everything that pertains to the anticipatory experience of utter lucidity, in which any and all of the more overt perceptions based on dualistic consciousness have subsided.

In this method of application, when one is engaging in the developmental aspects contributing to manifest enlightenment, while the moon is shining on the previous evening, one meditates primarily on the timeless awareness of the phase of “manifestation.” During the next day, one meditates on the phase of “increase.” Once the sun has set, one meditates on the phase of “attainment.” Then, with the coming of daybreak, manifest enlightenment becomes fully evident in the ultimate experience of utter lucidity.[873] These particular time frames in the external world are analogous to the inner states of meditative absorption one undergoes; hence they are termed “the external aspects contributing to manifest enlightenment.”

Taking the previous discussion of particular time frames into account, when twilight falls, one begins by performing a gaṇacakra feast and other rituals, and then joins one’s consort in supplicating one’s spiritual master. The master confers the empowerment into sublime intelligence and timeless awareness, and then teaches the participants the instructions that introduce one to the stages for attaining manifest enlightenment through the anticipatory phase of timeless awareness.[874] This leads to the fourth stage of empowerment: by familiarizing oneself with the ongoing experience of that phase, at dawn the path of seeing (which constitutes manifest enlightenment) becomes fully evident.[875] This process is described in both the father and mother classes of the Anuttarayoga tantras. [4.196.b]
If we consider the explanations given by the mahāsiddhas who were learned in the mother tantras, the process is as follows: When the empowerment is conferred, one engages in union with one’s consort (who embodies sublime intelligence). From the melting of the white energy[876] comes consummate insight into supremely blissful emptiness; this insight constitutes the aspect of “manifest enlightenment through the lunar energy.”[877] When the bindu[878] is drawn upward together with the red energy[879] of the consort (the woman who embodies sublime intelligence), it is the support for the consummate experience of the indivisibility of superlative bliss and emptiness; this constitutes the aspect of “manifest enlightenment through the solar energy.” When the energies are absorbed into the crown of one’s head, the experience of the unity of bliss and emptiness suffuses one’s entire form,[880] leading to the consummate knowledge that the distortions affecting one’s being are primordially empty; this constitutes the aspect of “manifest enlightenment through the symbolic emblem.”[881] From this comes the unifying and consummate insight into all phenomena, that is, the inseparability of objects and the subjective agents perceiving these; this constitutes the aspect of “manifest enlightenment through emptiness.” It is due to this that enlightened mind constitutes dharmakāya, enlightened form constitutes sambhogakāya, and so forth—the aspect of “manifest enlightenment through the totality of the kāyas.”
If we correlate these causal aspects contributing to manifest enlightenment with the situation of someone’s attaining the path of seeing, there is a context in which one’s completely pure insight has not yet reached a consummate degree, and there is the accomplishment of the experience of primordial unity that still involves training (which is equivalent to the attainment of the two kāyas[882]). In the latter case, the “internal aspects contributing to manifest enlightenment” are so termed because they have no relation to specific time frames in the external world but are related to the internal stages of experiencing the unity of bliss and emptiness.
As for “bodhicitta”[883] (in the sense of the white and red bindu) in the context of the path of seeing, these are, for the most part, products of the physical elements; when one awakens to buddhahood, however, the distinction lies in the fact that, at that point, these energies constitute expressions of the natural radiance of timeless awareness.
The previous interpretation[884] concerns a process of transformation taking place in one’s ongoing experience. The latter interpretation, although not clearly laid out in the Guhyasamāja cycle,[885] is the tradition followed in the mother tantras. In the context of one’s awakening to buddhahood, even an ordinary person engaged in the conduct of the immediate cause[886] awakens to buddhahood by relying on such conduct.
As well, a human guru may not be present in physical form; nevertheless, in the context of these aspects contributing to manifest enlightenment, it is essential that the process rely on one’s receiving empowerment, and so it can be buddhas who confer that empowerment.[887]

In the Anuttarayoga tantras, it is said that even though one may have traversed the ten bodhisattva levels of the transcendent perfections, up to the point at which one is in one’s final rebirth, still one must definitely rely on this tantric path of the five aspects contributing to manifest enlightenment.
That is to say, once one has traversed the path of the transcendent perfections up to the tenth level, buddhas confer on one all empowerments into all maṇḍalas simultaneously. One gives rise, also simultaneously, to states of realization, from those of the stage of development to those of the illusory body. Thereupon, with the conferral of the empowerment into sublime intelligence and timeless awareness, the state of utter lucidity becomes fully evident to one. And within that very state, the first four developmental aspects contributing to manifest enlightenment constitute timeless awareness “on the very threshold of enlightenment.”[888] Upon one’s moving beyond that, the kāya of primordial unity is attained; this constitutes the fifth aspect contributing to manifest enlightenment, the attainment of buddhahood.
In the Lamp That Integrates Conduct,[889] it is explained that there are some ninety-six synonymous terms for this process of attaining manifest enlightenment within the state of utter lucidity; it constitutes the direct cause for the experience of primordial unity.

If we summarize the implications of the foregoing discussion of these causal factors: Once the impure illusory body has been attained, one relies on any of three kinds of conduct.[890] Through either of two alternatives in meditative stability (“instantaneous collapse” or “gradual dissolution”[891]), one is brought to the indelible experience that all phenomena are empty. By cultivating this experience of utter lucidity over and over, one applies the two methods of the aspects contributing to manifest enlightenment (explained previously) in their entirety. Once this awakens one to the experience of the path of seeing, one comes to perceive utter lucidity in its ultimate sense.

Once one has experienced utter lucidity in the ultimate sense, the kāya that still involves dualistic perception has truly been purified as empty. Within that context, as soon as one moves out of that state, the successive steps of subtle experience unfold in the reverse order from usual (that is, attainment, followed by increase, then manifestation). At the conclusion of these steps, the kāya of nondual timeless awareness is achieved, which constitutes primordial unity as experienced on the path that still involves training. One must still rely on conduct, causing one’s mind to move in and out of the utterly lucid experience that is enlightened mind over and over, so that there is still some sense of a distinction between meditative equipoise and postmeditation. This is nevertheless termed “primordial unity,” for under all circumstances one is never separate from enlightened mind (that is, timeless awareness as the unity of bliss and emptiness) and enlightened form is uninterrupted; alternatively, it is so termed because (given that the significance of “primordial unity” is one of nonduality) the more overt thoughts patterns based on dualistic perception have ceased.
As causal factors, during the path of seeing, subjective experiences arise in a methodical progression, from that of a mirage (the indication that the earth element has dissolved into that of water) up to that of the nonduality of emptiness and lucidity, which is comparable to seeing dawn breaking in a cloudless sky (the indication that the phase of attainment has dissolved into the state of utter lucidity). When one moves out of that state, these experiences happen in the reverse order; one attains the state of primordial unity. There are, therefore, these experiences of moving in and out of the state of utter lucidity.
When the phase of complete attainment associated with the anticipatory state of utter lucidity takes place for the fourth time, there occurs a visionary state like that of one perceiving a limpid sky. But once the state of utter lucidity in the ultimate sense has been attained, thereafter there can be no issue of clarity versus obscurity, no vacillation or change; so other than some metaphor for clarity and emptiness being used to indicate this freedom from elaboration, the state is not being specifically equated to some visionary experience of seeing space. [4.198.a] This is due to the fact that the unceasing perspective of timeless awareness becomes, in fact, limitless in extent.
In the final phase of the seventh bodhisattva level, one enters into the state of utter lucidity, which constitutes the eight level. Thenceforth it is impossible for one to move out of the state of utter lucidity.

The Five Stages speaks of these twenty-three aspects of primordial unity, while the Lamp That Integrates Conduct speaks of more than seventy;[892] the implication is that while there is but one timeless awareness associated with the developmental states of utter lucidity, all of these aspects are complete as its characteristics.
Since these characteristics are enumerations of the outstanding features, they are the characteristics of the state of utter lucidity in general, for they are complete on the path involving training, to say nothing of being so in the timeless awareness that requires no more training.
In this regard:
(1) There is the primordial unity of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, that is, the realization that saṃsāra is not something to be rejected and nirvāṇa something to be accepted.
(2) There is the primordial unity of deeply ingrained afflictive states and complete enlightenment, that is, the understanding that the nature of the phenomena that pertain to both deeply ingrained afflictive states and complete enlightenment is the same, that of the unity of bliss and emptiness.
(3) There is the primordial unity of the tangible and intangible, that is, the realization that concepts concerning both what is tangible (such as visible forms and sounds) and what is intangible (such as space) are identical in being primordially empty.
(4) There is the primordial unity in the nonduality of perceived object and the perceiving subject, that is, the cessation of dualistic perceptions in meditative equipoise, due to the realization of the state of equalness in which both perceived objects and perceiving subject are empty. [4.198.b]
(5) There is the primordial unity in the nonduality of affirmation and denial, that is, the elimination of all fixation on naïvely affirming or denying the existence of things, whether these fixations are instinctive feelings or conceptual elaborations.
(6) There is the primordial unity of compassion and emptiness, that is, experiencing all compassion as emptiness and all emptiness as compassion.
(7) There is the primordial unity of the masculine principle of skillful means and the feminine principle of sublime intelligence, that is, abiding in the supreme bliss of the union of masculine and feminine deities.
(8) There is the primordial unity of what entails residual traces and what does not, that is, since the vajrakāya is achieved, one is free of birth and death, and so there is no question of there being either some residual trace of the mind-body aggregates or none.
(9) There is the primordial unity of the two aspects of the lack of identity, that is, due to the insight that the actual nature of phenomena is such that everything is inseparable as the natural and primordial unity of manifestation and emptiness, one knows that the lack of identity in phenomena and in the individual personality are not cases of things that can be established to have separate status.
(10) There is the primordial unity of illusory body and utter lucidity: Initially, one attains the illusory body (the stage of “consecrating one’s own body”[893]). Then one carries out the stages of practice focusing on utter lucidity, until one experiences awareness in which tangible impressions are absent. One thus attains a state in which these two merge in having an identical essence.
There is the primordial unity of the inseparability of (11) instantaneous collapse and (12) gradual dissolution. The process of instantaneous collapse is one of allowing one’s very being to become, in essence, a state of supreme bliss; that of gradual dissolution is one of allowing all that one perceives to become that state of supreme bliss, whereupon one’s sense of self dissolves within that. Through these methods, there comes the realization that there is no real distinction to be made concerning the nature of the three phases of entering into the state of emptiness, abiding in that, and moving out of it; alternatively, the experiences of enlightened form and the unity of bliss and emptiness arise simultaneously.
(There are twenty-two aspects of primordial unity when the foregoing two methods are counted as one aspect; if they are counted separately, the enumeration is of twenty-three aspects.)
(13) There is the primordial unity of the two levels of truth, which is the insight into the equalness, in essence, of the two levels of truth.
(14) There is the primordial unity of focus, that is, there is focus both on suchness and on things in all their multiplicity; one enters into timeless awareness that perceives these two perspectives simultaneously.
(15) There is the primordial unity of sleep and waking consciousness, which is due to the fact that one’s sleep constitutes the state of utter lucidity (other more ordinary states of sleep having been eliminated), there is no distinction to be made between one’s being asleep or not, [4.199.a] in terms of one’s spiritual development, or activities to benefit others, or ways of engaging in states of timeless awareness.
(16) There is the primordial unity of meditative equipoise and postmeditation, in that whether one is resting in equipoise or not makes no difference, in terms of the range of one’s experience of timeless awareness being greater or less, or of one’s experience of the unity of bliss and emptiness.
(17) There is the primordial unity of insight into the inseparability of what is substantial and nonsubstantial, which is the insight that all things, whether substantial or not, lack any independent nature of their own.
(Again, there exists a treatment of twenty-one aspects of primordial unity when the foregoing aspect and that of the tangible and intangible discussed previously are counted as one aspect.[894])
(18) There is the primordial unity of mindfulness and its absence; since one is free of any lack of mindfulness or forgetfulness, there is no distinction to be made in one’s experience of timeless awareness, regardless of whether one is making effort to maintain such awareness or not.
(19) There is the primordial unity of bliss and emptiness, which is the path that incorporates both desire and the absence of desire; this is the path of resting continually in the innate experience of supreme bliss, free of ordinary desire and attachment (since there is no longer any fixation), yet free of being the mere absence of desire (since one is not separate from the accomplishment of supreme bliss).
(20) There is the primordial unity of the object and agent of action, that is, no conceptualization of the three factors of object, agent, and action.[895]
(21) There is the primordial unity of development and completion, for regardless what methods one employs in meditation (the four branches of approach and approach,[896] for example), one does not waver from the unity of bliss and emptiness but instead experiences the form of the deity arising solely within nonconceptual awareness.[897]
(22) There is the primordial unity of purity and impurity, which entails insight into the distinctions between pure and impure embodiments of enlightenment,[898] due to the perception that all obscurations have been forever exhausted.
(23) There is the primordial unity of what has form and what is formless; once one perceives that all that has form and all that does not is mind, there is the further insight that none of this has any independent nature of its own.

When the kāya of nondual timeless awareness is attained, there are further qualities gained at that point. [4.199.b] One gains ten powers, including those over longevity and material objects, and four avenues of total recall. The words “and so forth” in the verse imply that one also gains, for example, the eight extremely profound and flawless modes in the process of complete liberation and the four states of authentic discernment. Thus, the words “in addition” are not meant to indicate any difference between these qualities and the ones discussed previously.
As for the four avenues of total recall:
(1) total recall through patient acceptance depends on individual syllables for mental focus, such as the syllable A; the realization that the syllable is unborn acts as a catalyst, so that one comes to gain a patient acceptance of the fact that all phenomena are unborn;
(2) total recall through mantra involves attaining the power for one’s words to become true, and the capability to create new mantras;
(3) total recall through words is the capability to recall all the words one has ever heard, regardless of how many, without forgetting any of them; and
(4) total recall through meaning is the recollection of the meanings of all those words, just as was intended, without forgetting any of them.

If we now summarize everything concerned with the fruition of primordial unity, it is the indivisibility of the kāyas and timeless awareness, that is, the stage of completion in which all that has been discussed previously is found to be identical in essence, from the standpoint of both what is manifest and its emptiness. This is termed “primordial unity as the consummation of all stages of completion.” Without straying from the utterly lucid basic space of the unity of bliss and emptiness, the rūpakāyas, endowed with seven attributes of integration,[900] are uninterrupted in their manifestation, arising without bias or distinction.
Practitioners in whom such qualities of primordial unity are present are those maintaining the experience of primordial unity that still involves training. According to the intent of the Five Stages, when these practitioners engage in spiritual deportment to promote awareness of primordial unity, their qualities develop more and more, and they come into contact with the state of primordial unity that involves no more training.

Once that is attained, in reliance on the deathless kāya of timeless awareness,

Once one has attained the state of primordial unity that still involves training, it is no longer possible for death to occur, and on the basis of that deathless kāya of timeless awareness, one will definitely awaken to buddhahood. There are, however, a number of variations to this delineation, due to there being progressive stages of realization.
Suppose one had attained the authentic illusory body but was not able to engage in any of the three modes of conduct. Death would occur, but rather than that event of death entailing the encounter with the ultimate reality of utter lucidity and the ensuing intermediate state after death, instead the kāya of primordial unity would be achieved. This could be described by the conventional expression “attaining buddhahood in the afterdeath state,” although this would not, of course, be dependent on the usual basis that is specific to the process of becoming in the afterdeath state.[901]
The Lamp That Integrates Conduct uses the idiom “beholding the truth”[902] to connote the attaining of the consummate anticipatory state of utter lucidity, when it states, for example, that although one has beheld the truth, one may be attached to the residual traces of one’s karma.[903]
Generally speaking, even though śrāvakas directly “behold the truth,” they nevertheless experience the process of dying as the consequence of karma and afflictive states. In this Mahāyāna context, however, this does not take place.
We do find passages in Mahāyāna sūtras, though, stating that, for example, countless eons are required for “beholding the truth.” But while the situation is analogous to that of śrāvakas (that is, from the standpoint of one’s simply beholding the actual nature of phenomena, accomplishment comes about immediately), such statements in the sūtras take into account the benefit for others that ensues. The understanding is that one must develop, each and every moment, the capability to attain countless distinctive qualities consequent to this beholding of the truth, and so a long time must be spent in twofold development on a vast scale. Even with respect to the way in which truth is beheld, the difference is like that between the water contained in a hoof print and that contained in the vast ocean.[904] The difference—that what takes such time in that context[905] is achieved in a very short time in this one[906]—can be accounted for by the skill in means involved in the latter case. [4.200.b]
Given the foregoing, once one has attained the state of primordial unity that still involves training, one has beheld the truth, which means that one will attain nirvāṇa during the intermediate state after death. Once one has attained the state of utter lucidity in the ultimate sense, that more direct beholding of the truth means that one will definitely attain nirvāṇa in this lifetime.
Once one has practiced the stage of development to a consummate degree, with the arousal simply of the realization associated with the subtle experiences of manifestation and increase, one’s progress is still delayed by a single lifetime (which is to say, one will definitely awaken to buddhahood in the next lifetime).

The vajrakāya, the illusory body that is consequent on the consummate anticipatory state of utter lucidity, is the form of a deity that is formed simply of the unity of subtle energy and mind. The following are the analogies that illustrate it, according to the relevant passage in the Compendium concerning the Glorious Vajra of Timeless Awareness:[907]
(1) It is comparable to an illusionist’s trick; while it cannot be found to exist with some finite essence, due to causes and conditions, it nonetheless manifests as though it did.
(2) It is comparable to the reflection of the moon in water, in that its presence can extend anywhere.[908]
(3) It is comparable to a hallucination (or a shadow), in that it constitutes the projection of a form in the shape of a body,[909] even though it is devoid of flesh and bone.
(4) It is comparable to a mirage, in that it can cause many emanations to proliferate or diminish in number.
(5) It is comparable to a dream image, in that it is formed from the simple unity of subtle energy and mind.
(6) It is comparable to an echo, in that it is identical in its continuity to the physical body (which is the natural consequence of karma), yet appears as though separate from it.
(7) It is comparable to a city of the gandharvas,[910] in that it manifests as a supporting structure with a living component supported therein.
(8) It is comparable to an optical illusion, in that in being one, it can present itself as many.[911]
(9) It is comparable to a rainbow, in that it is formed from the subtle vital essence of the five elements colors, or that its colors are clear and distinct.
(10) It is comparable to lightning, in that just as a flash of lightning, which can illuminate an entire realm, shines forth from among the clouds, this body’s radiance shines forth through the corporeal body.
(11) It is comparable to bubbles forming on water, in that it develops as something that occurs naturally and suddenly, without premeditation, within the context of emptiness. [4.201.a]
(12) It is comparable to a reflection in a mirror, in that the limbs and parts are simultaneously complete.
Each of these analogies that illustrate the vajrakāya highlights a particular aspect of its characteristics, and so these twelve characteristics are complete in it.

One might ask, “What constitutes the difference between the state of a master of awareness and the kāya of timeless awareness?” As long as the gestalt of the mind-body aggregates remains unimpaired, there is simply “the kāya of timeless awareness.” When this is impaired (which is to say, when the continuity of the aggregates that are the natural consequences of karma has been interrupted) due to karma or meditative absorption, there is what is termed the “the kāya of timeless awareness of a master of awareness.”
The state of a master of awareness, moreover, is one of constantly maintaining meditative absorption; of being endowed with the five levels of deeper discernment; of engaging in conduct for the sake of beings in myriad realms; of not being subject to ordinary desires and fixations; of enjoying supreme bliss with respect to a limitless range of desirables; of transcending the usual limits of longevity (which is to say, of being immortal); and of having an embodiment that is a mental projection, being formed simply from the unity of subtle energy and mind. Thus, this state is explained as being endowed with seven distinctive qualities.

The second explanation, that of the state of primordial unity that involves no more training, has seven parts: the working basis on which it is achieved; the occasion on which (and the way in which) it is achieved; what primordial unity that involves no more training[912] constitutes in essence; what characterizes it; the auxiliary attributes of what it is in essence; its distinctive attributes; and brief comments on the qualities and activity it entails.

Immediately in the wake of the first bodhisattva level, the kāya of nondual timeless awareness is achieved. What pertained to one’s ordinary way of being, to the physical body and subtle channels, to the speech and subtle energy, and to the mind and its concepts, has already ceased. Therefore, this kāya of timeless awareness [4.201.b] is further edified, leading to the body of nondual timeless awareness that is in every respect parallel to sambhogakāya; this is the working basis for awakening to buddhahood, which is to say, for primordial unity that involves no more training becoming fully evident. However, this does not mean that one has not attained buddhahood in a single lifetime and in a single rebirth, although the impure mind-body aggregates have not been discarded but have only dissipated into basic space.[913]

As for the occasion, once both the external and internal aspects contributing to manifest enlightenment (as these were previously explained) have been finalized, to the accompaniment of a limitless array of miraculous displays and offerings and a magnificent abundance of omens, one attains the state of what the mother tantras term “a spiritual being of the consort of awareness”; that is to say, one gains the state of mahāmudrā, the most sublime spiritual attainment.
There is a particular way of explaining this found in the relevant chapter of the glorious tantra the Wheel of Time:
When the moon consumes the form of the sun, never is there either day or night in the sky;
that is the period of time. Yogic practitioners dwell constantly in the state of nectar in the center of the body.
Just as the moon rides in the sky with all its phases at an end, of equal taste with the sun,
so when life force and downward movement come to an end, they cease on the occasion of spiritual attainment clearly taking place within the body.[914]
The meaning of this passage is as follows: Externally, when “the moon” (that which consumes the nighttime) ceases, and there is “the form of the sun” (which is to say, the point before the actual onset of the day), there is neither day nor night in the sky; that period of time, at the break of dawn, is the occasion upon which one awakens to buddhahood. Internally, in the center of the body, yogic practitioners experience all the phases of the white energy of passion coming to an end, before the onset of the dark energy of the absence of passion, [4.202.a] and so awaken to buddhahood on the occasion that they dwell constantly in the sixteenth degree of the state of that lunar nectar.
To explore this analogy, the text is stating that, at the point where the phases of both light and dark have come to an end (the “dark of the moon,” before the onset of the first day of the lunar month), the moon is nevertheless present in the sky but “of equal taste” with the sun. In a parallel manner, once the upper, solar life force energy and the lower, downward moving lunar energy have become of equal taste and so have ceased to function, at that point (the sixteenth degree on the external and internal levels) one awakens to buddhahood.
The same source also discusses in detail the way in which this awakening comes about, and many parallel explanations are found in other tantras. For example, in the tenth section of the Well-Sealed Locket we read the following:
Next, for anyone who attains the state of a spiritual being of the consort of awareness, there occurs a magnificent display like the following:
The earth itself is delighted, gladdened, overjoyed, and quakes in six ways, causing a sound like overpowering music to resound throughout the realms of the māras. In the ten directions, shooting stars fall like the fire at the end of time, there is the roar of great oceans churning, meteorites fall everywhere, and at the same time the radiance of the fire of timeless awareness blazes, like the shape of the fire at the end of time. All the three realms appear within the depths of the consort’s birth canal.
Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Varuṇa, Indra, Rudra, Agni, Balabhadra, Sūrya, Candra, along with any number of yakṣa spirits, siddhas, gandharvas, kinnaras, mahoragas, sublime gods, masters of awareness, water-born spirits, and others, and in addition the gods of the Trayastriṃśa heaven[915] approach and are truly delighted, making offerings of flowers. Vīṇās, flutes, [4.202.b] kettledrums,[916] conch shells, trumpets, bells, tambours, and clay drums rest in space, constantly making offerings of music.
Daughters of the gods and of the rulers among masters of awareness all dance and play many kinds of cymbals. Kinnaras and yakṣas sing songs and dance. Taking joy in the one they make offerings to, they constantly bring delight with their shouts of, “Victorious one! Victorious one!” The gods dwelling in the heavens extol to the utmost the excellence of the one who is attaining this state. He or she is honored by the most excellent gods dwelling in the Tuṣita heaven, as well as by children of the gods, masters of awareness, and even the gods of the pinnacle heaven of Akaniṣṭha, who all come and respectfully pay homage, making offerings of myriad kinds of flowers, of rains of myriad fragrances, and of myriad kinds of incense.
What more extensive explanation needs to be given to you? The offerings made are the offerings that are produced throughout the three realms by the merit of the one gaining such a state of accomplishment.[917]
There are many more descriptions such as this.

According to this tradition, both the kāyas and timeless awareness are, in essence, pervasive and constant. Both attributes are such that they apply equally to all phenomena, with no constraint of proximity or distance. There is pervasiveness with respect to all things because there is no arbitrary distinction such as, “It is valid in this context, but not in this one.” And there is constancy because it is absolutely impossible for this essence to change into something of a different “kind” or to become interrupted.
The present discussions of the kāyas and timeless awareness as distinct aspects that are in essence identical, and of the kāya of timeless awareness endowed with seven attributes, are interpretations from the extraordinary point of view. There are some who hold that mere emptiness is pervasive and constant but not that the kāyas are pervasive and constant, [2.203.a] while others explain that the meaning of “pervasive” is one of emanations occurring whenever necessary. Both interpretations would seem to be claims that sambhogakāya is some subtle body formed from the ordinary elements, but an ongoing and constant presence is absolutely impossible for the elements and whatever is formed from them. There may indeed be some circumstances under which what is merely characterized as a total negation can be defined to be an aspect of dharmakāya; but it does not define the kāya of timeless awareness endowed with seven attributes (which is defined as being pervasive and constant) because seven attributes cannot be enumerated in what is a total negation. Therefore, those who follow these two interpretations may have heard the terms “pervasive” and “constant,” but they have not understood what they mean.

As for what characterizes it, it is the supreme state of primordial unity, embodying the greatest degree of elimination and realization.
That is to say, supreme elimination constitutes the insight that all limitless obscurations, along with the habitual patterns reinforcing them, are such that they have always, primordially, been nonfunctional. The sūtra the Discourse Requested by Dhāraṇīśvararāja states:
Divestment is not just the resolution of the ordinary rational mind;
there is primordial resolution, and therefore it is termed “resolution.”[918]
As for supreme realization, this constitutes unpremeditated knowledge of all phenomena (for example, of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, or of the ground and the path) comparable, for example, to the visions of a psychic performing a divination.

These are also listed by the great master Vagīśvarakīrti as follows:
Enjoyment of the richness of being, integration, supreme bliss, absence of independent nature,
being replete with compassion, continuity, and absence of cessation.[919]
The first of these seven attributes is enjoyment of the richness of being, which constitutes the complete range of major and minor marks of perfect form in their entirety. The second aspect is integration, which refers to union in equalness with the consort of pure awareness, the kāya’s own natural manifestation. The third aspect is supreme bliss, which is the nature of being—that of abiding in what is, in essence, an innate state of bliss. The fourth aspect is the absence of any independent nature, which is to say the empty quality of being free of all elaboration. The fifth aspect is that of being constantly endowed with nonreferential[920] compassion with respect to beings. The sixth aspect is continuity, the fact that both the kāyas and timeless awareness constitute an ongoing and constant presence. The seventh aspect is the absence of cessation, which is to say, the fact that enlightened mind does not become immersed in a state of cessation devoid of perception, nor is there any cessation due to the continuity of the rūpakāya being interrupted for a time.
In the context of an empowerment, the timeless awareness that informs the empowerment process is endowed with these seven attributes. In the context of the spiritual path, through practicing the stages of both development and completion, one becomes familiar with such awareness. And the kāyas of buddhahood one attains, moreover, are endowed with these seven attributes. These are general tenets in the intent underlying all the tantric source texts, and in particular they are emphasized by the great master, the venerable Jñāna, and his followers.[921]

These eight qualities, then, are due to the purity of the six elements, the “sun,” and the “moon.” With the purity of the element of earth in its natural condition, one’s spiritual strengths become limitless. With the purity of the element of water, one is never again subject to such flaws as illness. With the purity of the element of fire, all buddha realms are permeated with light. With the purity of the element of air, miraculous powers allow one to move with the swiftness of thought. With the purity of the element of space, one can go anywhere. [4.204.a] With the purity of the “sun” (that is, the red energy), one can display myriad emanations. With the purity of the “moon” (that is, the masculine energy), the continuum of enlightened mind is suffused with supreme bliss. And with the purity of the element of consciousness, at all times one does not stray from timeless awareness as the unity of bliss and emptiness, but engages in that awareness throughout the three times without attachment or hindrance.
The foregoing are qualities that pertain to primordial unity. There are other things that are discussed as being positive qualities, for example, gaining the strength of Nārāyaṇa,[922] having a blissful luster, having a magnificent and resplendent radiance, being unharmed by such dangers as abysses, having the ability to become invisible, being able to manifest any number of emanations, casting no shadow,[923] and gaining any of the five levels of deeper discernment. However, these are considered to be qualities that pertain to the more common siddhis.

The Oral Transmission of Mañjuśrī states:
And so, throughout the limitless cycle of saṃsāra,
there is constancy, absence of torment,
soothing calm, oneness,
bliss, immaculacy,
joy, and inspiration:
these are the eight supremely blissful experiential qualities.[924]
As this passage indicates:
(1) there is constancy because the state of primordial unity abides for as long as saṃsāra endures;
(2) there is absence of torment because it is unsullied by a conceptualization process focusing on, for example, perceived objects;
(3) there is soothing calm because primordial unity that involves no more training has none of the burning torment of cognitive obscuration, and even primordial unity that still involves training is such that overt dualistic perceptions have ceased;
(4) there is oneness because the two levels of truth are experienced as inseparable, and conditioned existence and the peace of nirvāṇa as an equalness;
(5) there is bliss because there is none of the changeability of ordinary mind;
(6) there is immaculacy because there is freedom from errant states of confusion;
(7) there is joy because action takes place for the sake of beings without one straying from the profoundly lucid state of inseparability; and
(8) there is inspiration (or enthusiasm) because there is knowledge of how things simply are and of how many things there are, and so one is constantly resting in equipoise with respect to the actual nature of phenomena and to ordinary beings. [4.204.b]

In expanding on these verses (including the abbreviated reference to “the three secrets”), we may cite from the Illuminating Lamp, which contains the following quotation:
There are eight qualities: powerful mastery of enlightened form, powerful mastery of enlightened speech,
likewise powerful mastery of enlightened mind,
powerful mastery of miraculous powers, of omnipresence,
of states of being, of desired goals, and of positive influence.[925]
That is to say, there is:
(1) powerful mastery of enlightened form, which is the displaying of countless forms simultaneously;
(2) powerful mastery of enlightened speech, which is the revealing of spiritual teachings in the languages of all beings simultaneously;
(3) powerful mastery of enlightened mind, which is the knowing of all objects of knowledge without using the ordinary conceptual process;
(4) powerful mastery of miraculous powers, which is the demonstrating of miraculous powers that are limitless and spontaneously present;
(5) powerful mastery of omnipresence, which is the pervading of all places and times and circumstances;
(6) powerful mastery of states of being, which is that of becoming a focus for qualities such as spiritual strengths;
(7) powerful mastery of desired goals, which is the accomplishment of all goals simply with the intention to do so; and
(8) powerful mastery of positive influence, which is that of causing any of the three degrees of enlightenment[926] to awaken in the mind streams of countless beings to be guided.
These are called “qualities of powerful mastery” due to the command they bring in these areas.

Generally speaking, according to the explanations found in the context of the more common spiritual paths, the context within which one awakens to buddhahood is, in fact, described in a variety of ways. But the interpretation from the ultimate perspective, according to this approach of the supreme secrets, is stated in the tantra the Vajra Garland:
E is the secret vault of basic space.
Within the bhaga, the lotus that is the source of phenomena,
the yogic practitioner dwells on the lion seat,
displaying magnificent marvels.[929]
In this way, the source text uses a number of synonymous terms, such as “the realm of buddhahood,” “the vault of the basic space of ultimate reality,” “the bhaga of the queen,” “the source of phenomena,” and “the lion throne.” It is referred to as “the level of buddhahood awakened in every respect, emptiness free of all elaboration,” “the bhaga of the vajra queen,” and “the secret.” Moreover, the glorious source the Well-Sealed Locket states:
The attainment of a spiritual being of the consort of awareness is not localized anywhere, does not take one anywhere, and is free of beginning, middle, and end. It is a state of nonduality, yet permeates the entire phenomenal world throughout the three planes of existence.[930]
This being the case, the realm is not something with physical spatiality, nor can it be analyzed as closer or further from any place within the ten directions of the universe of world systems. This is because (as has been discussed previously) it is all-pervasive, solely the pure vision of timeless awareness itself, free of elaboration yet endowed with any and every potentiality, being experienced as a pure realm. The realm in which the enlightened vision of timeless awareness interacts with ordinary beings and ensures their welfare is the universe of all world systems in its entirety.
While it is certainly the case that when the manifestation of a buddha in an impure realm appears, there is actual engagement taking place, such manifestations are primarily reflected forms that fall within the range of experience that is accessible to bodhisattvas on any of the levels of realization in their meditative absorption. It is this state of perception that texts describe as “buddhas as numerous as all atoms dwelling on a single atom.” [4.205.b] And the sūtra the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent, in referring to
…the characteristics of utterly pure, empowering, discerning awareness…[931]
is explaining this perspective with respect to the immeasurable mansion. Therefore, in the ultimate sense one should not regard buddhas as separate from one another, in distinct pure realms.

In essence, the kāyas constitute the maṇḍala of timeless awareness. Once a single individual attains manifest enlightenment, all the maṇḍalas of timeless awareness without exception are ensured: for example, that of thirty-seven deities, embodying the transformation of the mind-body aggregates, the sense fields, and the components of perception; or that of thirty-two deities, embodying the transformation of one’s subtle channels and constitution.
As for what the four kāyas are in essence, this will be discussed below.

The fruition aspect of tantra, since it entails the coming together of factors that are not subject to degeneration, can be termed “kāya” in Sanskrit, which can be rendered a “coming together” or a “dimension of enlightened being.”[932] As the Brief Presentation of the Tenets of View by Mañjuśrī states:
“Holistic sphere,” “aggregate,” and likewise “kāya”:
these are widely known to refer to a total amassing.[933]
There are detailed analyses of the kāyas that discuss from one to five kāyas, and even analyses of six, or sixteen, or more. Again, the Brief Presentation of the Tenets of View by Mañjuśrī states:
The Buddha, the lion of the Śākyas,
in accord with the acumen of ordinary beings’ intelligence,
spoke of one kāya, of two, of three,
of four, and of five.[934]
Of these, the single kāya is described as follows:
It is buddhahood, without beginning or end.
The original awakened state is indivisible:
it is the single flawless eye of timeless awareness,
the state of the tathāgatas, the kāya of timeless awareness.[935] [4.206.a]
Given that this is, in essence, the single timeless awareness that is the primordial unity of emptiness (endowed with any and every potentiality) and bliss (utterly unchanging), ultimately there is just this single kāya of primordial unity. This is because this very awareness has abided primordially without undergoing any change into something else (even in the circumstances of saṃsāra) and because this itself is the single kāya that is the natural perspective specific to buddhahood.

The same source states:
Due to the analysis into mind, speech, and form,
there is the proclamation of three kāyas.[937]
Nonconceptual enlightened mind is dharmakāya; enlightened speech, the inviolable and innately present vibration of being, is sambhogakāya; and enlightened form, endowed with any and every potentiality, is nirmāṇakāya. Alternatively, emptiness is explained to be dharmakāya, bliss to be sambhogakāya, and lucidity to be nirmāṇakāya.
The reflected forms that manifest to those who are to be guided, whether nirmāṇakāyas adorned with major and minor marks of perfect form, or even such things as mountains and forests, are all reflected forms that bring benefit and well-being to ordinary beings, and so constitute the form vajra, or nirmāṇakāya. All reflected sounds, from those of the twelve branches of the Buddha’s sublime teachings[938] to those of any and all objects of knowledge, constitute the speech vajra, or sambhogakāya. The kāya that is the unity of unchanging bliss [4.206.b] and emptiness endowed with the most sublime of all attributes constitutes the mind vajra, or dharmakāya.
There is an alternative explanation of the Three Jewels (buddha, dharma, and saṅgha) being the three kāyas, but this is subsumed within that of the three vajras.

There are four kāyas when one adds the svabhāvikakāya (enlightened dimension of the very essence of being itself) of innate presence, or mahāsukhakāya (supremely blissful dimension of enlightened being), to the three kāyas. The previous source states:
It is truly explained that the kāyas are four:
svabhāvikakāya, sambhogakāya,
nirmāṇakāya, and dharmakāya,
as well as the enlightened deeds they entail.[939]
In this regard, the Kālacakra tradition provides two classifications:
(1) According to one of these interpretations, with respect to the ultimate kāya of timeless awareness, there is svabhāvikakāya from the standpoint of bliss as the perceiving aspect and emptiness as the perceived aspect; and dharmakāya from the standpoint of emptiness as the perceiving aspect and bliss as the perceived aspect. There is sambhogakāya from the standpoint of sounds as the reflections of emptiness, and nirmāṇakāya from the standpoint of forms as its reflections. Svabhāvikakāya constitutes the totality of four such kāyas. Dharmakāya is the dimension of enlightened being that manifests, by way of being its reflection, to bodhisattvas on any of the levels of realization, without wavering for as long as space itself endures; it is this that the master Buddhaguhya also refers to as “the kāya of manifest enlightenment.” The rūpakāya that is present in the pinnacle pure realm, and that does not fall within the perception even of śrāvakas who have taken rebirth in the purest mundane realms, is sambhogakāya; that which performs such deeds as revealing itself as a presence in the Tuṣita heaven, manifesting in whatever forms are appropriate, in accord with the capacities of ordinary beings, is nirmāṇakāya. This classification was accepted by the early masters of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. [4.207.a]
(2) Alternatively, there is a classification of the “kāyas of the four vajras”: emptiness as svabhāvikakāya; bliss as dharmakāya (or mahāsukhakāya); the speech that is the natural manifestation of buddhahood as sambhogakāya; and the form that is its natural manifestation as nirmāṇakāya. Alternatively, the form that is the natural manifestation of buddhahood can be classified as sambhogakāya and supreme innate compassion as nirmāṇakāya.

There are five kāyas according to such analyses as the five family types of Akṣobhya and the rest, or the five aspects of timeless awareness. As the previous source states:
Buddhahood is the totality of five kāyas.
The sovereign lord is lord of the five aspects of timeless awareness.
The lord of the five buddhas is the wearer of the crown,
bearing the five aspects of enlightened vision without attachment.[940]
As for what characterizes these, the source continues:
All the limitless aspects of the aggregate of matter
constitute my[941] sublime nirmāṇakāya.
All the limitless aspects of the aggregate of sound
constitute my sublime sambhogakāya.
All the limitless aspects of the aggregate of mental events
are extolled as my dharmakāya.
All the limitless aspects of the aggregate of timeless awareness
are extolled as my jñānakāya.
All the limitless aspects of the aggregate of bliss
are my sublime and unchanging mahāsukhakāya.[942]

By adding the universal principle of the supremely blissful kāya of Vajrasattva, which permutes the rest, the total becomes one of six kāyas. In this regard, the glorious tantra the Wheel of Time states that the six family types derive from the six elements being free of obscuration. In accord with this statement, the element of timeless awareness is the family of Vajrasattva; the element of consciousness, the family of Akṣobhya; the element of air, the family of Amoghasiddhi; the element of fire, the family of Ratnasambhava; the element of water, the family of Amitābha; and the element of earth, the family of Vairocana.
Let us consider the interpretations of the mother tantras (including the Cakrasaṃvara cycle) in general. Since mind that is utterly lucid by its very nature transcends ordinary consciousness, it constitutes the transformation of the basis of all ordinary experience. But while all phenomena that entail conceptual elaboration partake of the nature of that mind, [4.207.b] it itself is unsullied by elaboration. This is Akṣobhya, the glorious heruka.
The emptiness of all phenomena being primordially unborn is the equalness that is free of any division into nirvāṇa versus saṃsāra (such as buddhas versus ordinary beings, for example). Without one straying from that state, one nevertheless takes great delight in whatever one experiences, with a sense of spontaneous presence that is free of all ordinary mental states. As well, in accord with the fortunes of ordinary beings, activity to benefit those beings is forthcoming without hindrance and without missing the appropriate occasion. This is Amoghasiddhi; and since engagement to benefit others is swift, this is also Pāramāśva, or Aśvarāja.[943]
Due to the insight into equalness, which is freedom from naïve affirmation or nihilistic denial, one does not stray due to error. This is Ratnasambhava, also known as Vajrasūrya, or Tejorāja.[944]
Unchanging subtle energy, while equal to space in its extent, is unborn; it is timeless awareness, free of all the structure of ordinary syllables and words, expressing itself for all beings, in all realms, at all times, and in all languages, in whatever way is necessary to guide beings in any way. This is characterized as expressing itself as the unity of sound and emptiness, and is Padmanaṭeśvara,[945] or Amitābha.
The nature of a vision seen by a psychic performing a divination transcends that of even minute subatomic particles. Analogous to this is the fact that all that is simply the pure aspect of the mind’s perception (of naturally arising pure realms, enlightened forms, and other splendid manifestations, which are immeasurable, unlimited, in infinite array) manifests as the elaborate display of a single timeless awareness. This is Jinanitya,[946] or Vairocana.
The epitome of what is constant and sublimely pervasive does not entail a duality of constancy versus pervasiveness. This is the principle of the “sovereign lord.”
All objects of knowledge are seen to be in every way like illusions. This is the nondual unity of bliss and emptiness, of timeless awareness of emptiness and of natural supreme bliss, in full evidence. This is Vajrasattva as the embodiment of ultimate enlightenment. This is also termed “twofold purity,”[947] or “the fruition of the vajra holder.” [4.208.a]

Once the sixteen degrees of transition[948] have ceased in a state free of obscuration, one attains sixteen kāyas, which is to say one becomes aware of these sixteen aspects of suchness. An alternative model is one of arriving at a total of sixteen by analyzing each of the four kāyas into aspects of enlightened mind, speech, and form, and timeless awareness. As is said:
As for nirmāṇakāya, there are the aspects of enlightened form, speech, and mind,
and timeless awareness, all merging together as one.
As for sambhogakāya, there are the aspects of enlightened form, speech, and mind,
and timeless awareness, all merging together as one.
As for glorious dharmakāya, there are the aspects of enlightened form, speech, and mind,
and timeless awareness, all merging together as one.
As for the kāya of innate presence, there are the aspects of enlightened form, speech, and mind,
and timeless awareness, all merging together as one.
These are not the ordinary states of waking consciousness, the dream state, deep sleep,
or (the fourth) the bliss generated by the two sexual organs.[949]
As the foregoing illustrates, one should understand that there are numerous classification systems of the kāyas that employ analyses according to the family types.

Of all the foregoing analyses of the kāyas, the explanation of there being three kāyas is the most widely known model in the approaches of both sūtra and tantra. And in the tantric approach presently under discussion, it is extremely important to understand the innate purity underlying the model of the four kāyas. So let us analyze these in a bit more detail.
As for dharmakāya, with knowing awareness and what is known resolved in equalness, this is the nature of suchness as a freedom from all elaboration. [4.208.b] As for sambhogakāya, this is the oneness of the enjoyment of the full richness of all phenomena (with the elimination of mental images based on dualistic perceptions) with the seven consummate attributes of integration. And as for nirmāṇakāya, this is enlightened activity that is spontaneously accomplished.
To put it concisely, dharmakāya is one’s own nonconceptual, self-knowing timeless awareness that perceives that all phenomena do not exist as such. It is this single timeless awareness that nevertheless knows everything, even down to the vibration of a single subatomic particle, all at once; knows that things have manifested without having to exist, do so manifest, and will so manifest, all part of the process of cause and effect, without a single exception. Sambhogakāya is the arising of the unceasing manifest aspect of that awareness in a myriad array as enlightened forms and pure realms. Nirmāṇakāya is timeless awareness that demonstrates to ordinary beings (who are confused concerning the nonexistence of things) the means to become freed from that confusion. These three are, in fact, facets of a single timeless awareness; this is the significance of the primordial unity of the three kāyas.
The nature of mind (that of supreme bliss and the eight experiential qualities, ultimately free of elaboration) is the kāya of innate presence. This, however, can be subsumed within dharmakāya.
For each of the two rūpakāyas, there are two further kāyas: the symbolic expression and the actuality. The symbolic expression of sambhogakāya is that which falls within the range of experience accessible to great bodhisattvas;[950] the actuality is exclusively the timeless awareness of buddhahood, which does not manifest in the perceptions of any unenlightened beings. The symbolic expression of nirmāṇakāya is that which manifests in the direct perception of certain ordinary beings; the actuality is that of a transcendent and accomplished conqueror’s timeless awareness as spontaneous fulfillment, which is to say, supreme innate compassion.
One should understand that the four kāyas constitute the freedom of the four ordinary states of waking consciousness, dream state, deep sleep, and the fourth (that is, the thought patterns produced by sexual passion) free of obscuration, and the completely purified state of subtle energy, feminine energy, masculine energy, and ordinary consciousness. Dharmakāya by nature is unconditioned; sambhogakāya by nature is unassailable by the afflictions due to suffering or the all-pervasive origin of suffering; [4.209.a] the nature of nirmāṇakāya is that of liberating through compassion; and the kāya of innate presence is by nature the supremely blissful state of primordial unity.
If I were to elaborate on these themes, there would be a great deal to say, but I will confine myself to this much for the time being.

There can be no analysis into family types, for example, on the basis of the ultimate nature of being. But because one can analyze these from the more fragmented standpoint of the relative level, there are unlimited models for analyzing family types, far more than one could possibly count. But to begin our concise presentation, let us consider the basis for the analysis of all family types, according to the general Anuttara tantra approach. The Gathering of Secrets, for example, states:
In brief, the five mind-body aggregates
are renowned as the five buddhas.
The fields of the vajra senses themselves
are the sublime maṇḍala of bodhisattvas….
…Earth is termed “Locana”;
the element of water is Māmakī;
Those called “Pāṇḍara” and “Tārā”[951]
are renowned to be fire and air.[952]
To classify the aggregate of matter as “being” Vairocana means that when discerning consciousness, which (in the context of saṃsāra) perceives what manifests as the aggregate of matter, has become transformed, the natural manifestation of timeless awareness itself becomes that of the maṇḍala of Vairocana (which is to say, the form of Vairocana, adorned with major and minor marks of perfection, as well as the associated pure realm and the infinite array of its splendor). It is for this reason that the gurus of the past used euphemistic expressions for awakening to buddhahood, such as “the transformed aggregate of matter is Vairocana” and “the aggregate of matter is, in essence, Vairocana.” [4.209.b]
A parallel situation applies to the other aggregates. Thus that of sensation is Ratnasambhava; that of perceptions, Amitābha; that of formative factors,[953] Amoghasiddhi; and that of consciousness, Akṣobhya. The eye is Kṣitagarbha; the ear, Vajrapāṇi; the nose, Ākāśagarbha; the tongue, Lokeśvara; the body, Nivaraṇaviṣkambhin; and the conceptual mind, Samantabhadra.[954] Earth is Buddhalocana; water, Māmakī; fire, Pāṇḍaravāsinī; and air, Samayatārā. The realm of visual forms is the vajra goddess of form; that of sounds, the vajra goddess of sound; that of odors, the vajra goddess of odor; that of tastes, the vajra goddess of taste; that of tactile sensations, the vajra goddess of the tactile; and that of concepts,[955] the vajra goddess of the basic space of phenomena.
Thus the five mind-body aggregates, four elements, and twelve components of the sense fields,[956] all taken together, constitute twenty-one aggregates. Due to the transformation of the ordinary mind that perceives what manifests as these aggregates, this brings about the twenty-one maṇḍalas that are their analogues. That is to say, awakening to buddhahood takes place.
When a single individual awakens to buddhahood, there comes about anything up to an infinite array of maṇḍalas that are all subsumed as the natural manifestations of that individual’s awareness. The tantra the Vajra of Delight states:
All of them, moreover, belong to hundreds of thousands,
to tens of millions, even to countless family types.
Therefore, family types are countless,
and these types themselves derive from the family of sublime joy.[957]

The subsumed models are those of some ninety-five minor types,
while the subsuming model is that of the family types of the five victorious ones,
giving one hundred family types.
Each of the five major types has five subsidiary types,
and each of these is analyzed according to the four feminine consorts, again giving one hundred, and so on.
There are countless specific expressions. The freedom of the six elements from obscuration
gives six family types, and these can further be subsumed within five, or even three, types.
The dance of the many unfolds within the mood of oneness.

If we analyze what has just been discussed in more detail, we arrive at anything up to one hundred family types. Of the twenty-one aggregates discussed above, the realm of concepts and the conceptual mind [4.210.a] are considered as being common to all the rest. The remaining nineteen aggregates are related to the five family types in the fundamental context of the ground of being;[958] each of the nineteen is analyzed further into five types, giving a total of ninety-five minor types that constitute the “subsumed model.” As for the “subsuming model,” this constitutes the five aspects of timeless awareness (that is, the five major types of the victorious ones of the five families), again within the context of the ground of being. Adding these two models together gives a total of one hundred. This interpretation is stated in the Lamp That Integrates Conduct:
The aggregates, the components of perception, and similarly the sense fields[959]
are each further analyzed into five according to the five types,
a process blessed by the tathāgatas.[960]
Where did all the suffering[961] of saṃsāra come from?
Similarly, in the case of the five sense faculties and the five kinds of external sense objects,
each and every one of these
is constantly blessed by the five tathāgatas,
and they are blessed as[962] five, or three, aspects of timeless awareness.[963]
There is an even more detailed model that analyzes some ninety-five minor family types.
The Kālacakra cycle speaks of the following models:
(1) thirty-six types associated with the innate purity underlying thirty-six aggregates and components of ordinary perception;
(2) twelve types associated with the twelve sections of the human cranium (these twelve also derive from the six basic family types further analyzed according to the principles of skillful method and sublime intelligence; and from the three types of enlightened form, speech, and mind further analyzed according to the four kāyas);
(3) thirty-two types that derive from earth, water, fire, and air each being analyzed according to these same four elements, and then further analyzed according to the principles of skillful method and sublime intelligence, giving a total of thirty-two; and
(4) one hundred types that derive from the twenty finger- and toenails being further analyzed according to the five elements and added together.
In addition, in the context of the ground of being, the mirrorlike aspect of timeless awareness is Vairocana; the aspect of equalness, Ratnasambhava; the discerning aspect, Amitābha; the aspect of spontaneous fulfillment, Amoghasiddhi; and the aspect of the basic space of phenomena, Akṣobhya. When these five major family types are analyzed according to the same five, there are twenty-five types. When these are further analyzed according to the four feminine consorts, there are one hundred. [4.210.b]
Taking the three avenues of ordinary mind as being common to all the rest, there are five avenues of ordinary consciousness.[964] Attendant on these are five kinds of formative factors; five kinds of perception (smallness, largeness, immeasurability, nothingness, and the perception that constitutes the pinnacle of conditioned existence); five situations in which factors come together to produce sensory contact;[965] and the five divisions of the aggregate of matter (shape, color, changes in form, open cavities, and imagined forms).[966] Because each of the foregoing is formed from the natures of the four elements, there are a total of one hundred factors.
From these models come further variations of countless, limitless family types. If these are summarized concisely, they are subsumed within six families that constitute the freedom from obscuration of the six elements,[967] or five families (if, of the six, the family of Vajrasattva is considered common to the others). The minor types are included within their respective major types, and so are subsumed within the five families. And if a more concise model is adopted, within the context of the ground of being, the aggregates are subsumed within the three principles of body, speech, and mind. This is what is intended when the Sphere of the Secret Moon states:
Families are explained as being of one hundred types.
If these are summarized, there are five types.
Due to an analysis into enlightened form, speech, and mind,
they can also become three.[968]
But all of these family types are solely the manifold display of the timeless awareness of primordial unity. As the tantra the Authentic Conduct of Yoginīs states:
All these beings are the mastery of buddhahood itself,[969]
manifesting like fine dancers and artists.
Anything and everything is what is termed “the sixth buddha.”[970]
The dance of the many unfolds within the mood of oneness.[971]

The timeless awareness that is primordially integrated with the foregoing kāyas is fivefold or sevenfold.
If the first case, in the fundamental context of the ground of being, the five mental poisons (that is, the five afflictive states) entail conceptual thought processes, which abide in their essence, by their very nature, as the unity of lucidity and emptiness. By one pursuing a spiritual practice that uses skillful means to work with that abiding nature, without one’s having to deliberately eliminate these poisons, they serve as the basis for distinctive states of meditative absorption that are the causal factors for experiencing the five aspects of timeless awareness. This is the path of skillful means that relies on emptiness.
There are those who strive to incorporate a powerful intention of bodhicitta, wishing to gain spiritual attainments (the most sublime and the more ordinary) as a precursor to experiencing any and all of afflictive states—ignorance as the state of utter lucidity, anger as the meditative absorption of wrath, pride as the “pride” of deity yoga, desire and attachment as the timeless awareness of power, envy, and so forth. These practitioners apply this approach directly to these ordinary afflictive states and meditate accordingly, so that the five mental poisons become fully evident in their complete and innate purity as the five respective aspects of timeless awareness. This is skillful means that focuses on the relative level of reality. This interpretation is one of applying the principle of innate purity in an extraordinary way, according to which interpretation the five aspects of timeless awareness are accounted for due to the innate purity of the five mind-body aggregates, the five elements, and the five afflictive states. It is explained in great detail in such sources as the Commentary by Vajragarbha.[973] [4.211.b] The significance of the five aspects of timeless awareness, corresponding to the five mind-body aggregates in their innate purity, is referred to in the following passage from the Sublimely Unchanging State, which contains citations from the source tantra:
All the collections of things are imputed forms
that are eliminated in emptiness, but this is not a blank void.
All this is seen in the way that a young medium sees a vision
when casting a divination with her mirror.
This verse refers, on the transcendent level of truth, to the aggregate of matter as the mirrorlike aspect of timeless awareness.
All things have become an equalness,
such that things abide in their unchanging oneness.
This derives from unchanging timeless awareness.
This is neither a nihilistic denial nor some naïve affirmation.
This verse refers to the aggregate of sensations as the aspect of equalness in timeless awareness.
All syllables, the building blocks of words,
truly derive from the family type of the syllable A.
A supreme unchanging state is attained.
There are no words, there is nothing to which words apply.
This verse refers to the aggregate of perceptions as the discerning aspect of timeless awareness.
In phenomena that are not born
and are devoid of formative factors,
there is neither buddhahood nor enlightenment,
neither ordinary beings nor their life force.
This verse refers to the aggregate of formative factors as the aspect of spontaneous fulfillment in timeless awareness.
Transcending the nature of ordinary consciousness,
timeless awareness is pure and unsullied.
Phenomena, whose nature is that of utter lucidity,
abide within the realm of the basic space of phenomena.
This verse refers to the aggregate of consciousness as the completely pure basic space of phenomena in timeless awareness.[974]
These aspects are, in essence, as discussed earlier in the section on the approach of the transcendent perfections.[975]

An alternative, extraordinary classification of timeless awareness and the auxiliary aspects it entails derives from the great tantras that are the gateway to the vajra approach, [4.212.a] as elucidated by the mahāsiddha Śāntigupta,[976] a greatly accomplished master in this age of strife,[977] in his personal teachings. In this classification, there are three general contexts: ground, path, and fruition.
In the first context, that of the ground of being, the seven key factors are:
(1) profundity because mind itself is emptiness;
(2) vast extent because it extends throughout all sensory appearances that one perceives;
(3) pervasiveness because it is not subject to distance;
(4) constancy because it is uninterrupted and by nature changeless;
(5) embodiment of timeless awareness because the unceasing avenue for the expression of the lucidity of being manifests as a body;
(6) primordial unity because there in the inseparability of manifestation and emptiness; and
(7) supreme bliss because perceived object and subjective perceiver blend timelessly as one.
In the second context, that of the spiritual path, meditation conforms with both the ground of being and the fruition state because it makes fully evident those very aspects that abide as just described in the ground of being. In this present context, there is profundity, in that one meditates on things having no independent nature; vast extent, for although suchness accounts for the arising of all things in one’s experience, one trains in experiencing these arising as embodiments of one’s pure self-knowing awareness; pervasiveness, in that one is assured that suchness pervades all things; constancy, for one trains in experiencing the nature of mind as changeless; embodiment of timeless awareness, for one trains in experiencing this nature arising as the maṇḍala of deities; primordial unity, for one blends the manifestation of the deities’ forms with the unity of bliss and emptiness, as one “taste”; and unchanging bliss, since one relies on the process of “melting bliss” to highlight the innate nature of being.
One can apply a more detailed treatment of meditation techniques to these aspects, by analyzing them according to such topics as empowerment, the stages of development and completion, and so on.
In the third context, we apply this treatment to the timeless awareness of buddhahood, the fruition. There is profundity because the fruition entails knowledge of the way of abiding, just as it is, free of elaboration; vast extent, in that it entails timeless awareness that knows all things, interdependent and interconnected, in all their multiplicity; pervasiveness, or omnipresence, for it abides such that it permeates all things simultaneously (for example, the three kāyas, which constitute the way in which things naturally abide, extend to the limits of space itself, without being subject to distance, while the two rūpakāyas [4.212.b] appear in countless world systems for countless beings to be guided, such that whenever the occasion is appropriate for them to appear, they do so at that very point in time); constancy, for the three kāyas are not subject to destruction and do not ever change in essence; embodiment of timeless awareness, for buddhahood is awareness’s natural manifestations and so manifests to others as forms endowed with seven attributes of integration (the manifestation of myriad nirmāṇakāyas to beings who are to be guided falls within this category); primordial unity, that is, the inseparability of the kāyas and timeless awareness; and bliss, which is to say, the supporting and supported factors of unchanging bliss being inseparable, as the innate nature of reality.
In fact, the real topic under discussion in this section is the latter treatment.

Timeless awareness as profundity entails five auxiliary ramifications, or characteristics. Because the experience of it comes about through a process of interdependent connection, it has no independent nature. It is self-knowing, in that it comes about, in essence, as simply a “being aware,” free of a duality of something to be aware of and something to be aware of that. Because its qualities are naturally what they are and are inseparable from it, from the standpoint of their very essence, these qualities undergo no increase. And as is said:
The element of water, gold, and space,
in that they are pure, are held to be pure.[978]
That is to say, given that timeless awareness is by nature forever free of distortion, it entails no factors to be eliminated that must be reduced. Hence, there is an absence of fluctuation. It is not some object of conceptual thoughts (which conceive in terms of ordinary characteristics) and abides as the epitome of nonconceptuality that cannot be so characterized. And that nonconceptual state itself clearly manifests in the reflected images of all things. Such are its five ramifications.

Timeless awareness as vast extent applies to its causal factors (those of the vast extent of merit and the vast extent of timeless awareness);[979] to the sphere of timeless awareness’s activity (that is, the vast extent of its environment); to the vast extent of its scope (because it takes all the factors involved in buddhahood as its frame of reference); to the vast extent of its involvement (because it involves the specific manifestations of all phenomena); and to the vast extent of its activity (because it is active in ensuring the welfare of all ordinary beings through any and all avenues). It is thus endowed with five characteristics, or auxiliary ramifications, of its vast extent.[980]

As for its pervasiveness, this timeless awareness is not subject to distance, but permeates throughout all of space. It is not subject to temporality, but permeates throughout all of time. It is pervasive due to that fact that it is not different in its essence from any one of the three continua of ground, path, and fruition. It is pervasive because emptiness is not something distinct from suchness. And it is pervasive because it perceives all phenomena in their equalness, nonconceptually. These are the five auxiliary ramifications of its pervasiveness.

As for the auxiliary ramifications of its constancy, it is uninterrupted, for it is impossible for any interruption to occur in the primordial unity of the kāyas and timeless awareness. It is without cessation, such as the cessation that results in no residual traces being left behind.[981] The kāyas do not have subtle traits such as being made of minute particles of matter. As is said:[982]
As it was before, so is it afterward:
the true, unchanging nature of phenomena.
And so this awareness is, by nature, forever unchanging in any and all situations. And timeless awareness is inconceivable because it transcends the scope of the imagination of even the greatest heirs of the victorious ones.[983] These five are the auxiliary ramifications of its constancy.

As for the auxiliary ramifications of its bliss, enlightened form expresses itself in a form of integration, of masculine and feminine deities in union, the unity of skillful means and sublime intelligence. Enlightened mind abides in its naturalness as unchanging bliss. The expression of timeless awareness is that of supreme compassion, and it abides such that its nature is that of the inseparability of these first three ramifications. There is the dissolution of conceptual mind, of the relentless process of ordinary mental activity that is the antithesis of supreme bliss. There is also the dissolution of the subtle energyof karma that serves as the vehicle for that mental activity, and the cessation of that energy. This awareness becomes fully evident through the attainment of bliss on the basis of the process of “melting.” And due to the natural presence of bodhicitta, it abides as the very essence of inexhaustible bliss. These are the seven ramifications of bliss.

As for the auxiliary ramifications of the embodiment of timeless awareness, it is born of (that is, derives from) the timeless awareness of the emptiness of everything. It entails the cessation of suffering, which is the perception imposed by impure karma. It is omnipresent. It is unwavering under any and all circumstances, which is to say it is not defined by any process of change. It is an embodiment that is simply a manifestation of mind, of a thinking process; and it is a quasi-physical embodiment that is simply the refined vital essence of subtle energy. There would be nothing to preclude this awareness revealing, in an instant of the briefest duration, all objects of knowledge subsumed within space and time.[984] And it sends forth clouds of forms similar to its own, adorned with major and minor marks of perfection. These seven are said to be the auxiliary ramifications of the vajrakāya. In this regard, there are seven due to the embodiments of subtle energy and mind being counted as one ramification, but one should not think of what is termed “subtle energy” as some inanimate matter that exists in its own right.[985]

As for the auxiliary ramifications of its primordial unity, it has no dualistic framework since all dualistic perception has been eliminated. [4.214.a] It is nonconceptual, in the sense that the stirring of ordinary mind and mental events has been arrested; that is to say, any concepts that do not accord with reality have ceased. It appreciates the actual nature of phenomena, reality just as it is. Since it involves no ordinary dualistic perception, it perceives solely a vast array of innate purity. It manifests throughout all time and space, and in all ways, as ensuring benefit for beings. And because there is never any wavering from that state, the timeless awareness of Vajrasattva is the state of primordial unity. These are the six auxiliary ramifications of primordial unity.[986]

In this context, there are additional aspects, referred to by specific terms that are also found in the sūtra tradition, though with distinct connotations. Such aspects constitute the different functions through which the very essence of timeless awareness expresses itself.
Of these ten aspects of knowledge:[987]
(1) Knowledge of relative reality is such that supremely blissful timeless awareness knows anything and everything that occurs due to the interdependent connectedness of causes and conditions, and perceives these to be without independent nature, like illusions.
(2) Knowledge as understanding of phenomena constitutes knowledge as the aspect of skillful means. It has four applications. Knowledge as understanding of the phenomenon of suffering means that all specific expressions of the truth of suffering have been eliminated; instead, there is perception of the maṇḍala of the nature of things[988] being that of their innate purity. Knowledge as understanding of the phenomenon of the all-pervasive origin of suffering is the insight that afflictive states are naturally occurring timeless awareness; that anything that is nominally meritorious or nonmeritorious (even anything that manifests as subliminal karma[989]) is a fragmentary expression that is primordially and utterly lucid by nature; and that all of this karma is, by nature, inseparable from the spontaneously present deeds of enlightened being. Knowledge as understanding of the phenomenon of the cessation of suffering is the insight that any factors to be eliminated are adventitious and have newly ceased, and that the basic space in which they have ceased is supremely blissful. Knowledge as understanding of the phenomenon of the spiritual path is the insight that all factors associated with the spiritual path are, in their nature, inseparable from the nature of mind (the nature that abides primordially as supreme bliss, naturally lucid and self-knowing) [4.214.b] such that these factors in turn abide primordially as its very essence.
(3) Knowledge as subsequent understanding of phenomena constitutes the aspect of sublime intelligence. It too has four applications. Knowledge as subsequent understanding of suffering takes as its frame of reference the objects of knowledge of the phenomenon of suffering and perceives these to be supreme bliss. Knowledge as subsequent understanding of the all-pervasive origin of suffering takes as its frame of reference the objects of knowledge of the phenomenon of the all-pervasive origin of suffering and perceives these to be without independent nature. Knowledge as subsequent understanding of the cessation of suffering is the insight that the elimination of all factors to be eliminated is primordially the case. Knowledge as subsequent understanding of the spiritual path is the insight that the inseparability of the ground of being and the spiritual path is itself such that their nature is primordially one of emptiness.
(4) As for knowledge of the Four Truths, this is not, in fact, anything separate from the foregoing knowledges as the understanding of phenomena and the subsequent understanding. However, if one identifies each of these truths simply by what it is in essence, knowledge of suffering is the perception of the maṇḍala of all manner of suffering and its essence as that of supreme bliss.
(5) Knowledge of the all-pervasive origin of suffering is knowledge that the nature of this all-pervasive origin is that of timeless awareness (and the enlightened activity that this entails) and that even that knowledge is perceived in such a way that it has no independent nature.
(6) Knowledge of the cessation of suffering is the perception that suffering is by nature such that its cessation is primordially the case and that there is freedom even from the state of “being free” of adventitious factors.
(7) Knowledge of the spiritual path is the perception that the inseparability of the ground of being and the fruition abides as the very essence of the spiritual path[990] and that that inseparability itself is primordially empty. In this context, it is very important that one understand the significance of the following: that what is seen is the fact that the truth of cessation is the nature of the truth of suffering, and that the truth of the path is the nature of the truth of the all-pervasive origin.
(8) Knowledge of other’s minds means there are levels of deeper discernment elicited by timeless awareness (which perceives all phenomena in their equalness), and these deeper levels allow for knowledge of the activity going on in the minds of all beings, whether ordinary beings in conditioned existence or spiritually advanced beings in the state of peace.[991]
(9) Knowledge of the exhaustion of all negative factors is the perception that all phenomena that are factors to be eliminated are, [4.215.a] by their nature, such that their exhaustion is primordially the case.
(10) Knowledge of the unborn quality of things is the perception that all phenomena are by nature unborn and that all factors to be eliminated, while nominally removed through the process of the spiritual path, only came about adventitiously in the first place and henceforth can never occur again.
The foregoing are the ten aspects of knowledge from the standpoint of the level of buddhahood. The steps involved in knowledge of phenomena and subsequent knowledge as these relate to the path of seeing[992] are defined in relation to the afflictive obscurations, but they can also be understood through the reasoning used in this context. As for the eight steps of patient acceptance (that is, patient acceptance producing knowledge of the phenomenon of suffering, patient acceptance producing subsequent knowledge of the suffering, and the rest), one brings patient acceptance to bear on the significance of what eight of the foregoing aspects of knowledge[993] have understood and cultivates that acceptance in meditation.
“Well,” one might ask, “given that the nature of the sixteen degrees of joy (which are stabilized in a downward progression during the phase of the path of seeing) is explained in terms of sixteen steps, do they correspond one-to-one with the sixteen steps of knowledge and patient acceptance?” In fact they do not. In the first place, the sixteen steps of patient acceptance and knowledge are analyzed in relation to the realization involved; and while there certainly is some slight delay between the two steps of attaining knowledge and attaining the patient acceptance to which this leads, for the most part the additional steps are all cultivated at the same time within a single session of meditative equipoise (for other than being aspects of knowledge that can be distinguished due to the objects that are their frame of reference, they are, in essence, a single state of timeless awareness. The sixteen degrees of joy constitute a temporal sequence that derives from analyzing the progress one makes on the basis of bodhicitta.[994] Although references are made to “the sixteen steps of joy on the path of seeing,” it does not follow that these steps are the sixteen steps of patient acceptance and knowledge.
Concerning the aspects of knowledge, Reciting the Names of Mañjuśrī states:
…upholding the realization of the eight aspects of knowledge. . .
…bearer of the ten completely pure aspects of knowledge.[995]
The definitive meaning of such passages was explained by the mahāsiddha Śānti in pith instructions that he extracted from a work entitled the Compendium of the Tantras, [4.215.b] which he said consisted of eight thousand sections.[996]
The phrase “and so forth” in the source verses cited above indicates that in this context there are other classifications that could be elaborated on, such as the twelve aspects of the meaning of truth, or the eight rates of initial entrance and stable abiding according to the secret mantra approach.[997]

As for the qualities and activity of enlightenment, they are in no way different from the explanations given in the section classifying the fruition in the dialectical approach, and so one can understand them from that explanation.
In brief, though, it does not matter how much one develops classification schemes to analyze the fruition in detail and enumerate its aspects: kāyas, pure realms, and so forth. That which constitutes the timeless awareness of completely perfect buddhahood abides, in the context of an ordinary being, as mind, which is utterly lucid by its very nature. Due to its very essence, free of all obscurations, that nature becomes fully evident, similar to gold being found in gold ore, and allows itself to be experienced directly. It entails supreme elimination, in that all limitless obscurations have been eliminated, together with their attendant habitual patterns. It entails supreme realization, for there is direct perception of all phenomena without exception (that is, the mind-body aggregates, components of perception, and sense fields), without any deliberate examination process, perceiving these to be like illusions, dream images, a city of the gandharvas, a seer’s vision, and the like. And due to the force of that realization, there is supreme mental focus, which ensures the welfare of all beings without exception as a spontaneous accomplishment, with this enactment taking place for as long as space itself endures, yet without attachment. This, then, is the absolutely perfect and sublime fruition that can be characterized by these three supreme principles.
Such ensuring of limitless beings’ welfare entails the two qualities of being constant and pervasive. There is ongoing and constant presence, abiding without any fluctuation [4.216.a], in that beings are nurtured in the endless realms in which they live. And just as the space associated with the realm of phenomena pervades it in such a way that it provides an open context for all material things, timeless awareness is spontaneously present in its supreme pervasiveness, present in any and all kinds of ordinary beings, without being subject to the slightest distinction due to distance.

Let us briefly discuss the fruition aspect of tantra, which constitutes the consummate state, according to the tradition of Vajrasattva entitled the Web of Magical Display. According to the Specific Presentation of the Web of Magical Display:
Although the accomplished yogic practitioner, the supreme practitioner immersed in the state of genuine being,
has made evident what is spontaneously present, just as it is,
this is merely a conventional label; there is no duality.
Nevertheless, it is referred to in this way.[998]
As this passage indicates, the basis for the process of refinement is the ground, or causal, aspect of tantra. Dependent on that are the adventitious distortions that are the factors to be refined away. Once these have been thoroughly refined away by the process of refinement, the consummation is one of this ground aspect’s being experienced fully, just as it is.
That is to say, the basis for the refinement is the causal aspect of tantra, which is to say, buddha nature, which is primordially present, in and of itself, as a natural attribute in the makeup of all beings. To use an analogy, it is like a precious gem lying in a muddy swamp. The factors to be refined away are the obvious, and even the most subtle, adventitious distortions, that is, dualistic perceptions of what manifests do not actually exist; these distortions are analogous to the mud that is obscuring the gem. [4.216.b] The process of refinement is the path subsumed within the stages of development and completion; these are analogous to water and cleansers used to wash the gem. As for the result of this refinement, once all the distortions have been refined away by one’s practice of the spiritual path, the consummation constitutes the full experience of the qualities of enlightenment, just as these are present in the ground of being; this is analogous to the outpouring of all desirables that comes from the wish-fulfilling gem once the mud has been removed.
As for the derivation of the term, “Why,” one might ask, “is the term ‘fruition aspect of tantra’ used?” The Scriptural Synopsis states:
The consummation of spiritual attainment is described as the “fruition.”[999]
That is, this is called “fruition” because it completely fulfills the wishes of those who earnestly seek the consummate state that is the unsurpassable and most sublime fruition, and it is called “tantra,” or “continuum of being” because it is forever uninterrupted.

As to what characterizes the fruition aspect of tantra, it is already free of all limitations (such as being one thing or many) without these limitations having to be eliminated. Therefore, since this constitutes the full experience of what is truly meaningful yet indescribable, it is a freedom from any context in which it could be objectified, [4.217.a] and so proves to be of “one taste” (like water being poured into water) with the enlightened intent of all buddhas. The Three Stages states:
Because it is characterized in four ways,[1001]
this totality is neither identical to, nor separate from, anything.[1002]

If a specific enumeration is applied to the inconceivable scope of these categories, there are twenty-five factors entailed in the fruition state. Of these, the five kāyas are as follows:
(1) “Dharmakāya” (the dimension of the actual nature of phenomena) refers, in essence, to the consummate realization that is for one’s own benefit, that is, the freedom of timeless awareness in the immediacy of the ground of being.
(2) “Sambhogakāya” (the dimension of being enjoying its own richness) refers to the manifestation of forms endowed with major and minor marks of perfection; while not straying from the context of dharmakāya, these forms manifest in the perceptions of those to be guided whose karma is pure (specifically, tenth-level bodhisattvas) and are the extraordinary indirect results of bodies becoming incorruptible.
(3) “Nirmāṇakāya” (the dimension of emanated form) refers to the manifestation of myriad forms that ensure benefit, appearing in harmony with the aspirations of those to be guided whose karma is still impure (that is, the six classes of ordinary beings).
(4) “Vajrakāya” (the dimension of immutable being) refers to the fact that, even though rūpakāya (dimensions of enlightenment manifest in form) manifests in two ways, these forms do not exist in their own right; rather, they do not stray from dharmakāya (or, put another way, dharmakāya and rūpakāya are indivisible).
(5) “Abhisambodhikāya” (the dimension of manifest enlightenment) refers to the fact that the foregoing rūpakāyas are spontaneously perfect in the pure presence of timeless awareness, so that, while never straying from dharmakāya, they can and do manifest in myriad ways that are in harmony with the karma of those to be guided.

These five aspects of enlightened speech embody the principle of effective communication between the five kāyas of teachers and the respective retinues. They are as follows:
(1) “enlightened speech as the ultimate unborn nature” (associated with dharmakāya), from the perspective that the actual nature of phenomena, though itself indescribable and inexpressible, serves as the basis underlying everything that can be expressed;
(2) “enlightened speech as the symbolic expression of enlightened intent” (associated with sambhogakāya), in that the symbolic expressions of this kāya present an approximation of ultimate reality to the minds of the retinue, in the way that a mirror aids in the removal of dirt that is already on one’s face;
(3) “enlightened speech as the utterance of words” (associated with nirmāṇakāya), in that spiritual teachings are presented simultaneously in languages and vocabularies that guide any and all beings in any and all ways;
(4) “enlightened speech as the vajra state of inseparability,” in that all these languages and vocabularies constitute the nondual unity of sound and emptiness, and so there is freedom from dualistic extremes; and
(5) “enlightened speech as manifest enlightenment,” in that all that is audible is spontaneously present within the scope of pure awareness, and so unimpeded in any way whatsoever as the “speech” that is the blessing of that pure awareness. [4.218.a]

and are pacified through the deeds of buddhahood. [4.218.b]
Individuals who are bewildered and suffer from poverty and want
are enriched with increasing intelligence and wealth.
Stubborn individuals who cannot otherwise be helped or guided
are guided and tamed through the activity of exercising power.
Malevolent beings who cannot be tamed through compassionate means
are annihilated through the wrath of forceful intervention.
Thus, in the context of such mastery, activities are spontaneously present and unbiased
toward the various kinds of beings who lack realization.[1017]

The great perfection of the kāyas forms, speech, and mind:

As this passage indicates, the distinctive features of the fruition aspect of tantra can be subsumed within five categories: There is enlightened form since there is what serves as the basis for all the magnificent qualities of the fruition without exception; enlightened speech since there is effective communication to those who are to be guided; enlightened mind since there is knowledge of all that can be known; qualities of enlightenment since there is perfection of control; and enlightened activity since those to be guided are guided.

The five kāyas are as follows:
(1) dharmakāya, since enlightened intent free of obscuration proves to be the primordial unity of basic space and timeless awareness;
(2) sambhogakāya, since that unity manifests (to the vast retinues of those who are spiritually mature) as being endowed with fivefold certainty;
(3) nirmāṇakāya, since it manifests to the vast retinues of those who are spiritually motivated;
(4) abhisambodhikāya, from the perspective of the foregoing three dimensions being distinct in their manifestation; and
(5) vajrakāya, from the perspective of their being indivisible.
One might ask, “Are these identical or distinct from one another?” While the five kāyas are identical in essence as expressions of spontaneous presence, [4.219.a] they are distinct in the sense that this reality manifests as five kāyas from the standpoint of the specific qualities of enlightenment; this similar to the moon in the sky and its reflections in water.
The abhisambodhikāya and vajrakāya are kāyas in the purely nominal sense, for they are merely assigned from the standpoint of certain attributes; it is definite that there are three kāyas in the true sense of the term. Of these three, one should understand that dharmakāya is assigned on the basis of the enlightened intent that is for one’s own benefit, while the two rūpakāyas are assigned on the basis of the deeds that are for the benefit of others.

Once one has realized the nature of being that is already free of all limitless adventitious obscurations without these having to be eliminated, there is the full experience of the basis of experience that is the true ground of being;[1019] this is timeless awareness as the basic space of phenomena. At that point, the transmuted analogue of the basis of ordinary experience as true linkage[1020] is a lucid yet nonconceptual state that serves as the basis for the remaining three aspects of timeless awareness; this is mirrorlike timeless awareness. The transmuted analogue of the afflictive aspect of consciousness is the absence of any value judgment, any division into better or worse; this is timeless awareness as equalness. The transmuted analogue of conceptual mind is knowledge of all that can be known throughout the three times, as clear and distinct as the petals of a lotus; this is discerning timeless awareness. The transmuted analogue of the five sensory avenues is the unhindered quality of the enactment of deeds that benefit beings; this is timeless awareness as ensured fulfillment. The Detailed Array states:
Timeless awareness as emptiness[1021] is insubstantial;
mirrorlike timeless awareness is nonconceptual;
timeless awareness as equalness has no division into better or worse;
all-discerning timeless awareness is unconfused and lucid;
the constancy of ensured fulfillment is the consummation.[1022]

These twenty-five factors entailed in the fruition state, moreover, arise as various aspects of the qualities of the “sixth victorious one” (that is, the totality of the five kāyas) and can be summarized as the qualities of that totality.

There is equalness with buddhas and freedom within basic space.
There is spontaneous presence in supreme suchness.[1023]
And the Three Stages states:
Since the qualities of the fruition state are spontaneously present,
they manifest like the wish-fulfilling gem.[1024]

Once one’s own benefit has been accomplished as just described, there comes benefit for others. As to the way in which one perceives those to be guided with innate compassion, in this tradition no denial is made (“Timeless awareness can be interrupted”), nor any exaggeration (“Timeless awareness is an uninterrupted entity”). Rather, the very essence of being itself is free of the limitations of either of these two extremes and is the mode that accounts for perception taking place in a naturally lucid, yet nonconceptual, manner. The tantra states:
Emptiness, while having no identity, is timeless knowing, the enlightened mind of self-knowing awareness,
a masterful state of mindfulness without anything to be focused on or anything to focus.[1025]
According to Lord Dropukpa’s interpretation,[1026] there are, in fact, three modes of perception. He describes these three as follows: (1) the mode of perception that is none other than basic space, also termed “timeless awareness of the actual nature of things, just as it is”; (2) the mode of perception that is none other than timeless awareness, also termed “timeless awareness of things in all their multiplicity”; (3) the mode of perception that is the inseparability of basic space and timeless awareness, also termed “timeless awareness that is aware within the inseparable union of the actual nature of things and things in all their multiplicity.”
As for the ways in which innate compassion is aroused once such perception has taken place, the Three Stages describes four:
It manifests in that it occurs as an ever-present flow, a natural force,
an invoked presence, or in response to an object.[1027]
Innate compassion as an ever-present flow is comparable to the flow of a river; innate compassion as a natural force is comparable to the sun and its rays; [4.220.a] innate compassion as a presence that is invoked through prayer is comparable to a compassionate person’s reaction when approached by a beggar; and innate compassion in response to an object is comparable to a wise person’s reaction upon seeing someone committing a wrongful action.
Once innate compassion has been aroused in these four ways, the way in which deeds are then enacted to benefit beings is comparable to the function of a precious wish-fulfilling gem. To use this analogy, when one polishes such a precious gem and shows it honor, one’s wants and needs are satisfied to the degree that one’s personal merit allows, although the gem has no concepts, makes no effort, and is not partial or prejudiced. The consummate enlightened intent of victorious ones is similarly free of the limitations of ordinary existence and nonexistence, and therefore constitutes the dimension of the very essence of being, free of being naïvely affirmed or denied, which manifests in myriad ways, in harmony with the minds of those to be guided, acting in a nonconceptual and spontaneously present way that ensures uninterrupted benefit for beings.

In order for one to develop a more precise comprehension of the distinctions between the cause-based approach and the fruition-based approach, the following points are to be examined concerning the distinctions between the interpretations of buddhahood that are to be found in the explanations according to the sūtra and tantra traditions. As for dharmakāya, these distinctions are threefold: its essence; its characteristics; and its blessing.
As to the first of these distinctions, the interpretation of dharmakāya in the dialectical approach is that it constitutes emptiness free of elaboration; this is compared to space. As the Entrance into the Middle Way states:
Once the dry tinder of all that is knowable, without exception,
has been burnt up, that peace is the dharmakāya of the victorious ones.
At that point, there is no origin and no cessation.
The kāyas ensure that the cessation of ordinary mind is fully evident.[1028]
The interpretation of dharmakāya in the tantric tradition is that it constitutes what is the nature of basic space and timeless awareness, emptiness and manifestation in primordial unity. As the extensive version of the tantra the Web of Magical Display states:
The things of the animate and inanimate world,
even in manifesting, do not exist as substantial entities.[1029] [4.220.b]
As to the second of these distinctions, the interpretation of dharmakāya in the dialectical approach tends toward the extreme of emptiness, but the interpretation of dharmakāya in the tantric tradition does not tend toward the extreme of either naïve affirmation or nihilistic denial since it is held to constitute the nondual unity of manifestation and emptiness.
As to the third of these distinctions, the interpretation of dharmakāya in the dialectical approach is that no blessings other than those of the two rūpakāyas proceed from it, but the interpretation of dharmakāya in the tantric tradition is that from the blessing of basic space and timeless awareness (that is, emptiness and manifestation) in primordial unity come all manner of developments, such as the five kāyas.

As for sambhogakāya, these distinctions are twofold. Concerning the distinctions regarding what can be experienced, the interpretation of sambhogakāya in the dialectical approach is that while it can experience all that is positive, it cannot experience what is negative. The interpretation of sambhogakāya in the tantric tradition, however, is that it can experience both.
Concerning the distinctions regarding the means that allow such experience, the interpretation of the dialectical approach is that there are no means for there to be experience of what is negative, but the interpretation in the tantric tradition, however, is that there are means for both positive and negative to be experienced.

As for nirmāṇakāya, these distinctions are twofold. Concerning the distinctions regarding those to be guided, the interpretation of nirmāṇakāya in the dialectical approach is that while it can guide those whose character is positive, it cannot guide those whose character is negative. The interpretation of nirmāṇakāya in the tantric tradition, however, is that it entertains no bias concerning those to be guided.
Concerning the distinctions regarding the means of guiding, the interpretation of nirmāṇakāya in the cause-based dialectical approach is that there are no means to guide those whose character is negative, but the interpretation of nirmāṇakāya in the tantric tradition, however, is that it possesses the means to guide both those whose character is positive and those whose character is negative.
The foregoing distinctions between the dialectical and the tantric traditions were discussed by the great Gyalwa Yungtön[1030] in his analyses, which were famed as being held in high esteem by his learned contemporaries. [4.221.a]
Furthermore, dharmakāya is distinguished by utterly unchanging and supreme bliss. Sambhogakāya, endowed with fivefold certainty, is such that its pure realms and teachers and retinues are not subsumed within the realm of externals, but rather are all awareness’s own natural manifestations, spontaneously present within the supreme state of utter lucidity that is the ground of being. With the gaining of mastery, through the four modes of guiding,[1031] over any and every aspect of the entire range of the four kinds of enlightened activity, nirmāṇakāya entails command over the deeds that benefit those to be guided.[1032] As well, the following distinction applies to sambhogakāya and nirmāṇakāya: in the interpretation of the dialectical approach, these two rūpakāyas are held to be produced by causes and conditions, while in the interpretation of the tantric tradition, the rūpakāyas are not produced by causes and conditions. For example, the extensive version of the tantra states:
…because they do not rely on causes and conditions,…[1033]
There are other distinctions discussed by the great learned and accomplished masters of the Early Translation School.

In the tradition of the vajra pinnacle (that is, the Great Perfection approach of utter lucidity), distinct modes of freedom are described, according to some twenty-one levels of acumen. The twenty-one levels are as discussed in the following passage from the great tantra Naturally Arising Awareness:
Acumen is taught to be of three kinds: higher, middling, and lesser. The higher kind has seven levels: the lesser degree of the higher, the middling degree of the higher, the higher degree of the higher, the excellent degree of the higher, the sublime degree of the higher, the pinnacle degree of the higher, and the ultimate consummation of the higher. Such are the divisions of the higher kind of acumen. On each of these levels, furthermore, one experiences a specific way in which perception takes place, a specific way in which the scope of timeless awareness unfolds,[1034] [4.221.b] a specific measure of the realization involved, a specific way in which visions unfold, a specific occasion for understanding,[1035] and a specific way in which awareness views reality.[1036] One thus gains stability in the experiences of each specific level.
The middling kind also has seven levels: the lesser degree of the middling, the middling degree of the middling, the higher degree of the middling, the excellent degree of the middling, the sublime degree of the middling, the pinnacle degree of the middling, and the ultimate consummation of the middling. Such are the divisions of the middling kind.[1037]
The lesser kind also has seven levels: the lesser degree of the lesser, the middling degree of the lesser, the higher degree of the lesser, the sublime degree of the lesser, the excellent degree of the lesser,[1038] the pinnacle degree of the lesser, and the attainment of the summit of the lesser.[1039]

Those of the lowest degree of lesser acumen have very little diligence, and so even though they may gain a glimpse of the doorway to the direct experience of reality, their practice is one of establishing predilections; they lack the indwelling confidence born from some measure of freedom. Although they experience the intermediate state of the actual nature of phenomena, they do not recognize its significance, and so experience the intermediate state of becoming as simply the confusing images of a dreamlike state.[1040] Due to the blessing of truth (which is to say, the actual nature of phenomena), their karmic tendencies have carried over to this point, and they are born into naturally occurring nirmāṇakāya pure realms, such as Abhirati.[1041] There they see the faces of tathāgatas, hear their teachings, receive empowerments and spiritual transmissions, and so are inspired. They become completely free of all the bonds of afflictive states and awaken to enlightenment on the primordial level of freedom. Naturally Arising Awareness states:
For ordinary beings who have perceived the truth
(even though true realization may not have awakened in them),
final freedom is gained by abiding in nirmāṇakāya pure realms throughout the ten directions.[1042]
And from the same source: [4.222.a]
For those with the lowest degree of the lower kind of acumen, having abided for twenty-one days,[1043] they then encounter a process involving spontaneously present visions (specifically, a process involving the impure avenue of samsaric experience) and abide in nirmāṇakāya pure realms throughout the ten directions. There, without any further intermediate state, they awaken to buddhahood in the true sense of the term.[1044]
These pure realms manifest in ways that resemble those of naturally occurring sambhogakāya pure realms. One perceives oneself in the center, surrounded in the four cardinal directions by peaceful forms, with a wrathful realm directly above and in front of one. All this arises naturally through the blessings of Samantabhadra Vajradhara. Among these realms, one is born into whichever one accords with one’s spiritual potential and aspirations. There one is brought to spiritual maturity, so that when one beholds the universe arrayed in the space in front of one as a wrathful realm, the blessing of this experience completely refines away cognitive obscurations; one awakens to manifest enlightenment on the level of original purity.

Those whose acumen and diligence are of a middling kind, but who still have not gained the primordial level of freedom in this lifetime, experience the intermediate state of the actual nature of phenomena through a fourfold process of dissolution. When eight modes of arising, six states of recollection, levels of deeper discernment, powers of complete recall, and states of meditative absorption ensue, they recall spiritual instructions that concern the three modes. Of the twenty-one levels of acumen, theirs are the remaining twenty,[1045] and in accord with their respective levels, they experience a progression of “days” of meditative stability and gain freedom through eight modes of dissolution, thus reaching the ultimate goal.
As for this fourfold process of dissolution: (1) initially, as space dissolves into utter lucidity,[1046] one experiences the utterly lucid vision of the actual nature of phenomena, radiating the five colors of the light of timeless awareness; [4.222.b] (2) as utter lucidity dissolves into primordial unity, pure awareness suffuses light and light suffuses pure awareness; (3) as primordial unity dissolves into timeless awareness, one gains freedom from fixation on the seeming self associated with the mind-body aggregates, the physical obstruction of the elements, and afflictive states (both obvious and subtle), and the visions of fourfold timeless awareness[1047] arise; (4) as timeless awareness dissolves into spontaneous presence, the visions of timeless awareness are resolved within their true nature, and all the experiences of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa arise as eight modes of arising. The Conjunction of Sun and Moon states:
Then one’s consciousness dissolves into the light above one, and one experiences the eight modes of arising. At that point, one perceives the visions of wrathful sambhogakāya deities below one.
One might ask, “What are these eight modes of arising?”
There is arising as innate compassion, and so saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are not divorced from one another.
There is arising as light, and so all manifest appearances are expressions of one’s inner experience of lucidity.
There is arising as enlightened embodiment, and so one does not become lost in externalizing the objects of one’s knowledge.
There is arising as timeless awareness, and so all manifest appearances are experienced as unobstructed.
There is arising as nonduality, and so one’s consciousness abides one-pointedly.
There is arising as a freedom from extremes, and so one is not caught in any extreme whatsoever.
There is the arising of manifest appearances as the impure avenue of saṃsāra, and so the source of conditioned existence is not blocked off.
And there is the arising of appearances as the pure avenue of timeless awareness, and so one is connected with the actual nature of phenomena.[1048]
It is at that point that one should recall the sublime skillful means that allow for no turning back, like an arrow shot from the bow of a champion archer.[1049]
While these visions are taking place, some fourteen qualities come into play, among which are the six states of recollection. The source just cited states:
At that point, the six states of recollection also arise.
There is recollection of the deity, and so at that very moment one beholds the presence of one’s chosen deity.
There is recollection of the spiritual path, and so one gains the mastery to experience the actual nature of phenomena in the intermediate state after death.
There is recollection of alternative states of rebirth, and so those of lesser acumen are inspired to attain naturally occurring nirmāṇakāya pure realms.
There is recollection of states of meditative stability, and so one abides for five “days” in meditative stability. [4.223.a]
There is recollection of the pith instructions of one’s gurus, and so one can appreciate one’s perceptions of apparent phenomena in a state of nonduality.
And there is recollection of the view, and so there is recognition, as though one were simply encountering a person one already knew from before.[1050]
As for the six levels of deeper discernment, the same source states:
Once the foregoing has arisen, a child of spiritual heritage experiences the six levels of deeper discernment.[1051]
This statement means that one experiences six degrees of each of six levels of deeper discernment: one’s sense faculties and one’s mind become pliable, one’s sublime intelligence gains in power, one experiences the completely pure perception of timeless awareness, one unerringly perceives the actual nature of phenomena, and one unerringly perceives the sublime intelligence of the buddhas. It is said that if these states are analyzed in further detail, there are some 134.
As for the powers of complete recall, the same source states:
At that point the powers of complete recall also awaken in one’s stream of awareness. All phenomena from one’s past arise simultaneously in one’s experience. Similarly, since phenomena that one has never before perceived also arise, this is termed “the intermediate state of the actual nature of phenomena.”[1052]
As for the ongoing states of meditative absorption, moreover, the same source states:
Ongoing states of meditative absorption arise naturally in one’s stream of awareness, and so negative thoughts never occur.[1053]
There are three pith instructions concerning the key point of the state of freedom:
(1) the advice for recognizing the visions of the actual nature of phenomena to be awareness’s own natural manifestations (the analogy is that of a child climbing into its mother’s lap[1054]);
(2) subsequent to the foregoing recognition, the spiritual instruction on not straying for a single instant from a natural state of meditative stability in the immediacy of one’s experience (the analogy is that of using a golden probe[1055]);
(3) the pith instruction on never turning back once one has gained freedom in original purity, which is one’s natural state in the immediacy of abiding in meditative stability (the analogy is that of an arrow shot from a champion archer’s bow).
By recalling these instructions, those whose acumen is the ultimate consummation of the higher kind gain freedom in three instants; those whose acumen is the pinnacle degree of the higher kind, in a single “day”; [4.223.b] those whose acumen is the middling degree of the lesser kind, in nineteen “days.” Having gained freedom, they send forth emanations, until finally the visions of spontaneous presence resolve within the inner basic space of original purity, like the rays shining from a crystal drawing back into it.[1056] This is a process of eight modes of dissolution. Naturally Arising Awareness states:
Ah, friends! When one’s true nature becomes the predominant factor in the visions of spontaneous presence, and one directly perceives the truth, one should recognize the eight modes of dissolution.
Innate compassion dissolves into innate compassion; this is analogous to the sun’s rays resolving back into it as it sets.[1057]
Timeless awareness dissolves into timeless awareness; this is analogous to a child’s climbing into its mother’s lap.
Light dissolves into light; this is analogous to a rainbow’s fading in the sky.
Enlightened embodiment dissolves into enlightened ebodiment; this is analogous to the body of a vase.[1058]
Nonduality dissolves into nonduality; this is analogous to one river’s flowing into another.
Freedom from extremes dissolves into freedom from extremes; this is analogous to space’s blending with space.
The pure avenue of timeless awareness dissolves into original purity; this is analogous to a snow lion’s taking a glacier as its territory.
The impure avenue dissolves into the pure avenue of timeless awareness; this is analogous to releasing the guy cord to collapse a tent.[1059]

Those whose acumen, personal lot, and diligence are the ultimate consummation of the higher kind reach the primordial ground of freedom in this very lifetime.
As an indication of this, in certain cases their physical bodies are dispersed into subatomic particles, and so the physical aggregates disintegrate. This is comparable to what occurs when a ḍākinī passes away, leaving no remains that anyone can see. It is an indication that one has awakened to buddhahood without any intermediate state occurring after death.
In other cases, in order to bring others to the teachings, a sublime yogic practitioner may pass away as a mass of light in the sky, which everyone can see and which emits sounds and rays of light. [4.224.a] This is comparable to cases in which masters of awareness have ascended bodily, as everyone sees them going higher and higher up into space, accompanied by sounds and rays of light. It is an indication that such a practitioner can bring benefit to beings through an inconceivable number of emanations in an inconceivable number of worlds.
As to the way in which yogic practitioners whose spiritual practice is consummate die, it is comparable to the way in which huge roaring fires die out quite naturally when the firewood that is the causal factor is exhausted. In an analogous way, for these yogic practitioners the “fuel” that has been exhausted is that of the elements (which are the causal factors), and so the mind-body aggregates (which are the conditioning factors) have ceased to be experienced as substantial entities. This is an indication that the afflictive states have been freed into their natural state.
There are other cases in which yogic practitioners experience an atemporal merging with the level of original purity when their physical body disintegrates into subatomic particles, like a vase being shattered: this is the “spacelike” way of dying. The sensation of having a physical body creates an impression comparable to that of a clay vase with space trapped inside it. One’s realization of original purity is focused in the heart center of utter lucidity within that body. When a clay vase is shattered, the space outside the vase and the space inside it merge, so that one can no longer distinguish between them. In an analogous way, one awakens to buddhahood without any further distinction of “this is the physical body that was reduced to subatomic particles” versus “this is the pure awareness that was within that body.” This is an indication that one has gained freedom without obstruction on the level of original purity.
The foregoing alternatives pertain to one reaching the final goal of a secret path of practice: that of trekchö, or “cutting through seeming solidity,”[1060] in the first and last cases, and that of tögal, or “surpassing the pinnacle,”[1061] in the middle two cases. Through the practice of cutting through seeming solidity, one’s physical body is dispersed into subatomic particles, while one’s mind is dispersed into its true nature, and one gains freedom on the level of original purity. Through the practice of surpassing the pinnacle, the specific distinction is that while one’s body is dispersed into subatomic particles, it is rendered lucid as a form of light, giving one control over birth and further involvement; reemerging into the enlightened embodiment of “supreme transference,”[1062] one continues to act for the sake of beings.
In such cases as the foregoing, one has transcended view and meditation, so that spiritual teachings no longer have any effect, positive or negative, and one experiences awareness’s own natural manifestations as originally pure and spontaneously present, and the level of freedom is experienced as an innate attribute. [4.224.b] This is because freedom is gained through spontaneous presence resolving into the expanse of original purity.
Although the foregoing entail distinct levels of acumen (due to the various ways in which one trains on the spiritual path), the results are essentially the identical fruition, that of the secret embrace of precious dharmakāya that is endowed with twofold purity. This is analogous to the space inside various containers being subsumed within the same realm of space, or different rivers merging as one in the same ocean.

At whatever point one experiences pure awareness entirely free of all adventitious distortions, dharmakāya, completely pure by nature, becomes fully evident. One awakens to manifest enlightenment within the basic space that is the inseparability of the kāyas and timeless awareness and manifests in worlds throughout the furthest reaches of the ten directions, as though a whole array of lamps were being lit; that is, without straying from dharmakāya, sambhogakāya and nirmāṇakāya manifestations, together with the enlightened activities they entail, ensure that the two kinds of benefit[1063] are spontaneously accomplished. This is the consummate fruition in this approach.
The three kāyas are, in essence, as follows: they serve as “embodiments,” or underlying bases, for the qualities of buddhahood. Dharmakāya, in essence, is supreme original purity since it is free of being anything that could be imagined or verbalized. Sambhogakāya, in essence, is supreme spontaneous presence since it is natural lucidity free of any limiting conceptual framework. Nirmāṇakāya, in essence, is the occurrence of whatever serves to guide beings in any way necessary since it is the aspect that is the basis for the expression of innate compassion.

As for those to be guided, those whose experience is one of complete and innate purity are those to be guided by dharmakāya, for their pure awareness is beyond vacillation or effort. Those to be guided by sambhogakāya are the hosts of those in the center and retinue who are awareness’s own natural manifestations. Those to be guided by nirmāṇakāya are the ordinary beings in their natural abodes within the six classes.
All of these situations, furthermore, involve what by nature constitutes fivefold excellence. The Heaped Jewels states:
Due to dharmakāya, the innate purity underlying all ordinary reifying perceptions,
the teachings that involve no conceptual elaboration,
which emerge from enlightened mind, and the natural resolution that cannot be confined to specific limits
are communicated through speech that involves no ordinary characteristics,
within the immeasurable mansion of unelaborated innate purity,
to the retinue that manifests as inseparable from being itself.
Without having been spoken, without being spoken,
these teachings are revealed within the supreme state of equalness.
Due to sambhogakāya, the pure state of innate lucidity,
the teachings that constitute purity that is not some substantial entity,
which emerge from enlightened mind,
endowed with the five aspects of timeless awareness,
are communicated through speech that is supreme,
unelaborate bliss within the immeasurable mansion of completely pure light of five colors,
to the retinue of the family types of the five kāyas.
Completely pure rays of light spread forth from the tongue that reveals these teachings, unspoken,
in a supreme and naturally occurring state as six naturally occurring syllables.
Due to nirmāṇakāya, which involves no obsessive fixations,
all the teachings that are appropriate to any being’s level of acumen,
which emerge from enlightened mind, the naturally lucid state of recall,
are communicated through speech that involves the elaboration of language within the environments of the spiritual teachings,
the specific realms of those to be guided,
to those fortunate beings of the six classes whose karmic predispositions have been awakened.
Teachings spread forth from the tongue that is not a physical organ,
but that reveals these teachings as a succession of spiritual approaches.[1065]

The constancy of dharmakāya lies in an unwavering state free of freedom from elaboration; the constancy of sambhogakāya, in natural lucidity expressed in the major and minor marks of perfect form; and the constancy of nirmāṇakāya, in ensuring that two kinds of benefit are spontaneously accomplished. These constitute the perfection of all that is truly meaningful (without entailing any conceptual process) that abides spontaneously present within the basic space of dharmakāya, which is without transition or change.

As for this analysis, each of the three kāyas is analyzed into a fivefold continuum of the inexhaustible adornment of being, which means that, generally speaking, there are fifteen categories of enlightened being. As the source tantra, the Reverberation of Sound, states:
As for dharmakāya, it is enlightened form, speech,
mind, qualities, and activity.
Enlightened form is by nature empty, clear,
and beyond ordinary characterization.
Enlightened speech is free of terms, words, and labels
and is inexpressible, beyond discussion.
Enlightened mind entails no thought or mental stirring and is beyond proliferating thoughts and analysis.
The qualities of enlightenment neither increase nor deteriorate.
They pervade basic space and timeless awareness and are by nature uncontrived.
Enlightened activity is nonoccurring, unborn, automatic, and unceasing,
is not caused to happen, and does not cause anything to happen. [4.226.b]
For the sambhogakāya, as well, there are the five facets
of form, speech, mind, qualities, and activity.
Enlightened form is apparent yet has no self-nature,
and awareness permeates both what is illuminated and what illuminates.
Enlightened speech is naturally occurring, naturally manifest,
an ongoing process of proliferation and resolution.
Enlightened mind is uninterrupted vision,
the dynamic quality of sublime intelligence, and enlightened intent.
The qualities of enlightenment consist of the perfection of the major and minor marks,
as well as the perfection of lucid enlightened intent and deeper levels of discernment.
Enlightened activities develop on outer, inner,
and secret levels of the wheel of spiritual teachings.
To the buddhas of the specific family types,
as well as to bodhisattvas,
these facets proliferate from the buddhas’ “naturally occurring tongues.”
They reveal themselves to the retinue by virtue of their own essence.
Nirmāṇakāya, moreover, is fivefold:
enlightened form, speech, mind, qualities, and activity.
Enlightened form, with the major and marks of perfection,
emanates in a body in whatever way necessary to guide those who are to be guided.
The words of enlightened speech are elegant,
with sixty melodious qualities.
Enlightened mind abides as the enlightened intent to benefit both oneself and others and is timeless awareness of the knowable.
The qualities of enlightenment are the perfection of sublime intelligence.
Enlightened activity is the perfection of all deeds without exception,
on outer, inner, and secret levels.
These abide as fivefold excellence.[1066]

As for the analysis in detail of the nature of the distinct expressions of the kāyas, they can be analyzed into nine categories: the dharmakāya aspect of dharmakāya, the sambhogakāya aspect of dharmakāya, the nirmāṇakāya aspect of dharmakāya, and so on. Each of these nine can be further analyzed into six factors: the respective pure realm, environment, meditative absorption (that is, characteristic), retinue, teaching, and occasion. Let us consider each of these in turn:[1067]
In the first place:
(1) For the dharmakāya aspect of dharmakāya, the pure realm is inconceivable to the ordinary mind. [4.227.a] The environment is the actual nature of phenomena, which transcends any context in which it could be imagined. The meditative absorption is the supreme state that never strays from that nature. The retinue is the myriad array that by nature is none other than dharmakāya. The teaching is the actual nature of phenomena, which is inexpressible. The occasion is that of the actual nature of phenomena, which is without any change whatsoever.
(2) For the sambhogakāya aspect of dharmakāya, the pure realm is immaculate, free of any flaw. The environment is that in which the ordinary mind’s concepts have been eradicated. The meditative absorption is that in which ordinary mind and mental events are purified within basic space. The retinue is emptiness, which allows for the appearance of awareness’s own natural manifestations. The teaching is that of the complete purity underlying any conceptual frame of reference. The occasion is that which cannot be imputed conceptually.
(3) For the nirmāṇakāya aspect of dharmakāya, the pure realm is emptiness, which is in no way restricted. The environment is that which serves as the ground from which everything arises. The meditative absorption is that of innate lucidity within a supreme unceasing state. The retinue consists of buddhas indivisible from this aspect and the “host” of a vast range of expressions of timeless awareness. The teaching is the uncontrived nature of being. The occasion is the overt manifestation of the heart essence of being as enlightenment.
In the second place:
(4) The dharmakāya aspect of sambhogakāya is the form of Vairocana known as Himasāgara,[1068] whose presence manifests as transparent inwardly if viewed from without and transparent outwardly if viewed from within, who has no front or back, and whose face gazes panoramically in all ten directions. The pure realm is that of mastery over the twenty-one universes held in the palms of Vairocana’s hands, and the environment is the completely pure realm of Ghanavyūha. The retinue is such that it is none other than Vairocana. The teaching is the innate manifestation of naturally occurring awareness. The occasion is that of realization becoming fully evident.
(5) The sambhogakāya aspect of sambhogakāya is the principal buddhas of the specific family types, whose attributes are such that they have distinctions that are separate from their essence, yet are identical in nature.[1069] The pure realms are the innumerable maṇḍalas of the specific families. The environment is Akaniṣṭha, the pinnacle pure realm. The retinues consist of the five families of the respective buddhas. The teaching is that of appreciating the richness of the five aspects of timeless awareness as qualities of knowing. The occasion is that of manifest appearances forming and evolving. [4.227.b]
(6) The nirmāṇakāya aspects of sambhogakāya are the five principal buddhas of the specific families and their retinues. Their attributes are such that they are apparent yet have no independent nature, that is, they are clearly evident, yet entail no concepts. The pure realms of these aspect are enjoyed by countless hundreds of thousands of gods and goddesses. The environment is the realm of Alakavati, the spontaneous presence of the five aspects of timeless awareness. The retinues consists of countless buddhas and bodhisattvas. The occasion is that of awareness’s own manifestations becoming apparent.[1070]
In the third place:
(7) The dharmakāya aspect of nirmāṇakāya is the glorious and supreme Vajradhara, whose attributes constitute the commitment to manifest in physical form through any of the four modes of rebirth[1071] and to complete the thirty-six deeds of enlightened beings.[1072] The pure realm is a Mahābrahma realm,[1073] consisting of billions of three-thousandfold universes surrounding Vajradhara. The environment is Metok Pema Khatong Denpa [Endowed with a Thousand Lotuses]. The retinue consists of beings born through any of the four modes of rebirth. The teaching is the Reverberation of Sound, the source of all categories of the teachings. The occasion is the time when people live for countless years.
(8) The sambhogakāya aspect of nirmāṇakāya is the glorious Vajrasattva. The pure realm is that of a billion three-thousandfold universes. The environment is in harmony with the perceptions of those to be guided. The retinue consists of bodhisattvas on the eight level of realization. The teaching is the spiritual approach that concerns the definitive meaning of the teachings. The occasion is unpredictable.
(9) The nirmāṇakāya aspect of nirmāṇakāya was Śākyamuni, whose attributes consisted of engaging in the twelve great deeds, such as leaving home to become a homeless renunciate. The realm over which this aspect held sway was that of a single greater order universe, a three-thousandfold universe of long-endured suffering, consisting of a billion worlds such as our own human realm and more. The environment included such places as Vulture Peak.[1074] The ordinary retinue consisted of fours groups: fully ordained monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen; the extraordinary retinue was varied, consisting of indescribably countless numbers of great bodhisattvas; [4.228.a] the inconsistent retinue consisted of countless numbers of gods, humans, demigods, and other beings. The teaching consisted of a variety of spiritual approaches, oriented toward both causes and results. The occasions were opportunities to eradicate doubt with total certainty, which is to say, occasions to ensure benefit for individual beings to be guided.

Timeless awareness as dharmakāya, abiding as the ground of being, is comparable to the orb of the sun (or a globe of crystal), resting in its natural place, in abiding as the ground from which everything arises, that is, the unity of emptiness and lucidity. Timeless awareness as both sambhogakāya and nirmāṇakāya is comparable to the sun’s rays in serving as the ground from which everything arises.
There is, moreover, the expression “timeless awareness abiding as threefold.” Timeless awareness as the originally pure essence of being, beyond the limitations of conceptual elaboration and description, is comparable to a transparent globe of crystal. Timeless awareness as the spontaneously present nature of being is the ground from which arise the qualities of enlightenment that are its manifest aspects; other than simply constituting the most subtle state of profound lucidity, [4.228.b] it does not exist as some substantial thing distinct from anything else. Timeless awareness as the all-pervasive responsiveness of being[1075] is unceasing as the ground from which everything arises due to the dynamic energy of the essence of being; it abides as the simple aspect of awareness that is not yet actually engaging in specific objects of consciousness.
If timeless awareness existed in dharmakāya in some more obvious way, this would mean that it was substantial and could be characterized in ordinary ways, and so it would not follow that it could be characterized as peace free of such elaboration. But if timeless awareness were not present as that aspect of profound lucidity that serves as the ground from which everything arises, this would mean that there was an inert void, like blank space. Instead, as an alternative to both of these extremes, there is what is termed “subtle timeless awareness, profoundly lucid, abiding in its natural place of rest as the ground from which everything arises.”

Due to sambhogakāya (that is, timeless awareness as it exhibits attributes), there is the manifestation of five colors of light. Alternatively, it could be said that since timeless awareness is comparable to a mirror, it presents forms that constitute the reflections of the perfection of that awareness. And so it exhibits attributes, distinctly and clearly.
If we analyze this timeless awareness, five aspects can be distinguished, and if each of these is analyzed into five further aspects, this gives a total of twenty-five aspects. These aspects, moreover, constitute the inseparability of three factors: emptiness as originally pure basic space (the ground of freedom); the ground of being that is the innate radiance of naturally lucid timeless awareness; and the basic space of pure cognizing awareness.
(1) This inseparability constitutes timeless awareness as the basic space of phenomena. In analyzing this, Naturally Arising Awareness states:
This has five aspects: two of these aspects are timeless awareness as basic space and timeless awareness as the basic space of phenomena; two more are timeless awareness as the complete purity of basic space and timeless awareness as the supremacy of basic space; and there is timeless awareness as the nonduality of everything in basic space.[1076]
(2) As for pure awareness, empty yet lucid, the way in which it is arises is lucid as an unimpeded avenue of experience; this is mirrorlike timeless awareness. In analyzing this, Naturally Arising Awareness states:
This has five aspects: two of these aspects are timeless awareness that is like a mirror and timeless awareness that is like a supreme mirror; two more are timeless awareness as nonconceptual lucidity and timeless awareness as nonconceptual limpidity; and there is timeless awareness as supreme lucidity without reifying concepts.[1077] [4.229.a]
(3) There is a supreme equalness of timeless freedom within the basic space of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, which are to be experienced as equal. Within this equalness, the conditioning factors of that equalness are the three avenues of enlightened form, speech, and mind, which abide as the supreme equalness of three aspects (that is, the essence, nature, and responsiveness of being) such that they are not subject to restrictions or extremes. This is timeless awareness of equalness. In analyzing this, the foregoing source states:
This has five aspects: two of these aspects are timeless awareness of equalness and timeless awareness of unceasing equalness; two more are timeless awareness of the equalness of an unwavering state and timeless awareness of the equalness of an unceasing state; and there is timeless awareness of equalness that is not limited in any way whatsoever.[1078]
(4) The direct realization of all phenomena in their distinctness is discerning timeless awareness. In analyzing this, the foregoing source states:
This has five aspects: two of these aspects are discerning timeless awareness and timeless awareness that analyzes all objects of experience with extreme precision; two more are timeless awareness that constitutes realization born in the moment and timeless awareness that ascertains all terminology;[1079] and there is timeless awareness that is realization[1080] not limited to terms and words.[1081]
(5) Once one’s own benefit has been ensured within the scope of pure awareness, benefit for others ensues effortlessly, as spontaneously present as if supplied by a wish-fulfilling gem; this is timeless awareness as spontaneous fulfillment. In analyzing this, the foregoing source states:
This has five aspects: two of these aspects are timeless awareness as spontaneous fulfillment and timeless awareness that enacts all that is to be done; two more are timeless awareness that is not fixated on what is to be done and timeless awareness that relinquishes what is to be done; and there is timeless awareness that eradicates all false assumptions.[1082]
The terms for these individual aspects, as well as the significance, essence, and other topics, are discussed in detail in the same tantra.

Nirmāṇakāya, all-pervasive timeless awareness, manifests by harmonious accommodation to the individual receptivity of those to be guided, just as the reflection of the moon in water arises in accord with the context in which it occurs. Nirmāṇakāya is not like the reflection of some inanimate material object, for it spontaneously ensures benefit for beings through two aspects of timeless awareness. [4.229.b]
Knowing reality just as it is constitutes realization of the indisputable essence of phenomena and the ultimate level of truth, and so reveals the actual nature of phenomena to be (like space) free of origin, cessation, or elaboration. Knowing things in all their multiplicity constitutes realization of the relative level of truth (which is to say, the distinct forms phenomena take) and so, considering objects in the phenomenal world in light of the eight analogies for illusoriness,[1083] it addresses such things as levels of acumen, spiritual teachings, karmic causality, and spiritual paths.
If we analyze these, knowing reality just as it is entails both knowing, just as it is, the way in which objects that manifest in the phenomenal world abide, and knowing, just as it is,[1084] the way in which emptiness abides as the actual nature of phenomena. This is similar to knowing the properties of a water lily (its blue color, for example) as well as knowing the lily itself. Knowing things in all their multiplicity entails knowing all the phenomena that can be evaluated by a nirmāṇakāya, both the pure range of phenomena that pertain to buddhas and the impure range of phenomena that pertain to ordinary beings. Thus, through analyzing these forms of knowing, we arrive at a total of four aspects.

The state of Samantabhadra, that of perfect enlightenment, is the supreme level of freedom. Let us consider this briefly:
The youthful vase body is distinguished by six distinctive attributes that constitute the consummate qualities of basic space. These attributes are those of: emerging from the ground of being; manifesting within its own true nature; establishing a distinction;[1085] being free in the immediacy of that distinction; not relying on any other circumstance; and abiding in its natural place.
Within the expanse of this supreme, inwardly lucid state of original purity, the kāyas and timeless awareness abide innately as a unity beyond ordinary union or separation. That is to say, one’s own welfare is perfect within basic space.
Further to that, due to the engaging of innate compassion in the situations of those to be guided, [4.230.a] for the welfare of others there is the emergence of awareness’s own natural manifestation as sambhogakāya, ensuring that all of space is filled with a vast range of enlightened embodiments and pure realms, like clouds massing in the sky. The natural dynamic energy of this enlightened activity is to guide beings until saṃsāra is emptied. In pure realms, this is ensured by the “quasi-nirmāṇakāya sambhogakāya,”[1086] and in impure worlds by the emanations that guide beings there, like an array of lamps. This activity, like that of a wish-fulfilling gem or a wish-granting tree, takes place in such a way that it is accomplished spontaneously and without interruption.

The great spiritual helmsmen who appeared in the past in this Land of Snows and founded lineages of spiritual accomplishment are entirely worthy of our highest respect. In later times, there have been those who presumed themselves to be learned and great, and who composed works for the most part in a complicated and very rigid way, using citations from authentic scriptures to support their statements, employing logical argumentation to refute or prove points, [4.230.b] and engaging in a plethora of words to explore the ramifications of their themes. As for the ongoing string of texts they have produced, some adopt a dilettantish perspective, behaving like yaks when they cast about for tufts of grass. Others fall into a biased perspective, holding to their own interpretation and being dogmatic. In either case, they do no justice to the straightforward approach of a nonsectarian appreciation of the Sage’s teachings.
Given that these authors have fallen under the sway of such influences, the vision that is their spiritual birthright has been clouded by the cataracts of their flawed thinking, and their spiritual training has not brought them to maturity in the slightest. Such spiritually immature people, with extremely feeble discernment, have produced trifling works by randomly putting together whatever words and meanings they came across. Such works amount to little more than self-promotion. How could they arouse admiration in those learned people imbued with dynamic intelligence, who delight in the discernment that derives from following the path of logical reasoning? In fact, they could not.
While all that is so, those great beings whose spiritual vision is one of a straightforward and unbiased appreciation of the teachings have composed works in a truly altruistic manner, performing a service that arouses such delight.

Since it is the prattling of fools that is unable to arouse admiration in the learned, one might wonder who would undertake the heavy burden of dedicating themselves to the tiresome task of writing volumes of such babble? In this regard, we live in times when the mere trappings of the Sage’s teachings are being upheld, and a poor excuse for a practitioner as myself, propelled by karma into these circumstances, is a mere shadow who can only boast of having heard these teachings. Where the mainstream traditions of the holy Buddhadharma (of sūtra and tantra, together with the pith instructions they entail) came from in the first place, [4.231.a] who established the various vehicles of spiritual practice, what profound key points these contain, which instruction manuals are major and which are minor, and where interpolations exist or not—if those such as myself remain unaware of even such things as these, how could they have even a partial understanding of the words and meanings that characterize these teachings?
So even though learned people who have undergone great training have no need of this work, I composed it out of an unfeigned altruism, thinking that it would serve to nourish such people as I have just described, by opening the eyes of their intelligence.

The heir of the victorious ones, Śāntideva, said:
I have not spoken here of anything that has not been heard before,
nor have I any skill as a poet.
Therefore, I cannot think that this will benefit others;
I have composed it in order to meditate upon it in my own mind.[1089]
Similarly, I have neither the merit nor the intelligence to reveal anything that has not been told before regarding the traditions of spiritual vehicles or to explain things in some novel and elegant way. Truly holy people are those who have, for their own benefit, reached the pinnacle of sublime intelligence in three ways[1090] and who have, for the benefit of others, illuminated the precious teachings with the blazing radiance of the three activities of explaining, debating, and writing. However, I have not spoken in order to compete with them, driven by some desire to become famous.
But the majority of people nowadays, born in these times of spiritual degeneration, have such a small degree of intelligence and such extremely feeble diligence that they cannot begin to follow the path of hearing and contemplating teachings. Even if, by some chance, they can apply themselves to something positive due to a modicum of faith and intelligence, due to the paucity of those very two causes [4.231.b] it is exceedingly difficult for them to master even some minor secular field of knowledge. So it is plainly evident that they cannot cross to the far shore of the oceanlike expanse of the mainstream Buddhist traditions. I have written this work in order to train my own mind in these fields of knowledge and to be of benefit to others like me, who are of inferior intelligence, by collecting the crucial points of the teachings that will sustain them. I have abridged the words and meanings into a compendium of the methods of all spiritual approaches,[1091] so that if one understands them well, one will be capable of “encompassing all knowledge”[1092] through exercising the untrammeled discernment of one’s intelligence.

Nowadays, those who have read, and are familiar with, a few of the major Buddhist source texts that are well known (dealing with the Madhyamaka philosophy, the Prajñāpāramitā literature, Vinaya, the Abhidharma, and so forth) are cynical about the more common fields of knowledge; they interpret the enlightened intention of the victorious ones through the filter of their own concepts; and they make snap judgments about the profound and definitive secret teachings found in the classes of tantra. They use their minds clumsily, to skirt over the general range of knowledge in the most cursory manner, treating them with disrespect.
Those whose path is one of laboring assiduously with minor secular fields of knowledge (such as Sanskrit grammar, valid cognition, medicine, and astrology) find that the eye of their intelligence is dulled for viewing, just as they are, the Buddha’s excellent teachings in all their vast scope and profound depths—the sūtras and tantras, as well as the commentaries on the enlightened intention of these sources. [4.232.a]
To say nothing of having realized these more common and extraordinary fields of knowledge, as well as their auxiliary subjects in any authentic way, I myself have not gained the confidence that comes from studying and becoming familiar with them to even a partial degree. Nevertheless, in these times of spiritual degeneration Vajradhara has indeed manifested in the forms of my spiritual mentors, and in particular Mañjughoṣa, the sole father of the victorious ones, has taken the forms of two of my masters.[1093] It is due to the kindness of these learned and spiritually accomplished tutors that I have heard many teachings of the sūtras and tantras, of the mainstream traditions of Sarma and Nyingma, and of other spiritual instructions, secular fields of knowledge, and related subjects. My studies have included the works of the great mainstream textual traditions of the holy country of India, the ten great pillars who upheld the lineages of explanation in the Land of Snows, and the masters of the eight great lineages of spiritual accomplishment in this land.[1094] In particular, I have studied the sublime writings that were composed in so excellent a manner by many great and holy masters who have become authorities, including the omniscient Rangjung Dorjé and the eighth lord and their followers;[1095] the king of the dharma, the noble Longchen Rabjam; the hereditary masters of the Sakya school, who were emanations of Mañjuśrī;[1096] the great and venerable master of the Jonang tradition;[1097] and Chökyi Jungné,[1098] an omniscient being in these times of strife.
Having relied on these works, I have composed this work with the intention of benefiting others who are my peers, if only slightly. May anything that derives from this undertaking, contributing to the increase of what is positive, be capable of serving to illuminate the Sage’s flawless teachings for a long time!

With sincere motivation and dedication to my task, I have completed this trifling good work, my intention being to emulate truly holy masters. [4.232.b] Through the power of this undertaking, may countless beings, who are the foundation in whom any and all spiritual teachings take root, enjoy physical and mental happiness and well-being, attaining higher states of rebirth in the shorter term. May they enjoy the increase that comes with spiritual activity, so that they eventually reach the conclusion of the path that leads to the definitive excellence of enlightenment.
On that basis, may the precious teachings of the victorious ones, which are the embodiment of scriptural authority and experiential truth, flourish and last for a long time. May all who embrace the teachings observe the higher training of completely pure discipline, unsullied by a single flaw. Then, may they train themselves through the sublime intelligence that comes from hearing, contemplating, and meditating on teachings. May they thus reach the consummation of the spiritual paths and levels, with their manifest states of realization. With this, may all beings without exception, whose numbers fill space, swiftly attain as one the state that embodies the three kāyas and the five aspects of timeless awareness!
This source verse completely subsumes all the topics covered in this treatise from beginning to end.

With these words, I acknowledge that there may be any number of flaws in this work: there may, for example, be contradictions in the way I express myself in words due to my mind’s falling under the sway of delusion and ignorance; there may be errors due to my misconstruing the meaning of the topics I discuss; and there may be ways in which I have treated especially profound and secret topics with disrespect, however unintentional. In the presence of the Three Jewels and the Three Roots and those learned and accomplished masters who are definitely endowed with spiritual vision and stand as my witnesses, from the depths of my heart I acknowledge and request forbearance for all such flaws. In doing so, I ask that they inspire me to attain the most sublime state of purity and absolution. [4.233.a] I ask that they please grant their blessings in an ongoing flow, to ensure the most auspicious conditions of all that is auspicious—that this treatise, which brings together the quintessential and profound topics found in the mainstream traditions of India and Tibet, will endure as long as the precious teachings of the Sage; to ensure that for that long it will remain uncorrupted; to ensure that it will cast illumination pervasively and without bias, like the shining sun and moon, radiating as a constant source of benefit for all who desire liberation; and to ensure the auspiciousness of fame, so that the positive effects of this treatise’s renown will pervade the three planes of existence.

This treatise was written by me, who has heard many teachings, the positive effect of which has given rise in me to constant faith and pure attitude toward the entire tradition of the Sage’s teachings and those who uphold it, without any sectarian bias. I have been guided by the compassionate embrace of many holy masters, including the lord Maitreya, Tai Situ. I, Karma Ngawang Yönten Gyatso Trinlé Kunchap Pal Zangpo, also known as Lodrö Tayé Pai Dé,[1099] composed this at Kunzang Dechen Ösel Ling, in front of the cliff face of Tsadra Rinchendrak on Devikoṭi, the site of the retreat center associated with Palpung Tupten Chökorling.[1100] May this work bring great benefit to the teachings and to beings.

The teachings are the light of this world,
the complete accomplishment of what is positive and excellent,
victorious over the two extremes.
From the blossoming lotus of my undivided faith in these flow the sweet drops of nectar that nurture and protect me.[1102]
While this will not serve to sustain the learned,
whose stomachs are filled with the nectar of truly excellent explanations,
it may serve as a flutelike melody of my speech,
to inspire the bees—those of less substantial intelligence. [4.233.b]
My vision is too feeble for me to explain the dharma well,
in ways that have not been used before.
My intelligence is too feeble for my explanations to come to terms with the myriad topics encompassed by enlightened intent.
But the explanations I have given herein follow the example of authoritative sources,
not something I made up on my own.
In particular, they are part of an oral tradition that delights the protector Mañjuśrī,
and so are worthy of one’s trust.
People endowed with both merit and intelligence are hard to come by in this world.
Their excellent explanations are like a pile of gems that are not kept polished nowadays.
However, since those who rely even slightly on these gems find that they remove the poverty that hampers liberation,
may this work, which distills the essential worth of their crucial points long be available to intelligent people.
How could one’s vision be flawless when it is clouded by a hundred veils of deep-seated delusion?
Yet because I have looked into all traditions and hold them in my esteem,
it pains me to see those with fanatical adherence to some biased perspective.
While the statements in this work may not please some great beings who hold that their individual interpretations are true,
may it serve as a massing cloudbank of offerings to delight my gurus and the victorious ones and their heirs.
For those whose minds feel only a biased regard, learn herein of the single path to which all the Buddhadharma leads,
like those who, upon having their eyesight restored, behold the sky.
May they drink to their hearts’ content,
imbibing the quintessence of the Buddha’s teachings without sectarian bias,
their throats filled with threefold faith.
May this experience act as an emetic,
purging them of all the poisons of sectarianism,
so that the ocean of the sacred Buddhadharma unfolds for them.
This work does not involve the haughtiness of pedants,
who refute the beliefs of others while asserting their own.
It follows the example set by the truly wise of old, for it illustrates, if only partially,
the incredible avenues of the teachings.
It is a lamp of gem light for those plunged in the darkness of delusion and a treasure trove of nectar for those deprived of studying the teachings.
May they not fall into sectarianism,
and may this precious spiritual source yield to them all that they wish for. [4.234.a]
By gaining unerring insight into the process of interdependent causes, conditions, and results,
may they dispel confusion concerning the ground and path by becoming wise in making moral choices of what to accept and what to reject.
May the golden sun of noble awareness radiate knowledge of all things and an undeluded mastery of skillful means,
shining always in the sky of the spiritual realm,
illuminating the path of the authentic view of reality.
This work is positive at the outset,
for it presents the path of benefit and well-being in the threefold world.
It is positive in the interim,
for it presents the middle way that avoids dualistic extremes,
bringing well-being and excellence when it is followed to the fullest.
It is positive in the end,
for it is the symbolic expression of the unique state of flawless and consummate peace.
May the auspiciousness of this adorn the immeasurable jeweled mansion that lies at the very heart of space,
so that it stands forever in all its magnificence!

This text was composed as a somewhat brief commentary on the source verses entitled the Encompassing of All That Is Knowable, with an emphasis on promoting ease of understanding. It was specifically requested by one who illuminates the entire range of the Sage’s teachings, the omniscient and all-seeing Jamyang Khyentsei Wangpo, who presented me with abundant gifts, first and foremost among these some fine representations of enlightened form, speech, and mind. He bestowed his request on me like a garland of udumvara blossoms coming to rest on the crown of my head.[1103]
I, the author, have also been nurtured by many extraordinary mentors, especially the lord of the world, the Karmapa, and the lord Maitreya, Tai Situ, resting myself in the cool shade of their compassion.[1104] I am but a mere shadow of a well-studied spiritual renunciate, a poor excuse of a practitioner who goes by many names, such as Karma Ngawang Yönten Gyatso Trinlé Kunchap Palzangpo[1105] and Loter Rabga Tsangjung Nyempai Langtsoi Danang[1106] (the name given to me by my Sanskrit tutor). I wrote the commentary, based on my source verses, at the retreat center of Tsadra Rinchen Drak, “the third glorious Devikoṭi,”[1107] the hermitage associated with Palpung Tupten Chökorling, the primary monastic seat of the Kagyü lineage in eastern Tibet. The text was written in a more-or-less continuous period from summer through the next winter.[1108] [4.234.b] The scribe who prepared the entire manuscript was Karma Tashi Özer, who upholds the principles of the Three Compilations and maintains the discipline of his spiritual training in an excellent manner.[1109] The work was finally completed on the morning of the second “day of joy” in the waxing phase of the moon,[1110] when there was a favorable aspect between Jupiter and the constellation Puṣya, during the fourth month of the Wood Rat Year, a most majestic year in the sexagesimal cycle.[1111]
