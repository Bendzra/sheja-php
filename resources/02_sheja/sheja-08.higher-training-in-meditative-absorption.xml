On the basis of sublime intelligence that derives from contemplation, one gains certainty, having put an end to naive assumptions concerning the general and specific characteristics of phenomena, as well as the topics entailed in the profound view.[625]
Once this certainty has been gained, one should put it into practice and apply it in one's ongoing experience through meditation; hence, Book 8 concerns a developmental analysis of the higher training in meditative absorption. This book has four parts, which present: (1) a presentation of the stages of cultivating calm abiding and profound insight, which constitute the common foundations of meditative absorption, (2) a presentation of the specific stages of meditation in the cause-based dialectical approach, (3) a general presentation that emphasizes the tantric approach—that is, the stages of meditation in the secret mantra approach of the Vajrayāna,[626] and (4) a specific presentation that emphasizes the esoteric instructions.[627] [3.167a]

Thus, the actual significance of the sublime intelligence that has been developed through study and contemplation should be incorporated into one's experience through meditation, in which one's focus turns inward. For no matter how profoundly one has studied and contemplated, in the absence of meditation, this will not bring about freedom from bondage.
To give two analogies: A farmer may reap a fine harvest, but unless it is consumed, one's hunger will not be assuaged, for it is meant to be eaten. Alternatively, no matter how skilled one is at reading and thinking about and knowing about medical prescriptions, that skill will not assuage the pain of one's disease, for the medicinal regimen must be followed.

In citing the pronouncement of the transcendent and accomplished conqueror,[628] the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent states that all the states of meditative absorption in the Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna approaches are subsumed within the aspects of calm abiding and profound insight:
Whatever presentations there are concerning the many expressions of meditative absorption for śrāvakas, for bodhisattvas, and for tathāgatas, one should know that all of these are subsumed within calm abiding and profound insight.[629]
Thus, for those who are motivated to develop meditative absorption, but who cannot thoroughly investigate its endless categories, the universal themes for the vast range of states of meditative absorption are twofold— those of calm abiding and profound insight. Therefore, one begins by seeking to gain certainty concerning these two aspects.
One might wonder, “What is the necessity for doing so?” As the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent states, all qualities found in the Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna approaches, whether they are mundane or transcendent,[630] are the results of calm abiding and profound insight. [3.167b] As this source states:
O Maitreya, you should know that all virtuous factors, both mundane and transcendent—whether they pertain to śrāvakas, or to bodhisattvas, or to tathāgatas—are the results of calm abiding and profound insight.[631]

As to what these aspects constitute in essence, calm abiding is essentially a one-pointed state of attention that is focused within an authentic framework, while profound insight is essentially the discerning and sublime intelligence that thoroughly analyzes phenomena and comprehensively investigates suchness itself. As we read in the Cloud of the Rare and Excellent:
Calm abiding is simply a one-pointed state of mind; profound insight is discernment.[632]
And as Vasubandhu states, by way of commentary on this text:
One should know that calm abiding and profound insight are to be understood to be a sequence because they constitute, respectively, mind settling in mind[633] and a thorough analysis of phenomena, both relying on an authentic state of meditative absorption; neither can be the case in the absence of meditative absorption. Such are the characteristics of calm abiding and profound insight.[634]
And as the intermediate version of Stages of Meditation explains:
With the calming of distractions due to external sense objects, one takes delight in engaging with a focus, continuously and as a matter of course, and rests in mind itself, which is imbued with thorough pliancy;[635] this is termed “calm abiding. ” “Profound insight” constitutes whatever thorough investigation of suchness itself takes place when one is focused on that state of calm abiding.[636]

As for the derivation of these terms, with the calming [zhi] of distraction, there is abiding [gnas] to the highest degree, [3.168a] and theprofoundly [lhag] special quality of things is seen with the insight [mthong] of the vision of sublime intelligence.

<d e="2">
As for the etymology and meaning of the Sanskrit terms, in the word śa-matha, the component śama means “calm” [Tib. zhi ha], while tha[637] means “abiding” [Tib. gnas pa]. Thus, “calm abiding” means that once the mind distracted by forms and other sense objects has become calm, it abides one-pointedly in any given state of meditative stability that one is cultivating.
In the word viśeṣapaśya,[638] the component viśeṣa[639] means “special quality” [Tib. khyad par] or “profound quality” [Tib. lhag pa], while paśya[640] means “having insight” [Tib. mthong ba] or “seeing” [Tib. Ita ba]. Thus, “profound insight” means that there is insight due to the perspective of sublime intelligence that sees the profoundly special quality of things—that is, their true nature.

One might wonder why both aspects are needed, with neither calm abiding nor profound insight being sufficient on its own. To give an analogy, if a lamp is both unstirred by wind and burning brightly, one can see things clearly, whereas one cannot see if the lamp is, for example, stirred by wind, even though it is bright. Similarly, if one is endowed with both sublime intelligence that ascertains the meaning of suchness itself in an unmistaken manner and meditative stability in which the mind can abide at will on its focus, one will perceive that suchness clearly. However, even though one has meditative stability (which ensures that the mind abides without wavering), without the sublime intelligence for understanding the way things actually are, one could not possibly realize the way in which they truly abide. And even though one has the view of realizing the absence of any identity,[641] without meditative absorption in which the mind abides one-pointedly, one could not possibly perceive the way things actually are with any clarity. Therefore, all the sūtras and tantras advise the way of integrating these aspects, for the underlying intention is that one will realize suchness itself when both aspects—those of calm abiding and profound insight—come together.

The developmental process of calm abiding and profound insight involves a relationship between them of, respectively, a support and what is supported, similar to that between oil and the lamp it fuels. [3.168b] According to Engaging in the Conduct of a Bodhisattva:
Having understood that profound insight utterly imbued with calm abiding
will completely overcome afflictive mental states,
one first seeks calm abiding...[642]
Therefore, one begins by establishing calm abiding and, based on that, cultivates profound insight. There is a reason for this order: it is because profound insight consists of using discerning and sublime intelligence to perceive, just as it is, the true way in which mind abides; and in order for such perception to take place, it must certainly be the case that the mind being perceived is pliable and has been brought under control, which depends on there being calm abiding to begin with.

That is to say, for those who wish to accomplish calm abiding, it is crucial that they rely on the causes, or circumstances, for it. As the Lord [Atīśa] says in his Lamp on the Path to Enlightenment:
With the factor of calm abiding impaired, though one were to meditate with intense effort even for thousands of years, one would not accomplish meditative absorption.
Therefore, rely entirely on all the factors outlined
in the Chapter on the Circumstances for Meditative Absorption.[643]
With respect to any pure focus whatsoever,[644] one's mind should settle in a virtuous context.[645]
Once an advanced spiritual practitioner accomplishes calm abiding, levels of deeper discernment are also accomplished.[646] [3.169a]
One might wonder, “What are these circumstances? ” According to the intermediate version of Stages of Meditation:
To dwell in a conducive place, to have few wants, to be content, to completely avoid having many activities, to observe pure discipline, and to completely avoid the concepts and distractions of desire and so forth.[647]
And in the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras we read:
The place in which an intelligent person will practice is where everything fine is provided, with a fine dwelling, a fine environment, fine companions,
and the things that delight an advanced spiritual practitioner.[648]

<d e="2">
That is to say, everything fine is provided means that it is easy to come by food and clothing. A fine dwelling is where one is not subject to such threats as bandits and thieves. A fine environment is one in which one will not fall ill. Fine companions are those whose view and conduct are in accord with one's own. The things that delight are such things as the absence of busyness caused by people and the absence of the hardship of noise.
In such ways, one:
(1) dwells in a conducive place;
(1) has few wants for fine food and clothing;
(3) knows contentment with these being simply adequate;
(4) completely avoids having many activities, such as business matters,
and observes pure discipline, without any flaw or breach of one's vows (both those of individual liberation and the bodhisattva path); and
(5) completely avoids concepts concerning desires, keeping in mind that they create many problems in this lifetime.
In addition, one should rely completely on the advice given by the lord Atīśa in his Chapter on the Circumstances for Meditative Absorption, where he discusses the circumstances or supports for calm abiding, as well as counterproductive factors.

If we analyze calm abiding according to the working bases,[649] or kinds of beings, we find that there are four categories of stages that are included (1) within the mind of the realm of desire, (2) within the states of meditative stability, [3.169b] (3) within the states of meditative equipoise associated with the formless realm, and (4) within the meditative equipoise of cessation.[650] The ways in which these stages unfold can be found in earlier and later discussions throughout this work.[651]

When one is cultivating calm abiding, physical posture is very important from the outset. In this regard, one sits on a comfortable seat, with one's posture having eight points. As described in the Stages of Meditation,[652] these are as follows: one's legs are fully crossed or half-crossed; ones’ eyes are half-closed and focused beyond the tip of one's nose; one's body is held erect; one's shoulders are even; one's nose serves as the guide for one’s gaze;[653] one’s lips and teeth are slightly parted; one’s tongue rests against one’s hard palate; and one’s breathing is allowed to occur quite naturally, without any effort.

Generally speaking, the transcendent and accomplished conqueror[654] spoke of four kinds of focus used by advanced spiritual practitioners:
(1) As for a pervasive focus,[655] there are four alternative ways in which one’s goal can be realized. The first two are those of (a) resting without any process of mental investigation or (b) using a focus in which one does use mental investigation. One may also meditate on (c) the “limit of things”[656] (both things in their multiplicity and their true nature just as it is) or (d) the significance of any of these[657] and thus effect a transformation, which are ways of validating the purpose of the practice.[658]
(2) As for a focus that purifies one of former behavior, there are five alternatives. One’s behavior in one’s earlier life might have been due to a predominance of desire, anger, delusion, pride, or discursiveness. The respective remedies are to meditate on what is unattractive, loving-kindness, interdependent connection, a detailed analysis of one's mind-body complex, or the coming and going of the breath.[659] [3.170a]
(3) As for a focus involving knowledge, there are again five alternatives— that is, knowledge concerning the mind-body aggregates, the components of one's ordinary experience, the sense fields, the twelve links of interdependent connection, or what is appropriate and inappropriate.[660]
(4) As for a focus that purifies one of afflictive mental states, there are two alternatives—the higher and lower levels of the coarser state of calm abiding,[661] or the sixteen topics (impermanence and the rest) pertaining to the Four Truths.[662]
From among all the foregoing alternatives, which focus is used by any given individual must accord with one's acumen. If one is an individual subject to a predominance of one influence or another (from desire to discursiveness), one should use the corresponding definitive theme (from unattractiveness to the coming and going of the breath). If one is an individual who has behaved in a balanced way, or who is subject to few afflictive mental states, one may focus one's attention using any of the foregoing themes.

With regard to the specific ways of settling the mind, what is important at the outset is training that uses a physical support. One may settle one's mind using some impure object, such as a small stick of wood or a pebble, to focus one's attention. Alternatively, one may use a pure object—a painted or sculpted image (such as an image of the Buddha), a sacred syllable, a symbolic emblem,[664] and so forth.

</d>
<d e="2">
Once one has gained some sense of one's minds abiding on a physical support, one calls to mind some object that is not such a support, such as the image of an enlightened being s form. Initially the impression is partial, as one focuses one’s attention on some specific part (such as the face or hands); this is called “having a partial focus.” Once one has become familiar with that, one can focus one's attention on a general impression of the complete form; this is called “having a complete focus. ”
In his analytical overview of the foregoing stages, [3.170b] the master Bodhibhadra explains in his Essay on Meditative Absorption that calm abiding is subsumed under either of two methods: that of (1) directing one’s attention outwardly or that of (2) directing it inwardly.
(1) The outward directing of one’s attention can be of two kinds, special or ordinary; the former involves focusing on either a form of enlightened being or a sacred syllable.
(2) The internal directing of one’s attention can also be of two kinds, that of (a) focusing on one’s body or (b) settling one’s mind on something related to the body.
(a) There are three ways to focus on the body: as the form of a deity, as a symbolic emblem, or as a skeleton.
(b) There are five ways to focus on something related to the body: on the breathing, on some minute characteristic of the body,[665] on a sphere of light,[666] on rays of light, or on feelings of joy and well-being.[667]
Although other works contain any number of ways to classify what one focuses on, these nevertheless all fall into the two categories of those that involve a physical support and those that do not.

Once one has become familiar with the foregoing methods, without bringing to mind any support for one's focus, one settles into a state in which all mental activity associated with object or subject has thoroughly subsided. With this, all the waves of thoughts proliferating and resolving dissolve thoroughly and in their entirety into the “ocean” that is the basis of all ordinary experience.[668] This is meditative equipoise that is the very essence of meditation, and so constitutes the consummate state of calm abiding. One should, therefore, strive at that.

If we consider the way in which calm abiding is explained in the great tradition of mainstream sources, it is said that one relies on eight remedial techniques to eliminate five flaws, which act as impediments that obstruct the development of meditative experiences. According to Distinguishing Center and Limit:
Abiding in that state with flexibility
ensures that all one's goals are fulfilled.
This comes about due to the causes on which it depends—
using eight remedial techniques to eliminate five flaws.
Faintheartedness, forgetting instructions, mental laxity and agitation, nonapplication, and overapplication— these are held to be the five flaws.
The context, remaining within that, cause, and effect; not forgetting the framework; being alert to laxity or agitation;
taking steps to ensure that they are actually eliminated;
and entering into a genuine state of repose when calm ensues.[670]
From the foregoing citation, the words abiding in that state mean that, in order to do away with counterproductive influences, one exerts oneself diligently and remains in that state. This leads to meditative absorption that brings physical and mental flexibility.[671] This is the basis, or context, for supernormal powers (such as powers of deeper discernment) that bring realization of all one's goals, and so ensure that one's goals are fulfilled. Such a state of meditative absorption develops due to the causes on which it depends—using eight remedial techniques and eliminating five flaws.

<d e="2">
Of these five flaws:
(1) Faintheartedness is a flaw when one is trying to apply oneself to meditative absorption because it ensures that one does not, in fact, apply oneself. It can be of three kinds: lethargy (which includes sleepiness), obsession with ignoble activities, or diffidence.[672]
(2) Forgetting instructions is a flaw once one is diligently pursuing meditative absorption, [3.171b] for one's mind cannot settle in equipoise if one forgets the focus.
(3) Mental laxity and agitation are impediments to settling in equipoise since both of these make the mind inflexible. Each of these can be of two kinds. There is obvious laxity, when one loses the sense of holding one's attention to the focus and instead feels a sense of losing consciousness, in which that focus is no longer clear; and there is subtle laxity, when there is still some clarity, but the strength of the mind holding the focus wanes. There is obvious agitation, when the mind is fascinated with sense objects and cannot be reined in with remedies; and there is subtle agitation, when the mind is stirring slightly, without abiding in an unwavering way.
(4) Nonapplication[673] is a flaw when either laxity or agitation occurs, for it ensures that neither subsides.
(5) Overapplication is a flaw once one is free of laxity or agitation since it means one cannot abide in equanimity.
When laxity and agitation are counted as one, there are five flaws; when they are considered separately, there are six, as described in the Stages of Meditation.[674]

(5) The remedy for forgetfulness is meditative absorption that ensures one is not forgetting instructions. Such absorption is endowed with three features, in that it involves an intensity, due to the mind's being extremely lucid; a nonconceptual quality, due to the mind's abiding one-pointedly on its focus; and an experience of well-being that takes the form of a blissful sensation.
(6) By one's being alert to whether or not laxity or agitation are taking place, then should either occur, one exerts oneself in any means to dispel the problem—focus, gaze, conduct, and so forth.[676]
(7) Rather than failing to apply remedies for laxity or agitation, one applies them with an attitude of making effort.
(8) Once meditative stability ensues faultlessly and one is resting in equipoise, rather than continuing to make effort in application, one trains in equanimity, no longer applying any remedy.

One relies on six powers that promote one's growth: these are the powers of listening to teachings, contemplation, mindfulness, alertness, diligence, and familiarization. The first power ensures the first step in settling the mind; the second power, the second step; the third power, the third and fourth steps; the fourth power, the fifth and sixth steps; the fifth power, the seventh and eighth steps; and the sixth power, the ninth step.
These steps involve four attendant attitudes: those of involvement with tension, involvement with interruption, involvement without interruption, and spontaneous involvement. During the first two steps of settling the mind, one is involved with the first situation; during the third through the seventh steps of settling, with the second situation; during the eighth step of settling, with the third situation; and during the ninth step of settling, with the fourth situation. These steps are therefore said to “involve situations with four attendant attitudes.”

The nine steps of settling the mind that develop through these powers and attitudes are those of settling, settling continually, and so forth. Of these nine steps:
(1) settling the mind involves drawing one's mind in from any external focus and directing it toward some inner focus;
(2) settling continually involves the mind that was thus directed initially continuing to settle on its focus without becoming distracted by anything else;
(3) settling repeatedly involves one's being aware if the mind becomes distracted outwardly and causing it to settle once more on its focus;
(4) settling more intimately involves settling in a more subtle way, ensuring that the mind is drawn naturally from a broader scope to a more concentrated one;
(5) guiding the mind involves a feeling of inspiration when one reflects on the positive qualities of meditative absorption; [3.172b]
(6) pacifying the mind involves one's seeing distraction to be a fault, so as to pacify any resistance one still has to developing meditative absorption;
(7) pacifying it thoroughly involves pacifying feelings such as desirous attitudes or unhappiness;
(8) settling the mind one-pointedly involves striving in order to be able to settle effortlessly; and
(9) settling in equipoise, once the mind has achieved evenness, involves one's allowing that to occur with equanimity; thus, the final of the nine steps in settling the mind is awakened.
The nine steps of settling the mind are discussed in the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras,[677] while the six powers and the four attendant attitudes are explained in the Levels of the Śrāvaka.[678]

(4) the fourth stage is the experience of stability, comparable to an ocean free of waves; and
(5) the fifth stage is the experience of consummation, with the mind abiding in a state of limpid clarity in which no circumstance whatsoever can cause it to stir; this is comparable to the flame of a lamp unstirred by any breeze.
One should understand that each of the analogies is an attempt to illustrate the actual experience taking place.

That is to say, even though one may have achieved the four attendant attitudes and the nine steps of settling the mind, if one has not gained a thorough pliancy of mind and body, one has not yet reached the consummate state of calm abiding. According to the Commentary on Enlightened Intent: [3.173a]
“O transcendent and accomplished conqueror! As long as a bodhisattva’s mind is such that the attention is directed inwardly but thorough pliancy of body and thorough pliancy of mind have not been attained, what does such attention constitute?”
“O Maitreya! This is not calm abiding. Rather, one should describe this as a case of someone who has an approximation of, and a dedicated interest that is entirely in accord with, calm abiding.”[679]
And in the Ornament [of the Mahāyāna Sūtras] we read the following:
Once familiar with that, they no longer use application.
This then brings about a consummate degree of thorough pliancy of body and mind, which is termed “involving deliberation.”[680]
In this context, the phrase “involving deliberation” refers to calm abiding.[681]
In brief, calm abiding is explained as being the thorough pliancy that involves flexibility of body and mind. Before it is attained, any state of meditative absorption still falls within the realm of desire; this is not yet actual calm abiding, and so is referred to as “the one-pointed mind of the realm of desire.”
As for thorough pliancy, the Compendium of Abhidharma states:
“What is thorough pliancy?” one might ask. It is flexibility of body and mind, because the continuity of the physical and mental tendencies that perpetuate ignoble states of existence has been interrupted; its function is that of removing all obscurations.[682]

The physical and mental tendencies that perpetuate ignoble states of existence are such that one is incapable of engaging at will in positive actions, whether physical or mental. Their remedy lies in a thorough pliancy of body and mind, for due to being free of both kinds of such tendencies, one's body and mind are extremely flexible in engaging in positive actions. There is flexibility of body, for once one has made effort to eliminate the afflictive states that reinforce physical tendencies that perpetuate ignoble states (and interfere with the process of eliminating those tendencies), one is free of bodily inflexibility (such as physical sensations of heaviness) and instead feels one's body to be buoyant and light, like a ball of cotton. There is flexibility of mind, for once one has made effort to eliminate the afflictive states that reinforce mental tendencies that perpetuate ignoble states, one is free of mental inflexibility (in which the mind is incapable of engaging wholeheartedly within any positive framework) and can engage without any impediment. [3.173b]
According to the Levels of the Śrāvaka,[683] of these two kinds of flexibility, the thorough pliancy of mental flexibility develops first, and due to its influence, a subtle energy (that causes thorough pliancy of body to develop) stirs and becomes pervasive throughout the body, so that one is freed of physical tendencies that perpetuate ignoble states, resulting in the development of thorough pliancy of body. (This thorough pliancy of body is not just a mental state; there is a remarkable and extremely pleasant physical sensation throughout one's body.)

<d e="2">
As for the way in which these states develop, at first thorough pliancy is subtle and hard to detect; then it becomes more obvious and easily recognized; then it develops to a great degree, with a powerful sense of wellbeing and joy overtaking one's body and mind. According to the Levels of the Śrāvaka,[684] once this has developed, one meditates by adopting an attitude of equanimity toward the joy that could otherwise make one's mind too excited. At a certain point, due to the influence of a thorough pliancy that ensues, as light as a shadow, one gains calm abiding,[685] As for the measure of success in the calm abiding that comes with the consummation of this thorough pliancy, without any obstacle due to distraction, outwardly or inwardly, one's mind rests inherently on its focus in a stable way, abiding limpidly since it is free of laxity or agitation.

Thus, the attainment of the aforementioned attendant attitudes ensures that one attains four factors to some small degree: (1) a mind state included within the realm of form,[686] (2) thorough pliancy of body, (3) thorough pliancy of mind, and (4) one-pointed focus. With these come calm abiding on a more obvious level (or what could be termed the spiritual path that embodies the aspects of the Truths[687]), which has the capacity to refine away afflictive states. If one then turns inward, resting in equipoise, thorough pliancy of body and mind develop very swiftly; the five obscurations (such as fascination with objects of desire or sleepiness)[688] do not, for the most part, occur; and even when one arises from a formal state of meditative equipoise, one is, at least from time to time, endowed with a thorough pliancy of body and mind. This explanation, found in the Levels of the Śrāvaka,[689] concerns the indications that one is imbued with this state of mental engagement.[690]
It is also explained that there is the sense of well-being that comes from thorough physical and mental pliancy. This pliancy also leads to exceptional meditative experiences of clarity, such as being able to perceive things on the atomic level, and to an absence of conceptual thinking about any of the ten kinds of characteristics that one might perceive in things (that is, the five kinds of sense objects (visual forms and so forth), the three times, and male and female genders), [3.174a] so that one has an experience as though one were blending with space. This experience is such that during formal meditative equipoise one has no perception of having a body, while one's mind blends with space; in postmeditation, one has experiences such as the impression that one's body suddenly reappears.

The consummate state of calm abiding that comes with the attainment of thorough pliancy is the basis that gives rise to, or supports, all the states of meditative stability discussed in the sūtras and tantras, whether these states involve conceptual frameworks or not. It is like a fertile field for someone who wishes to grow crops. This state of meditative absorption alone is itself capable of suppressing and pacifying all the overt manifestations of afflictive states and suffering. And that is not all, for the realization of the authentic state of suchness (that is, the lack of identity in things), just as it is, must depend entirely on one's resting in equipoise. As the first version of Stages of Meditation states:
A mind that is not resting in equipoise cannot know what is authentic, just as it is. The transcendent and accomplished conqueror proclaimed, moreover, “It is through resting in equipoise that one knows what is authentic, just as it is.”[691]

In this regard, the intermediate version of Stages of Meditation states:
“What are the circumstances that support profound insight? ” one might ask. They are: to rely on holy masters, to seek any and every way to study the teachings in depth, and to think correctly.[692]
That is to say, one relies on learned people who have fathomed the meaning of the scriptures [3.174b] and listens to their teachings on the flawless mainstream traditions. Through the sublime intelligence that comes from listening to and contemplating these teachings, one develops the view that constitutes the realization of the very nature of things. These are the indispensable causal circumstances that are supportive of profound insight, for it is impossible for the realization that constitutes that profound insight to awaken without one's having the completely authentic view.
With respect to such a view, one must seek to develop this by relying on the definitive meaning of the teachings rather than the provisional meaning. And so, having understood the distinction between the definitive and provisional meanings,[693] one must master the profound meaning of the scriptures that deal with that definitive meaning, which, in the present context, is to say that one should discover the view that constitutes the realization of the profundity of emptiness by relying on the extensive traditions established by the two guides.[694]

In this regard, if one considers profound insight from the point of view of its expressions from lower to higher levels of spiritual development, the following expressions are spoken of:
(1) The expression of insight as a more obvious state of calm abiding— which is found in common with non-Buddhist systems—is the more mundane level of insight that eliminates overt manifestations of afflictive mental states.
(2) In the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha approaches, the expression of profound insight is the view that focuses on impermanence and the rest of the sixteen topics pertaining to the Four Truths.
(3) In the Mahāyāna approach of the transcendent perfections, it is the view that focuses on emptiness.
(4) In the systems of the tantric approach, that same view is imbued with a blissful quality.
The three latter expressions constitute profound insight that transcends the mundane sphere, in that it completely eliminates even the underlying potential for afflictive states.
The way in which the main states of meditative stability are accomplished through the seven preparatory phases that are expressions of calm abiding[695] is, in fact, the one that was explained in the section on the mundane path.[696] However, those who are following the tantric path—and the words “or others” refer to those with the exceptional view of the pāramitā approach— are not motivated to practice deliberately to achieve these phases.

An analysis may involve three categories: analytical insight, thoroughly analytical insight,
and insight as the avenue for four essential experiences of examination and investigation.
Insight can derive from the ordinary distinctions one makes, from a thoroughgoing search, and from discernment.
It can involve six explorations—of meaning, things, characteristics, influences, time, and logical principles.
(There are four logical principles that concern dependent
relationships, performance of function, establishment of what is reasonable,
and the nature of things.) These six are used to analyze things in detail,

At this point, my discussion will not place emphasis on the profound states of insight that pertain to the advanced paths and levels;[697] rather, I
shall emphasize the profound insight that is cultivated in meditation while one is an ordinary mortal individual. An explanation of such an analysis involves three categories:
(1) In the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent,[698] two aspects are those of analytical insight and thoroughly analytical insight. Each of these two is further divisible into two modes, those of thoroughgoing examination and thoroughgoing investigation, making for the third category, that of what is known as “profound insight involving four essential experiences.”
Of these, analytical insight focuses on things in all their multiplicity, precisely analyzing the mind-body aggregates, sense fields, and components of perception. Thoroughly analytical insight focuses on reality just as it is,[699] leading to realization of the lack of identity in the individual and the lack of identity in phenomena. The two modes of examination and investigation involve mentally analyzing things in a more obvious and more subtle way, respectively.
As for the way in which these aspects of profound insight are realized, the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent states:
with thorough examination, certain examination, thorough evaluation, and intimate evaluation.[700]
If we apply the same detailed divisions to investigation, we arrive at a total of sixteen degrees of insight.[701] A precise classification of these can be found in the Levels of the Śrāvaka.
A similar treatment is found in the Compendium of Abhidharma:
“What is profound insight? ” one might ask. It is the analysis, the thorough analysis, the thoroughgoing examination, and the thoroughgoing investigation of phenomena, because it is the remedy for tendencies that perpetuate ignoble states of existence and the ordinary distinctions one makes, keeps one away from what is erroneous, and allows one's mind to settle in what is without error.[702] [3.175b]

(2) As for profound insight through three avenues of engagement, we read in the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent:
“O transcendent and accomplished conqueror! How many expressions of profound insight are there?”
“O Maitreya, there are three: that which derives from the ordinary distinctions one makes, that which derives from a thoroughgoing search, and that which derives from discernment”[703]
If we define these three expressions of profound insight with reference to meditation on the absence of identity, for example, the first expression involves focusing on the identification of this absence of identity, so that the ordinary distinctions entailed are called to mind; but it does not involve much attention to come to a definitive conclusion. The second expression involves coming to such a conclusion, in order to gain certainty about what was hitherto uncertain. The third expression involves the same kind of investigation as used before but concerning the significance of what has already been ascertained.

(3) As for “profound insight that involves six explorations,” this derives from a thoroughgoing search of six factors—meanings, things, characteristics, influences, time, and logical principles—and from the discernment one gains through having examined them. Of these factors:
(a) the exploration of meaning here refers to the inquiry “The meaning of such-and-such a word is such-and-such”;
(b) the exploration of things refers to such inquiries as “This thing is something internal, while that thing is something external”;
(c) the exploration of characteristics has two aspects, what is more common and what is more particular, as in the inquiry “These are the characteristic specific to something, while these are its more general characteristics”;
(d) the exploration of influences involves the examination of negative factors (from the point of view of their flaws and drawbacks) and positive ones (from the point of view of their qualities and benefits); and
(e) the exploration of time involves the inquiry “Such-and-such happened in the past, such-and-such will happen in the future, such-and-such is the case at present.”

(f) The exploration of logical principles entails four such lines. Of these:
(i) The logical principle of dependence focuses on results coming about in dependence on their causes and conditions. It also involves investigations of what is relative or ultimate, and the respective bases for these contexts. [3.176a]
(ii) The logical principle of function focuses on the functions that are specific to phenomena, such as the function of fire's being that of burning. It involves such explorations as “This is a given phenomenon; this is a function; this phenomenon performs this function. ”
(iii) The logical principle that establishes what is reasonable involves the proof of a point without contradicting the process of valid cognition. It involves investigation by considering, “Does this point in question conform to any of the three kinds of valid cognition, whether direct experience, correct inference, or reliable scriptural authority?”[704]
(iv) The logical principle of the nature of things involves investigating things by concentrating on their nature's being what is commonly accepted in the world (such as fires being hot and waters being wet), on the inconceivable nature of reality, and on the true and abiding nature of things,[705] without considering extraneous issues.[706]
One can apply these six methods of exploration to any given phenomenon within the deeply ingrained afflictive state and the totally refined state—from forms up to and including the state of omniscience—to analyze them in detail and gain realization thereby.

While these examinations can be classified as sixfold, for an advanced spiritual practitioner, there are three topics to be understood: the meaning of what is uttered, reality just as it is, and things in all their multiplicity.
In categorizing these topics, from the point of view of the first topic, the method of exploration is of the first kind.[707] From the point of view of the second topic, the methods of exploration are of things and characteristics (both general and specific). From the point of view of the third topic, the methods of exploration are of the latter three kinds,[708] plus that of general characteristics.
The avenues to the four kinds of profound insight discussed earlier[709] are threefold,[710] while the methods of exploration are explained as being the foregoing six. Thus, the three avenues and six methods of exploration are subsumed within the foregoing four kinds of profound insight.
Alternatively, profound insight can be considered as twofold, divided into a preparatory phase and the actual state. So profound insight can be subsumed under two categories: profound insight as a discerning function of thought (in the context of the preparatory phase) and profound insight as a completely unwavering state (in the context of the actual state).

If one has not discovered the view of things lacking identity, one will stray from the ultimate point of suchness itself, regardless of which method of meditation one employs; so one must discover that view. However, even with an understanding of that view, if one does not meditate by resting one's mind on the basis of that understanding, one will not cultivate the experience of suchness. Therefore, having used sublime intelligence to investigate the fact that things lack identity, one rests in equipoise in basic space, free of all conceptual elaborations.
With respect to this point, if one engages a great deal in analytical meditation and the abiding aspect of one's meditation diminishes, one can engage more in resting meditation and nurture that abiding aspect. If one engages in a great deal of resting meditation and becomes disinclined to engage in analytical meditation, one should engage in the latter. For it is explained that it is more powerful for one to meditate by balancing calm abiding and profound insight in equal measure.
In this regard, the usual model common to most systems of Buddhist thought[711] is that once one has completed an investigation of the topic of meditation using discerning intelligence, one rests in equipoise in this freedom from conceptual elaboration. The model of the Gedenpa school,[712] however, is that when maintaining the main practice of meditative equipoise, one should continue to clarify, further and further, the way in which one's mind deliberately apprehends.[713]

As for the actual cultivation of profound insight in meditation, if one has begun by cultivating calm abiding, the many forms that are perceived within the scope of one's meditative absorption—whether or not these accord with external circumstances—are termed “nonconceptual images” If one then cultivates profound insight in meditation, one meditates byusing those reflections (which arise on the strength of one's calm abiding) as the bases for examination by one's discernment. But the mind is entirely directed inwardly; there is no examination that actually focuses on externals in a deliberate way.[714]
When one investigates those images, which constitute the scope of one's meditative absorption, initially one must use the discernment of one's sublime intelligence [3.177a] to focus on the individual phenomena under investigation, because one cannot eliminate any false assumptions concerning the specific attributes of things until one has ascertained the bases of these attributes. Therefore, one first clearly brings to mind a given object about which one's false assumptions must be eliminated. Then one uses the authentic discerning function of one's sublime intelligence to examine it, coming to the definitive conclusion that it is apparent yet has no independent nature. One then focuses without wavering on that as the object of one’s meditative absorption, and so realizes that the object upon which one is completely focused is apparent yet has no independent nature.[715] Meditative absorption and sublime intelligence are thus integrated with an identical focus. This is what is meant when the Compendium of Abhidharma states:
involving the congruency of meditative absorption and sublime intelligence...[716]

Suppose that, while resting in equipoise vis-a-vis visual forms and so forth, one uses the discerning function of one's sublime intelligence to realize that the nature of those forms and so forth is empty; this is not due to one's calling to mind such things as the ordinary characteristics of those forms. By initially familiarizing oneself with this, one becomes aware that the nature of what is merely perceived is emptiness, comparable to the realm of space, without any fixed frame of reference. This is to immerse oneself in the genuine state in which there is no conceptual framework of perceived objects; one meditates on what is external as the inseparability of appearance and emptiness.
When one experiences the onset of a given state of one's inner perceiving consciousness—such as aversion—in one's ongoing experience, one examines this with the discerning function of one's sublime intelligence, trying to determine what cause it could have come from in the first place; what location (whether internal or external) it could reside in for the duration; and what shape, color, and so forth, it might have in its essence. One should rest in equipoise, experiencing the significance of finding nothing whatsoever through such examination. This method is applied upon the onset of any of the six primary afflictive states.[717] And that is not all, [3.177b] for in becoming aware of any thoughts that occur, including neutral ones and so forth,[718] one applies this method accordingly. This is to immerse oneself in the genuine state in which there is no conceptual framework of a perceiving consciousness; one meditates on what is internal as the inseparability of awareness and emptiness.

Finally, the objects to be examined and even discerning sublime intelligence itself dissolve into basic space so that nothing can be found any longer (analogous to a fire sticks being consumed by the fire it produces), and one should rest in that state without any subjective perception. The foregoing points are presented in distilled form in Pith Instructions on the Middle Way by the Noble Lord, which states:
In this way, the mind of the past has ceased and so dispensed with; the mind of the future has not yet developed or occurred; the mind of the present moment is likewise extremely difficult to examine.[719] Since there is a similarity to space, with no color and an absence of any shape, if one uses the weapon of reasoning in investigating and analyzing mind—whether from the perspective that it cannot be found to exist, or that it is free of being one thing or many, or that it is unborn, or that it is utterly lucid by nature, and so forth—you will realize that it cannot be established to exist.
Thus, given that mind cannot be found to exist in essence as some “thing” of either of two kinds[720] and so simply does not exist as such, even discerning sublime intelligence itself[21] cannot be established to exist as such. To give an analogy, the fire that results from two sticks’ being rubbed together consumes them both, and in the wake of them vanishing, even the fire that consumed them dies out in and of itself. Similarly, once it has simply been established that all phenomena (with both shared and specific characteristics) do not exist as such, even that sublime intelligence itself is not something manifest, but rather is an utter lucidity, free of all conceptual elaborations,[722] not something that can be found to exist as anything at all in essence. And so everything that could constitute a circumstance[723] of mental dullness, agitation, and the like has been eliminated.
Under those circumstances, there is no thinking about anything at all, no fixation on anything at all; for all deliberate recollection and formulation of thought has been eliminated. One’s consciousness should rest[724] for as long as enemies and thieves— that is, ordinary distinctions and thoughts[725]—do not arise.[726]

When one meditates using the discerning function of one’s sublime intelligence to investigate things individually, as long as thorough pliancy has not been attained, one has a valid approximation of profound insight, but with the onset of that pliancy, one’s insight is completely authentic. The essence of thorough pliancy and the way in which it comes about were explained in the context of calm abiding. If one is able to usher in this thorough pliancy on the specific strength of one’s having practiced analytical meditation, the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intend[27] and Śāntipa's Pith Instructions on the Transcendent Perfection of Sublime Intelligence[728] speak of this as the point at which insight is attained. This applies to both kinds of profound insight—that which focuses on phenomena in all their multiplicity and that which focuses on reality just as it is.

That is to say, as far as the accomplishment of nondual timeless awareness—in which calm abiding and profound insight are integrated—is concerned, various masters of the Middle Way school discuss different ways in which this is developed. Nevertheless, they agree that what is to be developed is the integration of that abiding and insight.
In this regard, the master Bhāvaviveka gives the following explanation: Having fostered calm abiding by focusing on unattractiveness, lovingkindness, and so forth, one follows this by developing profound insight through the influence of precise investigation using reasoning.[729] The master Śāntideva explains that, having first fostered calm abiding by cultivating bodhicitta, one follows this by developing the sublime intelligence of profound insight by focusing on emptiness.[730] In the intermediate version of Stages of Meditation, the master Kamalaśīla states that one first develops calm abiding by focusing on an image of the Sage,[731] for example, and then gains profound insight through a precise investigation of the nature of that same focus.[732] [3.178b] According to the master Candra,[733] calm abiding and profound insight are accomplished on the basis of the view that derives from investigating suchness itself.
Given that all these interpretations, moreover, are completely accurate and constitute unerring paths, they all agree in holding that one meditates in a methodical and developmental way, given the cause-and-effect relationship that involves three steps: calm abiding, profound insight, and their integration. And for all these masters, what is paramount is the unwavering quality of one-pointed attention.

“Well, ” one might wonder, “at what point do calm abiding and profound insight become integrated? ” When one is cultivating that abiding and that insight by meditating with some construct,[734] both the calm abiding (the nonconceptual mind focused on the image) and the profound insight (the realization that analyzes phenomena precisely) are equally engaged as a matter of course—that is, they are in actual fact integrated. In this present discussion, though, when one gains both calm abiding that is completely nonconceptual and profound insight that is also completely nonconceptual, these two abide identical in essence, and so there is truly what is termed “integration. ”[735] As the first version of Stages of Meditation states:
At whatever point one is focused on the absence of any finite essence in all phenomena, such that one's consciousness is engaged yet free of mental dullness, agitation, and the like, and without the overt application of any remedy, at that point one has completed the path that brings about the integration of calm abiding and profound insight.[736]

Such meditative absorption, which integrates calm abiding and profound insight, is truly authentic meditative absorption. This is what Maitripa refers to in his Commentary on the “Ten Topics of Suchness”\ [3.179a]
with authentic meditative absorption, just as intended,...[737]
The path that connects and integrates calm abiding and profound insight is that of truly authentic meditative absorption, just as it is intended to be, for as is said:
This is the actuality that ensures accomplishment of that integration.[738]
It is the consummation of this that leads to nirvāṇa that is not confined, but free of the bonds of conditioned existence and the state of peace.[739] According to the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent:
When people have become familiar with profound insight and calm abiding,
they become free of the bonds that perpetuate ignoble states of existence
and the bonds of making ordinary distinctions.[740]
When one arises from meditative equipoise, with the perspective that all phenomena are like dream images, one exerts oneself in skillful ways to honor buddhas and bodhisattvas, treat ordinary beings with compassion, dedicate one's fundamentally positive qualities on a vast scale, and so forth.

In brief, in the more ordinary approach,[741] one may meditate on the nine perceptions of unattractiveness,[742] train one's mind in loving-kindness and compassion,[743] or count the phases of one's breathing (exhalation, inhalation, and retention). In the Vajrayāna approach, there are many means available to one: the pith instructions on consolidation (isolating, and thus eliminating, the perceptions of specific sense objects), the empty framework[744] of the subtle channels, the advanced practices for harnessing the subtle energies, the melting bliss[745] of bindu, the visualization of deities, or the repetition of mantras. Or one can rest in the natural state of relaxation—the uncontrived and unfettered state of genuine being. All these alternatives, while accommodating the various degrees of acumen in individuals, [3.179b] amount to means that usher in the focusing of the mind's attention and develop calm abiding.

According to the principles of valid cognition,[746] for example, one may investigate such issues as what serves as a basis for certain characteristics, what is characterized, and what serves to characterize it. In the abhidharma teachings, one may thoroughly investigate the general and specific characteristics of phenomena. One may gain understanding of the process of interdependent connection, both the usual progression and its reversal.[747] One may eliminate wishful thinking through use of the five major logical proofs, focusing on causes, results, both, things in their essence, and interdependent connection.[748] Or one may be introduced directly to one's own true nature, beholding it in all its nakedness, due to many means involving scriptural citations, logical reasoning, the transmission of blessing, or the use of symbols. All such approaches are a developmental spectrum of means to arouse the superb discerning function of one's sublime intelligence, in accord with the acumen of individuals.

If one summarizes the situations involved in the development of meditative stability, there are said to be three: [3.180a]
(1) Initially, with the meditative stability of an inexperienced practitioner, one experiences the onset of the “indications of empty form”—smoke and the like[749]—which are signs that the mind's attention has turned slightly inward, away from distraction by externals.
(2. ) Then, with the meditative stability that thoroughly analyzes what is ultimately meaningful, one sees the interdependent connection between illusion-like phenomena and one's ordinary conceptual elaborations subside, so that one realizes the identical “taste” of things.[750] One is able to rest with one's mind directed inwardly and authentically in experiencing the equal taste of all phenomena of the dualistic state of consciousness, thus ensuring an unmistaken state of mind that is the most sublime meditative stability.
(3) Finally, with the meditative stability that focuses on suchness itself, one understands all phenomena subsumed within dualistic consciousness to be emptiness, and on the strength of that understanding further realizes the state of peace, primordial by its very nature, so that the true nature of everything as effortless is ensured.
The foregoing constitutes the commentary on the first part, concerning the stages for cultivating calm abiding and profound insight, which are the foundation common to all states of meditative absorption.

In the context of meditation, there are five indispensable factors that are the preliminaries at the outset, serving as the foundation, or root, of all meditation. One engages in meditation through the following:
(1) the underlying basis, which is the observance of discipline and development of the three kinds of sublime intelligence;[751]
(2) the circumstance that promotes meditation, which is the fact that one is capable of both physical and mental isolation;[752]
(3) the eschewing of counterproductive circumstances, that is, the eight mundane concerns;[753]
(4) the supportive circumstances, that is, the twelve disciplines one maintains in one’s spiritual training; and
(5) the circumstance of a pure lifestyle, that is, the complete abandonment of the five kinds of wrong lifestyle.
(1) As to the first of these preliminaries, one observes any of the seven kinds of ordination for individual liberation,[754] [3.180b] thus avoiding all manner of harmful actions of body, speech, and mind. Following that, one hears teachings by listening to scriptures that accord with the actual realization of what is true. One uses reasoning to thoroughly investigate the meaning of what one has heard, developing the sublime intelligence that derives from contemplation (which is to say, the correct functioning of the thinking process). In this way, one proceeds to apply oneself to meditation by focusing one's attention one-pointedly on the meaning of what one has contemplated.

One might wonder, “What is sublime intelligence that derives from hearing teachings, contemplating, and meditating?” The Particularist school holds that the sublime intelligence that derives from hearing teachings has only the words as its objects; that which derives from contemplation has both the words and their meaning as its objects; and that which derives from meditation has only the meaning as its object. But Vasubandhu points out that a single state of sublime intelligence cannot focus on both the words and the meaning at once; thus, while that which derives from hearing teachings constitutes the aspect of sublime intelligence that focuses on the words and that which derives from meditation constitutes the aspect that focuses on the meaning, it is impossible for there to be sublime intelligence deriving from contemplation that focuses on both the words and the meaning at the same time.[755]
Therefore, it is logical that hearing teachings involves listening to authoritative and reliable scriptural sources; sublime intelligence that derives from contemplation constitutes that which comes from using reasoning to arrive at a definitive conclusion concerning the meaning of what one has heard; and sublime intelligence that derives from meditation constitutes that which comes from meditating one-pointedly on the meaning of what one has contemplated. Therefore, these are aspects of sublime intelligence that involve, respectively, gaining certainty concerning the meaning on the basis simply of the language employed; gaining this on the basis of lines of reasoning; and gaining this certainty concerning the meaning on the strength of meditation, without relying on language or concepts.

(2) One might wonder, “What is the working basis on which these aspects of sublime intelligence that derive from hearing teachings, contemplating, and meditating can be developed? ” In order for these aspects of a deep immersion in spiritual practice to develop, people, whether they are lay or monastic practitioners, must physically distance themselves from the busyness of societal ties and mentally distance themselves from inappropriate trains of thought and other distractions. But for those who are not content with monastic robes and the simple fare obtained through begging, [3.181a] and who are very covetous, desiring fine things and many possessions, these aspects of deep immersion in the spiritual path—deriving from hearing teachings, contemplating, and meditating—will not develop.
(3) Given that the path of a spiritually advanced being will not develop for someone who is caught up in the eight mundane concerns, one should eschew these concerns in order to promote access to that path. As one reads in Letter to a Friend:
You who are wise in the ways of the world, the eight mundane concerns
are those called gain and loss, pleasure and pain,
fame and notoriety, and praise and blame.
Please treat these as equally unworthy objects of your attention![756]

(4) Of these disciplines:
(a) Three are remedies to attachment to food:
(i) living on alms (that is, keeping only enough food for one day and not hoarding any extra);
(ii) eating at one sitting (that is, having sat down to eat, eating one's fill without eating anything further once having arisen from one's seat); and
(iii) not eating after midday (that is, having first eaten one's fill of what food has been given one, not eating later even if more should be given).
(b) Three are remedies to attachment to clothing:
(iv) wearing only the three monastic robes (that is, wearing only the three garments of vest, skirt, and shawl and not hoarding anything extra);
(v) wearing only coarse wool (that is, wearing only robes fashioned entirely from rough wool); and
(vi) wearing inferior clothing (that is, wearing older clothing, not newer clothing that is less than a year old, and wearing robes made from inferior cloth discarded by others).
(c) Four of these disciplines are remedies to an attachment to a dwelling place:
(vii) living in solitude (that is, building oneself a hut out of earshot from the nearest village and not staying in any other dwelling, whether in a community or a temple);
(viii) frequenting charnel grounds (that is, staying in charnel grounds and using shrouds for clothing and living solely off the food offered to the dead); [3.181b]
(ix) dwelling in the forest (that is, living at the foot of a tree in a solitary place); and
(x) living without a roof over one's head (that is, living in a simple hut without any more permanent structure protecting one).
(d) Two of these disciplines are remedies to an attachment to a comfortable bed:
(xi) making do with whatever bed is available (that is, refraining from fashioning one's sleeping quarters over and over); and
(xii) sleeping sitting up (that is, passing the night in an upright position).

(5) As is said in a sūtra:
It is difficult for householders to train in the view when they always have so many opinions;
it is difficult to maintain a spiritual practice when one is dependent on other lifestyles.[757]
This means that, for those who have taken monastic ordination, there is the danger of them adopting five kinds of wrong lifestyle, and so they should take care and avoid these. The five are lifestyles that involve the following:
(a) ingratiation (that is, speaking sweetly to others in order later to receive gain and honors);
(b) flattery (that is, praising something owned by another because one wishes to obtain it);
(c) self-promotion (that is, speaking of one's qualities in order to advance one's own interests);
(d) profiteering (that is, using one's gain to seek further gain by boasting about one's previous gains or giving a little to receive a lot in return); and
(e) hypocrisy (that is, pretending to control one's senses and be restrained in order to receive gain and honors).
In addition, engaging in agriculture, trading, or the selling of religious articles and texts are wrong kinds of lifestyle that incur a heavy burden.[758] Thus, if one pursues them, the manifest states of realization associated with the spiritual path that have not arisen in one will not arise, while those that may have arisen will swiftly fade. So avoid these lifestyles completely and adopt a lifestyle that is completely pure.

The first of the successive discussions of the process of meditation in the more common and extraordinary approaches [3.182a] concerns those who follow the śrāvaka schools. They meditate on the first four paths[759] in seven stages. According to the Treasury of Abhidharma:
The seven stages, in order, are thoroughly analyzed as follows:
those of beginning practitioners,
those of the phases that anticipate the decisive breakthrough,
that of meditation, and that of seeing.[760]
That is to say: on the path of accumulation, (1) in the initial phase, one cultivates the four applications of mindfulness; (2) in the intermediate phase, one cultivates the four aspects of authentic renunciation; (3) and in the final phase, one cultivates the four bases of supernormal powers. On the path of linkage, (4) during the anticipatory phases of meditative warmth and the peak experience, one cultivates the five governing powers; (5) during the phases of patient acceptance and the highest state of mundane experience, one cultivates the five strengths. (6) On the path of seeing, one cultivates the seven aids to enlightenment. (7) On the path of meditation, one cultivates the eightfold path of spiritually advanced beings.[761]
All of these stages should be understood to be subsumed within five points—(A) the scope of one's focus, (B) the content (or process of meditation involved), (C) the essence, (D) the result, and (E) the context that delineates when one engages in the respective meditations.[762]

For beginning practitioners in the śrāvaka approach:
(A) The scope of their focus is that of meditation that focuses on four topics: the body, sensations, mind, and phenomena. In this regard, as the general remedy for desire, they meditate on their own and others’ bodies—and, in fact, all sensory appearances—as being skeletons, and thus neutralize their desire. As the Treasury of Abhidharma states:
skeletons in all situations that involve attachment.[763]
As specific remedies, they meditate on eight mental images, such as a decomposing corpse, a swollen corpse, a maggot-ridden corpse, and so forth.[764] [3.182b] Once they are free of desire, from time to time they use the application of mindfulness that scrutinizes the body to meditate on their bodies as being, for example, like hollow reeds.
They next meditate on the idea that regards sensations—whether pleasurable, painful, or neutral—as being productive of suffering, and the idea that these are like hollow reeds, without any real substance.
Then these practitioners calm their thought processes by focusing their attention on the coming and going of the breath; and while the usual flow of thoughts in the mind constitutes the relative level of truth, when they examine this, the ultimate level of truth lies, for these śrāvaka practitioners, in indivisible moments of consciousness,[765] and so within that context they meditate on the fact that nothing has identity.
Next, they meditate on everything subsumed within the categories of mental states and aspects of consciousness—everything that seems to embody something either internally or externally—to determine that the nature of all of these is such that they have no true identity, are impermanent, are like illusions, and forth.

“Why, ” one might ask, “do they take these topics as their focus? ” It is in order to undermine the following concepts in the minds of those whose thinking is erroneous: that the body is the actual abode of the personal self; that sensations are the basis for the self s experiences; that the mind is the actual self; and that phenomena are the basis for the self's experience of either deeply ingrained afflictive states of mind or the totally refined state of enlightenment.
In this regard, there are three aspects to what constitutes one's “body”: the inner aspect, the outer aspect, and the aspect that partakes of both. The first aspect consists of the eyes and other corporeal sense organs that are the internal components of one's perceptual field. The second aspect consists of visual forms and other tangible sense objects that are the external components of one's perceptual field. The third aspect consists of the bases for one's own sense organs and the corporeal sense organs of others, for causes and perceptual fields interact in a way that effects change in both.
Each of the remaining three topics[766] also has three aspects; one can understand these through consideration of the bases and the scopes of focus that apply in their respective cases.
The term “phenomena” here includes all mental events other than sensations, as well as distinct formative factors[767] and forms that fall within the sense field of one's subjective consciousness,[768] as well as unconditioned phenomena.[769] [3.183a]

(B) As to the content of their meditation, they focus on the specific characteristics of the body and the other topics (what any given thing essentially is, of what elements it is composed, what derives from these elements, and so forth) and the general characteristics of things (that they are impermanent, productive of suffering, empty, without true identity, and so forth). Alternatively, they focus on four topics: that the body is unclean, that sensations produce suffering, that the mind is impermanent, and that phenomena have no true identity.
(C) In its essence this meditation brings an understanding due to one's sublime intelligence (which discerns both the general and specific characteristics of the body and the other topics) and one's mindfulness (which ensures one does not forget the scope on which one is focusing or the content). The term “application of mindfulness” is used because one thus considers the general and specific characteristics with sublime intelligence, while mindfulness keeps one's mind directed again and again toward its focus.

(D) The result (or alternatively, the purpose) of this meditation is that of causing one to come to terms with the Four Truths. The first topic[770] causes one to come to terms with the truth of suffering because through precise analysis one gains a thorough appreciation of the body as a subliminal state of suffering that perpetuates ignoble states of existence. The second topic[771] causes one to come to terms with the truth of the all-pervasive origin of suffering because one realizes that the primary factor in this all-pervasive origin—compulsion[772]—is the cause and condition for the three kinds of sensations (pleasurable and so forth), and so one wishes to eliminate that factor. The third topic[773] causes one to come to terms with the truth of the cessation of suffering because one determines that consciousness (which is devoid of personal identity) disintegrates moment by moment, and so one wishes to make that cessation fully evident, for there is no fear of any “self” being annihilated with the attainment of nirvāṇa. The fourth topic[774] causes one to come to terms with the truth of the spiritual path [3.183b] because one determines that afflictive states (such as attachment) are factors to be eliminated, while aspects of the totally refined state of enlightenment (such as faith) are factors to be relied upon, and so one wishes to follow the path. This is what is meant in Distinguishing Center and Limit:
Because of the perpetuation of ignoble states, because of the causes of craving,
because of the ground of being, and because of the absence of delusion,
one come to terms with the Four Truths, and so...[775]
(E) As to the context in which one engages in these meditations, it is during the initial phase of the path of accumulation when—having completed the process of hearing teachings and contemplating—one meditates on what is unattractive and follows the coming and going of the breath with mindfulness, thus rendering one's mind flexible through the process of calm abiding and meditating in order to initiate the process of developing profound insight.
These five points just discussed serve as the model for the remaining sections in the explanation that follows.[776]

Once a state of meditative absorption has been achieved, one cultivates the four aspects of authentic renunciation.
(A) The scope of one's focus includes those factors that are to be eliminated (that is, deeply ingrained afflictive states of mind), those factors to be encouraged (that is, aspects of the totally refined state of enlightenment)
that have already developed, and the development of those positive factors that have not yet developed.
(B) The content is that of ensuring that harmful, nonvirtuous factors that have not yet developed do not develop, while those that have developed are eliminated and their recurrence guarded against; and, in opposite fashion, of ensuring that virtuous factors that have not yet developed do develop, while those that have developed flourish. To these ends, one arouses one's intention, brings exertion to bear, focuses one's attention intently, and immerses oneself thoroughly in the process.
(C) These aspects, in their essence, constitute the diligence that ensures that factors to be eliminated decline, while the remedies to these factors gain in strength.
(D) The purpose, or result, of these aspects is that all factors to be eliminated decline without exception, and one avails oneself of all the remedies without exception.
(E) As for the context demarcating this process, one cultivates these aspects of authentic renunciation during the intermediate phase of the path of accumulation. This is due to the fact that, having meditated by relying in the appropriate manner on the topics for the application of mindfulness, [3.184a] one sees the flaw of those factors that are to be eliminated and the advantages of their remedies, and so arouses the diligence to begin making choices, rejecting the former and embracing the latter.

One might wonder why the term “aspect of authentic renunciation” is employed. It is because it signifies that these aspects eliminate all that is spiritually counterproductive.
Once these aspects are in place:
(A) The scope of one's focus in cultivating the four bases of supernormal powers includes creating emanations and other powers of transformation that are achieved through meditative absorption. The process of meditation is described in Distinguishing Center and Limit:
This comes about due to the causes on which it depends— eliminating five flaws and using eight remedial techniques.[777]
That is to say, one meditates as discussed earlier, employing the eight remedial techniques.[778]
(C) As for what these constitute in their essence, they are in general states of meditative absorption that are fourfold from the point of view of being supportive factors. Meditative absorption that involves intention is carried out on the basis of exertion as a dedicated application, due to which one reaches a state of one-pointed attention; while due to another aspect of meditative absorption that involves investigation, thoroughly analyzing in detail the spiritual teachings given by others, one reaches that same state of one-pointed mind.
(D) The purpose, or result, of these bases is that one wishes to make any given supernormal power fully evident, and brings it into full evidence by directing one's mind accordingly.
(E) As for the context, one cultivates these bases during the final phase of the path of accumulation.
One might ask why meditative absorption is referred to here as a “basis of supernormal powers. ” The term signifies that this absorption serves as a support for one to acquire all spiritual qualities.

The foregoing meditative absorption brings one to the path of linkage, which anticipates the decisive breakthrough[779] and has four phases: warmth, the peak experience, patient acceptance, and the highest state of mundane experience. During these four phases, one focuses on the sixteen topics that pertain to the Four Truths (those of impermanence and so forth),[780] applying two groups of five factors: the five governing powers—confidence, diligence, mindfulness, meditative absorption, and sublime intelligence—and the five strengths that are the transmutation of these.[781] [3.184b]
In this regard:
(A) The scope of one's focus in cultivating the five governing powers is that of the Four Truths, because these topics constitute aspects of those truths insofar as they link one to the path of spiritually advanced beings.[782]
(B) As for the process of meditation,[783] one meditates with confidence, such that this gives one the conviction that these truths address what is to be understood and what is to be eliminated; with diligence, such that one’s enthusiasm is aroused in order for one to come to a realization of what these truths actually entail; with mindfulness, such that one does not forget the topics on which to focus (that is, what these truths actually entail); with meditative absorption, such that one's attention is focused in a one-pointed manner; and with sublime intelligence, such that the topics of these truths are individually and precisely analyzed.
(C) This process, in its essence, consists of the five governing powers of confidence, diligence, mindfulness, meditative absorption, and sublime intelligence.
(D) The result is the swift attainment of the path of seeing and the accomplishment of the four steps in the path of meditation.
(E) As for the context, one cultivates these powers during the two phases of warmth and the peak experience.

If one wonders why the term “governing power” is used, it is because these factors give one governance over that which supports the state of definitive excellence—that is, over the mundane factors associated with the completely refined state of enlightenment.
Next, in the cultivation of the five strengths:
(A) The scope for one's focus and (B) the content employed are similar to the foregoing case.
(C) In their essence, these strengths constitute an increase in the force of confidence and the rest of the five powers, such that they become solely remedial, without any admixture of a lack of confidence of any of the counterproductive factors; this is what the term “strength” signifies.
(D) Their result is the onset of the phases of patient acceptance and the highest state of mundane experience, and the accomplishment of the path of seeing.
(E) As to the context, one cultivates these strengths during the phases of patient acceptance and the highest mundane state. As Distinguishing Center and Limit states:
For the governing powers and the five strengths there are two pairs of anticipatory phases.[784]
The meaning of the term has just been discussed in the discussion of their essence.

(A) The scope of one's focus in cultivating the seven aids to enlightenment (which are the factors to be cultivated on the path of seeing) is that of what the Four Truths of spiritually advanced beings actually entail. [3.185a]
(B) As for the process of meditation,[785] authentic mindfulness as an aid to enlightenment ensures that, when one focuses on suffering, one seeks to remove it; when one focuses on the all-pervasive origin of suffering, one seeks to be free of desire and attachment for it; when one focuses on the cessation of suffering, one seeks to experience that fully; and when one focuses on the path that leads to the cessation of suffering, one seeks to cultivate it. The process for the remaining six aids is similar.
(B) In their essence, these aids are as follows: (1) mindfulness is not forgetting the scope of the path of seeing; sublime intelligence is (2) a thorough analysis of the suchness of phenomena; (3) diligence is enthusiasm for what is virtuous; (4) incorruptible joy is a beneficial influence on the mind and body; (5) thorough pliancy is flexibility of mind and body; (6) meditative absorption is a one-pointed state of attention; and (7) impartiality is the minds engagement without the fluctuation due to mental lethargy or agitation.

(C) As to the way in which these function as aids,[786] mindfulness is an aid that provides a sense of abiding because its influence is one of ensuring that the other aids do not stray from their focus. A thorough analysis of phenomena is an aid by its very nature because it is, in essence, the nonconceptual state that constitutes the nature of the path of seeing. Diligence is an aid to one's will to be free of saṃsāra, for through relying on it, one feels a certainty about one's release from suffering. Joy is an aid that constitutes a benefit and advantage, for it comes about as the result of the other aids. The remaining three aids (thorough pliancy and the rest) are aids in negating afflictive states because it is thorough pliancy that brings about the absence those states, meditative absorption that constitutes the absence of those states, and impartiality that is, in its essence, the absence of those states. The foregoing is referred to in the following lines from Distinguishing Center and Limit:
An aid by nature, an aid providing a sense of abiding,
the third an aid to the will to be free,
the fourth an aid that is a benefit and advantage,
and three that are aids in negating afflictive states.[787] [3.185b]
(D) The purpose and result of these aids is one of bringing about the removal of all factors without exception that are to be eliminated on the path of seeing.
(E) As for the context, once one attains the path of seeing, the nature of that state itself is that of these seven aids to enlightenment.

(7) authentic mindfulness consists of not forgetting the purpose of calm abiding, of holding one's attention intently, and of impartiality;

These branches are considered to be present on the path of seeing insofar as they are attained on the basis of the potential of formal meditative equipoise of that path; they are considered in their essence to constitute the path of seeing in that they become fully evident on that path.
These eight branches function as four kinds of aids. That is to say, authentic view is the aid that involves thorough determination; [3.186a] it constitutes the investigation “This is what has been realized during formal meditative equipoise.” Thought is the aid that promotes understanding because it constitutes the motivation to speak in ways that completely define what one has realized. Speech, action, and livelihood are aids that inspire conviction, for they inspire confidence concerning view, discipline, and a completely pure livelihood, respectively. The three branches of effort, mindfulness, and meditative absorption are aids that are remedies to counterproductive influences because they function as remedies to the afflictive states that are to be eliminated on the path of seeing, to the afflictive states that contribute to mental laxity and agitation, and to influences that are counterproductive to the attainment of such special spiritual qualities as supernormal states of perception, respectively. As is said:
Involving thorough determination, promoting understanding, bringing conviction (in the case of three branches) in the minds of others,
and serving as remedies to counterproductive influences— these are the eight branches of the path.
It is held that others are made aware of view, discipline, and few material needs.[788]
There are remedies to counterproductive influences that involve afflictive states, secondary afflictive states, and mastery.[789]

(D) The result of these branches is that, due to one's cultivating them, all possible factors to be eliminated are removed.
(E) As to the context, they are cultivated at the point that one has attained the path of meditation.
In this regard, proponents of the Particularist school explain that the seven aids to enlightenment constitute the path of meditation since they are associated with what derives from meditation. For this school, the eightfold path of spiritually advanced beings constitutes the path of seeing because the path of seeing is the “wheel of dharma,” and the eightfold path (due to its facilitating swift progress and so forth) can be likened to a precious wheel.[790]
On the path of no more training,[791] one has the incorruptible knowledge that suffering has been understood, its all-pervasive origin eliminated, its cessation made fully evident, and the path cultivated. As well, one has the incorruptible knowledge: “Suffering has been understood; now there is nothing more to understand” and so forth, [3.186b] up to “The path has been cultivated; now there is nothing more to cultivate. ” But other than these successive states of knowledge, that negative factors have been exhausted, and that suffering will not occur again, there is nothing upon which to meditate as some additional focus with a specific object or structure.[792]

Pratyekabuddhas, having traversed their path by relying on the aspects of the totally refined state of enlightenment that were just discussed and on the process by which things occur through interdependent connection, maintain the focus of their attention on the three avenues to complete liberation.
In this regard, speaking generally, there are three ways in which pratyekabuddhas train in their path:
(1) Some of those who belong to the pratyekabuddha type serve the buddhas who appear during one hundred eons. Having thus matured themselves for the state of a pratyekabuddha's enlightenment, they then become learned in six topics[793] in order to attain that state.
(2) Some serve the buddhas that appear over an indeterminate period of time and listen to spiritual teachings by relying on holy masters. Having reflected on these teachings accurately, in the presence of spiritual masters, they undergo the experiences of the anticipatory phases of the path of linkage. However, unable in that lifetime to gain full realization of these teachings or the fruition of their spiritual practice, they become learned in the six topics in order to attain that state in a future lifetime.
(3) While similar to the foregoing on other points, some gain full realization of these teachings in the presence of spiritual masters and fully experience one or the other of the first two stages of fruition. However, unable to fully experience the latter two stages of fruition, they become learned in the six topics in order to experience these stages fully in a future lifetime.

Of these three models, the first are those who are solitary like a rhinoceros,[794] while the latter two are those who participate in groups.[795] [3.187a]
In any of these cases, in the lifetime following that one, they are reborn in worlds in which there are no buddhas or śrāvakas. Upon going to cemeteries and seeing the bones there, they immediately feel disenchanted with saṃsāra. They think “Alas! Where did these bones come from? They came from aging and death. Where did aging and death come from? They came from birth... ” and so forth, examining in succession the twelve links in the process of interdependent connection. Wondering “How can I become liberated from this? ” they then cut through the root of those twelve links, undermining the process of interdependent connection by arresting ignorance, karmic patterning, and so on, through the arresting of aging and death. Once they understand that all phenomena occur merely through a process of interdependent connection, they meditate on the twelve links of interdependence and the sixteen topics pertaining to the Four Truths. They thus fully experience the five paths in a single session, and so maintain an ongoing focus on the process of interdependence and complete liberation.
In this regard, the following explanation is given:
(1) Of the three avenues to complete liberation that concern the know-able, emptiness is the lack of identity; the absence of subtle traits is the nonexistence of anything the self takes to be its own; and the absence of naive speculation is the lack of any fixed frame of reference.
(2) In terms of the path, of the three avenues to complete liberation, emptiness is the cessation of suffering; the absence of subtle traits is the path; and the absence of naive speculation constitutes suffering and its allpervasive origin.
(3) In terms of the fruition, of the three avenues to complete liberation, emptiness and the absence of subtle traits pertain to the state in which there are no residual traces, whereas the absence of naive speculation pertains to the state that still involves residual traces.[796]

An individual who is an aspirant for following the Mahāyāna path of the transcendent perfections is someone in whom the affinity for the Mahāyāna approach has awakened and who upholds the training involved in the two aspects of bodhicitta—relative and ultimate. [3.187b]
As for the nature of that spiritual affinity, the sūtra Discourse of Oueen Śrīmālā states:
The potential for attaining the state of suchness permeates all beings.[797]
And the Highest Continuum says:
Because the kāya of perfect buddhahood is pervasive, because the state of suchness is indivisible,
and because all beings possess spiritual affinity, beings are forever endowed with buddha nature.[798]
As these passages demonstrate, this affinity abides innately and pervasively in all beings.
If one analyzes this spiritual affinity, it is twofold: that which is naturally abiding and that which is perfectly developed. As to what these constitute in essence, the incomparable Dakpo has the following to say:
First, as to the naturally abiding aspect of spiritual affinity, it is the capacity to develop the qualities of buddhahood, partakes of a timeless quality, and is obtained by the true nature of reality.
As to the perfectly developed aspect of that affinity, it is that capacity to develop the qualities of buddhahood that is attained by one's having become familiar with fundamentally positive qualities.
Thus, these two aspects provide the good fortune for one to awaken to buddhahood.[799]

Synonymous terms are “spiritual affinity,” “potential,” “natural state,” and “fundamental being.”[800]
In considering specific situations, the Ornament of the Mahay ana Sūtras discusses five alternatives,[801] which is to say:
(1) the fact that someone has the spiritual affinity for the Mahāyāna approach is the proximate cause of buddhahood;
(2) given that the spiritual affinities of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas eventually lead to the attainment of buddhahood, they are the more longterm causes;
(3) of those whose affinity is uncertain, for some it is the more direct cause,
(4) for others the more long-term cause;[802] and
(5) even in the case of those whose spiritual affinity is said to be “cut off,” this is only in consideration of the length of time required, not that they will somehow never attain enlightenment; for them, then, it is the extremely long-term cause.[803]
Therefore, because beings have these kinds of spiritual affinity, this scripture states that ordinary beings are endowed with the quintessential potential for buddhahood.

Nevertheless, the affinities for both the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha approaches are more rudimentary, whereas that for the Mahāyāna is far more sublime than all the others; in the former cases, the affinity is fully expressed by the refining away of the afflictive obscurations alone, while the latter is only fully expressed with the refining away of both levels of obscuration.[804] [3.188a]
The Mahāyāna affinity can be either awakened or remain unawakened; how these situations are to be understood is discussed in the sūtra Discourse on the Ten Attributes:
The affinity of intelligent bodhisattvas
can be known from indications,
just as fire can be known from the presence of smoke,
or water from that of water fowl.[805]
As this source states, one can know these situations from the signs or indications. The signs that this affinity has been awakened are that one’s actions and speech are naturally gentle, without one's having had to rely on remedies; that one’s mind holds little hypocrisy or deceit; and that one is loving and sincere toward beings. Again, from the sūtra Discourse on the Ten Attributes:
Not being a rough or crude person, completely rejecting hypocrisy and deceit, and being utterly sincere toward all beings— such is a bodhisattva.[806]

In addition, one feels compassion for beings before undertaking any activity; is inspired by the Mahāyāna teachings; has forbearance, not being daunted by undertaking difficult challenges; and engages wholeheartedly in the fundamentally positive attributes entailed in the transcendent perfections. This is stated in the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras:
Even before one undertakes training,
to have compassion, inspiration, and forbearance,
and to pursue what is positive wholeheartedly,
are to be known as the indications of spiritual affinity.[807]
The signs that one's spiritual affinity, although latently present, has not yet been awakened are described in the Highest Continuum:
If one lacks sensitivity to one's fundamental being, one's buddha nature,
one will never be sufficiently dissatisfied with suffering,
or desire nirvāṇa,
or strive for it, or even aspire to it.[808]
That is to say, this is like the situation of the vast majority of ordinary people.
As to the circumstances under which one's spiritual affinity is awakened, it is awakened when one is free of counterproductive conditions and influenced by conducive ones; as long as the opposite is the case, one's affinity will remain unawakened. [3.188b] There are four conditions that are counterproductive: to be reborn in a state devoid of spiritual freedom;[809] to be heedless;[810] to engage in morally wrong actions; and to be subject to the harm caused by obscurations. There are two conditions that are conducive: the external condition of others teaching one the sacred dharma; and the internal condition of one's reflecting on these teachings correctly and being inspired by what is spiritually positive.
Hence, this affinity is crucial since individuals in whom it has awakened are capable of following the Mahāyāna path and applying it in their ongoing experience.

For those who wish to train on the path of the transcendent perfections, the initial step is to train in the four immeasurable attitudes (loving-kindness and so forth), which constitute the training for bodhicitta as aspiration. According to the Intermediate Length “Mother”'.
O Subhūti, thus a great and heroic bodhisattva should cultivate supreme loving-kindness, supreme compassion, supreme joy, and supreme impartiality.[811]
And from the Sublime Heart Essence:
O Śāriputra, thus there are four pure states—those of lovingkindness, compassion, joy, and impartiality that are not preceded by the authentic arousal of bodhicitta and that do not entail such arousal. These states entail the overt formative patterns that contribute to conditioned existence.
There are four immeasurable attitudes—those of loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and impartiality that are preceded by the authentic arousal of bodhicitta and that do entail such arousal. These states entail the formative patterns that contribute to the path to nirvāṇa.[812]
In this tradition, the distinction is simply one of the immeasurability entailed.[813] And as the Categories of the Levels states: [3.189a]
The four immeasurable attitudes develop both with a conceptual frame of reference (whether that of beings or the true nature of reality) or without a frame of reference.[814]
That is to say, having understood the distinction between there being a conceptual frame of reference or not, one trains either within the scope of such a framework or within the scope of the immeasurable attitude in itself.[815]

These attitudes are developed through four conditions:
(1) the causal condition is that of one's naturally abiding spiritual affinity—that is, one's fundamental being;
(2) the governing condition is a spiritual mentor who instructs one in the teachings concerning the four immeasurable attitudes;
(3) the referential condition is the scope of the respective attitude that has become fully evident;[816] and
(4) the immediate condition is one's prior familiarity with the benefits and advantages of cultivating these four immeasurable attitudes and the shortcomings of not doing so.
The processes by which these attitudes develop are explained as being threefold, depending on the specific scope of the focus:
(1) those who are beginning practitioners, who have not realized the absence of identity in things, develop the four immeasurable attitudes by focusing on beings;
(2) those who are advanced in practice—who have realized 75 per cent of that absence[817]—develop these attitudes by focusing on phenomena; and
(3) those who have gained patient acceptance, who have realized both aspects of that absence, develop these attitudes through a process that involves no frame of reference.
With respect to the foregoing processes, the Levels of the Bodhisattva says:
To have beings as the frame of reference is a process held in common with non-Buddhist holders of extreme views. To have phenomena as the frame of reference is a process held in common with all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. To have no fixed frame of reference is a process that has nothing in common with any of the foregoing.[818]

From the point that they first embark on the Mahāyāna path of accumulation [3.189b] until they reach the path of linkage, beginning practitioners—completely motivated by the wish to attain enlightenment—maintain completely pure discipline; control their senses; exercise moderation in eating; exert themselves in spiritual practice, foregoing sleep in the late evening and early morning; take joy in maintaining alertness in issues requiring moral choices; and are extremely enthusiastic and have no regret at their positive actions.[819]
The seven riches are as stated:
Faith in the basis of truth, pure ethical discipline, hearing of many teachings, familiarity with giving, knowing modesty concerning others, having great self-respect concerning oneself,
and having sublime intelligence in abundance; these are the seven riches of spiritually advanced beings.[820]
The ten kinds of spiritual activity are spoken of in Distinguishing Center and Limit:
Copying texts, making offerings, giving generously, listening to teachings, reading them, memorizing them, explaining them, reciting texts aloud, contemplating and meditating— these embody the ten kinds of activity, the qualities of which are incalculable.[821]
The practical application of these is discussed, for example, in the excellent writings of Situ Rinpoché Chökyi Gyaltsen.[822]
In addition, the preliminaries involve one's efforts to increase one's spiritual progress through any and all positive acts—such as arousing one's inspiration and other positive factors that serve as causes of one's liberation—without any bias or prejudice. One then can embark on the stages of the path in the actual practice of meditation.

For those on the path of accumulation, in general it is the four axioms that denote the Buddhas words and other similar topics that are to be cultivated in meditation. [3.190a] Of these, the way in which one meditates on the four axioms is to arouse bodhicitta; to then meditate (1) on all that is conditioned being impermanent, (2) on the nature of what entails corruptibility being that of saṃsāra and suffering, (3) on all phenomena as lacking identity, and (4) on nirvāṇa as a state of peace; one then concludes with dedication.[823]
As for “recollection of the Victorious One and so forth,” this refers to one's recollection of the Buddha, dharma, saṅgha, one's ethical discipline, giving, one's body, death, birth, and the inhalation and exhalation of ones’ breath.
The nine perceptions of impurity are of a corpse decomposing, ridden with maggots, mottled with dark blotches, rotting, putrefying, being devoured by wild animals, scattered in pieces, being cremated, and disintegrating.[824]
The eight thoughts of a superior spiritual practitioner are to think as follows:
(1) “At some point, may I be capable of removing the suffering of beings!”
(2) “At some point, may I be capable of bringing great wealth to beings who are afflicted by poverty!”
(3) “At some point, may I be capable of ensuring benefit for beings with this flesh-and-blood body!”
(4) “At some point, may I be capable of ensuring benefit for beings, even if it means my remaining in a hell realm for a long time!”
(5) “At some point, may I be capable of fulfilling the hopes of beings with great wealth, both mundane and transcendent!”
(6) “At some point, having awakened to buddhahood, may I truly be capable of bringing beings out of their suffering!”
(7) “In all my lifetimes, may I never take a rebirth that does not benefit beings, or engage solely in experiencing the ultimate,[825] or speak words that do not satisfy all beings, or adopt a livelihood (or a body or intelligence or wealth or power) that does not benefit others, or take any joy in what harms others!” [3.190b]
(8) “May the fruits of beings’ harmful actions ripen for me, while the fruits of my positive actions ripen for them!”

As for the thorough purification of one’s sphere of activity, the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras states:
When heirs of the victorious ones act in any way whatsoever, their perceptions[826] functioning in a variety of ways, they are aware of things as they are and, with appropriate words, make this evident in their ideas in order to benefit beings.[827]
This passage should be understood to mean that which accords with a thorough purification of the sphere of one’s ordinary activity. When bodhisattvas enter a building, they arouse bodhicitta and think, “May all beings gain the citadel of liberation!” Using this as a model, when they lie down to sleep, they think, “May beings attain the kāyas of buddhahood!” If they dream, they think, “May beings realize all phenomena to be like dream images!” Once they awaken, they think, “May beings awaken from their ignorance!” As they arise, they think, “May beings gain the enlightened forms of buddhas! ” When they don clothing, they think, “May beings don the raiment of modesty and self-respect!” As they tie their sashes,[828] they think, “May beings unite themselves with fundamentally positive qualities!” If they sit on seats, they think, “May beings attain the vajra seat!”[829] Thinking in such ways, they feel, “I arouse bodhicitta!” Practicing in such ways, one trains one’s mind.[830]

In the specific phase of formal practice, the significance of the Middle Way is paramount, and that involves investigation as a preliminary.
Autonomists rest in the significance of an unqualified negation, comparable to space.

In the specific case of the meditation that is unique to those who follow the Mahāyāna approach, during the phase of formal practice, it is the significance itself of the profound Middle Way (concerning which they have come to a definitive conclusion through hearing and contemplating teachings) that is their paramount concern in meditation. [3.191a]
In this regard, those who profess the Autonomist interpretation begin by arousing bodhicitta and pursuing an investigation with the discerning function of their sublime intelligence. They then rest in equipoise, in a mode of “one taste” within the essence of emptiness comparable to space, an unqualified negation in which all extremes due to conceptual elaboration have been removed, so that there is no concept even of whether or not the very mind that is becoming familiar with the practice has anything with which to become familiar. Given that the conventional designation of “primordial union”[831] is not used in this interpretation, the postmeditation phase in this context is one of not blocking what manifests in light of ordinary awareness, while overtly conceiving of developing one's merit within a state in which, in light of timeless awareness, there is no fixed frame of reference whatsoever. It is this that they term the “primordial union of the two levels of truth”; they also term it the “development of merit that is imbued with sublime intelligence that does not conceive of the three focal points.”[832]
Those who profess the Consequentialist interpretation begin with the arousal of bodhicitta and an investigation with sublime intelligence. They then arrive at a nondual state, like that of water poured into water, without the mind that becomes familiar and the basic space of phenomena with which it becomes familiar being separate and distinct. Although they use the conventional designation of “sublime intelligence that realizes the basic space of phenomena, ” in actuality they have no classification of something to be known versus that which knows it, and so they do not employ even the conventional designation of “primordial union. ” As for the postmeditation phase, their way of thinking about it is like that in the context of the Autonomists.

As for those who profess qualified emptiness [gzhan stong], they begin with the arousal of bodhicitta and a brief investigation in which there is no frame of reference of things having any inherent nature. They then abide in the state of supreme utter lucidity, spontaneously present without involving any conceptual thinking. They rest in equipoise of that naturally lucid self-knowing awareness—timeless awareness that is devoid of the duality of perceived object and perceiving subject—and this by way of not thinking in terms of, or fixating in any way whatsoever on, ordinary distinctions of such elaborations as “exists, ” “does not exist, ” “is, ” or “is not. ” As for the posmeditation phase, they take as many tangible phenomena as there are as objects but do not fixate on any of the ordinary distinctions of conceptual elaboration whatsoever. This they term the “primordial union of the manifest and emptiness, ” [3.191b] and it is within this context that they engage in the development of merit on a vast scale. The phase of formal practice they refer to as the “primordial union of lucidity and emptiness” because it is empty of any conceptual thinking, while not straying from what is, in its essence, lucid pure awareness.
The foregoing three interpretations agree on the key point of simply resting in equipoise within basic space, which is a freedom from conceptual elaboration.

In the phase of postmeditation, once one has arisen from that of formal practice, on the lesser degree of the path of accumulation, one practices the applications of mindfulness by regarding the body, sensations, mind, and phenomena as having no inherent nature in any authentic sense, meditating on their very essence without conceiving of them individually: this is the aspect of profundity. And one meditates on the body as being like an illusion, sensations as being like dream images, the mind as being like utterly lucid space, and phenomena as being adventitious like clouds: this is the aspect of vastness.[833] Likewise, one meditates successively on the thirty-seven factors that contribute to enlightenment.[834] These are enumerated here just as they are in the context of the śrāvaka approach; however, their significance as factors that contribute to enlightenment in the Mahāyāna approach is such that, as the immediately preceding discussion illustrates, there are extraordinary dimensions with respect to the profundity of their scope and the vastness with which that scope is applied.

If we condense all the limitless stages of the paths of the Mahāyāna approach into a summary, the consummate fruition to be attained is that of omniscience; the means to attain that is knowledge of the path; and as an auxiliary entailed in the moral choices one makes in that context, knowledge of the ground (that is, knowledge of counterproductive factors in one’s existing situation and of a detailed analysis of remedies). These three aspects of knowledge constitute the context within which one puts an end to erroneous assumptions. [3.192a]
The four applications involved in spiritual practice are:
(1) the “application that perfects all aspects” is one of meditation in turn on some 173 topics, which subsume within them the significance of the definitive conclusions that one has reached through hearing and contemplating teachings concerning the foregoing aspects of knowledge;
(2) the “culminating application” is one of developing one's realization (based upon meditation that summarizes the foregoing aspects of knowledge) to a consummate level;
(3) the “sequential application” is one of meditating as before but on all topics at once, in order to gain stability from the foregoing application; and
(4) once that stability has been gained, the “instantaneous application” is one of meditating on the topics of the three aspects of knowledge in a single instant of timeless awareness, so that it is certain that immediately following this the fruition state will become fully evident.
Once one has pursued spiritual practice in the foregoing manner, one will straightforwardly accomplish what is renowned as the unsurpassable Prajñāpāramitā (the transcendent perfection of sublime intelligence), the supreme mother, dharmakāya—that is, the three kāyas and their attendant enlightened deeds.
The foregoing constitutes the commentary on the second part, concerning a presentation of the specific stages in meditation in the cause-based dialectical approach.
This concludes the commentary on [the first two parts of] the eighth book, a developmental analysis of the higher training in meditative absorption, from The Encompassing of All Knowledge, also entitled The Precious Treasury of Sublime Teachings:
The Compendium of the Methods of All Spiritual Approaches and A Treatise That Thoroughly Presents the Three Higher Trainings.

The essence of the two phases is the expeditious means, through using exceptional techniques, to protect one’s mind from the thought [processes] of [apprehending] characteristics.
As to the essence of the phase of creation in particular, [this phase] arises from the deliberate effort of thought,[4] which serves as its direct cause. its essential nature is the deity’s form of bliss, [inseparable] appearance and emptiness. its special feature is meditation that accords in aspects with birth, death, and the intermediate state, the three [processes in cyclic existence]. The great masters of the sakya tradition[5] explained [the phase of creation as meditation on] the form of the deity possessed of four distinctions: distinction in method, the relevant method of creation [of the deity’s form] as taught in the tantras; distinction in function, whereby the three [aspects], purification, completion, and ripening, are fulfilled;[6] distinction in result, the capacity to bring about its own result;[7] and distinction in essential nature, which manifests as the bliss [that arises from] the melting [of vital essence].[8]
The essence of the phase of completion is extraordinary pristine awareness, together with its causes and results, which arises when winds and mind have entered, abided in, and dissolved in the central channel.

As to the meaning of the term “phase of creation” (bskyed rim), [the equivalent of “creation” (bskyed) is sanskrit] utpatti, which means fabricated. The word bskyed rim therefore denotes that which is created by thought or fabricated by thought. [The phase of creation is] also known as the phase of imagination or the yoga involving fabrications.
The equivalent of “completion” (rdzogs) is [sanskrit] nishpanna, meaning the ultimately true, or the natural state. [The word] rdzogs therefore denotes what is ultimately true, the natural state, or the nature [of things]. What is meant is a state with which one has to familiarize—one that is not created anew but is already fully present.[9]
[The term] “phase” (krama) refers to a step in the path.
The phase of creation is also referred to as the phase of imagination and the yoga of fabrications; the phase of completion, as the phase that does not [utilize] imagination and the yoga of the natural state. That being so, the phase of creation is [defined as] the path and branches that involve imagination, the essence of which is fabrication by means of thought; and the phase of completion, the path and branches of the yoga of the innate,[10] in which nothing is fabricated anew by thoughts.
According to some masters of the past, nagarjuna[11] and his spiritual heirs named [these phases] in relation to the [two] bases of purification (birth and death), creation being related to birth; and completion, to death; and they described the two phases as paths that purify [birth and death]. The authors of the Commentaries by the Bodhisattvas[12] named [the phases] in relation to the results, creation being related to ordinary powers; and completion, to the supreme power [of awakening]; and they described the two phases as the means to gain those powers.
Nevertheless, the exalted Taranatha maintained that those [statements] are simply based on general considerations that have no connection to the etymological meanings [of the names of the two phases] and that it is difficult to determine whether these are in fact the views [of nagarjuna and the authors of the Commentaries by the Bodhisattvas].

<d e="2">
The phases are exactly two in number. They cannot be combined into one phase, nor is there need for there to be three or more phases. This is due to [several reasons]:
The two phases serve as paths to cross over [cyclic existence] using yogas that accord in features with the two processes [in the cyclic life] of a sentient being, the process of birth and the dissolution process at death, the [two] bases to be purified.
Moreover, they involve two abandonments to be made:[one,] the immediate stopping of the manifest arising of ordinary appearance and fixation on it, accompanied by the resultant suffering; and [two,] the immediate abandoning of even the seeds [of that arising, fixation, and suffering].
As for the aspects to be eliminated, [the two phases entail two] processes to abandon them: [one,] that of abandoning thoughts fixated on the ordinary; and [two,] abandoning thoughts fixated on the sublime deity.
Further, since in the context of the ground, the six sense fields are physical manifestations and bliss is a mental manifestation, in the context of the path, there is need for two yogas: the yoga of the creation phase [related to] the body; and the yoga of the completion phase [related to] the mind.[13] Even with the attainment of the resultant phase of completion,[14] there are the [two] yogas, one [related to the body], the illusory body[15] of just wind and mind, and the other [related to] the mind, luminous clarity.
Finally, as for the results, there are exactly two [kinds]: ordinary powers and the supreme power [of awakening]. The two phases serve as the means to attain those two.
For these reasons, there are exactly two phases. The Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra states:[16]
Distinguishing between the common and superior Yields two types of familiarization:
The common, the four vajra rites, and the superior, the six branches.[17]

The order of meditation of the two phases cannot be categorically fixed due to differences in the faculties [of trainees]. in the majority of cases, however, the order of practice for an ordinary individual on the path to freedom of the highest mantra [system] is first to cultivate the phase of creation, and following that, the phase of completion. [nagarjuna’s] Five Stages states:[18]
For those firmly abiding in the creation phase Who aspire to the phase of completion
The perfect buddhas set forth this method in a way that resembles the steps of a ladder.[19]
To expand on that, many masters such as nagarjuna and his spiritual heirs have explained that one should first gain stability in the phase of creation and then cultivate the phase of completion. That viewpoint takes into consideration the necessity for those of weaker faculties who have not previously undergone training to rely first on the former yogas in order to generate the latter ones, comparable to climbing the steps of a ladder.
The great adepts saroruha, Durjayachandra,[20] and others have explained that one should cultivate the phase of creation in the first half of a formal meditation session and the phase of completion in the latter half. That viewpoint takes into consideration the necessity for those who have gained some facility or are practitioners of moderate faculties to train in the two phases alternately, comparable to taking footsteps.

Some Tibetan masters advise cultivation of the two phases simultaneously, right from the beginning. That viewpoint takes into consideration the suitability of those of sharp faculties who have gained perfect facility to cultivate both phases together, comparable to a bird in flight spreading both wings simultaneously.
In any case, those viewpoints agree with respect to the necessity for a gradual learner to practice first the creation phase and subsequently the completion phase in his or her training on the path to freedom.
Moreover, since the creation phase serves as a support and the completion phase is supported by it, the creation phase is practiced first. [as recorded in the Hevajra Tantra,] Vajragarbha[21] asked the Lord:[22] “The meaning of great-bliss innateness[23] is that of the phase of completion itself. What, then, is the use of the phase of creation?” To this question, the Lord replied: “owing to your confidence in the phase of completion, you are slipping away from the creation phase.” The Buddha then explained that creation is the support, and completion, the supported, like a flower and its fragrance.

[Hevajra Tantra] Two Examinations states:[24]
Without a body, where would bliss be?
one could not even speak of bliss.
animate beings are pervaded by bliss
Which pervades and is itself pervaded.
Just as fragrance rests in a flower
But without the flower cannot be sensed,
Likewise, without form, and so forth,
Bliss itself would not be experienced.[25]
To expand on that, an ordinary person entangled in the net of discursive thinking would be unable at the outset to train in the phase of completion which does not involve thoughts. Therefore, as stated in Vajragarbha’s Commentary [Epitomizing the Hevajra Tantra],[26] one first purifies the ordinary thought [process] by means of the yoga of creation which involves the conceptual elaborations [of the deity and the mandala]. Then, when one has understood the nature of thought, one embarks on the cultivation of the phase of completion, which is without thought and free from elaborations. This is comparable to first planting false millet in order to prepare the soil of a field and then planting rice once the field has been refined.[27]
Until one has given rise to an exceptionally stable realization of the natural state, the unfabricated completion phase, one must rely on the fabricated creation phase using imagination since such realization has not yet arisen. once realization has dawned, however, it is no longer necessary to deliberately cultivate those fabricated yogas, such as ordinary [types of] creation-phase practices involving imagination. This is comparable to a person needing to use a boat[28] to cross a river but dispensing with it once he has reached the opposite shore.

At the same time, the supreme [power] is not achieved by the phase of completion in absence of the phase of creation, nor by the phase of creation alone without the phase of completion. in order to attain [the state of] Vajradhara, which is union at the time of the result,[29] it is necessary, in the context of the path, to cultivate creation and completion as a union, not solely the appearance aspect or the emptiness aspect.
The phase of creation is the method for cultivating the [appearance emptiness] union. The phase of completion is the wisdom of the method. That being so, one must meditate on the two as a union. [atisha’s] Lamp for the Path states:[30]
It is taught that method without wisdom or wisdom in absence of method
Will inevitably leave one fettered. hence, neither should be neglected.[31]
One might question whether or not this contradicts the statement that once one has given rise to an exceptional phase of completion, the phase of imaginative creation is unnecessary. [To answer that question:] at that point, there indeed would be no need for deliberate cultivation of the phase of creation that is solely imaginative. What is definitely necessary, however, is that the appearance aspect manifest as the creation phase that is the illusory circle of deities.[32]

Ancient masters have spoken of three valid reasons why cultivation of the two phases leads to freedom.
The first concerns the presence of affinities, meaning the three continuums [ground, path, and result] sealed by one another.[33] The All-Secret Tantra states:[34]
The cause is sealed by the result; The result is sealed by the cause.
In the context of the ground, there exists a naturally present affinity, while the mind of the path is an evolving affinity. With the attainment of the result, one becomes lord of a family [of buddhas]. [That means] with [the naturally present affinity as] the substantial cause and [the evolving affinity as] the contributory cause both fully present, the result [i.e., the resultant affinity] is actualized.

The second reason concerns special skillful methods. skillful methods such as these [two phases] are highly effective as remedies to overcome confusion. The Hevajra [Tantra] states:[35]
Thoughts are purified by thoughts themselves. Existence is purified by existence itself.
Just as water that has entered the ear is drawn out [by flushing it] with more water,
Likewise, the notion of existence is purified by definite knowledge.[36]
Moreover, [the same tantra] states:[37]
The horrific karma by which a person is fettered, of whatever kind it may be, that in itself— When accompanied by a [skillful] method—
Will free him from the fetters of existence.[38]
Accordingly, the cessation of ordinary thoughts is effectively accomplished by thoughts of the deity. This is comparable to the way that thinking someone is one’s enemy can be simply stopped on the spot by thinking that the person is one’s friend, while applying another technique such as meditating that [the enemy] is empty would be difficult.
A simple reversal of ordinary desire is swiftly effected through meditation on [the union of] bliss and emptiness, while this would not occur in [meditation on] emptiness alone, or other ways. When intentionally generated desire is purified into [a state of] emptiness free from fixation, naturally arising desire will automatically be purified into [a state that is] free from fixation.

The third reason concerns the natures of three purities. (This serves as an extension of the first reason above [the affinities].) in this context, the three purities are the purity of the essential nature, the purity of the particular deities, and the purity of self-knowing awareness.
As for the first, in the context of the ground, the essential nature of all phenomena is emptiness and therefore pure. hence, it follows that meditation on emptiness in the creation and completion [phases] will lead to freedom, as this amounts to meditation on the nature of reality.
Second, since the bases to be meditated upon—the aggregates, elements, and so forth—are of the same natures as deities, it follows that [creation] meditation will actualize [the result].
Third, as earlier masters have explained, since even the appearance of the [deity’s] body with faces, arms, and so forth, is the mind, it follows that the completion phase will actualize [the result].[39]
Thus, it stands to reason that meditation with thought and without thought will lead to freedom.

<d e="2">
The initial step in cultivating pristine awareness in the phase of creation is to identify what is to be abandoned. The Indestructible Tent [Tantra] states:[1]
The right meditation has been proclaimed in order to conquer ordinary thoughts.
Thus, ordinary appearances and fixation on what is ordinary are to be abandoned.
Meditation practice [that entails] the appearance of the deity’s form and fixation on the deity immediately stops the manifest arising of [ordinary] appearances and fixation (which are to be abandoned). Moreover, by understanding the deity to be without inherent nature, apprehension of both ordinary appearances and the deity’s appearance as inherently real is also stopped. These [results] are due to [the practitioner] having earnestly applied remedies whose features specifically counteract each of the three—[ordinary] appearances, fixation, and apprehension of a [false] reality—individually.
This approach is in contrast to that of the way of the perfections.[2] in the perfections practice, one subdues emotional afflictions, which are the cause [of suffering], thereby simply stopping the arising of future suffering, the result. in this [creation phase], right from the start one transforms the truth of suffering, these impure appearances themselves, into a pure mandala, thereby immediately stopping the manifestation of suffering.
That being so, in the phase of creation, generating a clear image of the deity’s form is antidotal to ordinary form. cultivating the pride of being a heruka[3] or another [deity] is antidotal to [conceptions] such as ordinary human pride. Viewing what arises as being like an illusion is antidotal to apprehending experiences as inherently real. in the context of those [methods], once a clear image has arisen, immediately those [ordinary conceptions] will be stopped, and the clear image will easily arise again, like a clear image of a woman seen in the mind of someone who desires her. [Dharmakirti’s] Treatise on Valid Cognition states:[4]
Therefore, whether it be the true or untrue, if one becomes very familiarized with that and brings the process to its culmination, one will reap a clear, thought-free mind.[5]
Thus, once proficiency has been achieved, there will arise clarity of image in both what is true and what is untrue.

The varieties of creation methods have been presented in many formats, detailed and condensed. These methods may be classified as eight types or all contained in two [broad categories]. in the eightfold classification, the methods are as follows: creation based on transformation of the bases of purification; creation by means of strong intent; creation [like] the flash of a fish [as it springs] from water; creation based on the seed-syllable and name only; creation based on the essential mantra only; creation in three steps only; creation in three steps plus a seat; and creation based on the sun and moon together.
The first method is creation based on transformation of the bases of purification. an example would be the visualization of [white and red] spheres [of light] within the channels [of one’s body] and the heroes and heroines who arise from the transformation of those spheres.[6]
The second method is creation by means of strong intent. This is to imagine that [the deity] has fully manifested in an instant simply by bringing her to mind. it is a meditation that is spontaneous, dependent solely on will. This method is also called instantaneous creation.
The third method is creation [like] the flash of a fish [as it springs] from water. This is to imagine that [the deity suddenly] appears above a seat or within a celestial palace, like the springing of a fish from water or the swelling up of a bubble.
The fourth method is creation based on a seed-syllable or name only. an example would be [the visualization of the deity] as one says, “from i [arises] amoghasiddhi”; or, “from tam [arises] Tara.”

The fifth method is creation based on the essential mantra only.[7] an example would be to imagine that by saying “om amoghasiddhi svaha,” the body of amogasiddhi arises.
The sixth method is creation in three steps [only]. an example would be visualization [of the deity] as one says, “[The seed-syllable i appears.] From i [arises] a sword. From the sword [arises] amoghasiddhi.”
The seventh method is creation in three steps plus a seat. This is to visualize [the deity] by following the [previous] three steps, with the addition of a lotus and moon [seat] or a lotus and sun [seat].
The eighth method is creation based on the sun and moon together. This is to visualize [the deity] arising from a seed-syllable that stands between sun and moon [disks] joined together, or from a seed-syllable atop sun and moon [disks].
Those eight methods of creation of the deity may be condensed into two methods of creation known as “transformation of the bases” and “removal of the bases.” The first corresponds exactly to the first of the eight methods. [The second,] removal of the bases, refers to creation after the bases of purification have been cleared away through [meditation on] emptiness. This corresponds to the remaining seven ways [of creating the deity].
The [eight] methods may also be condensed into four types: creation of the full form all at once; creation based on only a seed-syllable; creation in three steps; and creation through the five [steps of] actual awakening.[8]
in this format, the first corresponds to the second and third [of the above eight methods]; the second, to the fourth and fifth; the third, to the sixth and seventh; and the fourth, to the eighth.

To the question of whether or not there are [specific] levels of yogins’ faculties [suited] to the stages of those various methods of creating the deity, one must answer in the affirmative. This is substantiated by the following citation from the Samvarodaya Tantra:[9]
For meditation on the creation-phase mandala,
The weak and mediocre should imagine the mandala,
While one of sharp faculties should meditate on the mandala that is mind itself, in an instant;
By means of the yoga performed in an instant one should meditate on the phase of completion.
The first [two] lines mean that the first two types of creation-phase practitioner—those of weak or mediocre faculties—create [the deity] gradually. [The second two lines] mean that the third type—of sharp faculties—does the method of creation of the full form all at once, which takes [only] an instant. The last two lines mean that even the full manifestation of the body of pristine awareness in the phase of completion is accomplished in an instant, as in the previous case (the sharp). an alternative interpretation would be, as stated in [abhayakaragupta’s] Garland of the Complete Yogas,[10] that creation performed instantaneously, called “the profound phase of creation” or “the superficial phase of completion,” is the method of deity yoga intended for a person of sharp faculties.

Whatever one’s type of faculties, after having cultivated the pristine awareness of the phase of creation according to [the methods] spoken of above, one will advance through the realizations [arising] from four yogas: the beginner’s stage; the descent of pristine awareness; a minimal degree of mastery of pristine awareness; and great mastery of pristine awareness.
The first stage, that of the beginner, starts with the meditation sequence of the four branches of familiarization and attainment[11] and includes everything up to the point of [being able] to visualize clearly the coarse deities in gradual steps but not visualize them clearly all at once.
The second stage, that of the descent of pristine awareness, is the point at which [one is able] to visualize clearly the mandala of coarse [deities] all at once but not visualize clearly the [subtle] deities of the sense fields [of the coarse deities], and so forth, all at once.
The third stage, known as that of a minimal degree of mastery or [simply] mastery of pristine awareness, is the point at which there is a clear visualization of all the deities of the sense fields [of the coarse deities] all at once. Everything up to that point will be accomplished by the phase of creation alone. Beyond that point, there will not arise [any realization if the meditation is] not conjoined with the phase of completion. however, meditation on the creation and completion [phases] together will enable one to emanate and reabsorb the mandala within subtle spheres, and the contrast between periods of formal meditation and post-meditation will disappear. if one [continues to] make an effort [in this], one will [be able to] remain in the contemplation of creation and completion with no distinction between day and night. This stage includes everything just prior to the point of unhindered performance of all the various types of activation rites based on meditative absorption.
The fourth stage, known as that of great or perfect mastery of pristine awareness, is the point at which there arise in a single instant the infinite, all-encompassing, clear images of contemplation, as well as the power to effect a multiplicity of benefits for sentient beings merely by intending to do so. [at this point,] the practitioner must have achieved not only total ultimate realization of the creation phase itself but also total realization of the completion phase from the warmth [stage][12] on.

Expositions on this [subject] all agree that the term “phase of creation” refers to the purification of birth, death, and the intermediate state in general, and the purification of the process of birth in particular.
Birth occurs in one of four ways, known as birth from a womb, birth from an egg, miraculous birth, and birth from heat and moisture. concerning [purification of] those four kinds of birth, there are two points of view: one, that each kind of birth requires its own specific method of purification; and the other, that the purification of one kind [automatically] purifies all the others. according to Lord [Karma] Trinlé,[13] one should assume that all forms of the creation phase incorporate two purification steps, that of environments and that of the inhabitants. Thus, the statement that “all four modes of birth will be purified by a single [method]” is true in that if one trains in these two steps of the creation phase—the purification of realms and the purification of sentient beings—one will eliminate what all [four kinds of birth] entail. in other words, this phase of creation acts as the yoga that effects purification of the impure environments and inhabitants in the same way that the training in purifying realms[14] in the way of the perfections does. That being the case, [the phase of creation] eliminates what all [kinds of birth] entail.

According to the system found in [pundarika’s] Great Commentary on the Kalachakra Tantra, miraculous birth is purified by the method of creation of the full form all at once [in which the deity is visualized] in
An instant. Birth from an egg is purified by twice creating the universe.[15] Birth from a womb is purified by yet another method, that of creation of the main and attendant deities by means of the two supremely victorious [contemplations].[16]
[pundarika’s] Great Commentary, [in discussing The Means of] attainment, the fifty-first chapter [of the Kalachakra Concise Tantra,] states:[17]
Hence, there are two ways of coming into life: one is birth from a womb, and the other, birth from an egg. Birth from an egg [corresponds to] the creation of the world because the word “egg” refers to the “egg of Brahma” [18] [from which the world is said to have arisen]. Birth from a womb is the way every human comes into being. instantaneous birth is the way sentient beings born in the miraculous mode enter life. That is a single-step process of coming into an existence since it occurs in a fraction of an instant simply due to the sentient being’s intention. This was spoken by the Buddha.
Although there are a great number of presentations based on tantras and commentaries by scholars and adepts, the above points should be regarded as the essence [of the subject].[19]

There are many different branches that form the visualization sequences[1] of the creation phase owing to the [various] approaches of the individual tantras and great masters. The Indestructible Garland, an explanatory tantra of the great yoga or general explanatory tantra, presents a framework for the various branches of the creation phase that consists of three contemplations. That [tantra] states:[2]
The initial union comprises yoga, subsequent yoga, superior yoga, and great yoga; great yoga consists of the supremely victorious mandala and the supremely victorious action.
The three contemplations are the contemplation of initial union, the contemplation of the supremely victorious action, and the contemplation of the supremely victorious mandala. altogether, there are six yogas when the yogas of the two supremely victorious [contemplations] are added to the four yogas[3] [listed in the above citation]. however, since the first four yogas are all included in the initial union, the expression “three contemplations,” or “three yogas,” is used.
These three form a broad framework [applicable] to the main body of the sadhana. Thus, they are found in both yoga tantra and great yoga tantra, as well as in both the father and mother tantras of great yoga.
All expositions evidently agree with the general statement that “the initial union amounts to a meditation procedure that fulfills primarily one’s own aims, and the two supremely victorious contemplations are meditation procedures that fulfill primarily others’ aims.” here, the intended meaning is simply that the complete awakening of oneself precedes the stage of application to others’ benefit.

<d e="2">
There are many ways in which the three contemplations are demarcated; these will not be set forth at this point. however, the essential meanings of the three are explained as follows:
[The first,] for which the body is the point of reference, consists of the contemplation of [oneself as] the main deities, male and female, who act as emanators of the [other] deities of the mandala. since this contemplation is done prior to the remaining two, it is [called] initial. since it inseparably unites method and wisdom, it is [called] union. To mention its principal points, initial union includes all [steps of the visualization] from the creation of the [mandala] residence up to the creation of the [main] male and female figures.
[The second,] the supremely victorious mandala, consists of [the visualization of] the entirety of the deities of the mandala who have emanated from the bodhichitta of those two [male and female main figures] and the arrangement [of the deities] in their respective places. Because [one visualizes] the entire mandala with its arrangement of mandala deities, [this contemplation is called] the supremely victorious mandala.[4]
[The third,] done subsequent to that, consists of deeds such as the purification of realms by all deities. Because these deeds are similar to the deeds of the Buddha, [this contemplation is referred to as] the supremely victorious action.
As explained above, this represents the system of the Indestructible Garland, a broad framework that encompasses both inner and outer yogas.[5]

The Mahamaya[6] and other tantras set forth the threefold [formulation consisting of] shape, mantra, and reality [yogas]. These three apply to both path and result; and within the path itself, to both the creation phase and the completion phase.
in the context of the creation phase, all the steps from the manifestation of the forms of the main deities up to the [contemplation of the] supremely victorious mandala constitute the yoga of shape. The supremely victorious action corresponds to the yoga of mantra. [The yoga of] the subtle sphere, and so forth,[7] constitute the yoga of reality. according to a different explanation, creation corresponds to the yoga of shape; recitation, to the yoga of mantra; and entering luminous clarity and emerging from it, to the yoga of reality.[8]

A number of other [tantras] teach three different yogas. in his Illuminating Lamp,[9] chandrakirti cites the splendid Net of Magical Manifestation: King of Tantras:[10]
Three kinds of yoga should be known:
That of consecration, imagination,
And the completion of the form itself.
These yogas are praised by all buddhas.
Generating pride through mantras’ blessings
Is said to be the consecration yoga.
The purified mind of awakening
Is a great source of secret-mantra seeds.
The complete form manifested in steps,
Imagined as a set of symbols,
Is taught as the ritual yoga
Referred to as imagination.
Instantaneous manifestation of pristine awareness
Endowed with the supreme of all aspects,
The performer of emanation and withdrawal,
Is said to be the yoga of completion.
As stated, there are three yogas: the yoga of imagination, the yoga of consecration, and the yoga of completion.
The first, the yoga of imagination, refers to creating, from within the state of emptiness and through the steps [of visualizing] the seed-syllable, insignia, and so forth, the complete form of the deity with faces and arms. This is the actual deity yoga of the phase of creation. Moreover, it includes all the steps in what is known as “the phase of completion with signs,” which entails visualization of syllables, spheres [of light], the emanating and withdrawing of light,[11] and so forth, and which, in terms of being [a method] to elicit bliss, is [considered to be] deity yoga.
The second, the yoga of consecration, refers to the consecration, by means of bliss and emptiness (the mantra), from which is instantly created the deity with faces and arms [at the stage of] body isolation; the inseparability of wind and mantra [at the stage of voice isolation]; and the bliss, and so forth, manifested in just an instant, without using imaginative techniques, [at the stage of] mind isolation, devoid of faces and arms.
The third, the yoga of completion, refers to the illusory body with faces and arms [at the stage of] union; and the great bliss [at the stage of] luminous clarity, devoid of faces and arms.[12] The five stages [of the completion phase] are included in this [yoga]. The way [this last yoga] itself applies to the phase of creation alone is easily understood.[13]

The Net of Magical Manifestation of Manjushri[14] presents four sets of actual awakenings: the actual awakening in an instant; the actual awakenings in five parts; the actual awakenings in twenty parts; and the actual awakenings by means of the net of magical manifestation.
These four sets of actual awakenings constitute a major framework that encompasses all three continuums[15] and form twelve [branches] when each of the four is divided into the three contexts—ground, path, and result.[16] in the context of the path, each set pertains to both the creation [phase] and the completion [phase]. here, in the context of the phase of creation, the four are considered from two perspectives: that of one continuous sequence of visualization; and that of the distinct steps of the methods.
As for the first, one continuous sequence of visualization, the actual awakening in an instant corresponds to [meditation on] emptiness; the actual awakenings in five parts correspond to the completion of the form [of the deity]; the actual awakenings in twenty parts, [the steps] from urging with songs the molten [form of the deity][17] up to [merging] with the pristine-awareness deities as a single flavor; and the actual awakenings by means of the net of magical manifestation, the yoga of the subtle sphere.[18] The correspondences of the first, second, and last are easily understood. The third, the set of actual awakenings in twenty parts, corresponds to [urging with songs, etc.] in that [the twenty parts] are related to the number of the ten winds, the life wind, and so forth, and the winds of the ten mandalas, which emerge after the child is born.[19]

</d>
<d e="2">
As for the second, the distinct steps of the methods, there are many comprehensive presentations of the visualization procedures for each of the four sets. That being said, an example of the first, the actual awakening in an instant, would be the method of creation of the full forms of all the deities all at once or creation by means of the yoga of completion formulated by the master abhayakara[20] for the sake of practitioners of sharpest faculties. an example of the actual awakenings in five parts would be the sadhana of the circle of yoginis taught in the eighth chapter of the first examination of the Hevajra Tantra [Two Examinations].[21] an example of the actual awakenings in twenty parts would be the sadhana of the Blessed one [i.e., the main deity] through the step called urging with songs the molten [form of the deity] taught in the fifth chapter of the second examination of the Hevajra Tantra [Two Examinations].[22] (here, the meaning of “twenty” is as explained in a previous [section] according to the Commentaries by the Bodhisattvas.[23] according to other commentaries, [twenty] refers to ten causal factors for creation and ten resultant factors.)[24] an example of the actual awakenings by way of the net of magical manifestation would be the capacity, owing to the force of the yogin’s perfect knowledge, to emanate and transform mandalas perceptible by those to be guided.
Of those four sets of awakenings, one should understand in detail the set of awakenings in five parts since the use of this expression is often found in yoga tantras and the highest tantras. The set [of five] should be regarded as follows:
The root [tantra] and commentaries of Secret Manjushri[25] explain that the five actual awakenings are of the natures of the five pristine awarenesses, the mirror-like and the others,[26] and teach meditation [cultivated] by means of intentional imagination. [That entails] step-by-step visualizations that are in accordance with the focuses of contemplation specific to these awakenings.[27]

The Summation of Essential Principles, [the root scripture of] yoga tantra, correlates the five awakenings with five mantras. it teaches an intentional application of the five pristine awarenesses by means of the five awakenings, which [in this system] are called “discerning knowledge of mind,” “resolve of the mind of awakening,” “vajra of stability,” “essential nature of the vajra,” and “equality with all transcendent ones.”[28] a similar explanation is found in the Indestructible Peak [Tantra].[29] The Vajradaka and Samputa tantras [30] present a slightly different way of meditating on those same five mantras.
Followers of the arya [nagarjuna] tradition of Guhyasamaja,[31] in [the context of] creation of the original lord,[32] refer to the five awakenings by the names “awakening by means of essential reality,” “awakening by means of the moon [disk],” “awakening by means of the seed-syllable,” “awakening by means of the insignia,” and “awakening by means of the manifestation of the complete form [of the deity].”[33]
The Luipa[34] system of chakrasamvara presents the five as follows:
[one imagines] the vowels and consonants [of the sanskrit alphabet] appearing on a reddish-white moon. The vowels and the white hue represent the mirror-like [pristine awareness]; the consonants and red hue, [the pristine awareness of] sameness; seed-syllable hum [in their midst] (the causal vajra-holder),[35]
the discerning [pristine awareness]; the emanating and withdrawing [of rays of light from the hum], all-accomplishing [pristine awareness]; and the instantaneous manifestation of the residence and resident [deities], the pristine awareness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena.
The Hevajra [Tantra] states:[36]
The moon is said to be mirror pristine awareness,
The sun,[37] the pristine awareness of sameness,
One’s deity’s insignia with the seed-syllable
Is the pristine awareness of discernment,
All becoming one, the active pristine awareness,
Full manifestation, the pure ultimate dimension:
These steps which were taught by the wise
Constitute the meditation of five parts.[38]
Thus, [the Hevajra Tantra] presentation [of five awakenings] differs from those of the approaches mentioned above.

In the Kalachakra system, the moon with the vowels represents [awakening by means of] mirror[-like] pristine awareness. The sun with the consonants is [awakening by means of] the pristine awareness of sameness. The syllable hum, [which symbolizes] the scent-eater,[39] is [awakening by means of] discerning pristine awareness. The merging of all these into one, endowed with the syllable hi, [which symbolizes] the life wind, is [awakening by means of] accomplishing pristine awareness. That merging into one gives rise to the full manifestation of the [deity’s] form, which, endowed with the syllable ham[40] [symbolizing] consciousness, represents [awakening by means of] the pristine awareness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena.[41] Thus, the deity is complete as the essence of akshobhya.
It is due to distinctions in the pristine awareness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena that, inwardly, there are five pristine awarenesses. For this reason, outwardly, in the mandala, akshobhya [i.e., the Kalachakra arising from the pristine awareness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena] radiates five lights.
The [above] synopsis accords with the viewpoints of the majority [of scholars] in this tradition [of Kalachakra]. While that is so, the five actual awakenings as treated here accord for the most part with the hevajra [tantra]. according to that tantra, concisely put, there are five bases of purification: semen, ovum, scent-[eater, i.e., intermediate being], life wind, and consciousness. [Vajragarbha’s] Commentary [Epitomizing the Hevajra Tantra] states:[42]
The body that is fully formed by the five—
Semen, ovum, mantra [syllables],
Life force, and consciousness—
Is called the full manifestation of form.
Thus, there are five means of purification: the moon, sun, [and the syllables] hum, hi, and ham. The results of purification are also five in number: the five pristine awarenesses (or five victorious ones).[43] These [bases, means, and results of purification] form three groups: [one,] semen, moon, indestructible body, Vairochana; [two,] ovum, sun, indestructible speech, Ratnasambhava; and [three,] scent[-eater], syllable hum, indestructible mind, akshobhya. These groups, set forth in this way, stem from the system of the Net of Magical Manifestation.

The Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra states:[44]
In all of the yoga tantras[45] Ever praised by the yogin:
First is the rite of familiarization, second, that of near attainment, Third, the method of attainment, and fourth, that of great attainment.
It is taught that all the aspects of yoga are included in this four-branch [sequence].[46] as well, the same source states:[47]
Distinguishing between the common and superior Yields two types of familiarization:[48]
The common, the four vajra rites; and the superior, the six branches.[49]
Thus, the common type is considered to be the four[-branch sequence of] familiarization and attainment of the phase of creation; and the superior type, the four[-branch sequence of] familiarization and attainment [formulated] in six branches. These [four branches] are the main principles to be understood by yogins. hence, [the above citation] says “ever praised by the yogin.”

In the context of the Guhyasamaja system, the methods of practice for the common type of four-branch [sequence] are presented differently in the two [commentarial] traditions of Guhyasamaja, [that of arya nagarjuna and that of Jnanapada].

The arya tradition [of Guhyasamaja][50] sets forth the four branches as follows:[51] The familiarization branch comprises [the steps] up to and including the first [of the five] actual awakenings, [awakening by means of essential reality].[52] it is [known as] “familiarization” because supreme awakening is aimed at emptiness, and this branch effects the familiarization of pristine awareness, the subject, with emptiness, the object.[53]

The branch of near attainment comprises [the steps] from the previous step up to and including the full manifestation of the body mandala.[54] it is “near attainment” because [this branch brings about] attainment of the enjoyment dimension of mantras, which is near [in terms of resemblance] to the enjoyment dimension of pristine awareness,[55] and because [this branch brings about] the attainment of the sense fields of the deities.[56]
The branch of attainment comprises [the steps] from the previous step up to and including [the moment of] passion.[57] it is “attainment” because [in this branch] one attains [the realization of] the sameness of one’s body, speech, and mind and the lords of mantras, [the three syllables that symbolize] the indestructible bodies, voices, and minds of the buddhas.[58]
The branch of great attainment comprises [the steps] from making offerings[59] up to and including complete dissolution [of the mandala and the circle of deities].[60] it is “great attainment” because it brings about the attainment [of the power] to benefit others in great measure and completes the three beings (pledge-being, contemplation-being, and pristine-awareness being), which are [known as] one’s own mantras, [61] and the crowning by the lord of the family.[62]

The way a beginner’s powers are gained through applying the four branches is as follows: The familiarization branch comprises all four branches of familiarization and attainment as just described. The branch of near attainment consists in [the practice known as] “exhorting the mind” as taught in the tenth chapter [of the Guhyasamaja] [63] which is done after having implemented [various forms of] tantric conduct. The attainment branch consists of the [forms of tantric] conduct of the creation phase and the fierce rite.[64] The branch of great attainment consists of the activation rites of appeasement, and so forth, and the implementation of powers.[65]
The Jnanapada tradition[66] presents [each of] the four branches in three procedures—minor, intermediate, and major—to yield a total of twelve [steps].
The minor four-branch procedure[67] is as follows: The main body of the familiarization branch consists in generation as the causal vajra-holder; the creation of the mandala in the womb [of the main female deity] and the conferral of the initiation of compassion on sentient beings; [the two deities] melting due to the intermediate being entering [the womb mandala], and then [the deities] being urged by the songs of the four goddesses and [subsequently] arising as the resultant vajra-holders;[68] and recitation of the mantra [om dharmadhatu svabhavatmako ham] with the pride of being perfect awakening.[69]
Near attainment consists in the consecration of the sense fields.[70] attainment consists in the consecration of one’s body, speech, and mind by the three lords of all, [the mantras],[71] the indestructible bodies, voices, and minds [of the buddhas]; and the drawing in of the pristine-awareness deities.
Great attainment consists in the vajra being who resembles oneself (the three-beings placement) and the initiation (the sealing with the lord of the family [as a crown ornament]).[72]
In the intermediate four-branch procedure, the four branches are carried out in their entirety in the manner just outlined, this time for the [central] female [deity] figure.[73]
The major four-branch procedure consists of the supremely victorious mandala[74] in which the four branches are fulfilled in their entirety, this time for the retinue, in the creation of the mandala within the womb of the [central] female deity and the emanation of the retinue.[75]

Thus, [in the Jnanapada system,] creation of the pledge deity constitutes familiarization; consecration of the sense fields, near attainment; the consecration of the awakened bodies, voices, and minds, attainment; and initiation plus sealing [with the lord of the family], great attainment.[76]
There are various other ways of presenting the four-[branch sequence of] familiarization and attainment in the context of the phase of creation. however, in the system of Kalachakra, the four branches must be understood both in relation to the bases of purification and in relation to the purificatory means.
As to the first, the bases of purification, the initial formation of the child’s body [in the womb] is said to be [the basis of purification by means of] familiarization; the development of speech following birth, [by means of] near attainment; the loss of the baby teeth and growth of the adult teeth, [by means of] attainment; and the experience of orgasm at the age of sixteen years, [by means of] great attainment.[77]
As to the second, the purificatory means, the main body of the familiarization branch consists in, first, meditation on the four gateways to freedom;[78] then, the dissolution of the seed-syllable of vowels and consonants; and finally, the full manifestation of the body [of the deity] by means of the five actual awakenings.[79]
Near attainment [begins with the step called] urging with songs the molten form. This corresponds to the stage in the womb (in the case of a being who is to be born from a womb) in which the five types of winds, those of earth, water, fire, wind, and space, compel the being—whose consciousness is like that of the dream state—to take birth in the outer world—which is like the waking state.[80] [after that are the steps called] the supremely victorious action and the drawing in of the pristine-awareness deities. These correspond to what follows birth, the activation of the child’s sense faculties and the concurrent development of speech and its functioning due to the flow of the life wind.[81]
Attainment consists in the [step called] yoga of vital essence. Great attainment consists in the [step called] subtle yoga.[82]

The Red Yamari and Black Yamari tantras state:[83]
Meditate on yoga as the first step, subsequent yoga as the second, superior yoga as the third step, and great yoga as the fourth.
To expand on that:[84]
The manifestation of Vajrasattva should be declared to be the yoga.
The particular deity of a concordant cause is referred to as the subsequent yoga.[85]
The manifestation of the entire retinue is the meditation of the superior yoga.
The consecration of the deity’s eyes, and so forth,
And that of the awakened bodies, voices, and minds,
Drawing in the pristine-awareness mandala,
Tasting the nectar, and worship by means
Of vast offerings and words of praise:
These are considered to be the great yoga.
In that way, these four yogas are expounded in the Yamari cycle of tantras. The Buddhasamayoga[86] sets forth [four yogas whose] names and meanings for the most part correspond to these. Moreover, Secret Moon Essence[87] describes four yogas—yoga, subsequent yoga, close yoga, and superior yoga—all of which are definitely related in one way or another to the four branches of familiarization and attainment.
According to the famous Indestructible Garland system, yoga is generally [defined as] the inseparable union of method and wisdom as is taught in the Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra. in this context, however, yoga entails contemplation of the [causal] vajra-holder as having the nature of the pristine awareness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena, which has been manifested by means of the five actual awakenings.[88]

As for the subsequent yoga, shantipa explains the meaning of “subsequent” as “resembling.” This yoga is therefore carried out in a way that resembles the five yogas[89] and is the yoga of the resultant vajra-holder.[90]
The superior yoga is a deity yoga that is much more extensive than the previous two. it involves the union of the male and female deities and the full manifestation of the retinue of deities, which is first created in the lotus and then emanated forth and arranged in its respective place.[91]
The great yoga follows the superior yoga. as explained by shridhara,[92] this yoga comprises the steps of consecration as the awakened bodies, voices, and minds, and so forth, the drawing in of the pristine-awareness deities, and initiation plus sealing [with the lord of the family], offering and praise, tasting the nectar, and recitations [of mantra], up to and including the request that the pristine-awareness mandala depart and the withdrawal of the pledge deities.[93]
In [nagarjuna’s] Brief [Sadhana of Guhyasamaja], all four of the yogas being implemented in the initial union itself represents the system of the Indestructible Garland Tantra. [The four yogas] are not applied in their entirety to each individual deity but are performed, for the most part, within the scope of meditation on the circle [of deities] of the mandala.

The Circle of the Sun of the Rali tantras states:[94]
As a sphere, as water, as form, and as what is beyond form:
The tantras are truly none other Than those four types of dwelling.
Thus, all aspects of the phase of creation are considered to be included in the four dwellings.
Dwelling as a sphere comprises [the steps] from the creation of the causal vajra-holder up to and including the emanation of the goddesses of the retinue.
Dwelling as water comprises [the steps] of the male and female deities being in union and their consequent transformation into seminal fluid.
Dwelling as form comprises the steps from urging [the deities] with songs [to reappear] from that [fluid] and their arising as the resultant vajra-holders, up to and including initiation and sealing [by the lord of the family].
Dwelling as that which is beyond form follows [dwelling as form] and comprises the steps up to and including the dissolution of the mandala of the contemplation that is like the tip of a flame.[95]
This framework of four dwellings represents the perspective of Drokmi[96] and his followers. in addition to that, there are a great number of subtle designations of ways of correlation and frameworks of correlation, such as Maitripa’s condensation [of the practice] into the four seals.[97]

The Indestructible Tent states:[98]
Having manifested the buddhas’ place
One meditates on the five aspects,
The actual nature of samantabhadra,
Doing the sadhana of one’s favored deity.
With the mandala display complete,
One carries out the meditation sequence
Of offering, praise, tasting nectar, and so forth:
This is considered to be the six-branch yoga.
That [verse] provides a general description from which stem extensive discussions. This system resembles that of the [Hevajra Tantra] Two Examinations and its commentaries composed by Durjayachandra and others[99] in that it incorporates all of the various practices of the phase of creation in the six branches based on distinctions of nature or family.[100] in this, there is parallelism with there being six practices or six branches[101] for the liberative phase of completion and with there being six families [of buddhas] at the time of ultimate fruition.

That being so, in this context of the purificatory means, the six branches are defined in the following way:
The creation of the residence, the celestial palace and its world system, and the creation of the resident [male and female] deities constitute the branch of Vairochana, or that of earth.[102] This is because form or body is the residence of all deities. Vairochana is the essence of the form aggregate of all transcendent ones. hence, the creation of the celestial palace residence is based on that [branch of Vairochana].
The tasting of nectar is the branch of amitabha, or that of water. This is because amitabha represents indestructible speech. By tasting nectar, indestructible speech is satisfied.
Praise is the branch of Ratnasambhava, or that of fire. This is because what is called “praise” is the declaration of a person’s qualities. When five aspects [of the awakened state] are distinguished—awakened body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities—Ratnasambhava represents the awakened qualities.
Offering is the branch of amoghasiddhi, or that of wind. This is because amoghasiddhi represents the action family, and therefore has the power [to perform] the actions of making offerings to buddhas and serving the welfare of beings.
Initiation is the branch of akshobhya, or that of space. This is because the initiation of akshobhya is the water initiation, and water is the essence of akshobhya.[103]
Passion is the branch of Vajrasattva, or that of pristine awareness. This is because it is during the act of passion that the deities of the retinue are emanated from the bodhichitta of the main male and female deities. in order for that to occur, the main deities must engage in the act of passion and that [passion] itself is explained as being Vajrasattva.[104]

According to the omniscient Lord of Dharma [Dolpopa sherab Gyaltsen][107] and his disciples, the main points [of the creation phase] of the Kalachakra system are all contained in four branches:[108] [one,] full manifestation of the form, the branch of familiarization or the supremely victorious mandala; [two,] the branch of near attainment or the supremely victorious action; [three,] full manifestation of the vital essence, the branch of attainment or the yoga of vital essence; and [four,] full manifestation of bliss, the branch of great attainment or the subtle yoga.[109]
However, the majority of lineage holders of the past, principally the followers of Tsami[110] such as the eminent [Third Karmapa] Gyalwa Rangjung,[111] adhered to a formulation of twelve branches: [one,] creation of the celestial palace and the seats [of the deities]; [two,] creation of the main figures, male and female, by means of the five actual awakenings; [three,] the creation of the mandala of the residence and residents in the womb of the female deity and subsequent emission, which constitutes the supremely victorious mandala; [four,] drawing into the [deities of the] mandala all sentient beings of the six classes and conferring initiation on them; [five,] urging with songs the main figures, male and female, who have melted, [to reappear]; [six,] the reappearance, in three steps, of the main [deities] in their form dimensions; [seven,] the dissolution of the deities of the mandala [into the main figures] and the creation and emission [of the deities], which constitute the supremely victorious action; [eight,] summoning and drawing in the pristine-awareness deities; [nine,] initiation; [ten,] sealing by the lord of the family and consecration by means of the four vajras; [eleven,] the yoga of vital essence; and [twelve,] the subtle yoga. Furthermore, those lineage holders correlated the twelve branches with the elements to be purified (the twelve links of dependent origination of existence) and with the results of purification (the twelve aspects of the meaning of truth),[112] and so forth.

[certain requirements must be fulfilled] in order to cultivate the visualization sequences that consist of the branches just described. To begin with, the meditator must possess three special qualities, along with [knowledge of] the methods of mind training in the common and uncommon paths. These qualities have been discussed in previous [sections of the Infinite Ocean of Knowledge].[1] in particular, motivated by a firm conviction in the indestructible way, the individual must have received the ripening initiation and must abide by the pledges and vows that he or she has accepted at the time of the initiation. The Sarvabuddhasamayoga states:[2]
He who has never entered a pure mandala,
Or has forsaken all his pledges and vows,
Or lacks knowledge of the secret principle,
In spite of practice, will accomplish nothing.[3]

The [type of] place needed for cultivation of the phase of creation is described in the Guhyasamaja Root Tantra:[4]
Practice in regions of great isolation
Where flowers and fruit [trees] adorn
And in the seclusion of the mountains;
There, all types of powers are gained.[5]
[Buddhashrijnana’s Sadhana Called] Samantabhadra states:[6]
Somewhere in a mountainous region,
With the beauty of fine and stately trees
And the finest crystal-clear waters,
One should practice, Lord Manjushri.[7]
Furthermore, most sadhanas speak of [staying] “in a place that is secluded and pleasant.” accordingly, a place used for general purposes should be one that is isolated and where all the necessary elements are available. places used for specific purposes are described in the chapter [Means of] attainment [of the Kalachakra Concise Tantra]:[8]
Be it a lovely grove of trees, a mountain, a place of Buddhist pilgrimage, a deserted shrine of a god,
A place where an adept [has stayed], a charnel ground, the shore of a lake or [other water-side setting], an auspicious location, or a concealed site—
In whatever place you feel perfectly content—there you should practice, o King!
A lovely grove of trees is the ideal place to do dominating and summoning rites; a mountain, to do [rites of] stupefying, paralyzing, and piercing with daggers [obstructive forces]; a place where the Buddha [stayed] (i.e., the location of a major reliquary of the Buddha),[9] to gain the eight powers;[10] a deserted shrine of a god or the shores of a large body of water or similar setting, to do [the rites of] driving out and separating. a [power] place where an accomplished master has stayed is ideal for attaining power related to the action seal;[11] a charnel ground, for secret practice;[12] a lake or auspicious location (i.e., a rich and thriving settlement or town), for [rites of] appeasement and enrichment;[13] a well-concealed hollow in the earth or a rock cave, for gaining sovereignty over the three worlds [i.e., awakening].
Furthermore, it is said that one should practice in any place that seems agreeable and where one feels content; simply stated, this means a place in consonance with one’s own disposition.

A beginning practitioner of the mantra way, in the majority of cases, will more easily achieve clarity of the visualized image by cultivating deity yoga at night. once stability [in that clarity] has been gained, he or she can meditate at all times, throughout day and night.
As for duration, someone who is practicing mainly the phase of creation, or wishes [to gain] ordinary powers, or wishes to carry out subtle activation rites using special techniques[14] [should] meditate until he or she has attained stability in terms of clarity of image in deity yoga. That is said to be accomplished normally within a year.
As for the time needed to achieve results in ordinary activation rites such as fire offering and yantra,[15] a person who abides by the pledges, is energetic and persevering, and shows strong determination in the application of the rites—even if he or she has not gained stability in terms of clarity of visualized image—can still succeed in these activations by reciting the prescribed number of mantras in the manner set forth [in the tantras]. one should therefore meditate for as long as that requires.

There are three steps preliminary to cultivating contemplative equipoise: [giving sacrificial food offerings, visualizing a circle of protection, and fostering positive potential and pristine awareness].
The first is making sacrificial [food] offerings[17] to [non-human] obstructive beings in order to appease them. This is done in the following way: in one’s place of practice, one assembles all the [requisite] ritual articles. Then, while keeping to the specifications [in the sadhana] regarding meditation posture, the direction to face, meditation mat, and so forth, one offers sacrificial [food] to elemental spirits[18] before [any other step]. Two Examinations states:[19]
At this point, to propitiate the elemental spirits by making sacrificial offerings will bring excellent [results] to yogins.[20]
The Ocean of Dakinis Tantra and saroruha’s elucidation of that tantra[21] explain that, as the first step in sadhana practice, one [should] make a sacrificial offering. This offering serves to pacify obstacles caused by obstructive forces and misleading [spirits]. Two Examinations states:[22]
In order to protect the lives of all beings against obstructive and misleading forces,
Vajrasattva prescribed sacrificial offerings.

<d e="2">
The second step consists in visualizing a circle of protection in order to dispel adverse conditions. There are many [types of] protection circles described [in the tantras]. The common protection circle entails imagining such details as the ground, enclosing fence, and tent, [all] formed of vajra-crosses.[23] The special protection circle [involves meditation] on ten wrathful deities arranged on the spokes of a ten-spoked golden wheel,[24] who annihilate all obstructive forces.[25] Both those methods are described in the Indestructible Tent and in the Guhyasamaja tantras.
Abhayakaragupta explains that for the protection circles of most sadhanas [one visualizes] the deity humkara positioned at the hub of the wheel, with tenwrathful figures onthe spokes. he also discusses the various actions [to be carried out] in cases of obstructive forces causing serious harm, such as summoning the obstructive forces and piercing them with daggers.[26]
For the protection circle in the chakrasamvara cycle of tantras, [one imagines] wrathful deities positioned on the spokes of an eightor tenspoked wheel[27] within a common protection circle [i.e., the vajra tent], who pierce [obstructive forces] with daggers, and so forth. [as another method,] by [uttering] the four-faced mantra, the cardinal and intermediate directions are sealed; then, the female guardians of the gates and the intermediate directions arise from that mantra and pierce [obstructive forces] with daggers, and so on.[28]

The third step comprises two types of fostering [that of positive potential and that of pristine awareness] in order to establish conducive conditions.
The fostering of positive potential is described in the Indestructible Tent:[29]
offerings to one’s master, a vajra-holder, perfect fulfillment of the sevenfold [service], Forming the mind of awakening, …[30]
The fostering of pristine awareness is explained in the Indestructible Tent, Two Examinations, and other scriptures, as meaning meditation on emptiness. one meditates on the meaning of the mantra om svabhava [shuddhah sarva dharmah svabhava shuddho ham]: all phenomena—the apprehended and [oneself,] the apprehender—are naturally pure, devoid of inherent nature, emptiness; and on the meaning of the mantra om shunyata [jnana vajra svabhavatmako ham]: [oneself is] the essential nature of the indivisibility of such emptiness, which is the object, and pristine awareness, the subject.
To expand, all phenomena are primordially devoid of an inherent essence, nature, or identity, and are therefore free from all elaborations of superimposition: unborn emptiness. according to the works of great tantric adepts, once one has resolved that with certainty and become well acquainted with that view, one brings to mind that [unborn emptiness]. someone who is not well acquainted with that view must ascertain the emptiness [of all phenomena] through examination. some scholars call these two approaches “forceful meditation on emptiness” and “meditation on emptiness based on examination,” respectively.[31]

Some texts state that at this point [of the sadhana] one meditates on emptiness following the dissolution of the environment and inhabitants into luminous clarity. To do that, however, one needs both to remain without any conceptions once the appearances of the environment and inhabitants have been withdrawn into luminous clarity and to have present in one’s mind the emptiness that is the meaning of [the above] mantras.
Some assert that, at this point, in order to generate a clear visualization of the pure residence and pure resident deities, and so forth, one meditates that the impure environment along with its inhabitants is a voidness that is nothing whatsoever. however, this is not what is meant [by contemplation on emptiness].
The purpose of contemplation on emptiness is as explained by Lord atisha [in his Analysis of the Sequence of Visualization]:[32]
The reason for saying the two mantras[33] three times each in that way is to enable one to realize emptiness, to nurture one’s awareness of emptiness, to abide firmly [in the understanding of emptiness], to perfect the fostering of pristine awareness, to overcome ordinary concepts of body, speech, and mind, and to understand the residence and the resident [deities] as the [magical] display of emptiness.

The visualization of the celestial palace of residence is the first step in entering the main practice of the creation phase. The base for the generation of the palace, according to most of the principal texts, is the creation of a tetrahedral source of phenomena, the tiers of the [four] elements, and so forth.[34] There are several different presentations of the visualization of the base:
As one way, a vajra-cross is generated from the melting of the tiers of the [four] elements, and the celestial palace is created in the center of that.
As another, the celestial palace is created from the melting of the tiers of elements, and so forth, within a tetrahedron and in the center of a multicolored lotus and vajra-cross.
As another, the celestial palace is created within a tetrahedron and on top of a multicolored lotus and vajra-cross, without the tiers of the elements.
As yet another, both the celestial palace and deity are created simultaneously above the tiers of elements and Mount Meru and in the center of a multicolored lotus and vajra-cross.
In addition, there are various other descriptions, such as the celestial palace generated from the syllable bhrum; from a wheel; from the melting of [the form of] Vairochana; and so forth.
As to [the form of] the celestial palace, Two Examinations states:[35]
The Teacher described the mandala as four-sided and glowing radiantly,
With four portals, utterly resplendent,
Bedecked with jewel tassels and loops, a variety of garlands and yak-tail fans,
And beautified by eight supporting pillars.
The Abhidhana Tantra states:[36]
With a portal on each of four sides, it is ornamented by four archways,
Beautified by lattices and streamers, adorned with garlands and banners.
Details such as these are found in all the different tantras.[37]

The [systems of] chakrasamvara, hevajra, and other tantras explain that charnel grounds are to be imagined outside the celestial palace. The Samvarodaya Tantra instructs one to imagine the charnel ground within the vajra fence [i.e., between the palace and the vajra fence]; the Vajradaka [tantra], beyond the garland of light [i.e., beyond the flames surrounding the vajra fence]. [The names of] the charnel grounds are stated in the Samvarodaya Tantra:[38]
Violently hostile; Wild Thicket;
Blazing Vajra; place of skeletons;
In the northeast, Terrifying Laughter;
The southeast, supreme auspiciousness;
The southwest, Fearsome Darkness;
And the northwest, sounding Kili Kili.[39]
Special features of each charnel ground, such as the tree and guardian of the direction, are also described extensively [in the tantras].[40]
An additional element related to the celestial palace is the visualization of seats [formed of] a lotus, and so forth, for all deities of the mandala within the palace.

<d e="2">
Upon completion of the creation of the residence (the celestial palace as well as the seats), one meditates upon the entire circle of the resident deities. There are three main methods to perform that creation: creation by means of the five actual awakenings; creation in four vajra steps; and creation by means of three rites. (These three sets should be correlated with the last three lines, respectively, [of the above root text].)
The first of these entails the following visualizations: [First, one imagines that] above a seat formed of a lotus, and so forth, a moon disk arises from the vowels. [second,] a sun disk arises from the consonants. [Third,] between the two disks is imagined the insignia of the deity marked with the seed-syllable, from which light is emanated and then withdrawn. [Fourth,] all these elements merge. [Fifth,] from the merged elements, the body of the deity fully manifests.
Those steps are referred to as “creation by means of the five actual awakenings,” which Two Examinations explains as being awakening by means of mirror[-like] pristine awareness (the moon); awakening by means of the pristine awareness of sameness (the sun); awakening by means of the discerning pristine awareness (the seed-syllable and insignia); awakening by means of the pristine awareness of accomplishment (the merging of everything); and awakening by means of the pristine awareness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena (the full manifestation of the deity’s body).
In major tantric texts, one finds other versions of the five actual awakenings having the same names but differing in meaning. however, it is generally explained that the moon symbolizes the white vital essence; the sun, the red vital essence; and the seed-syllable, the consciousness of the intermediate-state being. The merging of all these elements corresponds to conception; and the full manifestation of the deity’s body, to birth from a womb.

The second is creation in four vajra steps. in this procedure, [the first step is] to meditate on emptiness. [The second is] to imagine, positioned on a lotus, sun, and other seats, a moon, sun, and seed-syllable, from which lights emanate and then converge. [The third is] to imagine the full manifestation of the deity resulting from that [converging of the lights and transformation of the seed-syllable]. [The fourth is] to visualize three syllables at the deity’s three places [head, throat, and heart], and so forth.[41] These four vajra steps are taught in the Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra, as well as in Two Examinations:[42]
First is the awakening by means of emptiness, second is the converging upon the seed-syllable, Third is full manifestation of the [deity’s] body, and fourth is placement of the syllables;
By means of these four vajra steps one should perform the ordinary familiarization practice.
The third is creation by means of three vajra rites. in this procedure, [the first rite is] to imagine the deity’s seed-syllable on a seat formed of a lotus, sun, and so forth. [The second rite is] to imagine that the seed-syllable transforms into the [deity’s] insignia marked by the [same] seed-syllable. [The third rite is] to imagine that the insignia transforms into the full manifestation of the deity’s body. These rites are taught in Two Examinations and other tantras.

The above three sets constitute general descriptions of creation methods. in addition, there are many specifications, such as including or not including [the step known as] urging with songs the molten form [of the deity]; requiring or not requiring both the causal vajra-holder and resultant vajra-holder; and so on.
The symbolism of the step of urging with songs being included [in a sadhana] is explained as follows: at a time when there are no beings suitable to be trained, the buddhas abide exclusively in the dimension of great bliss. When the time comes to train beings, the buddhas manifest in form bodies and then perform deeds that will serve the welfare of sentient beings. corresponding [to the manifesting of buddhas] is the [step of] urging [the deity] with songs [to arise from] the molten form, as a result of which [the deity] manifests. as to the symbolism of [the sadhana] not including the step of urging with songs, [it is explained that] the buddhas, for the benefit of others, may continuously abide as form bodies, not disappearing for even a single instant. corresponding to that, [the step of] urging with songs is absent [from some sadhanas].
The creation of the causal and the resultant vajra-holders may be carried out in different ways. Both may be created by means of the five actual awakenings or else by following the three rites. also, the causal vajra-holder and the resultant vajra-holder may be identical in color and [number and appearance of] faces and arms or may be dissimilar. There are many variations, and therefore this creation is not restricted to a single way.

Moreover, the creation of the deities of the retinue may be performed in various ways: creation by means of the five actual awakenings, creation by means of the three rites, or creation based on the essential seed-syllable alone.
Most sadhanas include [the step known as] the placement of the three beings [the pledge-being, the pristine-awareness being, and the contemplation-being]. The pledge-being means the particular deity generated through ritual steps[43] and therefore is one and the same as the deity [being meditated upon]. The pristine-awareness being is imagined at the heart of the pledge deity on seats such as a lotus, sun, and so forth. it may be visualized in different ways: as a deity identical to the pledge deity; as a deity unlike the pledge deity in color and [appearance and number of] faces and arms; or as an insignia that has arisen from a seed-syllable. The contemplation-being is visualized as the seed-syllable or insignia in the heart of the pristine-awareness being. in cases where the pristine-awareness being is to be visualized in the form of an insignia, the contemplation-being would be represented by the form of the seed-syllable. in this [step], the placement of the three beings may be done for all the deities or for only the main deities.
Consecration of the sense fields, and so forth, is taught in the majority of tantric texts. in many cases, the consecration consists in visualizing deities at the senses, who are generated simply from their seed-syllables. some works set forth the creation method of three rites, while others dispense with the visualization of the deities and instruct one to imagine the deities’ seed-syllables alone positioned at the senses.

The Indestructible Tent [Tantra] presents the branches that complete the creation[-phase] contemplation: the drawing in of the pristine-awareness mandala, [conferral of initiation, sealing of different types, and nectar-tasting, offering, and praise].
To draw in the pristine-awareness beings, one imagines that rays of light [radiating] from the seed-syllable at one’s heart invite from its natural abode the pristine-awareness mandala—the residence and its residents— which resembles the mandala being meditated upon. offerings, and so forth, are performed, and then the pristine-awareness mandala is made to merge with the circle of pledge deities. Thereupon, one has a firm conviction that these two mandalas have become of a single flavor.
In some [sadhanas], the invitation is made by means of the sound of vam, or by the sound of the joy of the union [of the male and female deities], and so on. The invitation may be of the pristine-awareness deities alone, without the celestial palace, or of the buddhas and bodhisattvas from every direction, [their forms] not necessarily identical to the pledge deities’, and so forth. There are many different systems of invitation.
As to the purpose of the drawing in of the pristine-awareness mandala, [abhayakaragupta’s] Awn of Esoteric Instructions explains that to have total conviction that all the transcendent ones are of a single identity will ensure belief in the sameness [of oneself and the deities]. Moreover, [in his Analysis of the Sequence of Visualization][44] atisha notes that this [step] serves the purposes of stopping the notion that oneself and the pristine-awareness deities are separate, of reinforcing the pride of being indivisible from them, and of being consecrated as such.

Conferral of initiation is the next [branch]. one imagines that rays of light [radiating] from the seed-syllable at one’s heart invite the initiating deities, to whom one makes offerings and requests [to initiate one]. The deities then bestow the initiation. The initiating deities—in most tantric texts, identical to the meditated mandala figures—confer the initiation in great number.
As to the initiation that is conferred [here], the majority of tantric works mention only the water initiation. saroruha and atisha, however, discuss the conferral of all four initiations.[45] some maintain that in order to meditate on the phase of creation alone, only the vase initiation is appropriate at this point, while to practice the phase of creation in combination with the phase of completion, all four are necessary. however, that is not definitive.
The purpose of conferring initiation is to cleanse oneself of the stains [that need] to be removed and to establish the potency required to accomplish one’s goal. atisha delineates eight purposes of initiation:[46] to dispel obstructive forces, to remove obscurations, to eliminate [the peril of falling into] inferior paths, to make oneself fit for recitation and meditation, to gain the power to perform the activations of appeasing, and so on,[47] to make amends for the deterioration of the awakening mind, [to make amends for the deterioration of vows and pledges], and to be initiated by the buddhas in the future.

Sealing [is the next branch].[48] although this branch is presented in many ways, Jetsun Drakpa[49] describes [seals] as follows:
Seals can symbolize all of the paths and results of the indestructible way in general. By symbolizing what is encompassed by the phase of creation, they can symbolize all paths. seals are five in number: the seal of essential reality on what is essential reality; the seal of mind on form; the seal of form on mind; the seal of the result on the cause; and the seal of the cause on the result.
Those words in themselves represent secret meaning of great significance. The meanings of those five seals are explained in this way:
[one,] the seal of essential reality on what is essential reality (also called the “seal of the nature on what holds the nature”) is to know that all phenomena, which are pure in nature, are [in truth] pure in nature. symbols of that would be hevajra and his consort [nairatmya] sealed by akshobhya.[50]
[Two,] the seal of mind on form is to understand that all phenomena— the outer [environment] and inner [sentient beings]—are not other than one’s own mind. symbols of that would be [yoginis] pukkasi and Gauri, essence of Vairochana, the purity of the aggregate of forms, sealed by akshobhya, the essence of mind.
[Three,] the seal of form on mind is mind itself manifesting in all of its various displays, the protection circle, the celestial palace, and external matter, that is to say, mind as form. symbols of that would be [yoginis] shavari and chauri, essence of akshobhya, the purity of [the aggregate of] consciousnesses, sealed by Vairochana, the essence of forms.
[Four,] the seal of the result on the cause is the consecration of the impure (the aggregates, elements, and sense fields) as the pure (the five families of transcendent ones, the bodhisattvas, and the like). This means meditation on the seed of the result, present in and connected to the cause. symbols of that would be [yoginis] chandali and Vetali, the purity of [the aggregate of] recognitions, essence of amitabha, who represents attachment (the cause [of avarice]), sealed by Ratnasambhava, the purity of avarice (avarice being the result of attachment).

[Five,] the seal of the cause on the result is the manifestation of the pure (the five families and the five pristine awarenesses) from the transformation of their [respective] causes, the aggregates and emotional afflictions. symbols of that would be [yoginis] Dombini and Ghasmari,[51] the purity of [the aggregate of] mental formations, essence of amoghasiddhi, who represents jealousy (the result [of attachment]), sealed by amitabha, the purity of attachment (attachment being the cause of jealousy).
Moreover, there are descriptions of the mutual sealing of family and possessor of family, the mutual sealing of what is created and agent of creation, and the mutual sealing of [other types of] cause and result.[52] These are presented in [Vajragarbha’s] Commentary [Epitomizing the Hevajra Tantra].[53]
As to its purpose, sealing ensures that, in the effort to gain ordinary powers and the supreme power [of awakening], meditation is carried out without mistaking family. The [Hevajra Tantra] Two Examinations states:[54]
A seal is a sign or mark by which a family can be symbolized.
Meditation in which the family is mistaken Yields neither powers nor achievements.[55]
[The last branch comprises] the tasting of nectar, offering, and praise, for which there are many procedures, varying according to each individual tantric text.[56] all are performed with the knowledge that the object to whom one offers, the offerings themselves, and the act of offering are [in nature] unborn emptiness.
The purpose [of nectar-tasting, offering, and praise] is to bring about the understanding that all objects of experience, the sensory pleasures, and so forth, are the immaculate expression of bliss and emptiness.

Tibetan masters of the past designated four [key elements] to be used as the path in all [types of] the creation phase and completion phase.
First, using form as the path is to meditate on forms that accord with those of the result [of awakening] and in that way to achieve clear images [of those forms], thereby stopping impure appearances. This is similar to imagining [the object of one’s sexual desire as] a skeleton and in that way achieving a clear image [of him or her in that form], at which point one stops [the arising of] sexual desire.
[second,] using [the force of] imagination as the path is to make those [visualized] forms [of awakening] a reality. This is similar to shariputra’s using his imagination to transform the fires of the hell of ceaseless suffering into water.[57]
[Third,] using the result as the path is to meditate on the result, that is, the very goal to be attained, and thereby to achieve that goal. This is similar to meditating on the coarse and peaceful aspects [of different levels within the realms of existence], whereby one achieves states of meditative stability.[58]
[Fourth,] using transformative power as the path is to turn ordinary body and mind into pristine awareness by means of the transformative powers of the buddhas and other awakened beings, similar to the way cow dung can be turned into gold when transformative powers are applied.[59]
The first comprises all the steps related to the deity’s form and [the union of] bliss and emptiness. The middle two are applied in all the steps related to the deity’s form in the context of the phase of creation. The last comprises the following steps: the drawing into oneself of the host of pristine- awareness deities; visualizing oneself and one’s channels and vital essences as deities, thereby being consecrated as deities; and the recitation of mantra, making offerings and [special] sacrificial [food] offerings, and so on. however, the most important element is as stated [by Vajraghantapa]:[60]
That which arises solely and instantaneously From the transformative power of the master.
That is to say, devotion to the master and the transformative power of the master are used as the path to realize the great seal.[61]

once one has fulfilled the crucial points of all four key elements (as just described), one must ensure that the crucial points that can lead to freedom are fulfilled even in meditation based on imagination. Therefore, the beginner should repeatedly bring forth clear images in both the coarse and subtle [aspects of visualization]. The coarse [aspect] refers to the body of the deity in the phase of creation which merely resembles [the actual body] endowed with seven features.[62] The subtle refers to the clear image of the deity, through which one is shifted to realization of the phase of completion.[63] Moreover, one practices the meditation with exceptionally firm pride in regarding oneself as the coarse or the subtle deity. These are the crucial points of the pith instruction known as “using imagination as the path.”

Whenever one trains in the phase of creation in thatway [presented above], one must understand that everything that arises to the mental consciousness—the mandala on the appearance side—is merely relative appearance, devoid of inherent nature, ultimately emptiness. Then, with that understanding, one must train in the contemplation [that realizes everything to be] like an illusion. Finally, one must manifest the pristine awareness in which the appearance of the deity (with the pride of being the deity), while arising unceasingly, and blessed with the bliss elicited by the melting [of the vital essence], is of an essence beyond all limits of conceptual elaborations.
If one is not yet capable of that, one should seal the clear image [of the deity] with emptiness by means of conclusive ascertainment of everything being emptiness; and one should seal the clear image [of the deity] with bliss elicited by the melting [of vital essence]. in the mother tantras, such bliss is elicited by the subtle yoga of winds and the yoga of descent and reversal of vital essence;[64] and in the father tantras, by the training in windyoga techniques (pranayama) [connected to] the meditations of the yogas of the upper and lower nose-tips.[65]
In summation, by sealing the clear image of the circle of deities with bliss and emptiness, the form of the body of the deity vividly manifests as the essence of bliss and emptiness. When this occurs, intense meditation on that essence causes the winds to dissolve within the central channel, whereuponone is shifted to the realization of the phase of completion. as a result, bliss arises. That bliss and the form of the deity are deliberately mixed with one another. Without any need for sealing, [the bliss and the clear image] are manifested simultaneously. This state wherein there is no interruption by thoughts is referred to as “abiding in undivided awareness.”[66] By cultivating that state, one comes to experience the signs of seeing and touching [the deity], at which point one abides in the yoga of realization.
There are many descriptions of the subtle and vital-essence yogas in this context, as well as many methods of meditating upon them. Therefore, these will not be elaborated upon out of concern [that the discussion become too lengthy]. one should refer to other types of works.

The works of the great tantric adepts advise that, as one becomes weary of visualizing the deity, one should recollect its pure [nature]. Accordingly, [prajnendraruchi’s] Blazing Jewel [Sadhana] states:[67]
A yogin unable to remain in absorption should bring to mind the pure [natures].
There are many presentations of ways to recollect purity. as for the pure [nature] of the relative deity, all [aspects of] the visualizations of deities [represent] the purities of the great qualities of buddhas. For example, Two Examinations states:[68]
The red eyes of compassion
Are the purity of the three vajras;
The black limbs, a loving mind.[69]
The human body’s aggregates, elements, and so forth are pure in being deities. The Guhyasamaja Tantra, for instance, states:[70]
The natures of the five aggregates
Are revealed to be the five buddhas;
The natures of earth, and so forth,
The four goddesses, Lochana and the others.[71]
The channels, vital essences, and other physical constituents are pure in being deities. For example, Luipa [in his Sequence of Visualization of Chakrasamvara] states:[72]
The vital essences of the body
Are imagined as twenty-four heroes.[73]
The [deity’s] ornaments are pure in being mantras. For example, Luipa states:[74]
The root mantras of the heroes, and so forth,
Are imagined as the thread of brahmins and the like.
As for the purity of ultimate reality, to know that all phenomena of cyclic existence and perfect peace are naturally pure, unborn emptiness, is the purity of the essential nature of things. Two Examinations states:[75]
In the true sense, the purity of all things is said to be their reality just as it is.
The purity of self-knowing awareness, in relation to the phase of completion, is to know that everything is the expression of the innate, [the union of] bliss and emptiness. Two Examinations states:[76]
The real purity is that of self-knowing awareness and by no other purity may one be released.
Since the nature of all sense objects is pure, everything is the supreme bliss of self-knowing awareness.[77]
The purpose of recollecting the purity, as asserted by masters, is to counteract the notion that the attributes of the path and those of the result are different.

A yogin intent on cultivating the phase of creation will train for four sessions a day. These four sessions are delineated by Jalandhara [in his Sadhana of Hevajra]:[78]
The phases referred to as “what are consecrated as four sessions” are the early morning, midday, late afternoon, and night [sessions]: these constitute the phase of meditation.
At the end of each session is the dissolution of the visualization: The environment and inhabitants, the residence and resident deities, are dissolved into oneself. Then, one also dissolves gradually into luminous clarity. Finally, one re-emerges from luminous clarity in the illusion-like form of the deity. Ghantapa states:[79]
Having been manifested from the light of the seed-syllable, The lord of wisdom, retinue, ground, and multi-storied palace Become light again and are gradually dissolved.

The yoga of informal contemplation (i.e., the post-meditation period) of the phase of creation consists of eight parts:
The first is the yoga of mantra [that involves] recitation, for which there are detailed presentations regarding the features of the chaplet used for the recitation; the visualization performed during the recitation; the mantra to be recited; and the prescribed number of recitations.
The second is the giving away of sacrificial [food] offerings. The sacrificial offering to the deity and the sacrificial offering to spirits can be separate or one and the same.[80] in the latter case, there are two systems, one in connection with the mandala [rite] and the other without that rite.
The third is the yoga of partaking of food and drink.
The fourth is the yoga of passion [performed with] an action seal. The fifth is the yoga of conduct between formal meditation sessions. The sixth is the yoga of sleep.
The seventh is the yoga of waking up at dawn. The eighth is the yoga of purificatory cleansing.
Those yogas consist of many types of visualizations and practices which have not been elaborated on here.[81]

If one does not first know the precise natures of the bases of purification, one will not understand correctly how the purificatory means correspond to them.[1] Therefore, what follows now is a general exposition of the natures of the bases of purification, presented in three parts: first, the way death occurs; then, the way the intermediate state arises subsequent to death; and lastly, the way birth takes place following the intermediate state. These three—birth, death, and the intermediate state—are said to be the bases of purification in the phase of creation and will be considered in this [discussion] principally from the perspective of human beings, who are endowed with the six elements.[2]

The term “death” refers to the dissolution of the five aggregates, four elements, six sense powers, five objects, and five pristine awarenesses, that is to say, the twenty-five coarse psychophysical constituents, and so forth, of a human being. There are numerous signs that indicate the dissolution of those constituents. however, the process of dying can be summarized as follows:
[First,] the coarse constituents (the four elemental properties) dissolve [in sequence]: The earth element of the body dissolves into the element of water. consequently, one is unable to move the body or control it (the external sign), and consciousness seems to be like a smoky haze (the internal sign).
The water element dissolves into the fire element. consequently, the body’s fluids—sweat, saliva, and so on—dry up (the external sign); consciousness seems like a shimmering mirage (the internal sign), and the thirty-three conceptions that have evolved from aversion are stopped.
The element of fire dissolves into the wind element. consequently, the warmth withdraws from the extremities of the body (the external sign); consciousness seems to be like fireflies (the internal sign), and the forty conceptions that have evolved from attachment are stopped.
The wind element dissolves into consciousness. consequently, exhalations become longer and one can no longer inhale (the external sign);
consciousness seems like a perfectly still flame undisturbed by wind (the internal sign), and the seven conceptions that have evolved from delusion are stopped.[3]
Next, the subtle constituents (the three [stages of experience of] light) dissolve in the following manner: consciousness dissolves into light, due to which one experiences a white brilliance, a vision that is like moonlight in a cloudless sky.
Light dissolves into the increase of light, due to which one experiences a red brilliance, a vision like sunlight in a cloudless sky.
The increase of light dissolves into the full culmination of light, due to which one experiences black brilliance, a vision like nighttime darkness pervading a cloudless sky. at that point, one’s awareness diminishes, and becoming senseless, one falls into an unconscious state. Just as one regains consciousness, there manifests what is like a perfectly clear sky at dawn, not vitiated[4] by the influences of moonlight, sunlight, and thick darkness; [this is the experience of] luminous clarity.[5]

That [experience of] luminous clarity gives rise, once again, to the full culmination [of light]; then, in sequence, from the full culmination arises the increase of light, and from the increase of light, the light, the entire sequence occurring in an instant. Light gives rise to the eighty conceptions, whereupon is produced the body of the intermediate state, which is [simply] consciousness riding on the mount of wind.
According to [pundarika’s] Great Commentary on the Kalachakra Tantra, at first, for a brief period, the intermediate-state body appears in a form based on one’s previous habitual tendencies [i.e., as the body of one’s most recent life]. Then, gradually that form fades away, and there arises the appearance of the body of one’s next life. it is further explained that that body, shaped according to what kind of birth one will take, is possessed of all its sense faculties. Because the body cannot be obstructed by matter, it has the miraculous power [of being able to move freely anywhere] with the exception of [not being able to exit] the mother’s womb [once it has entered it]. nourished by odors, the body enlarges. it can be seen by [other] intermediate-state beings who are of similar destinies[6] and by those with pure divine sight. in seeking a place of birth and a source of odors, the intermediate-state being wanders every which way. The being is in an extremely volatile state, experiencing a myriad of hallucinations, the quality of which is determined by whether previous actions have been positive or negative. The duration of this period is not fixed but it is never more than seven days.
If the being is unable to begin the birth process within those first seven days, it undergoes a minor death, which is like fainting for a short time, and again is born into the intermediate state. it may then begin the birth process within the [next] seven-day period. if even within that period, it still does not meet with the number of factors necessary for taking birth, it will inevitably [begin the process of] taking birth within forty-nine days [from the time of death].
A being who is to be born in the formless realm will not experience the intermediate state. Wherever one happens to die, in that very place, the aggregates of the formless realm come into being. a being who is to take birth in the desire realm or form realm will definitely experience the intermediate state.

Following the intermediate state, when the time comes to enter a [new] existence, a being will be born by one of four modes. if birth is to be miraculous, one begins to crave a place [to stay] and thereupon experiences some form of desire or aversion. as a result, one undergoes a minor death, which is like fainting for a short time, at the end of which one is born instantaneously in full form.
If birth is to be from heat and moisture, one experiences desire and aversion due to craving odors and tastes. as a result, one faints for a short time, after which one is born.
If birth is to be from a womb or egg, one experiences desire and aversion at the sight of one’s parents copulating. as a result, one faints for a short time. after that, one [is conceived and] takes birth.[7] in this case, the moving winds typical of the period in the intermediate state dissolve, whereupon light, the increase of light, the culmination of light, and subtle luminous clarity each manifest. When the light of full culmination again arises from that luminous clarity, one [is conceived and] takes birth. From the full culmination, there will manifest the increase of light; then, from the increase, light; and from that, the [eighty] conceptions.
From the wind that serves as the mount for the [mind of] light, there arises the wind element, endowed with a special potency to support consciousness. From the wind element arises the fire element, with that same potency. From the fire element arises the water element, the same in potency. From the water element arises the earth element, the same in potency. From those elements, the aggregates and other constituents develop.

Next is explained the way one takes birth specifically through a human womb: The intermediate-state being sees [the future] father and mother in the act of copulation and then enters the father’s mouth or top of his head. it then emerges from the father’s secret place [penis] and enters the secret place [womb] of the mother, thereby being conceived as a new life in the midst of sperm and ovum.
That being then begins to develop within the womb. since the sperm and ovum are composed of the four elements, [the developing embryo] derives stability from the earth element, cohesion from water, maturation from fire, and growth from wind. The embryo is gradually nurtured by the most refined essences of the blood, wind, and other constituents of the mother.
The Samvarodaya [Tantra][8] explains that the embryo in the first week is [an oval-shaped form, thin in consistency, called] nur nur. in the second, it is [of a thin pappy consistency, like a bubble on water, called] mer mer. in the third, it becomes [fleshy and oblong in shape, slightly harder than in the first week but unable to withstand pressure, called] tar tar. in the fourth, the embryo becomes [fleshy, more solid, with a soft membrane, now able to withstand pressure, called] gor gor. after that, it acquires the solidity of flesh, taking on a fish-like form, from which, in the fifth month, the protuberances of the limbs emerge. in the seventh month, hair, nails, and [the genitalia] appear. in the eighth month, the sense powers of the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind manifest. in the ninth month, the body is completely formed. in the tenth month, it exits the womb.[9]

Next are explained the ways that the purificatory creation-phase methods correspond to the bases of purification. Generally, there are many distinctive features of the purificatory means that accord in features with the bases of purification (the [four] modes of birth, and so forth). however, for the time being, in order to facilitate comprehension of this subject, only the common correspondences will be discussed here.
In the case of someone who has accumulated the [particular] karma that leads to birth from a womb, the bases of purification are the following: [the process of] dying, the subsequent experience of the intermediate state, conception in the womb of a mother in the human world, the formation of the body, being born once the body has fully developed, and engaging in the various activities of the particular existence.
The purificatory means that accord in features with those bases include the fostering [of positive potential] and [the fostering of pristine awareness through] meditation on emptiness, [visualization of] the celestial palace, [visualization of] the causal vajra-holder within the palace, imagining the nada[10] or syllable entering the causal vajra-holder, the melting [of the causal vajra-holder], the urging with songs, and the manifestation of the resultant vajra-holder.
What follows now is a detailed exposition of the ways each [purificatory method] corresponds to its respective [object of purification], presented in three parts: the process of dying; the process of the intermediate state; and the process of taking birth.

The bases to be purified by means of those purificatory creation-phase meditations are all contained in the three processes of taking birth, dying, and the intermediate state. To facilitate understanding, [in this discussion,] the visualization steps will be correlated with the bases of purification.
The accumulation of karma in one’s previous life to be born in a [particular] existence accords with [and is purified by] the fostering of positive potential in relation to the [deity’s] field for fostering [positive potential]. The process of death, characterized by the signs of dissolution of the twenty-five coarse and three subtle constituents, at the end of that life [accords with and] is purified by meditation on emptiness, the fostering of pristine awareness.

Following [the experience of] luminous clarity at death, the three [stages of] light and the eighty natures [i.e., conceptions] again arise, this time in the forward order. Thereafter is experienced the intermediate state, which is [just] consciousness riding on the mount of wind.
The environmental world into which the intermediate-state being will be born is purified by [the visualization of] tiers of elements, the celestial palace, and seat [of the deity].
The vision of the father and mother is purified by the causal vajra-holder, the male and female [figures].
Seeing the parents in the act of copulation whereupon the being is conceived in the womb is purified by the three syllables [marking] body, speech, and mind.
Craving and grasping[11] are purified by the nada or syllable entering [the causal vajra-holder] while sustained by two ho syllables, or simply by the nada or syllable entering [the causal vajra-holder].
To symbolize that [the intermediate-state being] does not have a coarse body and exists simply on the basis of a subtle mental body, in some [sadhanas] the form of the intermediate-state being is simply a mental impression, without there being an actual symbol for it. [in other sadhanas] (to explain “and so forth” [in the root text]), the intermediate-state being does not manifest even as a mental impression, except for when it is imagined as a seed-syllable.[12] This [formless] purificatory step accords with the intermediate state of those beings who experience it for an extremely brief period—remaining no more than the briefest moment of time—as is the duration of the transmigration of a leech.
The melting of the causal vajra-holder, the male and female figures, is the purificatory step that accords with the parents’ blank state of mind following orgasm.

The process whereby the intermediate-state being takes birth is influenced by the different modes of birth and habitual tendencies. accordingly, all [the various methods of] the creation phase apply equally to all four modes of birth in terms of serving as means for purifying them. however, owing to the similarity in aspect [of a particular method] to one or the other of the four modes of birth, realized masters have explained each individually.
The purificatory method that accords in aspects with birth from a womb entails [the steps of] the manifestation [as the resultant vajra-holder] due to urging the molten form with songs and the emanation of the mandala [of the retinue] from the space [of the consort’s womb].
The purificatory method that accords in aspects with egg birth is the creation method in four vajra steps, [which entails] the moon and sun [seat], seed-syllable, insignia, and the merging.
The purificatory method that accords in aspects with birth from heat and moisture is creation by means of just the moon and seed-syllable; or creation by the three vajra rites [of seed-syllable, insignia, deity].
The purificatory method that accords in aspects with miraculous birth is the creation of the full form all at once, completed instantaneously by means of thought.
All of those methods are applied within a single visualization sequence. Moreover, it is assertedthat[thecreationof] the deities of the eye-consecration, and so forth, accords with the miraculous mode of birth; the creation by means of five awakenings, with birth from heat and moisture; emanating from the space [of the consort’s womb], with birth from a womb; and the arising [of the deities] from vital-essence spheres [of light], with egg birth. however, i have not researched the source of this explanation.

Next [are explained] the purificatory means [that accord with the human birth] specifically:
In the context of a method such as creation by means of the five actual awakenings, whereby the resultant vajra-holder manifests, the step of visualization of the seed-syllable (hum or another syllable) purifies the five stages in the human womb.[14]
In the system that entails the visualization of the five-pointed vajra, the set of five lower prongs purifies the development of the five limbs (i.e., four limbs and trunk) [of the body], and the set of five upper prongs purifies the five fingers on each hand and five toes on each foot, and the head’s eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and the body’s [tactile] component.
Moreover, the visualization of the form of the deity through the steps of the seed-syllable, the insignia arising from the seed-syllable, and so forth, accords in features with and purifies the habitual tendencies related to the formation of the body through the stages of the fish[-like] form, the arising of limbs [in the turtle-like form], and so on.[15]
The pledge-being accords in features with and purifies the habitual tendencies related to a person’s coarse temporal body,[16] composed of elements and the evolutes of elements.[17]
The pristine-awareness being accords in features with and purifies the habitual tendencies related to the most refined essences of the channels, winds, and vital essences of that body.
The contemplation-being accords in features with and purifies the habitual tendencies related to the innate body, the subtle body of just wind and mind.
The consecration of the sense fields and the three places [i.e., forehead, throat, and heart] [accords in features with and purifies the habitual tendencies related to] the capacity to experience sense objects, which is acquired through the gradual growth and strengthening of the potencies of the sense powers and the faculties of body, speech, and mind.
Emanation of the deities in the supremely victorious mandala [i.e., the deities of the retinue] [accords in features with and purifies the habitual tendencies related to] a person’s procreation of offspring.

Evident ways that the completing methods correspond to, and accord in features with, their bases of purification are not found to any great extent in the tantric texts. however, according to masters of the past, each of the [completing] steps [of the creation phase] accords in features with a particular [object of purification] and thereby serves as its purificatory means:
The [step of] drawing in the pristine-awareness deities symbolizes the discernment of details of perceived objects. in an alternative interpretation, this step symbolizes the active consciousnesses, after having emerged from the ground-of-all [consciousness] and having drawn in their external objects, returning to that ground.
The conferral of initiation symbolizes a newborn infant being washed and [then beginning] to act on its own.
The sealing symbolizes [the child] being in the status of its own family.
The offering symbolizes the experience of pleasure as desire and craving for sensory experiences develop.
The praise symbolizes being spoken of with approval by other persons if one possesses qualities appreciated in society.
In short, those [steps] symbolize experience and enjoyment of the five [types of] sensory objects.
The recitation [of mantra] symbolizes ordinary breathing and conversation based on confused notions.
[The yogas related to] eating, conduct, and passion symbolize each of those activities, respectively.
The dissolution [of the mandala] and [re-]emergence [as the deity] symbolize the end of the life of an ordinary person, the stages of death and entering luminous clarity; and then, after that luminous clarity, re-emerging, on the basis of just wind and mind, as the mental body of the intermediate state and taking rebirth.

When the visualization sequence has been carried out in that way, the results of the process of purification [are attained]. [The creation-phase steps correspond to the results as follows]:

The creation [of the deity] by means of the five awakenings, or other creation methods,[18] accords in features with the manner of [attaining] enlightenment.
Offering, praise, recitation, dissolution of the mandala, post-meditation activity, and so forth, accord in features with deeds and activities performed once enlightenment is attained.

Moreover, [the steps of the phase of creation] correspond—being similar in aspects—to the natures of the three dimensions of awakening, namely, the dimension of reality, the enjoyment dimension, and the manifest dimension.[19] of those three dimensions, however, the creation phase in itself, owing to its being a yoga based on imagination, possesses the entire range of the vast and special attributes of the visible form of the manifest dimension of awakening. its steps correspond to the place, manner [of awakening], and deeds, as mentioned above; as well, to the acts done for the welfare of others after having received initiation from all the buddhas of the universe; the revealing of teachings to the pure retinue; appearing to impure trainees as if to pass away into perfect peace; and working unceasingly for the benefit of beings by means of emanations. seers of the sublime have aptly described [the creation phase] in these words:
Thus, looking up, it accords with the likeness of awakening; Looking down, it accords with the likeness of cyclic life.[20]
The main steps of the visualization sequence accord with the essential nature of the basis and therefore enable one to purify it. Being in accordance with the essential nature of the result, they enable one to see the result. on this point, the Venerable Jonang [Taranatha] states:
What others call “basis of purification” is, in our tradition, termed “object to be purified.” This is because the basis that effects the purification cannot be conceived of as other than original reality.
While there are different points of view on this subject, to understand this remark of Taranatha is of crucial importance.

When creation[-phase] contemplation is carried out in accordance with the tantras and immersed in with yearning, due to the relationship [to that contemplation] there unfailingly develops a special connection associated with body and mind. [as a result,] the creation-phase [steps] act as ripening agents for the arising of realization in the completion phase.
To explain, the different creation methods and completion methods set forth in the individual tantras act as ripening agents to bring about particular [attainments]. While it is not possible to expand on the details of this topic, [the following presentation] according to the arya [nagarjuna] tradition of the Guhyasamaja tantra can serve as an example:
The way to purify[21] the death process, imagining that [the universe and oneself] dissolve into luminous clarity, is a method that acts as the ripening agent principally [for the attainment of] the stage of luminous clarity. Therefore, being extremely similar in aspect to the luminous clarity [of the stage] of mind isolation, [that method] also acts as the ripening agent [for the luminous clarity of mind isolation]. as well, it will act as the ripening agent in general for all aspects of luminous clarity found in the phase of completion.[22]

The five actual awakenings that use the intermediate state as the path for [the attainment of] the enjoyment dimension of awakening [entail] modes of emergence from luminous clarity. The modes of emergence [are experienced] from the stage of mind isolation, when one emerges from the final-example luminous clarity[23] through the three [stages of] light occurring in the forward order, up to the fourth stage, when one emerges from the ultimate true luminous clarity through the three [stages of] light occurring in the reverse order. These are symbolized by the [visualization of] the sun, moon, and lotus.
The visualization of the three syllables [om, ah, hum] above [the sun, moon, and lotus] and their merging [into one] symbolizes the merging of the three [stages of] light with the wind of luminous clarity due to which the third-stage illusory body and the body of union are attained, and once attained, continuously manifest.[24]
Awakening by means of the seed-syllable symbolizes the awakened speech of that state of union, ineffable yet inclusive of all aspects of speech; and awakening by means of the insignia symbolizes the awakened mind of the state of union, [inseparable] bliss and emptiness, the awareness of all knowables, that which overcomes all obscurations.
Light emanated and then withdrawn symbolizes the activity of awakened body, speech, and mind.
Awakening by means of the full manifestation of the [deity’s] form symbolizes the attainment of the true sameness [of one’s being and] awakened body, speech, and mind, or a similitude of that sameness.
The above simply provides examples. There are also correspondences to the form of the deity that arises from inseparable bliss and emptiness [induced by] the subtle and vital-essence [yogas] during the stage of body isolation; as well as to the bliss and emptiness and the form of the deity [experienced] by yogins abiding in the stage of voice isolation, the stage of mind isolation, and the stage of the illusory body.

The practice that uses birth as the path [for the attainment] of the manifest dimension of awakening is to become the manifest dimension, Vajrasattva, through having immersed oneself in the bliss of the union of all transcendent ones. This symbolizes one’s continuous immersion in bliss and emptiness throughout all one’s experiences [even] when one has emerged from the bliss and emptiness of completion-phase equipoise. some maintain that this symbolizes entrance into the coarse body, which is a similitude of the illusory body [attained] during the three isolations [body, voice, and mind] and the form of the deity [made] of wind and mind [that is attained] on the third stage. in any case, to remain immersed, throughout all one’s experiences, in bliss represents the principal way of using [birth] as the path [for the attainment of] the manifest dimension in the context of the completion phase. The other [methods of using birth as the path] are simply variations.
Meditation on the body mandala acts as the ripening agent so that the impure aspects of the aggregates and elements dissolve into luminous clarity and the most refined aspects emanate as the form of the deity.

The consecration of the awakened body, voice, and mind is to lay the foundation for generating the special pristine awareness of the three [stages of] light, beginning at the stage of body isolation up to the state of union.
Visualization of the placement of the three beings acts as the ripening agent so that the most refined aspects of the channels, vital essences, winds, and mind manifest as the form of the deity.
Sealing and conferral of initiation act as ripening agents so that, by fixing bodhichitta at the head, the aggregates and elements all manifest as great bliss.
Gathering awareness females and the act of passion is to lay the foundation for all aspects of the phase of completion [involving] an action seal.
Emanating the supremely victorious mandala [i.e., the retinue] is what accords with the arising of the mandala of the pure and impure illusory bodies from the ultimate factor of yoga with the action seal and the pristine-awareness seal.[25]
The subtle and vital-essence [yogas] serve as causes for [the attainment of] body isolation and accord in aspects with [the stage of] body isolation itself.
Recitation [of the mantra] acts as the ripening agent for [the stage of] voice isolation.
Entering luminous clarity, the principal [method], acts as the ripening agent for mind isolation.
Urging [with songs] and the [re-]emergence, along with offering and praise, act as ripening agents for the illusory body of equipoise and the illusory body of post[-meditation] attainment.
While the above discussion is representative [of tantras in general], one should learn the secret practices that act as ripening agents for the completion-phase [practices] specific to the chakrasamvara, hevajra, Kalachakra, and so forth.

As stated [in the root text,] the phase of completion must be presented in terms of the three [contexts] of ground, path, and result.[1] Each of the three has three [primary] characteristics, as stated in [pundarika’s] Stainless Light:[2]
The completion phase is innateness, nonconceptuality, and the totality of all aspects, free from the concepts of faces, arms, colors, and shapes.
This means that the three [primary] characteristics—known as “innateness,” “nonconceptuality,” and “the totality of all aspects”—must all be present.
The first characteristic, innateness, cuts through [states] in which appearances and awareness have greatly declined, as though unconscious, and cuts through the meditative concentration of cessation,[3] and so forth. Thesecond, nonconceptuality, cuts throughpartial[approaches] involving conceptual thoughts, such as the creation phase.
The third, the totality of all aspects, cuts through the meditative concentration of a mere awareness devoid of appearances, which is just a partial representation of pristine awareness.

[To turn] for a moment to those three characteristics in terms of the ground, [the first,] innateness, is of two kinds: innateness as the bliss from the melting [of vital essence]; and innateness as the nature [of reality]. of the two, the innateness that is the bliss from melting refers to the four joys[4] during sexual union. it is as described in the Essence of the Great Seal:[5]
Then, there is the innateness that is The creation of indestructible bliss:
That itself is Bhagavati prajna[paramita] and is an aspect of the completion phase.
The innateness that is the nature [of reality] is defined in the Hevajra Tantra:[6]
What is called the innateness of the nature is the single binding together of all aspects.
What is meant here is [the state of] Vajrasattva that has no beginning and no end. it exists as all animate and inanimate phenomena and throughout all time. Thus, it is termed “innateness.” [This characteristic of] innateness in itself bears the characteristic of nonconceptuality, [the second characteristic of the ground]. [These points] are stated in [indrabhuti’s] Innately Existent.[7] [The third characteristic,] known as the totality of all aspects, means that which encompasses the body and all phenomenal things. The Hevajra Tantra states:[8]
It is what pervades all things....
Although [the ground] exists within the body phenomenon, it did not arise anew from it. There is a relationship between the support [the body] and what is supported [the ground].[9] consequently, [the ground] can be made manifest on the basis of the body composed of the six elements.[10]
This phase of completion of the ground should be known by the many different references to it, such as union,[11] vajra yoga,[12] and the inseparability of emptiness and compassion. The ground-completion phase itself is what is cultivated as the completion phase of the path. consequently, at the time of the result as well, it is solely this ground-completion phase that is made manifest.
To summarize, innate great bliss, nonconceptuality, natural pristine awareness, and so forth, are what connect the stages: they are the same at the path [stage] as they are at the ground [stage]; and they are the same at the stage of the arising of the result as they are on the path.

From the general perspective of the universal way (mahayana), the root of the path is that which is called “the bodhichitta of the emptiness that has compassion as its essence.”[13] That bodhichitta is widely known.
However, it should be understood that in the unsurpassable ripening and liberating paths of the indestructible way in particular, and in this context of the completion phase, it is a bodhichitta that is the inseparability of uncommon emptiness and great compassion—the ultimate object to be known, the ultimate object of meditation, and the ultimate result.
Of those [bodhichittas], the one to be understood in terms of the ground is as described in the Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra:[14]
Beginningless, endless peace; the sovereign
Wherein the phenomenal and noumenal have ceased;
The inseparability of emptiness and compassion:
That is referred to by the term “bodhichitta.”[15]
Similar statements appear in numerous scriptural sources.
The bodhichitta in the context of the path is described in the Brief Presentation of the [Kalachakra] Initiation:[16]
Emptiness, the image, the apprehended, the cause; compassion, the unchanging, the apprehender, the result:
The inseparability of emptiness and compassion is the bodhichitta that is not emitted.[17]
There are many such teachings.
The bodhichitta at the time of the result is as stated in [pundarika’s] Stainless Light:[18]
The emptiness that has the nature of compassion....
And:[19]
As for compassion and emptiness, it is explained that “Time” (kala) means the relative, that which has form; and the term “wheel” (chakra) refers to emptiness; “Wheel of time” (kalachakra) means their inseparability.[20]
There are numerous similar citations.

hence, these points [concerning uncommon emptiness and compassion] represent the essence of all the teachings of the sutras and tantras in general and the essence of the unsurpassable completion phase of secret mantra in particular. Therefore, [this bodhichitta is] the ultimate essential purpose of the highest yoga tantras such as Kalachakra, the meaning of évam, and the root of the eighty-four thousand aspects of the teachings.[21] Moreover, what is called “Vajrasattva Kalachakra” has the characteristic qualities of the union of emptiness and compassion. Thus, all the precious tantras clearly state that [this union] is the essence of their teachings.
The way in which that [union of emptiness and compassion] itself can serve as the root of the path [is explained as follows]: in the general system of the universal way, it is maintained that, by means of these [emptiness and compassion], the extremes of existence and peace are overcome.[22] Likewise, in this [context of the] completion phase, uncommon emptiness and compassion should be considered the means to overcome the two extremes of existence and peace, respectively.

As to the ways uncommon emptiness and compassion eliminate the two extremes, emptiness cuts through the elaborations of conceptual grasping; compassion [ensures] that the welfare of sentient beings is never abandoned. in this context [of the completion phase], compassion is referred to by the word “desire,” in which case desire should be taken to mean the desire that is uncommon great bliss, the great compassion that is the method of the completion phase. Moreover, it should be said that great bliss itself will overcome the extreme of peace. since that great bliss has an aspect of desire for sentient beings, [the word “desire”] is used to refer to great compassion, the method. This is important to understand and represents a distinguishing feature [of the completion phase].
That being so, the inseparability of emptiness and compassion itself is called the “vajra yoga of the union of method and wisdom” and is present throughout [the stages of] the ground, path, and result. of those [stages,] it is taught that during the time of the path, the pristine awareness of great bliss is inconceivably powerful—even more so than the ultimate truth [of emptiness]—in purifying the habitual tendencies of desire and the other emotional afflictions. To explain, first emptiness effects purification, and then great bliss arises from that emptiness. That bliss has the capacity to purify every single habitual tendency. Therefore, one should understand the statement that of the two—emptiness and bliss—emptiness is the root of the purificatory agent, while great bliss is the principal purificatory agent.

it is essential to know what is meant by emptiness and compassion [in this context]. Therefore, each will be described briefly.
Many different types of emptiness are delineated in the way of characteristics.[23] apart from those, there are many types of emptiness taught in the superior system of mantra. in the first three sets of tantra, [action, conduct, and yoga], emptiness is taught in conjunction with the sixteen sanskrit vowels[24] and the sixteen emptiness-beings. sixteen types of emptiness—the inner emptiness, outer emptiness, and so forth[25]—are taught in the Indestructible Garland Tantra. [26] Fourteen or, alternatively, sixteen emptinesses, such as the emptiness of that which eats and the emptiness of that which is eaten, are taught in the Samputa Tantra.[27] Eight emptinesses, the emptiness of looking at form, and so forth, are taught in the Continuation of the Abhidhana Tantra.[28] it is, however, the emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects, taught in the uncommon Kalachakra: King of Tantras, that represents the final view of all tantras.

In general, the uncommon emptiness of the completion phase may be differentiated [in various ways]. When differentiated according to the ways it manifests, it is classified in terms of light,[29] increase of light, culmination of light, and luminous clarity. in reference to those, the Indestructible Garland Tantra, for example, speaks of four emptinesses:[30]
The empty, the very empty, The third, the great empty, and the fourth, the all-empty:
These are distinctions of cause and result.[31]
As another example, the Primordial Buddha [Kalachakra Tantra][32] teaches ten forms of emptiness, the signs of day and signs of night:
Smoke, mirage, fireflies, Lamp, blazing, moon, sun,
Rahu, lightning, and great sphere.[33]
The uncommon emptiness can also be differentiated in terms of phases. For example, in the second summary in [Kalachakra Tantra’s] chapter on world-systems, there is a classification of the “sixteen emptinesses” that refer to the sixteen phases that are the elements of the sixteen parts of the dark side [waning moon]. These sixteen can be grouped into three categories, or four, when the all-aspects emptiness is included.[34]
Moreover, emptiness is differentiated according to categories of meanings. There are five and six emptinesses when it is divided into conceptual categories: “the five immutable great emptinesses,” which refer to the aspect of freedom from the obscurations of the five aggregates, the five elements, and so forth; and “the six immutable empty essences,” the aspect of freedom from the obscurations of the six sense powers, their six objects, and so forth.[35]
Although there are these various differentiations, all types of emptiness can be included in three emptinesses: the emptiness to be ascertained; the emptiness that is contemplated on the path; and the emptiness that is the ultimate result.
The first, the emptiness to be ascertained, is so called because in this context [of the completion phase], [this emptiness] should be ascertained as simply an object to be understood as a general category but need not be an object to be meditated upon. The type of emptiness spoken of in the way of characteristics would be an example [of this emptiness].

The second is the emptiness that is contemplated on the path. in this context, what is principally meant by this is not the emptiness based on analysis, such as the two [types of] no-self.[36] The actual meaning in this context is what is referred to as “unconceived emptiness,”[37] the all-aspects emptiness, for example. unconceived emptiness is of two types: emptiness in which appearance and emptiness are not distinguished; and emptiness in which appearance and emptiness are distinguished. The first of those, emptiness in which appearance and emptiness are not distinguished, comprises two aspects: definite emptiness; and indefinite emptiness. The term “definite emptiness” is used to refer to emptinesses such as the four emptinesses[38] and the ten emptinesses (the first of which is smoke).[39] Those are considered definite because they have definite [aspects] that can be identified as manifesting as particular kinds of forms. The term “indefinite emptiness” is used to refer to emptinesses such as empty form endowed with all aspects. They are referred to in this way:
The universal image that is luminous clarity.[40]
They are considered indefinite because they have [all] the aspects of the three realms and the three times, and therefore are indefinite in their modes of manifestation.

The third, the emptiness of the ultimate result, includes emptinesses such as the five immutable great emptinesses and the six immutable empty essences. When these [five and six] are differentiated [as two separate sets, this emptiness] is considered to be what is symbolized by the syllable é [the second set]. if they are not differentiated, the é-and-vam union is also referred to by the term “emptiness.” hence, all of the five immutable emptinesses and six immutable empty essences are considered to be what is represented by the term “emptiness [of the ultimate result].”[41]
That being said, the principal emptiness to be contemplated in the completion phase should be understood as follows: The Guhyasamaja Tantra teaches the causal three [stages of] light and the resultant luminous clarity,[42] the last of which [is the emptiness to be contemplated]. The Kalachakra Tantra teaches the causal ten signs[43] and the [resultant] eleventh sign, the universal image,[44] the last of which [is to be contemplated]. That is because only the emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects is the uncommon emptiness that is capable of giving rise to supreme unchanging bliss.[45]
This essential emptiness is of a nature endowed with all aspects of the three realms, unconceived appearances that are like magical images reflected in a divination mirror,[46] while its own nature has no inherent reality, being devoid of atomic structure, and is totally free from conceptions. it is the source of great bliss, the illusory creation of the supreme pristine awareness that is luminous clarity, direct knowing. hence, this emptiness is characterized as the “abode of great bliss”; that is to say, when focused on and familiarized with, it has the power to give rise to the pristine awareness of great bliss. This emptiness is therefore the source of that [great bliss].

[in the Kalachakra Tantra,] there are many references to the causeand-result relationship between this emptiness and great bliss, as in the following:
Emptiness, the image, the apprehended, the cause;[47]
Moreover, in the introductory remarks [section of the Kalachakra Tantra,][48] this emptiness is explained by means of terms such as “syllable é,” “vagina (bhaga),” and “source of phenomena”;[49] and bliss, by means of terms such as “syllable vam,” “holder of the vajra,” and “phenomenon.” however, one needs to understand that these [emptiness and bliss] are of an uncommon relationship, by virtue of being the union of the support [emptiness] and what is supported [bliss]. This profound point is valued as one of supreme [importance].
This empty form endowed with the supreme of all aspects is of the essential nature of inseparable emptiness and compassion. Familiarization with it is known as “vajra yoga.” hence, this emptiness, by virtue of being the emptiness of a union [with compassion (bliss)], should be understood to be the supreme central path.[50] Knowing how [this emptiness] is presented as the ultimate truth [divided] into types, one should understand that terms such as “source of phenomena” and “mother of the buddhas”—[when used] to propound [this emptiness] as the ultimate view of the definitive meaning, as the source of the strengths[51] and other [qualities of buddhas], and as the abode of great bliss—denote all that pertains to uncommon wisdom. in view of that, [the Kalachakra Tantra] uses such expressions as this:
Supreme mother of buddhas....
This emptiness should therefore be understood to be the path of the fourth initiation as well.[52] Thus, there are citations such as this:
The initiation that resembles the stainless moon....

Nevertheless, one might wonder, “Whether or not the dimension endowed with the supreme of all aspects can manifest as the pristine awareness of great bliss, in any case, isn’t that pristine awareness—which is free from all conceptual elaborations of apprehender and apprehended— merely the cessation of all dualistic experience, and therefore an emptiness devoid of any perceivable appearance?” however, that is not so. That freedom from elaborations in itself is what arises as the circle [of deities] of the mandala, and so forth, everything in cyclic existence and [the state of] liberation, having [all] aspects of the three realms. Moreover, that manifestation is not a relative appearance, karmic appearance, or delusory appearance, but is a manifestation of pristine awareness, a manifestation of reality itself, a manifestation of the primordial nature.
That being said, this manifestation accords in aspects with forms, sounds, and so on. There may therefore arise the notion that this is a phenomenon composed of atoms. in consideration of that, [the Kalachakra Tantra] repeatedly mentions that [this manifestation] is devoid of atomic structure. There are, however, some who say that what is called emptiness here is not the true ultimate emptiness but is instead an emptiness that is the absence of phenomena composed of atoms. That talk [indicates] a distorted view with regard to the profound meaning.
This all-aspects emptiness is spoken of by the name “emptiness that has a point of reference.” having a point of reference does not mean that it is attended by elaborations, designations, concepts, or efforts. “point of reference” means what is actually seen and experienced and therefore what manifests directly to undeluded pristine awareness. This is the true emptiness that is the ultimate dimension of phenomena. Thus, it represents ultimate truth as it is generally known.

The compassion being discussed [here in the context of the completion phase] is significantly different from ordinary compassion and great compassion, as well that termed “awakened compassion,”[53] as generally spoken of in the common ways [to realization]. in addition, in this mantra way, there is a threefold distinction, set forth in [Vitapada’s] Sevenfold Yoga,[54] in terms of [levels of] individuals: the compassion of a beginner; the compassion of a bodhisattva who has achieved a stage of realization; and the compassion of a buddha. When taught from a general perspective, those are called “compassion alone,” comparable to calling the common emptiness “emptiness alone.”
What is meant is that, unlike the compassion of union [with emptiness], this common compassion by itself—even if one had cultivated it continuously for the entirety of an eon—would not enable one to cross over cyclic existence. compassion alone therefore falls to the side of eternalism and hence is termed “eternalism alone.” accordingly, saraha states:[55]
One may have thoroughly familiarized with compassion alone But still remain in this cycle, without transcending suffering.[56]
That being the case, in a context such as the completion phase, which is based on the swift path of mantra, what is called the “compassion that is the root of method” should not be taken to mean compassion alone. The root-of-method compassion is considered to be primarily what is known as the “compassion of union [with emptiness].” This union-compassion should be applied as yoga in the path of uncommon emptiness whose essence is compassion.

The actual basis of the characteristics of that compassion of union is the uncommon changeless great bliss; that is to say, the self-cognizant dimension of ineffable great-bliss pristine awareness, which is the ultimate dimension of phenomena, unchanging by nature, united as a single essence with the unemitted vital-essence support.
This great bliss overcomes the suffering of oneself and others. it is therefore great compassion, since to fully protect all suffering beings is the characteristic [that defines] great compassion.
Although that is so, [bliss is taught as compassion] not because it simply fits the etymology of the word “compassion” but because [bliss] manifests with an aspect, or mode of apprehension, of supremely great love for all beings without exception. Great bliss has no point of reference since all dualistic experience has ceased and the seal of the ineffable is never transcended. Thus, it is called “compassion without a point of reference.” Moreover, even the bliss [experienced with] an action seal[57] is a manifestation of compassion. as it is said:
To offer everything as a cause for awakening through the method of the wisdom [seal] is to possess a mind endowed with the compassion of a king or minister.[58]
Thus, there are three compassions: the bliss of the action seal, which has sentient beings as its point of reference; the bliss of the pristine-awareness seal, with phenomena as its point of reference; and the bliss of the great seal, with no point of reference.[59]

[in tantras other than Kalachakra,] great bliss is considered to be relative. That great bliss is not actually relative, but it must be realized by relying on the method of bliss from the melting of the relative [vital essence]. it is therefore considered relative owing to its connection to the relative.
In this context—that of the uncommon system of Kalachakra— changeless great bliss is designated as ultimate truth since such bliss is distinguished by the disappearance of conceptual elaborations related to apprehender and apprehended, and so forth. The great seal of empty form endowed with the supreme of all aspects is designated[60] as relative truth since, in terms of its aspects being consistent with those of relative [phenomena], it exists as the true nature of every single relative phenomenon. in fact, the unchanging bliss and [the emptiness] endowed with the supreme of all aspects are one in nature. Therefore, unchanging bliss itself, being the very nature of all phenomena, is without change. in terms of being bliss, it exists in its own right purely as ultimate [truth]. in terms of its manifesting as the totality of all aspects, that great bliss itself is the intrinsic nature or true reality of all relative phenomena. its being the totality of all aspects is therefore considered relative truth. That said, this explanation has been given in order that through it one may come to such understanding.
This [“compassion”] is also named “the union of cause and result.” although there is no true cause (as the producer) and result (as the produced), the ultimate dimension of phenomena that is the nature of all causes is the empty form [endowed with the supreme of all aspects], and the ultimate dimension of all results is unchanging bliss. From emptiness—as a function of its very nature—arises bliss. Therefore, emptiness resembles a cause; bliss, a result. There are no differentiations to be made in terms of the essential natures [of empty form and great bliss]. however, as to the way the yogin achieves realization, the first five branches of the [sixfold] yoga[61] [bring about] realization of the characteristics of the totality of all aspects but not the realization based on unchanging bliss. From [the branch of] contemplation onwards, that bliss is also realized. Thus, the path of realization of great bliss arises from the path of realization of just emptiness itself. The agent of realization, the pristine awareness of the path, therefore acts as both cause and result. hence, that which is realized, the ultimate dimension of phenomena, is also designated as both cause and result.[62]

That being so, the actual union at the time of the path arises from the branch of contemplation. This union, which is the merging into one of knower and knowable, should be understood as the inseparable union of emptiness and compassion. accordingly, the term “knowable” means the mind that is apprehended, in other words, the emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects: wisdom. The “knower” is the apprehending mind, that is, supreme changeless great bliss: method. The seeing of the appearance of such a knowable precedes such a knower, which arises after. The knowable is therefore called “cause,” and the knower, “result.” in this [contemplation] branch, this cause and result “seal” each other by being inseparably merged and hence are termed “union.”
In summary, the nature of reality at the ground stage is thatof the essence of that union. hence, the resultant pristine awareness also has the essential nature of the union. Therefore, the path or method one applies in order to realize that [pristine awareness] must also have the characteristic [quality] of the union. This is because it is the natural [law] of all things that a particular cause will give rise to a corresponding result.
That union, as just explained, is the essential nature of the union of the pristine awareness that is unchanging great bliss and the emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects. it is also the union of great compassion and emptiness. Even the union of the illusory body and luminous clarity is simply this union alone. accordingly, the Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra states:[63]
Yoga will not be achieved by the body of method alone, nor by wisdom alone.
The Transcendent one taught yoga as the union of method and wisdom.
“Great compassion,” “luminous clarity,”[64] and “unchanging bliss” are identical in meaning. Moreover, these are explained as being the method, or relative truth as it is generally known. “Emptiness,” “the illusory body,” and “the dimension [of emptiness] endowed with the supreme of all aspects” are identical in meaning. These are considered to be wisdom, or ultimate truth as it is generally known.

There are various formulations of the completion-phase branches.
The Guhyasamaja Root Tantra teaches six stages: body isolation, Voice isolation, mind isolation, illusory body, luminous clarity, and union.
The first can be included in either the creation phase or vajra recitation,
So that all stages are included in the widely known five stages, namely,
Vajra recitation, focus on mind, self-consecration, actual awakening, and union.
This five-stage formulation is that of the tradition of Arya Nagarjuna.

The branches of the completion phase are very numerous. [some are] explicitly set forth in the highest yoga tantras; [others,] formulated by individual accomplished masters. What follows now, however, is a discussion of simply the essence of the principal and widely known sets [of branches].
In the sixteenth chapter of the Guhyasamaja Root Tantra, a father tantra,[2] it is said:
Through definite understanding of mantra, the voice cultivated through the body invokes the mind
So that the goals to be realized—the most supreme,
The power, gladness, and contentment—are met.
The meaning of this verse is as follows: “Through definite understanding of mantra” [arises] voice isolation. “Through the body” means what [tantras] call “the emanation body,” which cultivates vajra recitation; that is, body isolation. The isolation of “voice” cultivated by that [body isolation] “invokes the mind,” in the sense of making it its object. “Mind” is the Vajrasattva present in one’s heart. By means of that, the four [stages] such as “the most supreme” are “the goals to be realized” in the yogin’s mind. This “most supreme” [stage] is mind isolation, perfectly attained through vajra recitation. “The power” means self-consecration [i.e., the illusory body]. “Gladness” refers to luminous clarity, the ultimate truth, which purifies that illusory body. “contentment” means the dimension of Great Vajradhara, the state of union.[3] This explanation is given in [chandrakirti’s] Illuminating Lamp,[4] which distinguishes six stages [in the completion phase]. [aryadeva’s] [Lamp] Summary of Tantric Practice[5] sets forth the completion phase in the same way.
Arya Nagarjuna formulated the completion phase in five stages, the first of which is vajra recitation. This system follows what is taught in the last chapter of the Indestructible Garland, an explanatory tantra [of Guhyasamaja]:[6]
By means of proficiency in vajra recitation
The characteristics of winds are understood.
Then the winds of thoughts are stopped, and the focus on mind is thereby attained.
By means of the stage of self-consecration,
The eight powers[7] are gained.
Knowing the distinctions of light, and so forth,
The stage of actual awakening is attained.
To abide in the stage of union having gained all powers:
This is accomplished in this very life.

since the first [of the six stages], body isolation, can be included in either the creation phase or vajra recitation, the presentation of the completion phase in five stages is widely known. The five stages [as distinguished in the above citation] are taught as follows: [first,] the stage of vajra recitation, or voice isolation; [second,] the stage of focus on the mind, or [isolation of] mind; [third,] the stage of self-consecration, or the relative-truth illusory body; [fourth,] the stage of actual awakening, or the ultimate-truth luminous clarity; and [fifth,] the stage of nondual pristine awareness, or the union of the two truths.[8] [These are] delineated in [nagarjuna’s] Five Stages:[9]
Gradually, by means of the principle of winds, [The yogin] fathoms the principle of mantra. With understanding of the focus on mantra, he trains in the vajra-recitation [techniques].
Abiding in [the practice of] vajra recitation, The yogin comes to attain the focus on mind.
Abiding in the illusion-like contemplation, he will gain mastery through the true limit.
When he has emerged from that true limit,[10] he will attain nondual pristine awareness.
Abiding in the contemplation of union, he will have nothing more to learn.[11]
These five are the same as the five essential principles taught in [aryadeva’s]
Lamp Summary of Tantric Practice.[12]
From another perspective, the stage of vajra recitation is merely a preliminary for the mind-focus [stage], while it is the focus on mind that is the true causal completion phase.[13] The four stages of the completion phase (when vajra recitation is considered part of the [mind-focus] branch) plus the creation phase (as the first stage) constitute the five stages of the combination of the creation and completion phases.

[This way of differentiating the five stages] is taught in chandrakirti’s Illuminating Lamp:[14]
Accomplishment of the secret-mantra body is the phase of creation, the first stage.
The focus on the mind alone is said to be the second stage.
Revelation of the relative truth is the pleasing third stage.
Purification of the relative truth is referred to as the fourth stage.
That which merges the two truths is known as union, the fifth stage.
From yet another perspective, vajra recitation itself is regarded as the foundation of the path since the main practice in the mind-focus [stage] is vajra recitation. The four stages of the completion phase (when mind-focus is included in vajra recitation) plus the creation phase constitute the five stages. This [way of differentiating the five] is taught in the Continuation of the Kalachakra Tantra and accords with the explanations [of the Guhyasamaja] written by abhayakaragupta,[15] Munishribhadra,[16] and others.
It is not the case thatnone of those [sources] accept the stage of body isolation. however, they consider it to be a preliminary to the vajra-recitation stage and a subtle result of the creation phase. There are some individuals who accomplish [body isolation] as a side effect [of the creation phase]. others—although not cultivating [body isolation] separately—still may develop vajra recitation and the other stages. hence, [body isolation] is considered to be not absolutely required and therefore not presented as a separate stage.
In order to understand the meanings of those [five stages], one [should] learn, from the perspective of a gradual engagement, first the system of the creation phase and then the system of the six stages of the completion phase.[17] The five stages are implicit [in those], and they constitute the extraordinary completion-phase [system] as formulated by nagarjuna and aryadeva. Knowledge of them is therefore indispensable. Consequently, [the seven stages—the creation phase and six completion-phase stages—
Are presented next]. Only the essence of each stage and the divisions will be discussed.

The essence of the creation phase is described as follows: its very cause is a creative process based on thought. its essential nature is that of a deity yoga that may be either conceptual or nonconceptual. its form is the purification of the three [processes] of cyclic existence (birth, death, and the intermediate state) through means that accord in elements with the three; and the utilization of those [three] as the path through means that accord in aspects with the three dimensions of awakening. its purpose is that of a foundation that acts as the ripening agent for the completion phase. its supportive element is contemplation accompanied by deliberate bliss and emptiness.
[Various aspects of] the creation phase are differentiated:
The creation phase can be divided into three contemplations: contemplation practiced on the basis of the creation phase;[18] contemplation of the actual creation phase itself; [and contemplation of] the creation phase that is related to the completion phase. This is a differentiation made from the perspective of the individual meditator.
Considered in terms of the deity meditated upon, the creation phase is divided into two: the visualization of an entire mandala; and the visualization of a part of it.
It is also divided into branches of contemplation: the four branches of familiarization and attainment; the four yogas; the three contemplations; the six branches;[19] and so forth.
Considered in terms of stages in the development of powers, the creation phase can be divided into familiarization, close familiarization, attainment, and great attainment.
Considered in terms of superior and inferior levels of meditation, the creation phase can be divided into conceptual yoga and single recollection.[20] These topics have already been treated in detail above but are included here as an ancillary in order that the components of this system’s path can be understood in their entirety.

The essence of [the stage of] body isolation consists in the deity’s form, which, without being generated by thoughts, appears from the state of bliss and emptiness to the mind alone.
The body-isolation [stage] can be divided into two: equipoise; and postequipoise. alternatively, four aspects are differentiated: the single sealed procedure of one hundred families; the second procedure of five families; the third procedure of three families; and a single sealed procedure of one great secret family.[21]

The essence of the [stage of] voice isolation [is a contemplation that] serves the functions of causing the major winds, primarily the life wind, to enter, abide, and dissolve in the central channel, and of stabilizing their dissolution [into vital essence]. This is done on the basis of knowing the characteristics of the winds[22] and knowing the definitive meaning of mantras.[23]
Voice isolation can be divided into three meditations: meditation on the vital essence of light at the nose-tip of the face; meditation on the indestructible vital essence at the nose-tip of the heart; and meditation on the vital essence of substance at the nose-tip of the secret place.[24]
The first meditation consists of the vajra recitation of the four lords[25] (method); the vajra recitation of the four goddesses (wisdom); and the vajra recitation of the secondary winds (the secret), and so forth.[26] of the many types of vajra recitation, this type [of the first voice-isolation meditation] is the vajra recitation that purifies the pathways of the channels. Moreover, this vajra recitation, when done for a very long time, can definitely bind the winds within the central channel. however, it is particularly recommended for releasing the coarse knots [of the channels] for the very [purpose of] purifying the pathways of the channels.
The second [the meditation on the indestructible vital essence at the nose-tip of the heart] is recommended for first gathering the winds in the central channel and finally binding them to the vital essence in the central channel.
The third [the meditation on the vital essence of substance at the nose-tip of the secret place] enhances the results of the previous two [meditations].

The essence of [the stage of] mind isolation is the pristine awareness of bliss and emptiness [that manifests] through the stabilization of vital essence. This stabilization is due to thought-[generating] winds having dissolved for brief periods of time in the channel-wheels, through the force of meditation. [27]
Two [aspects] of mind isolation are distinguished: the practice of mind isolation; and the actual mind isolation.[28] The second of those, the actual mind isolation, comprises four levels: the level of light; the level of the increase of light; the level of the culmination of light; and the final-example luminous clarity.[29]

The essence of the illusory-body stage is described as follows: its primary cause is the mere wind-mind of luminous clarity. The secondary condition for its manifestation is the bliss of molten [vital essence] resulting from the dissolution of winds into the indestructible [vital essence at the heart]. The form manifests as the [mandala-]circle of the deity or like an illusion. The experience is one that indicates the nature of bliss from the melting [of the vital essence]. its function is that of a contemplation that can perform the activities of the yogin’s body.[30]
Four [aspects] of the illusory-body stage are distinguished: illusion in the state of equipoise; illusion in post-equipoise; illusion in the dream [state]; and illusion in the intermediate state.[31] according to an alternative [explanation], the illusory-body [stage] has three divisions: newly attained; in progress; and final.[32]

The Guhyasamaja completion phase in the tradition of Jnanapada (Buddhashrijnana) [stems from] what are called the Oral Teachings of Manjushri.[39] These Teachings were directly transmitted by arya [Manjushri] himself to the master Buddhashrijnana.[40] having received Lord [Manjushri’s] permission, Buddhajnana composed his own Vital Essence of Liberation.[41] The meditations contained in those works, as they are generally known, [are the yogas of the four vital essences, explained as follows]: [The practitioner trains in the first] yoga, that of the indestructible vital essence at the heart, which is related to joy; [and then, the second,] the yoga of the secret vital essence at the jewel [the tip of the sex organ], related to supreme joy. after having first gained proficiency in those two yogas related to vital essences, [one trains in the third,] the wind yoga of the emanated vital essence at the upper nose-tip, related to special joy.
When one has gained proficiency in wind yoga, owing to the vital essences and winds having become workable, again one trains [in yoga], the [fourth] special [yoga], that of the indestructible vital essence, related to innate joy.[42] on the basis of that, one repeatedly familiarizes oneself with dissolution into luminous clarity in the forward order and arising [from it] in the reverse order.[43] as a result, one unites with the pristine awareness that is inseparable profundity and clarity. Buddhashrijnana’s Oral Teachings of Manjushri states:[44]
The nature of all phenomena, from form To omniscience, is the pristine awareness of inseparable profundity and clarity, utterly pure like the center of space.
Thus, it is generally taught that the ultimate end of the completion phase is the pristine awareness of inseparable profundity and clarity, which is the fundamental state or true condition of all phenomena—from form to omniscience—of cyclic existence and liberation, and whose nature is utter purity, like the center of space.

That being so, by means of the meditations of the yogas of the four vital essences, the vital essences and winds of the body are made workable.[45] as a result, the mind itself, which has entered profundity, the essential nature [of reality], unites inseparably with clarity, the illusion-like body of the deity, the great seal.[46] This final result is reached by cultivating the two [profundity and clarity] not alternately but simultaneously. [Buddhashrijnana’s] Vital Essence of Liberation says:[47]

Totally free from any kind of concept, utterly inconceivable and inexpressible, stainless like space, the source of everything: it is known as profundity beyond scrutiny.
Bearing the form of the great seal,
It is like an illusion or a rainbow,
Purifying one’s own and others’ minds:
It is known as sublime clarity.
The supreme nature of their inseparability
Is the essence that encompasses all things,
Utterly untouched by cyclic existence: it is
Known as the ultimate dimension of phenomena.

Profundity refers to that which can neither be conceived of nor expressed in words and is devoid of the stains of conceptual elaboration and labeling. it is simply mind itself, bound by no limits whatsoever, like space. clarity refers to the unceasing natural luminosity [of mind itself], utterly clear and stainless, which manifests as the diversity [of appearances], like an illusion or a rainbow. Those two [aspects] of profundity and clarity, merged inseparably as the path of union, will lead one to freedom, while neither profundity nor clarity on its own can do so.
Thus, the ultimate crucial point to be reached in every completion phase is what is called the “union of the two truths,” “union of profundity and clarity,” or “union of bliss and emptiness.” in all the completion-phase [systems] of the great chariot[-like] traditions it is necessary to have an understanding—gained through some kind of sequential explanation of the way the union is and the way it is inseparable—of this [union] that is the principal cause of enlightenment. in the context of the creation phase as well, that very crucial point [is the basis on which] is explained the step of arising from the state of emptiness as the body of the deity, after having entered emptiness through [uttering] the svabhava mantra.[48] The purpose of all other completion-phase [systems] is to attain that pristine-awareness body of union. Thus, after considering the ways in which that is brought about in the methods of practice, one will thereby grasp the crucial points of the completion phase.

The esoteric instructions and explanatory teachings that are particular[49] to the Jnanapada system consist of exactly three topics of teaching: the instructions on the inseparability of profundity and clarity (contained in the Oral Instructions of Manjushri); the instructions on the pristine awareness of the supreme initiation; and the instructions contained in [Buddhajnana’s] unsurpassable Vital Essence of Liberation.[50] The first of the three comprises instruction on profundity, the ineffable; instruction on clarity, the mandala; and instruction on the ultimate, [the state of] union. The last of the three contains extremely deep forms of instructions on the creation phase and on [the yogas of] the four vital essences or three stages of the completion phase.[51]
There are three general forms of instructions set forth by the great master Jnanapada:
[The first is] a completion phase for the least capable, who would [simply] make a connection to the completion phase by means of aspiration to practice it in future lives but cultivate only the creation phase in this life.
[The second is] a completion phase for those of average capability, who in this life would cultivate mainly the completion phase while accomplishing the creation phase as a side effect. This is the path [that leads] to awakening in the intermediate state [between death and rebirth] or in another lifetime.
[The third is] a completion phase for the most capable, which is the path of the creation and completion phases sealed as a union. This brings about awakening within this very lifetime. of those three, the instructions [discussed above] belong to the last form.[52]
The set of instructions in [Buddhashrijnana’s] Vital Essence of Liberation is to be applied to the individual mandalas of the five families, such as akshobhya[-Guhyasamaja] of the Jnanapada tradition, as well as to the [mandala of] Avalokiteshvara-Guhyasamaja, and so forth, of the Jonangpa tradition. Therefore, other sets of instructions for those practices need not be sought. Lord [Kunga] Drolchok[53] states that these [completion-phase instructions] constitute the sixfold yoga of Guhyasamaja taught in the Continuation of the Root Tantra.[54]

The view to be understood by means of great master shridhara’s teachings has been examined in the creation-phase section. The completion-phase view is explained in accordance with the citations taken from the hero saraha’s Doha[55] [found] in the commentary on the last chapter of the Black [Yamari Tantra].[56] one should therefore gain extensive understanding [of this view by studying] the Treasury of Doha. The great master Jnanapada’s explanation is also the same as that [of the Doha].[57]
The main part of the completion phase, formed of various procedures that are methods of meditation on emptiness, consists of four practices: the shape yoga (initial yoga); the mantra yoga (subsequent yoga); the consecration yoga (surpassing yoga); and the pristine-awareness yoga (great yoga).[58]
The first, the shape yoga or initial yoga, comprises three stages: the stage of self-consecration; the stage of consecrating appearances; and the stage of consecrating the union.[59]
The second, the mantra yoga or subsequent yoga, consists of the main practice of wind [yoga], which comprises preliminary, main, and conclusion parts; and the auxiliary practices, consisting of the upward transference [of consciousness] and the transference [of consciousness] to one’s master.[60]
The third, the consecration yoga or surpassing yoga, consists of [the practice of] one’s own body as method; and that of another’s body as wisdom (familiarization, attainment, and the action [of the union]).[61]
The fourth, the wisdom yoga or great yoga, has three aspects: the preliminary practice to bring about the dissolution of the subtle and coarse constituents in the central channel;[62] the main part in which the [illusory] body and luminous clarity are applied as a union; and the supplementary practice by means of which negative conditions are implemented on the path according to the text on the six ways of averting [obstacles].[63]
This [system of completion phase] can generally be applied to any form of the creation phase. however, it is very closely related primarily to three [tantras,] Red Yamari, Black Yamari, and Vajrabhairava,[64] in the expositions of the adept shridhara[65] and is applied especially to the thirteen-deities Red Yamari [practices].

Another [system] is that of the superior completion phase of Yamari [based on] the oral teachings of Virupa, a master outstanding in strengths.[66] The Vajra Verses [i.e., Virupa’s Esoteric Instructions on Essential Reality] states:[67]
Even though one intellectually understands
The utterly unelaborate speech of one’s master,
One’s mind will not be touched by the unelaborate
So long as it is agitated by disturbing elaborations.
When one’s mind simply abides in the ordinary,
Elaboration will merge with the unelaborate
In the state of the sameness of a single taste.
Accordingly, the esoteric instructions on the utterly unelaborate consist of a preliminary practice, a main practice, and a concluding practice.
The preliminary practice is guru yoga. By means of its three forms of offering, [conceptual] elaborations are cut,[68] and the powers of the three pristine awarenesses are gained.[69]
The main practice contains the principles [related to] the three [i.e., body, wind, and mind] by means of which ineffable pristine awareness is manifested.[70]
The concluding practice can be succinctly condensed into two methods: [one,] the sixfold means for cultivating pure and total awareness (bodhichitta); and [two,] the way to dispel obstacles or hindrances. The first comprises six yogas, namely, guru yoga (the blessing); compassion yoga (the unequalled); causal yoga (the root); wind yoga (the pranayama); substance yoga (the interconnectedness); and the Vajrabhairava yoga. The second [has five aspects]: the causes of obstacles; their contributory factors; methods for dispelling them; measure [of success] in dispelling obstacles; and six types of instructions for dispelling them.[71]
Those esoteric instructions constitute what is widely known as the “unelaborate completion-phase system of Red Yamari.” in this land [of Tibet], the first person to write down the esoteric instructions was Lowo Lotsawa.[72] his commentary on the Concluding Session[73] and other of his works should be studied in order to understand the significance and essential points of the practices and their applications.

practitioners of the Yamari Tantra [74] who are capable of [cultivating] the completion phase and wish to practice the supreme familiarization [should] enter the four stages of yoga [the initial, the subsequent, the surpassing, and the great].
The initial yoga comprises six branches, namely, withdrawal, meditative absorption, wind yoga, retention, recollection, and contemplation. By means of these, the culmination of the first special stage is reached. The six branches of the initial yoga have the same names as the vajra yogas, but their meanings are different.[75]
Following the focus on mantra, focus on mind, and examination of the vajra fields of each of body, speech, and mind, and of all three faculties together, the subsequent yoga is cultivated. as a result, stability in the two phases[76] is achieved.[77]
The next, the complete yoga, involves setting up the mandala for practice and engaging in an elaborate [form of] deliberate behavior with an awareness female.[78]
The great yoga is practiced once stability [in the third yoga] is attained.
one dispenses with [the practices related to] the external mandala, and so forth, and trains solely in entering the luminous clarity of bliss and emptiness and arising from it during equipoise and post-equipoise. Forming a link through either an action seal or a pristine-awareness seal, one enters the all-encompassing conduct of the lord.[79]

This [system] is taught in the Black Yamari Tantra, and its meaning elucidated in the work of the great master Devakarachandra.[80] These [texts] were translated, and [the system] practiced and realized, by Zhang Lotsawa sherab Lama.[81] This [presentation] is a condensation of [the system’s] profound meaning that accords with the progression of the path of the Jnanapada tradition [of Guhyasamaja] and other [systems].[82]
Those [systems of the Guhyasamaja, Red Yamari, and Black Yamari tantras] are [formulations of the] completion phase of the highest [yoga] father tantras that are widely known here [in Tibet]. They constitute the main [father-tantra completion-phase] sets of instructions that form autonomous systems of teachings.
In addition, numerous minor [formulations of the completion phase] exist. Thereare, forexample, the following systems for the completion phase of the Mahavajrabhairava [tantra]:[83] the gathering of nectar, together with the nose-tip yoga (the system of the great master shantipa);[84] the esoteric instructions for the innate dimension of utterly unelaborate profundity; the completion phase of the tiers of three beings; the yoga of the buffalo face and of the erect penis,[85] and so forth (the system of Ra [Lotsawa]);[86] the esoteric instructions for the horn-tips [method of] holding the mind; the esoteric instructions for wandering at night,[87] and so forth (the system of Kyo);[88] the inner fire involving four channel-wheels [89] (the system of Zhang).[90] [apart from these,] there is the completion phase of the Net of Magical Manifestation of Manjushri,[91] the great vastness of which can be naturally inferred from its tantra and esoteric instructions for the practice. Thus, there seem to be countless examples.

[This chapter continues the presentation of the completion phase in terms of its branches. What follows now is] part two: completion-phase[systems] in highest yoga mother tantras. This discussion has seven parts: [one,] the completion phase in Kalachakra; [two,] in hevajra; [three,] in chakrasamvara; [four,] in chatuhpitha; [five,] in Mahamaya; [six,] in Buddhakapala; and [seven,] in Tarabhava. [The first two parts, the completion-phase systems of Kalachakra and hevajra, are treated in this chapter.]

The Supreme Primordial Buddha [Kalachakra Tantra],[1] the king of all yogin and yogini tantras, presents clearly and without concealment the six branches of vajra yoga, which are concealed in the concise tantras and are the stated meaning of the extensive root tantras. [The branches are contained in the] Kalachakra Root Tantra. Moreover, the Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra states:[2]
Withdrawal, meditative absorption, Wind yoga, retention, recollection, and contemplation: these are said To be the six branches of yoga.
The Chakrasamvara Root Tantra states:[3]
Mantra recitation, meditative absorption, and bliss will bring about achievement.
In addition, the Hevajra Tantra states:[4]
The yogin who meditates on the six branches....
There are many similar references. in short, the six branches are withdrawal, meditative absorption, wind yoga, retention, recollection, and contemplation. Those six branches [fit into other frameworks as follows]:
In relation to the yogas of the four vajras, withdrawal and meditative absorption constitute the vajra yoga of awakened body; wind yoga and retention, the vajra yoga of awakened speech; recollection, the vajra yoga of awakened mind; and contemplation, the vajra yoga of pristine awareness.
In terms of the four branches of familiarization and attainment, withdrawal and meditative absorption constitute familiarization; wind yoga and retention, near attainment; recollection constitutes attainment; and contemplation, great attainment.
In terms of the three virtues, withdrawal and meditative absorption represent virtue in the beginning; wind yoga and retention, virtue in the middle; and recollection and contemplation, virtue in the end.
In terms of cause and result, three—withdrawal, wind yoga, and recollection—are causal branches; and three—meditative absorption, retention, and contemplation—resultant branches.
All six, however, are one in being the yoga of the great seal. These six branches form the core of the path of meditation on the great seal of empty form endowed with the supreme of all aspects. That [great seal] is the supreme of wisdom females. Thus, [the six branches] form the supramundane path of pristine awareness [through] wisdom. During the first five branches, a true moment of changeless bliss is not achieved. however, from the point of [first] seeing empty form, there will be a fraction of a moment of changeless bliss [in all the branches].
As each branch has been realized, the next branch arises. The branches are therefore part of the sequence as they first arise.

The first [branch] is called with drawal. [The Tibetan] term sor sdud, a translation of the [sanskrit] word pratyahara,[5] means to sever the connection between one’s five ordinary sense powers and their five objects and withdraw the dissipated consciousnesses; and [to cause] one’s five sense powers, pristine awareness in nature, to enjoy, consume, and seize[6] the five objects, luminous clarity in nature. in short, “withdrawal” means to withdraw the mind from ordinary appearances, whereupon one enters the manifestations of pristine awareness.[7]
The essence of withdrawal is a nonconceptual [state] that has the capacity to withdraw the winds [and direct them] into the central channel by means of [practice involving] the three unmoving [faculties].[8] Withdrawal comprises two yogas, that of the day and that of the night, [both of which are necessary for these reasons:] The environmental world undergoes both creation and destruction. The beings who inhabit it are subject to both birth and death. a year is made up of two passages.[9] a month has two [lunar] phases [waxing and waning]. a day consists of both daytime and nighttime. Vital essences have left and right cycles.[10] Time junctures and winds have both even and uneven transits.[11] These and other [examples] represent the purity that is differentiated in terms of method and wisdom, owing to which both yogas, the day and the night, are definitely necessary.
The objects [of withdrawal] are the four signs of the night yoga, beginning with the smoke, and the six signs of the day yoga, beginning with the blazing. These constitute the ten signs with definite [forms], which are actually seen by the sense powers.[12] They are the principal objects.
The ground to be purified of stains by means of all six branches is solely the true nature [of things], the essence of the transcendent ones, and therefore has no divisions. however, differentiations may be made in terms of what is to be purified, which in general means the thirty-six psychophysical constituents.[13] of those, the portion that is withdrawal’s own sphere of purification comprises six [constituents] that form a single group: the element of pristine awareness,[14] the aggregate of pristine awarenesses, [the mental sense power, the objects of sounds, the male regenerative faculty, and the activity of discharging urine].
This branch’s immediate result is the accomplishment of the [power of] words of truth and the fruitions of mantras.[15]
The ultimate result is the manifestation of the infinite mandalas of the six deities, Vajrasattva and the others, who are [the purified] six [constituents] of the pristine-awareness-element group.[16]

The second branch is that of meditative absorption. The [Tibetan] term bsam gtan [translates the sanskrit] word dhyana, which means mind focused unwaveringly on an object of meditation. To explain [by using an example], if a door’s bar has been properly installed, the door will not become warped or shift position, and one will then have control over its opening and closing. similarly, the meaning [of bsam gtan] is to gain control over [mind’s focus on] the object of meditation.
The essence of meditative absorption is that of a contemplation undividedly focused on the manifesting signs of luminous clarity. such contemplation is accompanied by five factors, namely, intelligence, examination, analysis, joy, and bliss, whose objects—the various subtle images [of the universe], and so forth—[manifest] with five qualities.[17]
The sphere of purification comprises six [constituents] that form a single group: the elementof space, the aggregate of consciousnesses, [the sense power of the ears, the objects of mental phenomena, the female regenerative faculty, and the activity of emitting regenerative fluid].
The immediate result is the development of the five [kinds of] clairvoyance such as the divine eye.[18]
The ultimate result is the manifestation of the six deities, Buddha akshobhya and the others, who are [the purified] six [constituents] of the space-element group.[19]

The third branch is the yoga of the winds. [The Tibetan] terms srog rtsol [“life exertion”] and srog ’gag pa [“life stopping”] are translations of the [sanskrit] word pranayama. in those terms, srog [“life”] is a name for wind. To stop the winds or to exert [control over] the winds means to cause them to enter [the central channel].
The objects to be worked on [in the branch] of wind yoga are all of the channels, winds, and vital essences of the vajra body in general. of those, however, the main objects are the six channels: three channels above the navel (the right channel, left channel, and central channel) and three channels below the navel (the channel of feces, channel of urine, and channel of semen); and the two winds: the life wind and the downward-voiding wind.[20]
The purpose of the wind-yoga meditation is to bring together the causes for unchanging bliss. one approach to that is the great seal of empty form,[21] which is therefore cultivated even in the contexts of the withdrawal and meditative absorption [branches]. The main approach, however, is to gain victory over the winds and bind them within the central channel, whereby the vajra body[22] becomes completely pure, and deathlessness and mastery over the vital essences are attained.
The essence of wind yoga is stopping the winds [from flowing] in the right and left channels [and bringing them] into the central channel;[23] and stopping the winds from flowing in the lower feces and urine channels [and bringing them] into the conch-shell channel.[24] it is a contemplation that unifies the life wind flowing in the central channel and the downward voiding wind flowing in the conch-shell channel.
The sphere of purification comprises six [constituents] that form a single group: the element of wind, the aggregate of mental formations, [the sense power of the nose, the objects of tangible things, the faculty of the voice, and the activity of defecation].
The immediate result of wind yoga is to accrue [various] benefits by stopping erratic winds from flowing in the left and right channels. These benefits include receiving prophecies from and being blessed by buddhas and bodhisattvas; enjoyment of the six sensory objects, forms and so forth, as manifestations of pristine awareness; developing clairvoyances of the six sense powers; and acquiring power over human and nonhuman beings.
The ultimate result is to attain [the manifestation of] the six deities, amoghasiddhi and the others, who are [the purified] six [constituents] of the wind-element group.[25]

<d e="2">
The fourth branch is that of retention. [The sanskrit] word dharana means both “to retain” (’dzin pa) and “that which is retained” ( gzung bya) and therefore has various translations. however, in this context, the meaning is to retain (’dzin pa) the winds so that they do not come and go.
The object to be worked on [in the branch of retention] is the wind of bliss, which is the wind mixed with[26] the indestructible vital essence.
The purpose of the meditation is to bind bodhichitta so that it does not move and thereby to produce the inner fire’s blazing light, which is the root from which originate the special empty forms that directly induce unchanging bliss.
The essence of retention is, in general, a contemplation in which the upper, lower, right, and left winds[27] [are brought into the central channel] where they dissolve into the central-channel vital essences present at the five (or six) channel-wheels.[28] in particular, once [that] is accomplished, and when the life wind has fully penetrated the vital essence at the forehead, it is a contemplation in which mind is focused on the unemitted vital essence that is fixed at the forehead.
The sphere of purification comprises six [constituents] that form a single group: the element of fire, the aggregate of feelings, [the sense power of the eye, the objects of tastes, the faculty of the arms, and the activity of going].
The immediate results from retention consist in the elimination of physical suffering, such as aging and illness; [gaining] the capacity to use emotional afflictions as the path, and so on, thus defeating the four kinds of demonic forces to some extent; and the development of special strengths of body, speech, and mind.[29]
The ultimate result from retention is the manifestation of the six deities, Ratnasambhava and the others, who are [the purified] six [constituents] of the fire-element group.[30]

The fifth branch is recollection. [The sanskrit] word anusmriti means to recollect. [in this context, the Tibetan] term rjes dran means to recollect what was meditated upon in the previous [branches] and to do so intensely; and to repeatedly meditate upon the great seal of empty form and to exert a strong effort in doing so.
The objects to be worked on [in the branch of recollection] are all the channels, winds, and vital essences in general, the principal being the empty form of the inner fire’s blazing light, together with its bases, the vital essences of the four channel-wheels (or six), and that which depends on them, the bliss of melting.
The purpose [of this branch] is the actual achievement of unchanging bliss for which one trains in the undispersed bliss [from the] melting [of vital essence].
The essence of recollection is a contemplation [described as follows]: With the support of a seal (or without seal), the inner fire [is ignited]. its blazing light manifests as the empty forms of the coarse and subtle aspects of the three realms, principally the [empty-form] male and female deities in union. Focused on this, [the practitioner] rests in authentic equipoise, free of thoughts, [and achieves] an undivided contemplation in which undispersed bliss from the melting [of vital essence] is repeatedly generated.
The sphere of purification comprises six [constituents] that form a single group: the element of water, the aggregate of recognitions, [the sense power of the tongue, the objects of visible forms, the faculty of the legs, and the activity of taking].
The immediate result is that the mind actually manifests as a deity even though the body is not transformed. consequently, countless [kinds of] clairvoyance and miraculous powers are gained.
The ultimate result is the manifestation of the six deities, amitabha and the others, who are [the purified] six [constituents] of the water-element group.[31]

The sixth branch is contemplation. The [sanskrit] word samadhi means to hold [the mind] completely in equipoise. [The Tibetan term] ting nge ’dzin therefore means the mind’s abiding in the inseparability of subject and object, free from [the duality of] apprehender and apprehended.
The objects of this [branch] are both empty form and great bliss.
The purpose of the meditation is to augment unchanging bliss and to purify the fully ripened [karmic] body [so that it dissolves] into the expanse [of emptiness], thereby attaining the body of nondual pristine awareness. The essence of this branch is contemplation in which is experienced the union of the two: unchanging bliss (wisdom); and the pristine-awareness dimension [of emptiness] endowed with the supreme of all aspects. These two—a single pristine awareness differentiated [into two only] conceptually—are experienced free from the dualistic view that regards them as different.
The sphere of purification comprises six [constituents] that form a single group: the element of earth, the aggregate of forms, [the sense power of the body, the objects of odors, the faculty of the anus, and the activity of speaking].
The immediate results [are delineated as follows]: if, from its first arising, contemplation is then cultivated continuously, the level of genuine truth—the abiding nature [of reality]—will be attained in three years and three fortnights;[32]one’s fully ripened [karmic] body will dissolve into the expanse [of emptiness]; and the body of total pristine awareness, a nondual union, will thereby be realized. That would be [the state of] a great bodhisattva adorned by many qualities such as the ten powers.[33]
The ultimate result of contemplation is the manifestation of the mandalas of the six deities, Vairochana and the others, who are [the purified] six [constituents] of the earth-element group.[34]
This [Kalachakra completion phase] is the intended destination of all tantras. it is the ultimate of all [forms of] completion phase. Therefore, it has been treated here to some extent. other completion-phase [systems] have their own vast and profound points to be understood regarding spheres of purification, purificatory means, purposes, results, and so forth. These will not be treated here for fear the discussion might become too lengthy.

There are many completion-phase traditions of the hevajra tantra—the essence of [all] mother tantras—that were elucidated by individual masters. of those, eight autonomous systems of essential instructions have been introduced into Tibet at different times.
The first is that of the lord of yogins Virupa, the completion phase of the esoteric-instructions system, which includes the path-and-fruition essential instructions. This will be discussed briefly in subsequent [sections of the Infinite Ocean of Knowledge].[35]

The [hevajra] teachings of the outstanding scholar naropa[46] formed [the basis for] the tradition of his heart-son and great regent, Marpa the Translator.[47] This system consists of two essential instructions: mixing and transference.[48]
Mixing comprises instructions for the creation phase and instructions for the completion phase. The creation-phase instructions concern training with regard to forms; training in the sphere [of vital essence]; and training in the union [of creation and completion].[49] The completion phase instructions concern the inner fire, illusory body, and luminous clarity. The inner-fire [practice] has two instructions: one’s own body as method; and the body of another as wisdom.[50] The illusory-body [practice] has two instructions: dream-state illusion[51] to give rise to an experience of the [previously] unexperienced illusory body; and waking-state illusion to stabilize and enhance [the experience] that has arisen. The second is twofold: the illusion of appearances;[52] and the illusion of the intermediate state.[53] The luminous-clarity [practice] comprises four essential instructions: the luminous clarity of the intrinsic nature; the luminous clarity of meditation; the luminous clarity of sleep; and the luminous clarity of death.[54] Those constitute the way to practice the essential instructions for mixing.
Transference [of consciousness] comprises two essential instructions.
One concerns the upward transference; the other, entering the deceased (an auxiliary practice). The first of those has two aspects: the transference [of consciousness] that one trains in; and transference [of consciousness] in a forceful way [at the time of death].[55] The second has [two aspects]: the training; and the actual application.[56]

The first, inner fire, includes a preliminary wind[-yoga] and the main training in inner fire.[61]
The second, the seals, comprises three meditations: the action seal, the imaginary seal, and the meditation on one’s own body as bliss.[62]
The third, the great seal, has three[63] essential instructions: unifying the dispersed [aspects of the] ground of all; using the manifestations of the ground of all as the path; and the inconceivable ground of all.[64]

[This] system of the great adept Vyadalipa, a disciple of Virupa,[65] through which is practiced the essence of the definitive meaning of the hevajra tantra, is set forth in two parts: [the way] the life [force] is made to enter the central channel; and, once it has entered, the development and stabilization of unchanging bliss.
For the first of these, one achieves the abiding of mind in the central channel (which is the method to bring about [the abiding of] the life [force] in the central channel) and causes the two pathways [right and left channels] to enter the central channel in a peaceful way. This practice, [carried out] by means of six crucial elements, causes all the winds of the right and left [channels] to enter the central channel.[66]
When that occurs, there arises a nonconceptual contemplation, accompanied by utterly refined bliss. The blazing of the natural inner fire[67] causes the indestructible vital essence at the heart to melt so that the four joys are attained. The conceptions associated with the three poisons, the [sensory] consciousnesses, and mental consciousness are made to enter the state of the luminous clarity that is an example, after which the pristine awareness of bliss and emptiness is manifested in the form of a deity. By familiarizing with entering and re-emerging from that state [of luminous clarity], one attains the great seal.

[This] hevajra completion-phase [system] containing four essential principles [is] the essence of four seals:
[The first is] the pledge seal. This is practiced through applying in combination the subtle yoga based on the winds[68] and the vital-essence yoga of blazing and dripping based on the four channel-wheels and the two.[69]
[The second is the action seal.] once one is able to elicit bliss and emptiness by means of one’s own body as method[70] and has gained mastery over the winds, one trains in [methods involving] a real action seal and an imaginary seal.[71]
[The third is the seal of phenomena.] once bliss has been developed to the fullest extent, [one practices] the seal of phenomena, which is to seal all appearances with bliss, whereby all phenomena become the seal.[72]
[The fourth is the great seal.] having perfected one’s experiences of [the first] three seals, or having gained [at least] some familiarity with them, one meditates on the great seal, the six-branch yoga of withdrawal, meditative absorption, and so forth.
As a supplement to those, there is an introduction to the [authentic] view, [which entails] (1) equipoise[73] [with the understanding] that external things are [simply] experiences of the mind; that these mere experiences have no inherent nature, like the moon reflected on the surface of water; and that the cognizer of experience also lacks inherent nature; (2) the unification of intrinsic awareness and natural bliss; and (3) [the knowledge] that cyclic existence is uncreated and that everything exists as the naturally present mandala of true reality. [This] pursuit of the definitive meaning of meditation is the system of shantigupta,[74] a great master in this age of conflict. it contains the literal meanings of the actual tantric teachings and elucidates them in close connection with the ultimate and definitive meanings of tantra.

And a second one to acquire mastery of the awakened qualities of the result.
The first is twofold, based on the emissary path and based on the yoga path.

Gathering of vajra-beings, gathering of syllables, and gathering of vital essences,

The lord of adepts, Luipada,[1] was the first to establish a chariot[-like] tradition of chakrasamvara, the very heart of the mother tantras. From his teachings was derived a tradition of the completion phase of the [Chakra]samvara Abridged Tantra,[2] consisting of two aspects: a completion phase to strike the crucial points related to the vajra body (the cause); and a completion phase to acquire mastery of awakened qualities (the result).
The first aspect has two [approaches]: the completion phase based on the female-emissary path; and the completion phase based on the yoga path.[3] To the latter completion phase, followers of abhayakirti (nepal’s pamtingpa)—Malgyo Lotsawa and others—[4] applied the designation “the three gatherings,” namely, the gathering of vajra-beings, the gathering of syllables, and the gathering of vital essences.[5] The meanings indicated by those names[6] can be explained using different names: the esoteric instructions on the great yoga (relaxation), the esoteric instructions on recitation [connected with] winds (the coarse), and the esoteric instructions on vajra recitation (the subtle).
By means of the first, the great yoga, the winds are gathered and the channel pathways purified.[7] By means of the second, wind recitation, the channel-knots are loosened and the winds mastered.[8] By means of the third, vajra recitation, the winds and vital essences are bound (as the preliminary practice), and the winds and mind are halted and made to dissolve in the central channel (as the main practice).[9]
if one is cultivating the yoga path [as one’s main practice], during the third aspect (vajra recitation), one’s practice will be enhanced by applying the female-emissary path. if one is cultivating the female-emissary path, one’s practice will be enhanced by applying the yoga path. if one is cultivating both of them equally, they will act together, like competitors [aiming for the same goal].

Luipada, the crown ornament of the lords of yogins, explains these points in his work known as the Sequence of Visualization of the Glorious [Lord],[10] a synopsis of the Yoginisancharya Tantra[11] and the earliest of the commentaries on the Chakrasamvara [Tantra].
That being said, with regard to the yoga path, Luipa’s text [Sequence of Visualization of the Glorious Lord] states:[12]
With vowels and consonants imagined in front, settle at rest by means of the great yoga.
That represents the first esoteric instruction [that of the great yoga]. [The text] also says:[13]
With the sphere of the moon complete, imagine it to be in the channel’s center.
Here “center” means the center of [each of] the four channel-wheels (or five), referring to the practice in which one trains in the coming and going of the “moon”—[white] bodhichitta—through those channel-wheels. Those lines therefore represent the second and third esoteric instructions, taught in those terms because [these esoteric instructions] concern the coming and going of the winds and vital essences in the central channel.
Moreover, [the same text] says:[14]
Imagine it in the center of the abode of the supreme syllable.
This refers to the attainment of unchanging bliss from the melting [of vital essence]; that is to say, the result of those [practices manifests as] the four descending levels of joy.

If [the above quotations] are applied to the female-emissary path, the lines that begin
With vowels and consonants ...
refer to the purification of the winds. The lines that begin With the sphere of the moon ...
Represent the esoteric instructions on the main practice, that is, the descent and reversal [of the white bodhichitta]. The lines that end with
... the supreme syllable.
Mean the same as for the yoga path.
The second [aspect of the Luipa tradition] is that of the completion phase that brings about mastery of awakened qualities (the result). once the effects of the above esoteric instructions have been fully achieved, [the next step is] as stated in [Luipa’s] text:[15]
Meditate on the vajra deity body:
Awakened body, speech, and mind.
Accordingly, one will attain the immediate vajra body that resembles the eight magic images.[16] Moreover, [the same text] says:[17]
That [deity] transcends form. it is mind itself, immaterial. contemplate mind itself.[18]
This means that, with the attainment of the gathering of female emissaries,[19] and relying on either the elaborate or the unelaborate forms of the general and specific deliberate behavior of awareness,[20] one repeatedly purifies the body of the deity—[infinite] like space—in luminous-clarity emptiness. as a result of that, on the basis of the proximate cause[21] of the actual awakenings, one manifests nonconceptual pristine awareness, [the attainment of] the path of seeing. Further, [Luipa’s text] states:[22]
If one were to contemplate the inconceivable one would then achieve [the yoga of] retention.
The staff is explained to be the deity’s body, and the sound of the damaru, wisdom.
The victorious hero possessed [of qualities] is the daytime; the yogini, the nighttime.[23]
The heroes are manifestations of transcendence;
The six[ty goddesses], emanations of mind.[24]
The form of Varahi is explained to be
An emanation of true reality, the pure.
Shri is nondual pristine awareness;
He, emptiness, such as that of cause;
Ru, being devoid of collections;
Ka, not abiding in any place at all.[25]

That refers to the stage of union,[26] at which stage the three [results]—the body [of the deity], luminous clarity, and their union—arise from the natural energy of nonconceptual bliss and emptiness. Therefore, one does not need to depend upon a point of reference as in conceptual meditation. however, if beginners wish to meditate in a way that involves deliberate imagination, in the esoteric instructions of the great yoga of relaxation, the deliberate creation of those three [the deity’s body, luminous clarity, and their union] is the meditation itself.
The above words from [Luipa’s] text are [used] by Lvabapa, Krishna,[27] and others in elucidating the completion-phase teachings. in the esoteric instructions derived from the words of glorious Dipamkarashrijnana [Atisha], [28] it is said:[29]
Those who wish to enter the completion phase [should know]:
The moon is the female-emissary path,
And the sun, the mandala of the body.
The four vital essences are pristine awareness.
The utterly pure is luminous clarity,
Whose characteristic is like that of space.
The absence of an inherent nature is the union,
Explained using three types of examples.[30]
The creation phase and completion phase
Are adopted by the yogin as the path.
That is a supremely eloquent encapsulation of the completion phase according to this tradition based on the sadhana of the great master Luipa.

The outstanding master Vajraghantapa,[31] relying on the Abhidhana Uttaratantra,[32] the explanatory tantra on the definitive meaning concealed in the Chakrasamvara Root Tantra,[33] composed a work on the five stages and their blessing [i.e., the initiation rite].[34] countless persons in india and Tibet became accomplished adepts on the basis of that tradition. Even up to the present time, there has been an uninterrupted [stream of] realizations from its attainment. This marvelous completion phase comprises five stages.
The first stage is introduced [in Ghantapa’s Five Stages of Chakrasamvara]:[35]
Always present in one’s heart
The single vital essence is unchanging.
For the person who meditates on it
Pristine awareness swiftly dawns.
That passage concerns the stage of self-consecration, which consists of two aspects: self-consecration with seed-syllable; and self-consecration without seed-syllable.[36]
Similarly, the words of the text successively teach [the other stages]. The second, the vajra-cross stage, consists of three aspects: vajra-cross with seed-syllable; vajra-cross with different forms; and vajra-cross without seed-syllable.[37]
The third, the stage of filling the jewel, consists of four aspects: training in the action seal; training in the hand seal; training in the phenomena seal; and training in the great seal.[38]
The fourth, the Jalandhara stage, consists of the single practice of the blazing and dripping.[39]
The fifth, the stage of the inconceivable, comprises two aspects: mind entering emptiness; and emptiness entering mind.[40] This fifth stage consists of meditation on emptiness with bliss as its precondition. The Jalandhara stage is the meditation on bliss with emptiness as its precondition, [experienced] as a result of halting the winds. nevertheless, it is generally through the stage of the inconceivable that [the state of] union is perfected.

To be more precise, the first four of the five stages, self-consecration and the others, constitute the method for purifying the channels, winds, and vital essences through the yogas of winds, vital essences, and inner fire, and then entering luminous clarity. For that, one repeatedly dissolves the universe and its inhabitants into luminous clarity by means of [the contemplation of] successive destruction. one thereby enters luminous clarity just as in the process of death. For that to occur, one must generate the four joys of the molten vital essence. [To accomplish that,] one binds the right and left winds in the central channel, which causes the inner fire to blaze, which in turn causes the vital essence to melt and the four joys [to arise]. This is the effect of the Jalandhara stage [the fourth stage], which is also called “maintaining the blaze” because of the blazing of the inner fire.[41]
Prior to that [Jalandhara stage] is the generation of the four joys by relying on practice with a seal, which actually constitutes the [third] stage, [called] filling the jewel. For this stage, four seals are taught: The pledge seal is the generation of joy using an imagined pristine-awareness seal. This seal serves as a preliminary to the others. The action seal, the generation of bliss using an actual awareness female, forms the main practice. The phenomena seal, preserving bliss by bringing to mind what was previously experienced, forms the concluding practice. The great seal is meditation on essential reality after one has practiced the other [seals]. here, as stated above, the reversal of the order of the pledge and the action seals is [in keeping with] what was taught by the Great Jetsun.[42]

Prior to the filling-the-jewel stage is the second stage, that of the vajracross, the vital-essence yoga.
Prior to the vajra-cross stage is [the first stage,] self-consecration. The self-consecration without seed-syllable is the wind yoga. once the winds and vital essences have become workable as a result of those two yogas [the vital-essence yoga and the wind yoga], one is then capable of applying seal [practices]; hence, [those yogas must precede the third stage]. self-consecration with a seed-syllable is the method by which one forcefully focuses the mind upon the vital essences at the heart and other [channel-wheels]. Thus, by means of the creation phase as the preliminary practice, one fixes the mind—which [normally] flows toward the five [types of sensory] objects—on the vital essence at the heart. once the mind is settled there, one gains stability in [the practices of] wind yoga, the focus of which is the coming and going [of the breath] at the tip of the nose, and the yoga of vital essence, the focuses of which are the vital essences at the centers of the four channel-wheels. Then, relying on both outer and inner seals,[43] [one cultivates] the four joys [that arise] from molten vital essence. once one has gained mastery [of the four joys], one repeatedly dissolves the universe and its inhabitants into luminous clarity and makes them reappear. as a result of that, one attains the body of nondual pristine awareness: this is enlightenment.

To summarize, the first stage brings about a stable manifestation of the great-bliss vital essence, thesupport[vitalessence] and the supported [great bliss], in the middle of the central channel at the four channel-wheels.
The second stage halts the ordinary movement of [the upper and lower] winds in the left and right channels and strikes the crucial point in the coming and going of that vital essence [of great bliss].
The third stage is the application to the four seals so that the vital essence will melt and [its pure essence] increase.
The fourth stage binds that vital essence so that it is not emitted, thus manifesting the four ascending innate joys.
The fifth stage is [meditation in which] the resident [deities] and residence [mandala] that have been made manifest are repeatedly dissolved into luminous clarity and made to reappear, at the end of which the illusory body, the inseparability of utterly purified wind and mind, is attained.
These stages were described in that way by Lord Mikyö Dorjé.[44]
Some Tibetan masters of the past explained the five stages as [successive] methods to attain the special body of great bliss. [according to their descriptions,] the first stage includes only as far as the seed-syllable aspect. The second stage includes only as far as the insignia arising from the seedsyllable. The third stage is the method to manifest the entire body [of the deity] from the insignia. The fourth stage is the completion phase that arises from innate joy, the method to actualize the body of pristine awareness. The fifth is the method by which thatbody is dissolved into inconceivable luminous clarity and made manifest as a body of form [that requires] no more training.

[next is discussed] the completion phase formulated by charyadharendrapada [Krishnacharya].[45] This accomplished master, possessed of many qualities, was prophesied by the Buddha. his [chakrasamvara] completion phase is formed of four stages.[46]
[This completion phase consists of a common yoga and an uncommon yoga.] First one trains in the common yoga, which involves two aspects: the common-yoga training in the crucial points of the creation-phase esoteric instructions, [which means] to embark on mantra’s own path; [and training in the crucial points of the esoteric instructions on the view that eliminates deviations common to all paths and leads one to freedom’s gateway]. [The first training has two parts:] training in the yoga of imaginative meditation by means of the branches of the creation phase, inclusive of nine yogas;[47] and training in the yoga of actual meditation, inclusive of the twelve crucial points of the esoteric instructions.[48] Following those is [the second training] in which certainty is gained through the twelve crucial points of the esoteric instructions on the view that eliminates all possibilities of deviation and leads to freedom’s gateway.[49]
Following that is [the training in] the uncommon [yoga of] the completion phase, which comprises two practices: the path of yoga; and the path of the female emissary.

The yoga path is formed of four stages: tantra, mantra, pristine awareness, and secret.
The tantra stage concerns the root. This aspect is a root yoga that serves as the foundation for all focuses of meditation, the esoteric instructions for which treat the tantric stages only.[50]
The mantra stage concerns the practice. This aspect is the inner-fire yoga, the esoteric instructions for which [emphasize] channels, winds, and vital essences equally.[51]
The stage of pristine awareness concerns what arises (the four joys). This aspect is the yoga of vital essence whose descent in the forward order gives rise to the four joys.[52]
The secret stage concerns the result. This aspect is the training in entering and arising from luminous clarity, based on complete mastery of reversal [of the vital essence] and blazing and dripping.[53]
Those [four] aspects[54] are used as the path. That being said, to complete the four-stage path in its entirety is accomplished by means of the inner fire alone. Therefore, in some texts the path [of yoga] is called the “complete path of inner fire” or “taking up inner fire as path.” in those expressions, the term “inner fire” is being given a broad meaning and is used as a general term for the completion phase. however, in its narrower sense, this is a general term applied to a specific [aspect]. it refers to the inner-fire focal points, the principal of which is the fourth channel-wheel [that of the navel]. That is stated clearly and extensively in the Mahasamvarodaya Tantra, the Vajradaka Tantra, and the Samputa Tilaka Tantra.
[Charyadharendrapada] taught twelve crucial points of esoteric instructions [related to] the branches of visualization for the [above] aspects— three concerned with winds, three with nonconceptuality, three with vital essences, and three with inner fire.[55]
[The second] practice is the path of the female emissary. apart from the substitution of the female-emissary path for inner fire, in this path all the root esoteric instructions are similar to those of the yoga path. in the main practice, [one applies] twelve crucial-point esoteric instructions.[56]
The concluding practice concerns the elimination of impediments by means of the two types of equalizing, the four syllables, the six armors; and the enhancement [of the practice] by means of three [types of] conducts, thereby attaining the result.[57]

On [the subject of] that [path], this great accomplished master [Krishnacharya] composed the Illumination of the Secret Essential Principles.[58] [This work sets forth] the completion phase of the highest yoga [tantras] in general since the father-tantra Guhyasamaja and the mother-tantra chakrasamvara, although differing in terms of the descriptions, are the same in having these four stages as their subject matter. Moreover, Krishnacharya composed the Four Stages. [This work sets forth] the completion phase of mother tantras in general since the hevajra and chakrasamvara, although differing in terms of the descriptions, are the same in having these four stages as their subject matter. his formulation of a completion phase unique to the chakrasamvara tantra is that of the Vital Essence of Spring.[59] The sixth examination [section] of the Samputa Tantra states:[60]
The lotus within the heart has eight petals and a center. The channel within the lotus, has a flame as its nature.
[The channel] hangs face downward Like the plantain tree’s flower.
Within it resides the hero,
The size of a mustard seed.
The invincible hum, the seed, is what drips like melting snow. it gladdens all creatures’ hearts, and thus is known as “spring.”
The Mare’s fire, due to its great form,[61]
Is called selfless Female, “vital essence.”[62]
“spring” [means] the bodhichitta present in the hum at the heart; and [red] “vital essence,” the am at the navel. That passage speaks of the method of cultivating the completion phase in which spring and vital essence form a union.
One tradition [of this completion phase] comprises the four stages that belong to the nine cycles of the path, transmitted through Drokmi [Lotsawa].[63] a second is that of the tradition of the ultimate secret of naropa’s lineage.[64] of those two, the naropa tradition is especially distinguished and one that is very widely known. The lineage of the venerable sakyapa[65] and that of purang Lochung’s student, Mar chögyal,[66] are both the pure tradition of naropa.
According to Jetsun Drakpa[67] and others, Krishna composed six completion-phase synopses: the basic synopsis, [called] Vital Essence of Spring; the synopsis of words, Secret Essential Principle; the synopsis of realizations, Olapati; the synopsis of meanings, Epitome; the synopsis of vital essences and seals, Great Seal; and the synopsis of levels [of awakening], Secret Stages. The heart, so to speak, of those six is the Olapati. The quintessence of its esoteric instructions lies in the complete path of inner fire.[68]
The view [taught by] the master [Krishnacharya] is termed “beginningless and endless pure awareness (bodhichitta), the true reality, utterly free from the four extremes.”[69] as the means or path for realizing this view, he taught four stages (or five).

The completion phase of the chatuhpitha [“Four seats”] tantra[1] includes an uncommon creation phase containing the esoteric instructions of the cow’s udder, based on the nose-tip at the secret place and the nose-tip at the crown or the mid-eyebrow point. By cultivating this creation phase in conjunction with wind yoga, the deity’s body is sealed with bliss, and bliss is sealed with emptiness. The clarity of appearance [of the deity] is thereby enhanced.[2]
The preliminary to all aspects of [this] completion phase entails closing off the nine gateways and performing the vajra recitation.[3] one thereby purifies the channel pathways.
The main practice of the completion phase comprises two key elements: that of the pervading completion phase; and that of the pervaded completion phase.
The first, the pervading completion phase, consists of two yogas: the yoga of the essential instructions on the inconceivable; and the actionseal yoga involving passion. The first, also referred to as the “yoga directed toward ultimate reality,” elicits bliss-emptiness: on the basis of vital essence (the elicitor), [one experiences] ineffable bliss-emptiness (what is elicited). The second, the action-seal yoga involving passion, is essentially the same as the secret fire offering.[4]

The pervaded completion phase[5] consists of both the root of the path and the branch aspects. The root[6] comprises four essential instructions: like a bull’s hoof; like a cow’s udder; like a bunch of plantain bananas; and like a stupa-vase. The first, the bull’s hoof, has four focuses: the thirteen syllables, the two syllables, the single syllable, and the sphere alone.[7] [The second, the cow’s udder, is a single cycle of visualization.][8] The third, the bunch of plantain bananas, comprises three esoteric instructions: the thirteen syllables, the nine syllables, and the bird’s egg.[9] The fourth, the stupa-vase, has two aspects: binding the winds; and making the winds dissolve.[10]
[Those root instructions] all have branch aspects. The branches of the bull’s hoof are miscellaneous esoteric instructions.[11] The branches of the cow’s udder concern practices related to fire.[12] The branches of the bunch of plantain bananas concern upward transference [of consciousness] and the accessory practices [of entering the deceased, etc.].[13] The branches of the vase of the stupa concern the triad of illusions.[14]
All the above aspects constitute the completion phase as taught in the Vajra Chatuhpitha Tantra. There are two approaches to this completion phase: an approach that cuts through intellectual [formulations]; and an integrated approach.
In the first approach, one begins by cultivating the creation phase. Then, one uses the two pervading yogas to enhance and sustain a single technique alone—any one of the four pervaded [completion-phase instructions].[15] By means of that, one gives rise to the pristine awareness of warmth.[16] Finally, with tantric conduct and the proximate cause [of the outer and inner actual awakenings] providing the connection, one comes to attain the result. This is a system whereby one individual need not apply all four of the pervaded techniques together as an integrated approach.

In the second approach, all four esoteric instructions for the pervaded completion phase are combined as requisite elements for any single individual. By means of the bull’s hoof instructions, one halts the winds in the central channel. By means of the cow’s udder, one ignites the coarse inner fire and gives rise to blazing and dripping [from which are experienced] the warmth and bliss from the descent of [white] bodhichitta. By means of the bunch of plantain bananas, one first loosens the channel-knots, then opens them, and finally releases them. By means of the stupa-vase, one causes the subtle and coarse elements, in succession, to dissolve into the blissful vital essence within the central channel. That [experience]—the pristine awareness that is bliss and emptiness—is called luminous clarity.
The esoteric instructions [called] coiled king of the nagas are included within those four.[17] as to the meanings of the names given to these [instructions], the names used are based on the forms of the channels, places in the body, and focuses of meditation.[18]
As to how those [four instructions] are presented in the tantra,[19] the true nature [of reality] is conclusively established in the latter part of the third chapter on the seat of oneself and the first part of the fourth [chapter]. in many other sections are explained various completion-phase [practices involving] winds.
The fourth [chapter] on the seat of application contains the cycles of teachings concerning the seal of another’s body.
The second chapter on the seat of the secret treats the stage of the inconceivable;[20] the subtle and vital-essence [yogas] of the creation phase (consisting of esoteric instructions on the [sphere of] vital essence at the [tip of] the sex organ, the vital essence at the mid-eyebrow point, and the vital essence at the heart); the closing of the gateways shared [by the creation and completion phases]; the actual cow’s-udder completion phase; the bull’s-hoof thirteen-syllable, two-syllable, and single-syllable [practices]; the gaining of [the ability] to know others’ minds; and the fire-offering rite of the ultimate reality.[21]

The third chapter [on the seat of the secret] presents esoteric instructions on the egg-born; the plantain-flower[22] thirteen-syllable [practice]; the upward transference [of consciousness]; entering the deceased; and its branches.
The fourth chapter [on the seat of the secret] teaches the bunch-of-plantain-bananas nine-syllable [practice]; the stupa-vase’s branches of binding the winds; the stupa esoteric instructions; the stupa-vase’s main [practice of] nine syllables; and the yoga of the three illusions.
[That explains] how those instructions are related to the Root Tantra.
In the Explanatory Tantra,[23] the chapters on the seat of application teach various kinds of practices—such as the secret fire-offering and the plantain flower—that differ slightly from the Root Tantra. [The Explanatory Tantra] presents numerous other [topics], the qualifications of a seal, and so forth.
The Mantramsha Explanatory Tantra[24] sets forth the esoteric instructions of the om syllable, the arrow-shot inner fire, other variations of plantain-flower [instructions], the conduct of deliberate behavior, and so forth.
Lord nagarjuna’s Practice of the Armpit[25] and aryadeva’s Single Tree Commentaryon Difficult Pointsand Explanation of the Eight Topics Applied to the Inner Meaning[26] are among the very few[27] indian texts that treat this completion phase [of chatuhpitha] that were introduced into Tibet.
Jetari’s Four Essential Principles[28] and other commentaries contain various miscellaneous presentations of this completion phase. The root source for Tibetan literature [on this completion phase] lies in the Mother and Son Notes[29] of ngokpa and his students.[30]

[What follows next is] the completion phase as taught in the Mahamaya Tantra,[31] or Great Illusion Tantra. This formulation derives from the tradition of the lords Marpa and ngoktön[32] and comprises four essential instructions: the yoga of shape (the lesser); the yoga of mantra (the profound); [the yoga of reality (the ultimate)];[33] and [the practice] related to the triad of illusions (an auxiliary teaching).
The first, the yoga of shape, consists of extensive and simplified creationphase meditations as the bases for the completion phase.[34] The actual completion phase corresponds to the subsequent practices [the second, third, and fourth essential instructions].
The second, the yoga of mantra, comprises two yogas, namely, the mantra yoga of the upper door and the mantra yoga of the lower door. The first has three aspects: the mantra yoga of channel-wheels; the mantra yoga of vital essences; and the mantra yoga of the subtle. The first of those, the mantra yoga of channel-wheels, has three aspects: the one-channel-wheel practice; two-channel-wheel practice; and four-channel-wheel practice.[35] [The second], the mantra yoga of vital essences, also has three aspects: focusing on the upper nose-tip; focusing on the lower nose-tip; and focusing on the center of the body.[36] [The third], the mantra yoga of the subtle, consists of three aspects: training in the natural flow of the winds; training in counting the numbers [of breaths]; and training in the vase[-shaped] holding.[37]
[The third,] the yoga of reality, comprises a common practice and an uncommon one. Both practices include the two aspects of using the natural state as the path and using appearances as the path.[38]
[The fourth,] [the practice] related to the triad of illusions—those of daytime experiences, dreams, and the intermediate state—is presented as an auxiliary teaching.[39]
While [those four sets] constitute the central course of instruction, there are, in addition, miscellaneous completion-phase instructions, [known as] the six oral essential instructions and the six collections of activation rites based on meditative absorption.[40] Each of those [two sets] has esoteric instructions for the creation phase and the completion phase. Moreover, [the Mahamaya Tantra] states:[41]
The activities relating to another person’s corpse, and so on...
from which are derived teachings on both transference [of consciousness] and entering the deceased as found in the mixing and transference [instructions].[42]

At the present time, to carry out the practice related to the triad of illusions would mean the beginner’s [practice of the] illusory body and luminous clarity, on the basis of which the yogic experiences of illusory body and luminous clarity arise.
As to the ways these [practices of the completion phase] are related to the [root] tantra, the essential instructions for the mantra yoga of channelwheels are expressed in the six lines beginning with
Having equalized the vowels and consonants [43]
The essential instructions for the mantra yoga of vital essences at both the upper and lower [doors] begin with
Garlands of excellent syllables [44]
The essential instructions for the meditation on the vital essence in the center of the body begin with
Through the light that has awakened in the sphere. [45]
The essential instructions for all that is related to vajra recitation begin with
By means of the application of the first syllable. [46]
The essential instructions for the gradational practice of halting [the winds] by means of the vase-shaped holding [of the breath] begin with
Exhalation and inhalation are halted [47]
The essential instructions for the forceful practice of halting [the winds] begin with
Two eyes and [48]
The essential instructions for the yoga of reality begin with Through whatever path of the senses [49]
The essential instructions related to the triad of illusions begin with
Fully endowed with the sleep yoga [50]
And continue
Accordingly, the supreme three dimensions are bestowed [51]
The yoga of shape [i.e., the form of the deity] is extensively taught in all three chapters [of this tantra]. The yoga of mantra focused on the lower door is taught a number of times, [found] at various points within the three chapters.
In all contexts of the practice—beginning, middle, and end—it is absolutely required that every practitioner carry out the ultimate yoga of reality, and at appropriate times, the yoga of mantra focused on the lower door. Moreover, each person must definitely cultivate one—whichever is suitable—of the many mantra yogas focused on the upper door. however, it is not necessarily the case that one individual must definitely meditate on all of them. The practice of even just one of these carried out with great diligence over a long period of time can bring about the realization of lesser warmth. Then, the practice of the yoga focused on the lower door can lead to the great warmth and peak [stages of the path of preparation]. [52]
As has been explained, all these yogas may be approached either in an integrated way or in a way that cuts through intellectual [formulations]. in the case of the first, all practices need to be combined as requisite elements for any one individual. in the case of the second, even a single practice such as the mantra yoga focused on the channel-wheels will bring about the accomplishment of the particular aims.

The completion phase of the Buddhakapala[53] belongs to the lineage derived from the oral teachings of saraha,[54] the ancestor of all accomplished masters. it is a system comprising two practices, one with a focus and one without a focus.
The first, the completion phase with a focus, consists of four [aspects of] training. [First is] the yoga of the subtle in which are applied the four wind techniques, such as the finest particle.[55] [The second is] the vitalessence yoga of the inner-fire practice, in conjunction with vajra recitation, for which one’s own body [is used as] method.[56] [The third is] the class of techniques for the enhancement of bliss and warmth. This yoga entails gathering the winds at the entrance to the central channel, opening the entrance to the central channel, and applying a forceful method.[57] [The fourth,] practiced once one has gained proficiency in the previous, is the vital-essence yoga with a focus, using the body of another person, a wisdom woman.
The second, practice without a focus, the nonconceptual completion phase, consists of six branches. The first [branch], practiced once one has trained in the previous completion phase with a focus, [is] the yoga of withdrawal. [The second is] the yoga of meditative absorption.[58] These two yogas are carried out for a considerable length of time, the results of which are the arisings of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth branches. [The third branch,] that of yoga [to exert control] over the winds, is to stop the winds [from flowing] in the right channel and left channel and make them enter the central channel. [The fourth,] retention, [is to cause] the winds that have entered the central channel to dissolve into vital essences in the centers of the individual channel-wheels. [The fifth,] recollection, is to elicit the bliss of melting by way of the seal of empty form.[59] [The sixth,] contemplation, [begins] at the first instant of the arising of the pristine awareness of changeless bliss.

It is taught that single-minded perseverance in the subtle yoga and vitalessence yoga [mentioned] above will bring about various experiences of bliss and warmth. This will greatly enhance completion-phase meditation that has no focus. When one has cultivated the practice without a focus, that meditative stream with focus will also develop into a nonconceptual completion phase. Even the practices of the subtle and vital-essence yogas by themselves—if carried out for long periods of time—first naturally [lead to] the mind becoming utterly still and various experiences of bliss arising. Then, before long, the supreme contemplation of bliss and emptiness will manifest by itself.
Marpa and ngoktön’s instruction lineage for the completion phase [related] to the Buddhakapala Tantra and its commentaries no longer exists. This explanation has been given in accordance with the new extended tradition of the Venerable Master of Jonang [Taranatha], who received the transmission of the great adept shantigupta’s tradition.[60]

[next is presented] the completion phase taught in The Ultimate Essence of Tara, Origin of All Rites, King of Yogini Tantras.[61] This system consists of the stages of four yogas.[62]
The first yoga comprises a creation phase and its related aspects.[63] practices belonging specifically to the completion phase set forth in the tantra—known as the yoga of burning away negative karma,[64] that of averting obstacles,[65] and that through which blessing enters oneself[66]—constitute this creation phase. This precedes the actual phase of completion, which consists of three yogas, namely, subsequent yoga, surpassing yoga, and great yoga.
The subsequent yoga has a preliminary practice, that of the contemplation of calm abiding; a main practice of remaining in the equipoise of naturally pure reality; and an enhancement practice that is carried out by means of the nine methods of the retention mantras, syllable a, and so forth,[67] and by means of the yoga for defeating demonic forces, which is the elimination of unfavorable factors.[68]
The surpassing yoga has a preliminary practice of purification of the channel pathways[69] through the five wind techniques (filling, expelling, etc.);[70] and a main practice in which the pristine awareness of the four joys is stabilized through the actions of the five syllables.[71]
The great yoga has three parts—the yoga of indestructible body; the yoga of indestructible speech; and the yoga of indestructible mind—by means of which body, speech, and mind are realized as the vajras [of awakened body, speech, and mind].[72]

To elaborate [on those four yogas], the first yoga is the gaining of some degree of stability in the creation phase.
The subsequent yoga brings forth some experience of the [authentic] view.
The surpassing yoga [requires] one to have purified the channel pathways[73] by means of wind yoga. one then enters the main practice, that of the female-emissary path, as stated in the tantra:[74]
In this [yoga], one first purifies [the channels] using the techniques of filling, pressing down, stilling, and holding [the breath as if in] a vase. Then one enters practice with females. in that way, it is said, one will attain [supreme] power by means of this [lifetime’s] body itself.
On the basis of the sixty-four acts that arouse[75] and the wind yogas previously practiced, one meditates sequentially upon descent, retention, reversal, and spread [of vital essence];[76] and upon transforming it into pristine awareness. Following that, one relies on the body of another, primarily that of an action seal, but one may also rely on a pristine-awareness seal as a branch practice,[77] and in that way one cultivates the pristine awareness that is bliss and emptiness.
[The last,] the great yoga, [requires that] one gain some familiarity with [the yoga] consisting of three indestructibles. Then, by means of the functioning of the channel known as prajna-naranasika, one releases first the bliss-sustaining channel-wheel, then the emanation channel-wheel, and finally the channel-wheel of great bliss. Following that is the practice to crack the egg of ignorance in the heart, whereby one reaches [the stage of] supreme luminous clarity.[78]

The completion-phase systems as described above are the ones that became widely known in both india and Tibet. in particular, these completion phase practices—primarily of the [highest] yoga mother tantras—form unbroken [traditions] whose experiences, instructions, and practices are present even today throughout the himalayan region.
Only Vajradhara Buddha himself could possibly fathom those completion-phase [systems], along with all the other minor ones—some of which are clearly set forth in the decisive words of tantras and others definitively formulated in the esoteric instructions of accomplished masters. They are so numerous as to defy comprehension or description.
Two kinds of completion phase are generally spoken of: a completion phase based mainly on the tantras; and a completion phase based mainly on esoteric instructions. What has just been presented is the former kind— a magnificent tradition composed of teachings explicitly set forth in the tantras. it was cherished by the scholars and adepts of india who achieved total realization [by relying] on it.

<d e="2">
There are many completion-phase systems presented in the individual sets of tantras. all of those systems, however, share [several] key elements.
One such element is the requirement to cultivate the union of the training [stage], which is the direct cause for the attainment of the goal of union beyond training, the body of pristine awareness. To do that requires one to cultivate [the practice whereby] the illusion-like body of the deity is dissolved into luminous clarity and then made to reappear as the union [that requires training].
In order for one to carry out the dissolution and reappearance [of the deity], all systems share the key elements of requiring [cultivation of] both the relative [aspect], the completion phase of self-consecration, and the ultimate, the completion phase of luminous clarity. in order to practice those two [aspects of] the completion phase, all systems share the key element of requiring one to have made the channels, winds, and vital essences workable.
Although all systems have those key elements incommon, their respective ways of putting them into practice differ to some extent. Father-tantra practitioners first rely on the three types of isolation[1] and then cultivate union through the stages of the illusory body and luminous clarity. Mother-tantra practitioners first rely on the yogas of channels, winds, and vital essences and then cultivate union through the stages of innate bliss and emptiness.
Those methods can also be divided into subparts that form a collection of many traditions of practice. Thus, there is not precisely one single way.

All completion-phase systems can therefore be contained in three key elements:

Three key elements—the relative, the ultimate, and their inseparability—are taught.

<d e="2">
For those reasons [given above], [certain key elements are required]. all aspects of the entire completion-phase system in highest yoga tantra are contained in the following three [key elements]:
[The first is] practice that relies on one’s own body as method. [in this,] one strikes the crucial point [related] to the central channel by making [winds] enter, abide, and dissolve [in it].
[The second is] practice that relies on the body of another person as the wisdom [aspect]. [in this,] one elicits and stabilizes the pristine awareness of the four joys.
[The third is] practice that relies on the great seal of empty form. [in this,] one cultivates the emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects and unchanging bliss.
One needs no more than these three. Just one of them on its own, however, cannot bring about the final completion of the path. one therefore needs to practice the three together.
Nevertheless, people today are deficient in antidotes and weak in perseverance. They therefore lack the capacity to fully comprehend those elements exactly as they are. For that reason, [practices] such as [those that require] the body of another have been put aside for the time being, and in consideration of present circumstances, Tibetan masters of supreme insight teach the completion phase in a condensed form consisting of three [key elements]: the relative, the ultimate, and their inseparability. These three ultimate elements have superseded the previous three.

It is generally required as the first [step] of every completion phase that one make the channels, winds, and vital essences workable. Father-tantra practitioners accomplish that by means of three meditations: body isolation, voice isolation, and mind isolation.
Body isolation is to meditate on the subtle [vital essence] at the lower door; then, by causing the winds to enter and dissolve in the central channel, to give rise to innate bliss from the melting [of the vital essence].
Voice isolation is to cultivate the wind yoga involving the three vital essences at the three nose-tips;[2] then, by [causing] the winds to dissolve, to give rise to the four empties.[3]
Mind isolation is to practice the inner and outer methods;[4] then, by [causing] the winds to dissolve at the heart, to give rise to the special four empties.
In the [common] mother-tantra system, one has to strike the crucial points within the vajra body and then stabilize the arrayed vital essences in order to bring about realization. To stabilize the vital essences, one must gain control over the moving winds. in order to accomplish that, one has to purify the stationary channels.[5] it is therefore explained that one is to meditate on these three in that order of channels, winds, and vital essences. To explain, once one has first achieved proficiency in the empty enclosures of the body and channels[6] [and] has perfect adeptness in the fourfold technique of the vase-shaped holding of the winds,[7] one then makes the vital essences workable through the vital-essence yoga and other techniques.
In the uncommon mother-tantra system, one ignites the inner fire of bliss (the dripping vital essence); the inner fire of warmth (the blazing a- stroke);[8] and the inner fire of no thought (the union).
As a result of igniting the inner fires, and having penetrated the crucial points with respect to the winds, the four joys and the four empties manifest in union: that is the realization of inner fire. The [Hevajra Tantra] Two Examinations describes the four joys:[9]
The bliss of joy is the slight one.
Supreme joy is greater than that.
Joy-free joy[10] is free from desire,
And the remaining one is innate joy.

As to the way the four joys arise, the four joys of descent occur when the vital-essence fluid descends through the four channel-wheels, beginning with that of the crown. The Indestructible Garland states:[11]
What is called joy arises at the crown
In the channel-wheel of great bliss;
Supreme joy, in the enjoyment channel-wheel;
Joy-free joy, in the phenomena channel-wheel;
The experience of innate joy is generated[12]
In the emanation channel-wheel.
The four joys of ascent occur when the vital essence has been stabilized and is then redirected from the genital tip [upward] through the four places, beginning with the navel. The Indestructible Garland states:[13]
Joy is present in the emanation channel-wheel; supreme joy, in the channel-wheel of phenomena; [Joy]-free joy, in the enjoyment [channel-wheel]; innate [joy], in the [channel-wheel] of great bliss: Thus taught is what is called the “inverse sequence.”
The main practice for the realization of inner fire concerns the pristine awareness that is the indivisibility of luminous clarity and the bliss of the innate [joy] (the last of the four joys). That [innate joy] is of two kinds: the example-innate [joy], attended by subtle subject-object dualism; and the true innate [joy], free from subject-object dualism.
In general, in the mother-tantra system, self-consecration and the great seal of luminous clarity, as well as their inseparable union, are all derived from inner-fire yoga. Therefore, inner fire is not necessarily the self-consecration completion phase alone. it has been so classed for the time being because it is widely regarded in that way.

[The Tibetan term for “inner fire” ( gtum mo) is derived from the sanskrit term chandali.] Chandali literally means [a female] who carries out fierce and wrathful actions, such as burning away the impure psychophysical constituents and utterly vanquishing the emotional afflictions. in his Commentary [Epitomizing the Hevajra Tantra],[14] Vajragarbha states:
She is called chandali because she burns away [impurity].
In his Commentary on Difficult Points of the Hevajra Tantra,[15] saroruha states:
Chandali refers to the agent who obliterates the emotional afflictions of existence.
In his Commentary on Difficult Points [of the Hevajra Tantra], naropa states:[16]
Because she performs fierce [chandah] actions she is referred to as a fierce woman [chandali].
As for its general sense, in the sutra way, inner fire means the innate, ineffable emptiness-nature of all phenomena. in the mantra way, inner fire means bliss, emptiness, and their inseparable union [as pristine awareness].
Inner fire in its hidden sense means all [aspects of] the action inner fire, the yoga inner fire, and innate inner fire. The action inner fire is present in the secret place, blazing with warmth during the sexual union of male and female. The yoga inner fire is the a-stroke at the navel, which has the potency, when one strikes the relevant crucial points, to elicit the pristine awareness of the four joys and the four empties. The innate inner fire is innate pristine awareness, which is the all-aspects emptiness and unchanging bliss, manifested through the strength of familiarization with the yogas of the channels, winds, and vital essences.
The ultimate inner fire means the attainment of utterly luminous clarity, the flame of stainless pristine awareness. such attainment is brought about by means of the inner fire in the literal sense, which cuts through conceptual elaborations; the inner fire in the general sense, which is the practice itself; and inner fire in the hidden sense, which acts as a link [to attainment].

in general, the esoteric instructions on the illusory body are of profound meaning—the most important teachings of all the sutra and mantra ways. it is therefore explained that if one fails to discover this [stage], all [one’s efforts] amountto meaningless hardship. [nagarjuna’s] Five Stages of Guhyasamaja states:[17]
The study of sutras and tantras By one who does not discover The stage of self-consecration is meaningless hardship.[18]
That being so, in order to attain enlightenment, one must understand all phenomena to be like illusions. in view of that, aryadeva’s [Analysis of the Stages of] Self-Consecration states:[19]
Since everything is an illusory display it is [possible] to attain enlightenment.
As illustrated by the twelve examples of illusion and other examples, each and every phenomenon of existence and liberation is the body of illusion, or a manifestation that is the very embodiment of illusion. [This defines] the illusory body in its literal sense, which can be conclusively understood through study.
Although there are many kinds of examples of illusion taught in the sutras and tantras,[20] that [set of] twelve is very widely known. The twelve are listed in [aryadeva’s] [Analysis of the Stages of] Self-Consecration:[21]
A [magician’s] phantom display,[22]
A mirage,[23] a city of gandharvas,[24]
A rainbow, an image in a mirror,
The moon reflected on water, an echo,
A dream, an optical illusion, a cloud,
A flash of lightning, and a water bubble:
There are twelve examples of illusion.
The natures of those should be ascertained in accordance with the Brief Explanation of the Five Stages, written by the scholar Munishribhadra, which states:[25]
A [magician’s] phantom display is something created. a mirage is merely something unreal.
A city of gandharvas is a distinct form that can manifest anywhere. a rainbow is simply many different colors coming together.
A mirror reflection is nothing more than a clear image.
The moon on water appears wherever [there is a water surface]. an echo is merely the effect of a voice[26] in a particular spot.
A dream is the work of consciousness alone. a shadow is merely something incorporeal.
A cloud is simply what enshrouds everything in darkness.
A flash of lightning is an effect that lasts only momentarily.
A water bubble is simply a form that arises and then vanishes.

The actual illusory body, the goal of one’s practice, is [the illusory body] in its hidden sense. however, prior to that one must meditate on what is referred to as the “illusory body in its general sense,” a contemplation of the illusion-like [nature of things]. That means the impure illusory body, [a perspective] shared by [the way of] the perfections.[27] What is to be meditated upon and understood conclusively through examples, such as a phantom display, a dream, and so on, is that all these appearances of existence and liberation—the things that make up the outer environments and inner inhabitants of the three realms—have no true existence despite their appearing [as real].
To explain, all these external and internal things are the composite creations of causes and conditions. They are impermanent, [changing] moment by moment. Without any true essence, they are merely the manifestations of dependent origination. hence, they are like illusions.
Concerning the way to practice [the illusory body in its general sense], whereby the examples of illusion are applied to forms and other phenomena, the Subhuti Chapter of the [Transcendent Wisdom in] Eight Thousand [Verses] states:[28]
Lord, it is not the case that there are forms on the one hand and illusions on the other. Forms in themselves are illusions. similarly, the other [aggregates]—feelings, recognitions, and mental formations—are all illusions. Even consciousness itself is illusion.
The indra chapter [of the Transcendent Wisdom in Eight Thousand Verses], for example, states:[29]
illusions and sentient beings are one and the same. They cannot be separated.
Specifically, one meditates that one’s own body and others’ bodies are like reflections, voices like echoes, and minds like mirages. The Samvarodaya [Tantra] states:[30]
View every creature as being like the moon on water. Realize that what is heard is the same as an echo.
Regard even the mind as a mirage on a desert.
Thus, all phenomena of existence and liberation, while being empty, distinctly appear as the very embodiments of illusion. That, in effect, [defines] the illusory body in its general sense. The [Hevajra Tantra] Two Examinations states:[31]
This nature of all things is purely illusory form.

Then, in the uncommon indestructible way, what is meditated upon is the “pure illusory body”: the resident [deities] and residence mandala, the body of pristine awareness, perfectly illustrated by the twelve examples of illusion. This is the special illusory body. [nagarjuna’s] Five Stages states:[32]
It is like the clear reflection of a finely painted Vajrasattva in an immaculate mirror.
The body with the supreme of all aspects, Which is gazed at insatiably,
Will be shown to a good disciple:[33]
That is referred to as “self-consecration.”[34]
The characteristics that reveal its illusory nature precisely indicate this very same [body]:
The illusory [body] that is the relative truth.
[The special illusory body] accords with the twelve examples of illusion in the following ways:
Like a phantom human, although it is without any true existence, it possesses all the limbs and the head, the fingers and toes.
Like the moon reflected on water, it is a single thing that can appear anywhere.
Like an optical illusion, it is incorporeal. Like a mirage, it shifts moment by moment.
Like a dream, it is produced by the mind alone.
Like an echo, it is generated from causes and conditions. Like a city of gandharvas, it is an unpredictable appearance.
Like an hallucination, or like a cloud, it is one but appears as many. Like a rainbow, it is vividly apparent yet immaterial.
Like a flash of lightning, it is sudden but impermanent. Like a water bubble, it arises instantaneously.
Like a mirror reflection, it appears while having no true nature.

When experiential understanding of the common [system’s illusory body in its] general sense has been gained through meditation, and when realization of the uncommon [system’s] special [illusory body] has arisen in one’s mind, one then applies the [illusory body in its] hidden sense.
To expand on that, when the winds have dissolved in the central channel, the three empties (or four) are elicited.[35] at the end of the full culmination of that, or the end of luminous clarity,[36] in an instant, from just wind and mind, the body of the deity arises. This is known as the “illusory body in its hidden sense” and is the very core of the illusory body. [nagarjuna’s] Five Stages states:[37]
That consciousness triad in itself [38]
Truly possessed of the winds
Again arises as the body of the yogin:
That is known as the “illusory body.”[39]
[Naropa’s Elucidation] Summary of the Five Stages states:[40] although formed of merely wind and mind
The illusory body has an actual appearance.
Masters differentiate between an actual illusory body and one that is a similitude. The actual illusory body is the arising from the special empty as a deity of only wind and mind caused by the winds having dissolved in the heart [channel-wheel]. The similitude illusory body is the arising from the empty as a deity of only wind and mind[41] due simply to the winds dissolving on their own.
This [illusory body in its hidden sense] is illustrated by the twelve examples of illusion in the same ways as is the previous [general sense]. nagarjuna states:[42]
By means of a mirror’s reflection
One should understand the illusory body.
Its colors are like those of a rainbow,
Its ubiquitousness, like the moon on water.[43]
[The illusory body in its hidden sense is] an instantaneously complete form, like an image reflected in a mirror. its colors are vivid and distinct, like those of a rainbow. it is a single thing that is ubiquitous, like the moon reflected on water. These three examples are thereby used to illustrate [its nature].[44]

once perfect familiarity with the illusory body in its hidden sense has been achieved, with the channels, winds, and vital essences cleansed of all obscurations, a link [with the ultimate illusory body] is formed by way of the cause—the union [that requires] training—which consists of the illusory body that is a rainbow body.
With all karmic traces and emotional afflictions purified by the innate pristine awareness of luminous clarity, one actualizes, as the result, the ultimate, utterly pure, illusory body of the deity in the form of the enjoyment dimension, the union beyond training. [This is] the ultimate illusory body.
The illusory body in its hidden sense, as it pertains to this discussion, has been expounded by scholars in numerous and conflicting ways. [This illusory body] is evidently of extraordinary [significance]—the very aorta of the highest yoga tantras—and will therefore [now] be presented according to the viewpoints of Lord Mikyö [Dorjé] and his followers.
In general terms, [they explain that] within the supreme channel (central channel) there has always been an extremely subtle vital-essence-andwind [union], which is the support for innate bliss, and the seed of the undefiled body. This is what is actualized as the illusory body.
In order to actualize the illusory body, it is necessary first to experience the four joys resulting from the dissolution of the winds in the central channel. in particular, at the conclusion of the three empties sustained through the process of gathering winds and mind at the heart [channelwheel], one must actualize wind and mind as the illusory body. To do so, having first [perfected] the three isolations, with the outer factor of a seal and the inner [factor of] mind isolation, one fully elicits pristine awareness in the forward order.[45] Thereafter, in the reverse order, one actualizes the body of Vajrasattva—adorned with all the major and minor signs—from the pure essences of wind and mind. For this, there are many synonyms such as self-consecration and relative truth. [nagarjuna’s] Five Stages states:[46]
That is referred to as “self-consecration.”
The characteristics that reveal its illusory nature precisely indicate this very same [body]:
The illusory [body] that is the relative truth.
That dimension of enjoyment in itself is a gandharva being.
The vajra body is that alone,
The nature of Vajrasattva.

The reference here to a sentient being [called] gandharva [“subsisting on odors”] is made because the body of the intermediate-state being is identical [in nature] to the wind-mind inseparability.[47]
To summarize, during the cycle of existence, the coarse, karmic body is repeatedly discarded. nevertheless, the pure-essence body, which is the inseparability of wind and mind—and the ground for the actualization of the illusory body—continues without interruption throughout all one’s lifetimes in the beginningless cycle of existence until the attainment of total enlightenment. For this reason, it is called the “innate body.”
It is this innate body that creates the mental body of the intermediate state at the conclusion of the four empties during the process of death. it is this same innate body that, at the conclusion of the four empties of sleep, appears as the dream body formed of [karmic] imprints. Even on the levels of the formless [realm], although there is no evident appearance of a body due to the intoxication of meditative absorption, the innate body is present as a latent subtle body.
Practitioners of the creation phase apply on the path [the innate body] itself as the form dimension [in these ways]: in the Guhyasamaja, at the end of dissolving the visualization into luminous clarity, the innate body is generated as one’s lord.[48] in the chakrasamvara, hevajra, and other tantras, the innate body is the hum (or other syllable) that enters [the main deities] when the causal vajra-holder is in union [with consort]. in the Luipa [tradition of] chakrasamvara, the innate body is the nada that purifies the intermediate existence.[49]

Practitioners of the completion phase apply on the path [the innate body] as the form dimension in the following ways:
Father-tantra practitioners accomplish [the stage of] focus on the mind on the basis of vajra recitation, and by means of that [mind-focus], familiarize themselves repeatedly with the definite entry into and re-emergence from pristine awareness. as a result of that, [re-emerging] from the luminous clarity of the all-empty, they attain the illusory pristine-awareness body created from just wind and mind.
Mother-tantra practitioners, on the basis of the inner-fire [practice], develop the mind isolation that comes from the special four joys of blazing and dripping, caused by the pristine-awareness winds being gathered into the central channel, the supreme [of channels]. at the conclusion [of the stage of mind isolation], they attain the ordinary illusory body.
Then, true luminous clarity purifies the ordinary illusory body of stains. in the end is attained the special illusory body. accordingly, [nagarjuna’s] Five Stages states:[50]
That consciousness triad in itself
Truly possessed of the winds
Again arises as the body of the yogin:
That is known as the “illusory body.”
Naropa’s Elucidation Summary of the Five Stages states:[51]
Although formed of merely wind and mind
The illusory body has an actual appearance.
Moreover, according to the Five Stages, that illusory body arises from luminous clarity in the way a fish springs from water. The special illusory body is called the “body of union,” or the “dimension of complete enjoyment.”

[Maitreya’s] Jewel Affinity states:[1]
Mind nature is luminous clarity. it is changeless, just as space is.
The luminous clarity of the ground, as spoken of in that [citation], is the luminous clarity of the true nature, the primordially pure, naturally clear and luminous basis of phenomena. it is, moreover, the luminous clarity during sleep and luminous clarity at death since those definitely manifest for everyone—meditators on the path and non-practitioners alike— regardless of whether they are recognized or not.
During the time of the path, that [luminous clarity of the ground] is understood—through analyses based on reasonings and scriptural sources and through the strength of experience—as unborn emptiness, the true nature of all phenomena. This view represents luminous clarity in the general sense [from a perspective] shared by [the way of] the perfections. all phenomena made to enter luminous clarity by way of either [the contemplation of] total apprehension or that of successive destruction[2] is luminous clarity in its general sense [from a perspective] unique to the indestructible way.
The unceasing clarity of that emptiness’s self-luminosity is luminous clarity in its literal sense. This is essentially identical to what was discussed [above], the luminous clarity at the time of the ground.
Through cultivation of and familiarity with those [various types of] luminous clarity, the winds dissolve in the central channel, and the luminous clarity of the fourth empty, or the innate [joy], the fourth joy, is recognized as a direct experience. This is the actualization of luminous clarity in its hidden sense. The innate [joy] or fourth empty accompanied by the duality of subject and object is the luminous clarity that is an example. The innate [joy] or fourth empty free from the duality of subject and object is the true luminous clarity. Those [types of luminous clarity] form a link with the direct realization of emptiness through the nonconceptual pristine awareness that is the true nature of things. That direct realization is [luminous clarity] at the stage of training.
[Luminous clarity] at the stage of no more training is [reached when] all phenomena manifest fully as pristine awareness, and through the merging of mother–luminous clarity and son–luminous clarity,[3] arise as the infinite expanse of the dimension of reality. That is said to be luminous clarity as the ultimate result.

[next are explained] the methods of meditation on luminous clarity. in general, the luminous clarity that is the goal of practice is luminous clarity in its hidden sense. however, prior to that, one must have a definite understanding of luminous clarity in its general sense. The Abhidhana Tantra states:[4]
Being selfless in nature, all phenomena
Are without stain, just as space is.
Always meditate on their emptiness
With the emptiness pristine-awareness vajra.
The actual method of meditation consists in dissolving the environment and inhabitants by means of one or the other of two contemplations, whereupon everything enters luminous clarity. This very method is found in every one of the works [composed] by the great adepts. [nagarjuna’s] Five Stages states:[5]
Students who have received esoteric instructions[6] Train themselves next in the two types of yoga. one is the sequence of total apprehension;
The other, that of successive destruction.
Thus, there are said to be the two contemplations, total apprehension and successive destruction. concerning those, the same text says:[7]
From the head down to the feet until [the light] reaches the heart, The yogin enters the true limit:
This is known as total apprehension.[8]
First, the animate and the inanimate are transformed into luminous clarity.
Afterwards, one does the same with oneself. These are the steps in successive destruction.[9]
Just as the breath’s vapor vanishes
From the surface of a mirror,
Again and again, the yogin enters
The true limit [of luminous clarity].[10]

The proper cultivation of those two contemplations is an extremely profound key factor in bringing aboutthe gathering of winds and vital essences in the heart [channel-wheel]. as a consequence, there arise five signs indicative of the sequential dissolutions of earth, water, fire, wind, and consciousness. The Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra explains:[11]
The first resembles a mirage.
The second is like smoke.
The third resembles fireflies.
The fourth glows like an oil lamp.
The fifth is a lasting light
Like a sky free of clouds.[12]
Thereafter, the four empties manifest in succession. in the cloudless sky [of the fifth sign] manifests the light of the empty, which is like moonlight. Then the increase of light of the [further] empty manifests, which is like sunlight. Thereafter the full culmination of the great empty, which is like the pervasive darkness of night, manifests. Then luminous clarity, or the all-empty, manifests, which is like a [perfectly clear] sky at dawn, not vitiated by the influences of moonlight, sunlight, or darkness. The manifesting of those [four] is described in [Nagarjuna’s] Five Stages.
On this subject, the earlier masters have asserted that when the winds dissolve at the heart through practice of the outer and inner methods, one can give rise to the special fourth empty, the true luminous clarity. That is the real luminous clarity. Through the winds simply dissolving on their own, [there arises] the fourth empty, the luminous clarity that is an example. That is a similitude of [the real] luminous clarity.
Those two contemplations, as well as the mother-tantra yogas of the channels, winds, and vital essences, are said to elicit the four joys and the four empties and cause the environment and its inhabitants to be absorbed into luminous clarity. There are many such specific details concerning the methods of practice. however, to elicit correctly the true luminous clarity in its hidden sense definitely requires giving rise to the experience that comes from the winds having entered, abided, and dissolved in the central channel. Furthermore, nagarjuna and aryadeva state that to meditate on luminous clarity requires the attainment of the real illusory body.

The eight freedoms are distinctions based on the steps of the actual awakenings that form the way to enter the luminous clarity of emptiness. [The steps include] the total apprehension and successive destruction by means of which contemplative experiences are achieved; the outer and inner elements manifesting like space; [the elements] simply arising as manifestations of consciousness; [the realization of] their primordial nonexistence; the presence of [the effort of] attention; and the absence of [the effort of] attention.
The name “eight freedoms” is the same as the name used in the way of characteristics.[13] however, here, the eight freedoms are distinctions made solely based on the pristine awareness of inseparable bliss and emptiness, which is the mode of entry into luminous clarity. They therefore have unique meanings, explained as follows:
[one,] as the appearances of one’s own winds and mind arise unceasingly, all appearances unfold as an infinitude of clear images. [This is] the freedom in which forms are viewed as forms.
[Two,] one’s own five aggregates are absorbed into luminous clarity, and what simply appears as an external object is regarded as the body of the deity and illusory [in nature]. [This is] the freedom in which forms are viewed as formless.
[Three,] at the beginning of the successive destruction, oneself and all external appearances are regarded as being without any [basis of] reference. Then, while the actual destructions, and even the manifestations of the deity’s body and bliss, [occur] ceaselessly, they are understood to be without any inherent nature.[14] [This is] the freedom of what is especially beautiful.
[Four,] the clear, empty light [that manifests] when all relative appearances have been dissolved by means of successive destruction is the pristine awareness of light. [This is] the freedom of infinite space.
[Five,] that light manifesting extremely brightly is the increase of light. [This is] the freedom of infinite consciousness.
[six,] that increase of light manifesting with no inherent nature is the full culmination [of light]. [This is] the freedom of nothing whatsoever.
[seven,] an absence of fixation [on the previous stage of light], accompanied by a slight deliberate effort of attention, is the full culmination [of light] that leads up to the all-empty. [This is] the freedom of neither recognition nor non-recognition.
[Eight,] to abide in the effortless[15] pristine awareness of bliss and emptiness, in which all dualistic appearances have ceased, is the freedom of cessation.

The realization of the inseparability of emptiness and dependent origination, or the union of emptiness (wisdom) and great compassion (method), is union in its general sense, [a perspective] of the way of the perfections.
The inseparability of innate great bliss (method) and the emptiness of luminous clarity (wisdom) is union in its general sense, [a perspective] unique to the indestructible way.
The union of the two truths, without the conceptual differentiations of relative and ultimate, is union in its literal sense.
Having received teachings on union in its literal sense and having gained experience of union in its general sense, [one reaches] the special stage: according to the mother tantras, what is referred to as “union” [means] the one taste—like a blend of water and milk—of the object, the emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects, and the subject, unchanging great bliss. accordingly, the Samputa Tantra states:[17]
It is declared that the merging
Of two aspects, combined indivisibly
Like a blend of milk and water,
Is known as that of wisdom and method.
The perspective of the father tantras is as stated in [nagarjuna’s] Five Stages:[18]
When the relative and the ultimate, First understood as separate aspects, are then truly merged together:
That is explained to be the union.[19]
The relative truth is the self-consecration of the body so that it manifests as the illusory body. The ultimate truth is the mind entering essential reality through luminous clarity. The union is when those two are one: it is the combination or inseparability of the two, so that there is never an occasion for one to be without the other. Those [descriptions according to the mother and father tantras] represent union in its hidden sense.
Thereafter, one needs to train on the path that involves the three empties arising in the forward order and passing away in the reverse order. Through that, [one attains] the union [at the stage] of training [related to] the first to the twelfth [stages of realization].
The union [that requires] no more training is the opposite of that. it is free from [the arising and passing away of] the three empties in the forward and reverse orders and is thereby beyond training on the path. it comprises both what is supported—the reality dimension, whose subject and object possess the two purities[20]—and the support—the form dimension of complete enjoyment, created from just wind and mind. however, those [two] are of a single nature (although conceptually differentiated), known as the “body of pristine awareness,” which is the ultimate union.

The method of meditating on union is [first] to dissolve the environment and its inhabitants sequentially; and then, from the state of luminous clarity brought forth by the four empties, to arise as the illusory body. To explain, from the luminous-clarity state, the arising of the stage of self-consecration from just wind and mind is like the flash of a fish [as it springs] from water. [nagarjuna’s] Five Stages[21] states:
Through the stage of self-consecration consisting of wind and consciousness, The lights that are endowed with form at times bring about beings’ welfare.
Like the sudden flash of a fish
As it springs from a clear stream,
The net of magical illusion arises
From the all-empty, so is taught.[22]
This [illusory body] arises from the combination of pristine awareness (which, with the sequential dissolution of the [three] empties, has become solely luminous clarity) and the subtle wind element upon which that pristine awareness is mounted. Like [the body’s] shadow, it cannot be cut asunder. it is a vajra body that is not subject to destruction by any means: the very nature of Great Vajradhara.[23] This is explained in [aryadeva’s] [Lamp Summary of] Tantric Practice.[24]
One might wonder how this [illusory body] differs from the illusory body of just wind and mind that arises from emptiness when the winds have dissolved and that is made to enter emptiness and then re-emerge. however, there is a very significant difference between those two. The body of just wind and mind that arises from emptiness when the winds have dissolved is the illusory body alone. Equipoise in luminous clarity when the illusory body’s environment and inhabitants have been absorbed is luminous clarity alone. hence, there is an alternation [between the illusory body and luminous clarity].
In this case, the arising of the illusory body from the luminous-clarity state requires the simultaneity of the mind abiding in the nature of luminous clarity and the body manifesting as the illusory body.
On this point, masters have said that the arising of the illusory body from the state of true luminous clarity is the real union. The arising of the illusory body from the state of the luminous clarity that is an example is a union that is a similitude.

Among all of the meditation practices of sutra and mantra[1] found in this country of Tibet—a land situated in the midst of the snowy mountain ranges—here we are considering the vajrayāna. Of outer and inner mantra, the highest is yoga tantra.[2] This has two traditions: one that emphasizes the tantras and one that emphasizes the esoteric instructions. The latter, drawing mainly from the long tradition,[3] is known as the Eight Great Path Traditions of the Chariots of the Practice Lineage.[4] Since the meaning of these meditations will be explained sequentially, that intention is indicated by the addition of the word “from” in the root text, the ablative case.

The teaching tradition of the Ancient or Nyingma school of the early translation[6] of the secret mantra has very many general and specific meditation sequences in the three yogas,[7] and it is difficult to condense them all into one inclusive explanation. However, the basis of all of them can be subsumed into two meditation techniques: with or without characteristics. That is because even the three phases of creation, completion, and great completion[8] can be subsumed into two: (1) appearance and that which is manifest, has characteristics, and is objectified; and (2) emptiness and that which is unmanifest and without characteristics. This is also expressed in The Three Stages:[9]
The phase of meditation with characteristics And the meditation of suchness
Are taught as the two distinct kinds of meditation.

In the system of the Net of Magical Manifestation of Vajrasattva,[11] which is the main source for tantra mahāyoga,[12] there are two meditation methods with characteristics: the path of certainty through methods, and the path of total liberation through wisdom. As it states in the Explanatory Tantra of the Oceanic [Magical Manifestation]:[13]
The paths of liberation and methods are fully presented.
The former principally uses the special methods of amazing deliberate conduct[14] to bring about the swift attainment of the result. The latter principally employs the three kinds of wisdom[15] to liberate the bonds of ordinary being into reality itself.

When we divide the path of certainty through methods, there are the two approaches of the upper door [of one’s own body] and the lower door [of another’s body]. As is said in The Three Stages, there are “oral instructions about upper and lower doors.”[16]
The upper door practice is further divided into the common and special techniques. The common upper door applies the union of blazing and dripping based on the six chakras (Skt. cakra),[17] generating the pristine awareness of bliss in the four chakras as a progressive training.[18] This is taught in the Oceanic [Magical Manifestation]:
In two sets of three chakras in three life trees,
The sky cow is milked by the radiation of fire and energy. This is renowned as the upper door.[19]
The special [technique] was taught in the thirteenth chapter of the [Secret] Essence Tantra.[20] The esoteric instruction of Samantabhadra is to target the vital point of the vaṃ-shaped vital essence drop[21] of pristine awareness essence that is based on the gathering of the five quintessences in the heart chakra. The esoteric instruction of Samantabhadrī is to target the vital point of the aḥ-shaped vital essence drop of the five mothers in the navel chakra. The esoteric instruction of pure union is to target the vital point of the aṃ-shaped vital essence drop of the voracious ḍākinīs in the throat chakra. The esoteric instruction of the great pervasion is to target the vital point of the haṃ-shaped lunar vital essence drop of Samantabhadra in the head chakra.[22]
Thus, the meaning of the warming and descent of the vital essence as set forth in these approaches and in the Tārā esoteric instruction of energy currents,[23] the root text and commentaries of the Secret Innermost Essence of Vimalamitra,[24] and so on, are found in the oral teachings of the Zur forefathers[25] and the Omniscient Drimé Özer.[26] According to them, training in the union of melting and controlling causes all discursive thought to dissolve into the expanse of nonthought. Enlightenment occurs in the great bliss without reference or limitation.

In the practice of the lower door, the descent, retention, reversal, and pervasion of the vital essence from union based on both the “space” [of the female] and the “secret” [of the male] instantly generates the pristine awareness of inseparable bliss-emptiness. It is the path of skillful methods for the instantaneous realizer. Furthermore:
Approach and close approach; Attainment and great attainment.
In general, concerning the four branches of approach and attainment,[27] there are the four branches of approach and attainment at the time of the path, the four branches of approach and attainment at the time of attainment, and the four branches of approach and attainment at the time of union. Here, we are discussing the four branches of approach and attainment at the time of union.
The branch of approach is to first seek a qualified partner, examine the channels, arouse, increase pleasure by following the treatises on desire, and so on. The branch of close approach is encouragement by the mutual exchange of the four signs;[28] delighting in nonduality through the practice of the four mudras (Skt. mudrā)[29] by means of the three perceptions.[30] The branch of attainment is when, having entered into union in this way, the vital energy current moves in the heightened passion, causing the red aspect to descend and the white aspect to melt.[31] As the bodhicitta falls, the four joys arise in sequence.[32] Then the two sexual fluids meet at the tips of the private parts of the male and female. This is the practice of experiencing coemergent pristine awareness with the actual entity [or substance of sexual fluid]. The branch of great attainment is when the white and red constituents blend into one and are drawn up through the male’s vajra like a spider’s thread. As it ascends through the navel, heart, throat, and head chakras the four stable joys of ascent are experienced.[33] Finally, it spreads [throughout the body].
Energy channels (rtsa; Skt. nāḍī) pervade the whole body, bodhicitta pervades all of the energy channels, and the pristine awareness of joy pervades all of that. At that point, the ten perfections[34] and all of the qualities of the stages and paths[35] automatically reach completion and one arrives at the fruition at once. This is for the instantaneous realizer on the path of skillful methods. From the Extensive Sutra:[36]
Spontaneous accomplishments in abundance
Are bestowed by the sublime secret empowerment.

If we divide the path of liberation, there are two kinds of practitioners: instantaneous and gradual. As is stated in Sequence of the Path,[37] there is “the long-term or gradual and the instantaneous.”
As for the instantaneous, there are a few individuals of exceptional faculties who attain realization, familiarity, and consummation all at once. These are called the instantaneous realizers. As it says in the Highest Magical Manifestation:[38]
In the yoga of the great vital essence
The three meditations are completed all at once.
Those who practice realization, familiarization, and consummation by stages are called gradual ones. Their way of realizing and familiarizing will be explained next.

The former, the gradual realizers, train as follows: The attachment to the dual fixation of samsara (Skt. saṃsāra) and nirvana (Skt. nirvāṇa), including projections about it, are taken as the object of evaluation. The axioms[40] of evaluation are referenced in The Sequence of the Path:
Suchness: five actualities, manner, and words.
That is to say, the view of the abiding nature is ascertained through
(1) the axioms of five direct actualities of previous occurrence, (2) the axioms of the five manners that are consistent with those, and (3) the axioms of the five kinds of words. The view having thus gone before, one then enters into meditation.[41]

Even if one is unable to train until reaching the ultimate five experiences of meditative absorption in each of the paths, one could at least approximate the general meaning by meditating in a way that simulates the path through devoted intent to this or that.

All paths instantly completed in their aspects;

The path of the object of meditation is described in the [Secret] Essence:[45]
The way that the stages of existence are ripened Is laid out in the five branches of entrance.
Since all things are reflexive awareness, Death is the ultimate truth,
In between [death and] birth is the relative, The three stages of rebirth signify the nondual.
The paths to refine the three stages of birth, the intermediate state (bar do), and death all at once are taught definitively as follows: Great emptiness is the path corresponding to the luminous clarity at the moment of death. Great compassion is the path corresponding to the intermediate state. Single mudra, elaborate mudra, and the attainment of the mandala clusters[46] are the paths corresponding to the three stages of birth. [These refine the four kinds of birthplace:] spontaneous birth, which depends on a place, heat-and-moisture birth, which depends on flavor, and both womb-birth and egg-birth, which depend on the coming together of a father and a mother.

When embodied beings experience the transition of death and the sequence of outer and inner dissolution is complete,[47] the luminous clarity of the dharmakāya[48] of the death state arises. In order to integrate that experience into the spiritual path, one meditates in the absorption of suchness so that all things subsumed in sensory phenomena are [recognized as] the unembellished dharmakāya.
When one fails to recognize this luminous clarity in the death state, the illusory-like mental body of the intermediate state occurs. In meditation, the habitual patterns[49] formed from that situation are refined away by meditation in nonreferential all-arising absorption, the essence of which is the great compassion pervading space.
So long as one is not liberated in the intermediate state on that basis, the next stage is conception in the mother’s womb through actual birth. The habitual patterns formed then are refined by the subtle and coarse methods of the single mudra. The situation of the intermediate existence, when one is about to enter into a birthplace due to the condition of growing attachment to whatever place one is to take birth, is refined by the subtle absorption of the cause, the essence of which is meditation on a seed syllable alone. Those, then, are the trainings in the three absorptions.[50]
The situation from the time that [consciousness] itself intermingles with the father and mother’s seminal fluids until the awakening of the sense organs to the external world at birth is refined by training in the coarse form of the deity, such as the four actual enlightening factors, the three rites, and so on. The training in these creation phase practices accords with the manner of the four kinds of birthplace.[51]

The four measures of clarity are clear, luminous, vibrant, and vivid.[52] The four measures of stability are unwavering, unchanging, completely unchanging, and utterly unchangeable.[53] Once one has gained profi- ciency in these eight measures of clarity and stability, the habitual patterns arising from birth until maturity are refined by the four trainings in the elaborate mudra, as indicated in the Sequence of the Path:
There are mandalas, clusters, numbers, And faces and arms.
In the elaborate mudra one emanates mandalas, one emanates clusters [of mandalas], one emanates numbers [of deities], and one emanates faces and arms [of the deities]. These four respectively comprise (1) the extensive, medium, and condensed mandalas of peaceful and wrathful deities; (2) one, three, or five [mandala] clusters; (3) numbers of one thousand, twenty-four thousand, and a spontaneously present inconceivable number of peaceful deities, and one thousand four hundred and fifty, seventy-six thousand eight hundred and fifty, and a spontaneously present inconceivable number of wrathful deities; and (4) faces and arms of the deities that are also in extensive, medium, and condensed styles.
On this, the great paṇḍita Rongzom[54] explained that one could condense the meaning of all the deity yogas with characteristics into three: the yoga of blessing, the yoga of imaginative construction, and the yoga of completion.
The first of these is to meditate that one’s own suchness (de kho na nyid ) is blessed by the suchness of the deity. This is like using alchemy to change iron into gold. The second is to create the form kāyas out of pure bodhicitta. This is like making statues and such by correctly melting gold or other substances. Third is for a yogin who has realized natural purity to completely emanate[55] [the deities] in an instant of meditative absorption. This is like the effortless appearance of a reflection in clear water. It is said that the entire extent of secret mantra practice can be subsumed into these three yogas.

If one is trained in the elaborate mudra, the method that refines the habitual patterns of the time from maturity through old age[56] is the assembly practice of the cluster groups. The place where one does the practice, the time of practice, the practice materials that one uses, the teacher and entourage from whom one receives the practice, and the method of the practice mode should be the five excellences[57] that lay the foundation of practice. The four branches of approach and attainment at the time of practice straighten the approach. It states in the Sequence of the Path:
The first half-month, seeing the face is close approach:
Clarity of the deity, emanating and absorbing, [indicates] a suitable vessel.
The fifteenth day onwards is attainment:
Alternating emanating and absorbing attains it. When the number of days is complete and signs arise,
The spiritual power from mantra repetition is the great attainment.
Once the conditions and practice materials are assembled, as soon as one enters into the practice it is called approach. Once one has thus entered, up to half a month is the close approach. The last half [of the retreat time], except for the last day, is called attainment. And the very last evening when the spiritual powers are received is known as great attainment.[58]

Likewise, the results of attainment are taught in terms of the time it takes to accomplish the state of an awareness-holder. One will accomplish the fruition of being an awareness-holder in six months, if practice is done together with the addendum,[59] or whatever length of time is appropriate to one’s particular capabilities. This was indicated by the words “or so” in the root text. Depending on whether one uses the actionmudra or the awareness-mudra,[60] the common spiritual powers of the creation phase are the attainment of the awareness-holder of similar status to either the desire realm or the form realm.[61] The special spiritual powers of the practice of the peaceful assembly are accomplished in six [months] in the best of the best cases, in one year at the best, in fourteen months average, and in sixteen months in even the worst cases. The awareness-holder with control over life span applies to those of sharp faculties, while the awareness-holder of complete maturation applies to those with dull faculties. It states in the Secret Essence:[62]
In thirty days times six,
Or twelve, fourteen, or sixteen [months],
The ultimate accomplishment of empowered awareness-holder will be attained.[63]
In the practice of the wrathful deities, the time for accomplishment is even shorter: the best practitioner will become accomplished in two months, the middling in three months and six days, and even the lesser in six months. In the Sequence of the Path it states:
For thirty days times six,
Or sixty or ninety plus six,
Meditate on the mandala of great Bhairava.
Great emptiness, compassion, the single mudra, and the elaborate mudra—these four constitute the path of accumulation, while the assembly practice constitutes the path of application. These five dissipating[64] paths correspond to cyclic existence in the three stages of birth, the intermediate state, and death, and thereby purify its habitual patterns. Nurturing the potential of the family[65] will bring the result to completion. And since the path of the assembly practice causes the attainment of the deity’s form of bliss-emptiness, in terms of the supreme spiritual powers, it quickly lays the foundation of the path of application, and hence brings about the maturation of the higher paths. By that, one is able to enter the completion phase, which becomes the perpetuating cause for ultimately attaining the four types of awareness-holder subsumed in the three nondissipating paths: those of seeing, meditating, and the ultimate.[66]

To explain the main pillar of the path in terms of the completion phase, one must explain the five yogas of the path, such as great emptiness, and so on.
(1) The Yoga of Great Emptiness
The habitual patterns of the death existence are integrated on the path by the process of drawing the energy-mind into the central channel. The foundation is the view that has been ascertained. Then in a place where meditative stability will not be interrupted, awareness settles in a state of uncontrived fresh awareness by means of the seven-point posture of Vairocana.[67] This is the placement meditation of the kusāli.[68] Recalling the view gained from previous study and contemplation and resting in that state is the analytic meditation of the paṇḍita.[69] Resting in the equipoise of nonconceptual absorption by whichever of these two methods of placement is appropriate is the daytime yoga. At night, the two esoteric instructions for recognizing luminous clarity in sleep and in meditation sessions are combined. By means of practicing these day and night in conjunction, one trains in reaching the ultimate five meditative experiences.[70]
(2) Compassion Illusion
This is the way to meditate on the path that is consistent with integrating the intermediate existence on the path. From previously stopping the mind in the state of great emptiness and luminous clarity, the appearance of forms of emptiness arise, such as smoke, mirages, firefly-like, white, red, and black. All of the waking appearances of daytime yoga and the dream appearances of the night are seen as illusion, like moons reflected in water, and so they are liberated. Then great, nonreferential compassion arises unobstructed. One trains, familiarizing oneself with that.

</d>
<d e="2">
(3) The Yoga of the Single Mudra
In order to refine the habitual patterns of the first stage of a person’s life, one practices the path that is consistent with that. Great compassion is projected towards all appearance without partiality and, like the arising of reflections in clear water, the single mudra of the deity’s form concurrent with melting bliss arises by itself in meditative absorption, and seals all appearance.
(4) The Yoga of the Elaborate Mudra
In order to refine the habitual patterns of a person’s middle stage of life one practices the path that is consistent with that. The previous appearance of a single deity increases more and more until all appearance becomes nondual deities in the form of principal deities with entourages and clusters actually emanating throughout space, proliferating, distinct, and completely arising. One familiarizes oneself with that.
(5) The Cluster Assembly Practice
In order to refine the habitual patterns of the third stage of a person’s life, one practices the path that is consistent with that. By means of one or three or five clusters, whatever is appropriate, one practices in a similar way to the creation phase with elaboration, or by relying on the unelaborated yoga in which the male and female [yogins] and the father-mother central deities are assembled,[71] or practicing the extremely unelaborated yoga of the union of the father, unchanging great bliss, and the mother, emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects.[72]
In any case, the perpetuating cause is whichever of the three mudras was appropriate to practice in relation to the categories of excellent, middling, and lesser faculties. At the end of six months, based on the inner five enlightening factors, applying whichever is appropriate of the two nondissipating paths of seeing,[73] one will attain the nondual kāya of the path of training and thereby produce the actualization of the nondual union of the path of no-training.

Once one has reached the culmination of the descending and ascending pristine awareness,[74] one should meditate in the manner of no meditation on the unimaginable pristine awareness of Samantabhadrī[75] without characteristics. The body without movement like the sovereign mountain; speech without utterance like a mute; mind nonconceptual like the sky—settle into the suchness of reality. The emptiness of no mental constructions whatsoever is the ultimate pristine awareness of Samantabhadrī herself. The appearing aspect distinguished in the transparent brilliance of inherently luminous awareness is the basic ground pristine awareness of dharmakāya Samantabhadra. Those two inseparable—the evenly pervading intrinsic awareness with no outside, inside, or in between—is the inseparability of basic space and pristine awareness, the nondual Samanta mother-father, the native mind of great completion.

The essence is skillful methods and wisdom.
Two paths are specified: the definitive path of skillful methods and the totally liberating path of wisdom. The first refers to whichever method is used to accomplish the pristine awareness of melting bliss, the supreme great bliss of coemergence—that is, whether it is the esoteric instructions of the upper door using the method of eliciting bliss through the coemergent pristine awareness produced by means of meditation on the four chakras, or the esoteric instructions on the lower door using the method of eliciting bliss and coemergent pristine awareness all at once by relying on the union of the “space” of the female and the “secret” of the male. That text also says:
With the methods of esoteric instruction,
One enters the “source of enjoyment” and so on.[78]

Entrance [to the path of liberation] that is consistent with conceptual analysis[79] is first to ascertain the view. Then, as it says in the Gathering of Intentions:[80]
In reality just as it is,
Just like that, rest the mind, and then Maintain mindfulness without distraction From that inexpressible state itself.
Thus, the object of meditation is reality just as it is. Within that state, the mind that meditates is also left just like that and then abides in totally nonconceptual meditative absorption without characteristics. That is called “entrance that is consistent with the meaning.”[81]

There are three well-known classes of great completion divided according to the difference in degree of profundity in how they make naturally occurring pristine awareness into the path. In the first of these, the mind class, defining characteristics are destroyed and one achieves breakthrough or total conviction. The mind class practitioner thus trains in the context of consciousness, which is what is to be abandoned. Phenomena (chos, Skt. dharma), however they appear, are not stamped objectively by the seal of reality (chos nyid, Skt. dharmatā). Rather, relative phenomena (chos can, Skt. dharmin), however they appear, are realized to be fully contained within the reality of awakening mind, and are merely its object or display. This conveys one to the basic space, which is free of identifying appearance separately from awareness.[86]

Therefore, in the practice of meditation, one knows all appearances in this way to be the natural expression of mind, and mind itself to be naturally occurring pristine awareness. Then one settles directly into the natural basic ground of mind’s essence without contrivance or calculation. Thereby deluded appearance is directly liberated in itself without being rejected. Since the object of meditation is realized to be empty, there is no experience of meditation. Since delusion has collapsed in on itself, there is no experience of the absence of the ultimate meaning of meditation.[87] Therefore natural appearance is experienced without bias within the state of awareness-emptiness, the dharmakāya. Free of an object to rest in or an agent who rests, there is resting in the state of spontaneously present great equipoise.
On these occasions, one first severs discursive thought at its root. In the middle, one searches for mind’s hidden condition.[88] Finally, one investigates the arising, abiding, and departing of thought. The abiding of thought arises as the ornament of mind. Mental activity dawns as the play of mind. These two inseparable is the breakthrough to the state of equipoise. By such means, calm abiding and higher insight are duly accomplished. Then, once one has investigated external appearance, internal awareness, and the inseparability of these two, one must practice [diligently], like rock meeting bone, using the vital points of the esoteric instructions that have been imparted by a guru experienced in pointing out mind’s nature and such, and who has assessed the disciple’s mental type and level of cognition.

The space class of the great completion maintains the perspective that denies origination from any other source than the expanse of reality and asserts no other destination than the reality of Samantabhadrī’s expanse. The sequence of meditation is currently well established in the tradition of ripening empowerments and liberating instructions. The leading statement in the source text, the Vajra Bridge,[90] contains the conclusive points:
Homage to the unmistaken, uncontrived, unimaginable, free of intellect.
This lays out in summary the meaning of this source text. The view is unmistaken, the meditation is uncontrived, the activity is unimaginable, and the fruition is free of intellect. Since the view, meditation, activity, and fruition of this tradition are subsumed and completely contained in this, the initial statement alone liberates those of excellent faculties. This very meaning fully contains the basis of the spiritual instructions of the space class.

Those of middling faculties are liberated just by the blessing of the guru’s transmission. During empowerment, the distinctive quality of this itself is conferred in the four empowerments[91] and one reaches the ultimate experiential realization.
Those of dull faculties must meditate on the stages laid out in the guides to experience. To summarize those conclusive points: the four modes possessed of the four vital points make the meaning of the four empowerments into the path. The natural openness of the senses is the vital point of clarity. The unwavering lamps are the vital point of emptiness.[92] Drawing up the downward-clearing energy currents is the vital point of bliss. And the lips not touching[93] is the vital point of inseparability. With these are the mode of pristine awareness, the mode of basic space, the mode of bliss, and the mode of reality.[94] We can make the connection with the vital points of the four modes or four symbols as they are presented in the vajra verses as follows: In the four empowerments, the first pristine awareness makes the clarity of the vase empowerment into the path, the second makes the emptiness of the secret empowerment into the path, the third makes the bliss of the wisdom empowerment into the path, and the fourth makes the reality of the fourth empowerment into the path.

Having meditated on those profound vital points, various definite and indefinite experiences arise and ultimately the pristine awareness of realization becomes more and more clear and stable. The sequence of possible experiences is endless and cannot be estimated. However, in terms of the generic manner of arising, first there is the experience of abiding in which the conscious mind remains undivided during the meditation session without pursuing an external object. Second is the experience of unwavering meditative absorption without any conditions such as sinking or agitation. Third is the experience of evenness in which one rests in the sky-like equipoise of the equal flavor of samsara and nirvana. In the subsequent cognition, one integrates the illusory-like nature of all things and obtains the total confidence of fearlessness. Fourth is the experience of spontaneous presence, the absorption that goes beyond meditation sessions and breaks, the falling away of intellect and of phenomena. These “four experiences” (nyams bzhi ) of the mind and space paths were posited by the great awareness-holder Garab Dorjé.[95]

The esoteric instruction class of atiyoga is far superior to the two lower classes. One achieves breakthrough by the destruction of efforts to analyze and differentiate between good and bad thoughts. Thus, the antidote is approached from the direction of pristine awareness. In this esoteric instruction class of the great completion, the sequence of meditation is as follows: From the side of emptiness, primordially pure intrinsic awareness becomes free of elaboration, causing the phenomena of emptiness to fall away. From the side of appearance, spontaneous presence purifies corporeal form in luminous clarity, causing the very reality of phenomena to fall away.[96] The oral instructions for these two stages are primordially pure trekchö (khregs chod) and spontaneously present tögal (thod rgal).

The pristine awareness of nondual union is original liberation free from accepting and rejecting, conveying one to the state where all phenomena of samsara and nirvana are the reality free of fixation [even] to emptiness. Through this vital point, intrinsic awareness that makes no distinction whatsoever between samsara and nirvana manifestly arises as the objective field of reality. Then reflexive awareness matures as the forms of interlinking continuums[97] and causes liberation directly on that vital point, like sparks from striking the point [of a flint]. Just such an awareness itself has anyway never been encumbered in its essence by any kind of samsaric phenomena and so has exhausted the causes of taking on existence. Thus it is “original liberation” (ye grol ).
Without contriving any kind of antidote, whatever arises is all free, like a snake’s coils naturally unwinding, without recourse to any outside means of liberation. Thus it is “natural liberation” (rang grol ).
All of the eight groups of consciousness, moreover, are not divided into subject and object, but are by nature liberated in the very moment of arising in great immediacy.[98] Thus it is “naked liberation” (gcer grol ).
Not abiding in the three times or in any knowable object, it is “liberation from extremes” (mtha’ grol ).
Abiding in that way within the four great modes of liberation, one will gain certainty in the distinctive quality of this very path of naturally occurring pristine awareness—one’s own intrinsic awareness.
Through that, the enlightened perspective of utterly transparent[99] pristine awareness, Samantabhadra—that original, primordial, alphapure way of abiding just as it is—is now recognized directly in and of itself. This is “recognition directly in one’s own nature.”
That very awareness, which is not affected by objectification, is not polluted by subjective fixation, and is not engaged in rejecting or remedying; that awareness just as it is never departs from the naturally occurring pristine awareness of dharmakāya. Thus, it is “decided directly upon one thing.”
Whatever appears, whatever arises, all of it first arose as the expression of reality. Right now it abides within that reality. Ultimately, it will naturally subside within reality. Thus, “have confidence directly in liberation.”[100]
To enhance these [realizations], one should do the yogas such as in the spiritual instructions of the outer, inner, and secret threefold sky.[101]

The initial meditation in tögal is training in the meaning of the sounds of the four elements with the three kāyas acting as leader. It says in the Reverberation of Sound Root Tantra:[102]
The sequence of training in the three kāyas
Makes the sense-pleasures of the elements foremost. Excellently train in the sounds of earth, water, fire, and air, And definitely become accomplished.[103]
Then there is the training in the conduct that delineates the gap between samsara and nirvana (’khor ’das ru shan) with intrinsic awareness as the leader. It states in the naturally arisen Tantra of the Single Child of the Doctrine:[104]
Accordingly, the most fortunate one
Who desires to enter the extreme secret meaning itself Must begin with the activities of the preliminaries
In order to reverse compulsive attachment Of the body, speech, and mind.
Then there is the training in the preliminaries of the three doors with the mind as leader. At the end of the former and latter, one “falls into the natural state.”[105] Through this training with the three leaders, on the common level the sins and obscurations of the three doors are refined away and obstacles are pacified. As the supreme purpose, one is liberated in the space of enlightened body, speech, and mind. As is said:
Here there are two purposes,
Analyzed into divisions of common and supreme.

For the main body of the practice one relies on the continuum of nondissipating pristine awareness. For physical support, the vital point of the body is not to waver from the sitting postures of the three kāyas.[106] For guidance, the vital point of basic space is not to waver from the gazes of the three kāyas.[107] For visionary appearance, the vital point of the objective field is to sit with the breathing relaxed, not separating awareness from basic space. One practices with these three vital points, or nine, if one counts the subdivisions. Specifically, the objectively appearing visions are classified into “four lamps” (sgron ma bzhi ). The four visionary appearances will come from meditation based on those as the path. Ultimately they will convey one to the level of the falling away of phenomena.
The four lamps are the watery lamp of the far-reaching eyes, the lamp of the basic space of awareness, the lamp of empty vital essence spheres, and the lamp of naturally occurring wisdom.[108] The first of these four is the gateway that causes arising, since it is through the eyes that one sees the external manifestation of the radiance of the awareness aspect. The second is the ground from which the inner basic space arises externally as the radiance of clarity. The third is the support that activates the arising forms. And the fourth is the unerring abiding nature of higher insight, the very nature of awareness arising as quintessence and not as [gross] object. Concerning these classifications, it says in the [Great] Natural Arising [of Intrinsic Awareness]:[109]
In the mandala of the empty sky
Four lamps uncontrived
Manifest clearly by unimpeded ultimate nature.
The lamp of the basic space of awareness arises
In the center of the space of the empty sky as
The body of light, the inherent nature of basic space.
Unimpeded, it manifests clearly without impediment.
The kāya of Mind endowed with five pristine awarenesses
Arises in the manner of interlinking chains.
These fluctuate in their movements,
And their comings and goings.
If one brings them into the lamp of the basic space of awareness
And the awareness does not waver,
It is explained as unchanging realization.
If the lamp of naturally occurring wisdom Severs all superimpositions,
And the lamp of empty spheres Arises without any effort,
And the watery lamp of far-reaching eyes Views it without wavering,
It is said to be the measure of ultimate meditation.

As indicated by this, the awareness of higher insight views the vajra chains and through gradual familiarization trains in the stages of the four visionary appearances. The visionary appearance of the direct perception of reality opens the doors of pure realms. From that, the spheres mature into forms as one approaches the visionary appearance of the increase of meditative experience, which will result in the nirmāṇakāya. It will mature as the form of the saṃbhogakāya in the visionary appearance of awareness reaching full measure. Then, once all appearances are purified in the mandala of the single great essence sphere, whatever mentally designated phenomena there are will fall away and even the fixation on reality itself will fall away and one will behold the visionary appearance of the dharmakāya.[110] As it is taught in the Reverberation of Sound:
Seeing with the direct perception of reality Transcends the limits grasped by mental assumptions. The increase of appearances of meditative experience,
Eclipses deluded appearances and
Actualizes the pristine awareness of the intermediate state. The visionary appearance of awareness reaching full measure
Transcends the appearances of the path of realization of the three kāyas.
The visionary appearance of reality falling away
Cuts the continuity of cyclic existence in three realms.

The aids or props for reaching the full measure of the four visionary appearances are the three unwavering states of the body that nail the vital points, the three unwavering states of speech that clear the path, and the three unwavering states of mind that ripen into the maturity of fruition. These three [sets of three] unwavering states should be the foundation. The three restings of the body make one free of activity. Through the three restings of the energy currents one grasps the extent of the unborn. The three restings of appearance cause one to gain confidence in irreversibility. With these three [sets of three] restings[111] one grasps the extent, and if practice reaches its full measure, one attains control over birth and can actually benefit others. By attaining control over entrance [in basic space], one is enlightened with no defiled manifestation.[112] And by attaining control over the energy-mind, it is impossible to return to the three realms. Striking with the nail of these three attainments,[113] familiarity with that natural great completion becomes expansive and the four utter confidences are attained. The two lower kinds of utter confidence are the confidence of having no anxiety about the hot and cold sufferings of hell, and the confidence of no fear caused by the happiness and suffering of samsara. The two higher kinds of utter confidence are the confidence of having no hopes of attaining nirvana and the confidence of no exaltation over the qualities of buddhahood. Demonstrating the full liberation of these four confidences is total breakthrough.

This is the general system of the precious Kadam transmission lineage of the Great Lord, the Glorious Atīśa,[1] who possessed the three qualifications[2] and is famous throughout the earth. The Kadampa do the creation and completion practices of the four deities: Śākyamuni, the founder of the doctrine; Avalokiteśvara, the lord of love and compassion; Tārā, who clears away outer obstacles; and Acala (Akṣobhya), who clears away inner obstacles. Also the completion phases of those are first, the guide to the view; second, compassion pervading space; third, the five recollections; and fourth, the common and special six dharmas.
The media for expression are the Three Baskets or canonical collections of Vinaya, Sutra, and Abhidharma, and the subject matter is ethical discipline, meditative absorption, and wisdom, which comprise the three higher trainings.[3] These are practiced according to the sequence of the doctrine exactly as it is taught in the precious excellent speech of the Buddha, and not in word only.

Of the three Kadam traditions,[4] the holders of the tradition of esoteric instructions that descend from Puchungwa[5] particularly uphold what the exalted Tārā told the victor Dromtönpa:[6]
Remember the source of refuge, the guru. The body is the nature of the deity.
Through speech, continuously repeat the mantra. Consider each and every being as your parent.
Discern the emptiness of the abiding nature of mind. Once these five arise,
Purify all roots of virtue.
The topic of this instruction is the recollection of the five practices of the guru, deity, mantra, compassion, and emptiness. As an extension of that, the fifteen relative vital essences and the one ultimate vital essence—sixteen altogether—are integrated on the path. Those fifteen relative vital essences are five vital essences of the environment as support, six vital essences of the supported beings, including the gods, and the four vital essences of the root and lineage gurus.[7]

The system that combines into one the practices of the three traditions from the source texts, the spiritual instructions, and the esoteric instructions is called the stages of the path to awakening. While uniting the presentation of all the dharmas on the methods to attain enlightenment directly or indirectly, the root of the practice does not fall outside the two kinds of awakening mind (Skt. bodhicitta). Therefore, it is the very thing that an ordinary individual practices as the single initial stage. The combining of the esoteric instructions into the stages of the path is taught in the Ornament of True Realization,[8] where it says, “Śrāvakas who are seeking peace. ”
The author of the source text for these instructions is the single god of the Snow Ranges, the Glorious Great Lord Atīśa himself. He composed many of the sources for this tradition, but the one that is like the root of the total and complete body of the path is A Lamp for the Path to Awakening.[9] This primary text is said by the great learned masters of this tradition to be endowed with fourfold greatness: (1) It has the greatness of [inspiring the] realization that there is nothing contradictory in the doctrine, because it presents all the excellent speech of the Buddha from anything in the great or lesser vehicles as the path by which a single individual can attain enlightenment. (2) It has the greatness that all the excellent speech of the Buddha will arise as personal instructions, once one has found certainty in the vital points of this path. One need not accumulate the karma of rejecting the dharma by seeking the vital points of practice elsewhere, since the explanations of the sutras, tantras, and commentaries are the dharma. (3) It has the greatness that one will easily understand the entirety of the victors’ intentions based on this sacred esoteric instruction. (4) And it has the greatness of reversing the bad intelligence that thinks one should learn some parts of the excellent speech of the victors but that some are unnecessary. This great malpractice is automatically prevented by just knowing that these instructions teach the direct and indirect methods of enlightenment and that therefore one should practice them.[10]
This profound dharma tradition is also called “the stages of entering the doctrine,” “the stages of the path for three persons,” “the stages of the awakening path,” and “the aid to entering the great chariot.” To accomplish buddhahood, henceforth one only needs to enter into this great path tradition.
Having entered this dharma, in order to present it one must first correctly rely on a qualified virtuous spiritual mentor. This is the root of all paths and the source of all happiness. The way to do this was mentioned briefly above.[11]

Once one has received the instructions from a virtuous spiritual mentor and begins meditation on the stages of the path, if a genuine desire to find the meaning of one’s life arises then that is the inner inspiration for accomplishing it. In order to induce that, one meditates on the precious human life with its eight freedoms and ten endowments,[12] contemplating—by means of causes, examples, and numbers—how difficult it is to obtain. Then, if the attitude of pursuing this life is not reversed, an intense pursuit of the next world will not arise. So next one actively meditates on the impermanence of this fleeting body that has been obtained and how one will wander in bad existences after death. At this point, one will feel afraid of the sufferings of bad existences. When a genuine attitude of desiring release from cyclic existence is born, it will produce a heartfelt confidence in the qualities of the Three Jewels, who can provide a refuge from suffering. And so one will abide by the common vows of going for refuge. One’s previous impulsive pursuit of this life and lip service to the next life will be reversed, and the next life will take precedence while the activities of this life will become mere accessories. The fetters of the eight worldly concerns, such as pleasure in possession and displeasure in dispossession,[13] will be liberated in their own ground. With totally pure inspired faith,[14] the stages of the path for a person of small scope will be born in one’s mindstream. In the beginning one should meditate until this definitely becomes part of one’s being.

Not content with just that, one induces by many methods the faith that believes in karmic cause and effect, which is the basis of all positive action. With that stabilized, one exerts the effort to engage in virtue and reject nonvirtue, continually engaging the path of the four powers.[15] Then one contemplates again and again the general and specific problems of cyclic existence (Skt. saṃsāra) until one sees its defects. Once one recognizes that karma and afflictive emotion are the causes that produce cyclic existence, the attitude of genuine desire to eliminate them arises and one then pursues emancipation. That path entails the three trainings[16] in general and specifically the proper maintenance of whatever ethical discipline one has personally undertaken. If that is the case, then seeing the problems of cyclic existence will be the cause that produces the genuine attitude that desires the certainty of release from it. With that, one’s ethical discipline will be totally pure and the stages of the path of a person of medium scope will be born in one’s being. One should take up that practice and meditate.

Not content with even that previous stage, one must train in the third stage, the basis of the path to attaining buddhahood. One brings to mind [the thought], “Just as I have fallen into the ocean of existence, so too have all beings, all of whom have been my mothers [in many lifetimes].” In cultivating the awakening mind that has love and compassion as its root, one must exert oneself in whatever causes it to arise. Without that, practicing the six perfections and two phases[17] is like making a roof without a foundation. When some semblance of that experience arises to some degree, then the aspiring mind of awakening is reinforced in ceremony and one endeavors in its precepts. One should make the aspiring mind as stable as possible. Then, in listening to the great effectiveness of the bodhisattva conduct, one distinguishes between what to reject and what to engage and develops a desire to train in that. When that has arisen, the vows of engagement are taken in ceremony and one trains in the six perfections, which ripen one’s own mindstream, and the four means of attraction[18] and so on, which ripen the mindstreams of others. In particular, one should guard against the root downfalls even at the risk of one’s life and endeavor not to be tainted by the lesser and medium dissipations or infractions. If one is so tainted, one must make efforts to restore [the vows].
The last two perfections deserve special study. In becoming skilled in ways to maintain meditative stability, meditative absorption will be accomplished. One should do whatever it takes for a totally pure view of the two kinds of nonself [19] to arise in one’s mindstream. Once it is found and one settles into that view, the knowledge of how to maintain it is generated. This kind of meditative stability and wisdom together are termed calm abiding and higher insight.[20] Since there is no other angle besides these two, once one has taken the bodhisattva vows, they will happen within the training of those precepts.
By training in that way, one will always be engaged in tremendous benefit for oneself and others. The noble intention will be unwaveringly pure, and the stages of the path of a person of great scope will arise in one’s being. Meditate with great persistence in this purpose.

These paths, however, should not be separated. Meditation on the lower paths will increase one’s desire to attain the higher, and hearing of the higher should enhance one’s desire to accomplish the lower.
When meditating on them, after examining one’s thoughts, one must have an equitable attitude. If it seems that devotion to the spiritual mentor who guides one on such a path has diminished, it will cut off the roots of all good things, so one must strive at the ways of service. Similarly, if the strength of one’s enthusiasm for practice is weak, contemplate the freedoms and endowments, or if the strength of one’s attachment to the reality of this life increases, meditate mainly on impermanence and the problems of bad existences. If it appears that one has drifted past the limits of the avowed precepts that one holds, then emphasize meditation on karmic cause and effect. If weariness with cyclic existence is modest, then the pursuit of freedom will become mere verbiage, so think about the problems of cyclic existence. If one does not have the strength of intense conviction to work for the welfare of sentient beings no matter what, then the root of the mahayana will be severed, so cultivate the aspiring awakening mind and its causes. If, after one has taken on the vows of the heirs of the victors and learned the conduct, the fetters of fixating on attributes appear to be extremely strong, use rational consciousness to destroy the conceptual frame of reference that fixates on attributes and cultivate the emptiness that is like the sky and like illusion.[21] If it happens that one’s mind does not dwell on the visualization and becomes a slave to total distraction, cultivate mainly the aspect of abiding in onepointed concentration. So it has been taught by the previous masters. With these illustrations, even those situations that were not explained will be comprehensible. In short, it is taught that, without becoming partial, one needs to utilize everything appropriate to enhance virtue in one’s being.

The reason for the necessity of all the dharma spoken by the Buddha is that it is solely for accomplishing the welfare of sentient beings. That which can be accomplished is twofold: the temporary higher states and the ultimate definite goodness of liberation. From the full extent of the teachings, it is those included in the actual instructions for the person of lesser scope or in the cycles of dharma in common with it that are intended for the accomplishment of the first. What distinguishes a person of lesser scope is that he or she pursues the abundance of higher states in the next life without putting much emphasis on this life, and practices to accomplish the causes of that. It states in A Lamp for the Path:[22]
Know that those who by whatever means Seek for themselves only
The pleasures of cyclic existence Are persons of lesser scope.
There are two kinds of definite goodness: emancipation that is merely liberation from samsara, and the state of omniscience. From the full extent of the teachings, it is those included in the actual teachings for the person of medium scope or in the cycles of dharma in common with it that are intended for the vehicles of śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha.[23] A person of medium scope is one who has given rise to weariness with the whole of existence and makes the emancipation of personal liberation from existence the goal. To that end, such a person engages the methods of the three trainings. In A Lamp for the Path[24] it says:
Those who seek peace for themselves alone, Turning away from worldly pleasures
And avoiding negative actions Are said to be of medium scope.
There are two methods for accomplishing omniscience: the mahayana of the perfections and of secret mantra. Those are both included in the dharma cycle of the person of great scope. A person of great scope is one who is compelled by great compassion to eliminate all the suffering of sentient beings and therefore makes buddhahood the goal. Therefore such a person trains in the six perfections and the two phases of creation and completion, and so on. From A Lamp for the Path:[25]
Those who, through their personal suffering, Truly want to genuinely exhaust
All the suffering of others Are superior persons.
It is for such individuals who attain awakening by both the methods of the perfections and mantra that they were taught.

In general, this classification into three kinds of person is mentioned often in the Summary of Ascertainment[26] and the commentary to the Abhidharma Treasure[27] and so on.
There are two kinds of person of small scope: those who are dedicated to this life and those dedicated to the next life. Here, it is the second one. Moreover, it is one who has actually entered the unerring methods for attaining the higher states. Therefore, it is held that the entire extent of the well-spoken word of the Buddha is included in this path that applies the three attitude stages of individuals.
Here, we speak of three kinds of person, but since the other two are included in the path of the great person, Master Aśvaghoṣa[28] stated that those two are branches of the mahayana path. This being so, while not guiding people in the path of the person of small scope whose goal is the attainment of just mundane happiness, nor in the path of the person of medium scope whose goal is the attainment of their own mere emancipation from cyclic existence, some have made the paths common to those two a preliminary for the teaching of the path of a person of great scope. By making them branches of the training of the path of the great person, there occurs a further arrangement into common and uncommon paths that one should know.
If one thinks, however, that it is sufficient only to do the stage of the path of a person of great scope, there are two great necessities for guidance that distinguish each of the three kinds of persons. One is to conquer the arrogance of claiming for oneself the status of a great person in whom the attitude shared with those of small or medium scope has not arisen. Second is that there is great benefit in all three attitudes, from best to least.

Concerning the need to develop one’s attitude by stages, the protector Nāgārjuna advised giving guidance in the paths of higher states and definite goodness by stages:[29]
First the teachings of the higher states, Afterwards, definite goodness occurs.
That is because after attaining higher states, Definite goodness will come by stages.
Also Noble Asaṅga said:[30]
And in order that bodhisattvas might bring about by stages the perfect accomplishment of what is virtuous, they first present the simple dharma to those sentient beings that have childlike intelligence, and simple instructions and follow-up teachings that engage them. Once the bodhisattvas realize that the students have come to posses medium intelligence, they present medium dharma and medium instructions and follow-up teachings that engage them. After the bodhisattvas realize that they now posses vast intelligence, they present the profound dharma and subtle instructions and follow-up teachings that engage them. This, then, is how the conduct for the welfare of those beings falls into order.
And in the Lamp Summary [of Conduct], Āryadeva states:[31]
After first training in the ideas of the vehicle of the perfections, one should practice the necessary stages for engaging the mantra. To summarize the meaning of that:
For sentient beings with the karma of beginners To enter the ultimate truth,
This method was taught by the perfect Buddha Like the steps of a ladder.

The meditation subject at the root of the path of a person of great scope, which is the ultimate end of the three stages of the path, is relative awakening mind and the meditative absorptions of love and compassion. The enhancements are the types of mind training instructions of exchanging oneself for others. Furthermore, all of the guiding instructions that came directly from Lord Dromtönpa have also become special branches of the stages of the path to awakening.
As for mind training, the quintessence of the practices is found in Entering the Way [of the Bodhisattva],[32] the Compendium of Trainings,[33] and so forth. The meaning is summarized in experiential guides such as those of the more famous Indian source texts composed by the three gurus of Lord Atīśa, such as Guru Dharmarakṣita’s Wheel of Sharp Weapons and Peacock Overcoming Poison,[34] Maitriyogin’s Vajra Song of Conquering Self-Fixation,[35] and Serlingpa’s Smashing Down Concepts and Eighteen Dharmas to Integrate on the Path.[36] There is also Ja Chekawa Yeshé Dorjé’s Condensed into Seven Points,[37] and other instruction guides such as the Great Stages of the Doctrine[38] and the Kadampa’s Hidden Guide.[39]

The mighty yogin Virūpa[1] personally practiced the completion phase of the Hevajra Tantra Trilogy[2] and formulated the source text of the esoteric instruction possessed of four transmissions and authentic qualities called the Precious Excellent Words of the Path with Its Result.[3] This is the indisputable king of the completion phases of this cycle of tantras, the great path tradition as famous as the sun and moon. For that reason there exist an endless number of manuals and explanatory systems about these teachings by many learned and accomplished individuals, such as the Yellow Volume of Jetsun Drakpa.[4] Nevertheless, the summarized meaning of these very instructions that Lord Sachen[5] gave to Gyura Aseng[6] was the first Tibetan source text and seems to be like the root of the teaching. Therefore at this occasion also we will draw out the meaning somewhat in a combined summary of the essential points in keeping with this source.

The three appearances (snang ba gsum) are the impure appearance, the appearances of yogic experience, and pure appearance. Each of those has three further divisions through which it can be known: the cause of that appearance, the individual to whom that appearance arises, and the essential nature of that appearance itself. This provides the foundation of the path.
The impure appearance encompasses the problems of cyclic existence, the freedoms and endowments of human life that are difficult to obtain, and the belief in karmic cause and effect. Meditation on these three subjects delineates the path that is held in common with the śrāvakas.[8]
The appearance of yogic experience encompasses both those of common and uncommon yogins. Common yogins give birth to common experiences in their mindstreams. The meditations that give rise to them are the three meditations of love, compassion, and the awakening mind.
Uncommon yogins give birth to the conviction that experiences will happen. The meditations that give rise to that are knowing that once one has entered the profound path of vajrayāna and meditated, unimaginable visionary experiences will arise and that all of them are subsumed into fifteen.[9] This knowledge cuts through all doubts. Then at some point when those experiences arise they are maintained just as they occur by means of recognizing them individually.
The pure appearance encompasses recollection of the unimaginable qualities of a buddha, such as the ornamental wheel of inexhaustible body, [speech, and mind], and thinking “I too will become like that,” thus engendering exceptional enthusiasm in meditation. In short, once one has thoroughly refined one’s being through the vehicle of the perfections, making oneself a suitable vessel for the path of the vajrayāna determines the foundation. Therefore, this path of three appearances is shared with the path of the perfections.[10]

The view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana is maintained in the causal continuum of the universal ground.[11] As the method continuum of the body, one meditates on the path in connection with the four empowerments.[12] Ultimately, in the result continuum, the qualities of the five kāyas and five pristine awarenesses arise.[13] This is a way to know all vajrayāna practice without exception through the threefold division of ground, path, and result.
First, the causal continuum: For those who have refined their mindstream through the vehicle of the perfections and been moved by great compassion, the quickest path to enlightenment is indeed the vajrayāna. However, if one wonders whether or not one has the good fortune to practice it, one does have it. To wit:
Depending on cause, family, renunciations, and conditions, Individuals are posited according to four aspects.[14]
Certainty is created with these thoughts: Because in general all sentient beings have the cause, buddha nature; because, in particular, from the perspective of the proximity of accomplishment, they fall into the defi- nite family of one of the five buddha families determined by means of color, shape, and so on; because whatever afflictive emotion to be abandoned is greatest in them determines their definite buddha family;[15] and because due to conditions they definitely fall into the two types—less fortunate gradual realizers and fortunate instantaneous realizers—nevertheless both of them will ultimately be suitable to practice the vajrayāna. That is the practice of the causal continuum. The method continuum is the ripening empowerment and meditation on the two phases[16] of the liberating path. The result continuum is the ultimate result, the attainment of the five kāyas and five pristine awarenesses.
In this way all of the practices of the secret mantra without exception can be understood in the context of these three—ground, path, and result—because there is no secret mantra teaching that is not included therein.
Again, if one takes the two phases as the main methods, then the causal continuum would be to receive the empowerment and make oneself a worthy vessel for meditation on the path, and the method continuum would be the meditation on the two phases of the path. The result continuum would be the attainment of the five kāyas that result from that.

The term “cutting through doubts” (spros pa gcod) should be applied to this [understanding of authenticity]. The four authentic qualities are stated in the Sampuṭa:[17]
Through authenticity of treatise, the master,
Adherence to scripture, and awareness of immanent suchness,
The secret meaning and its entity
Should be known from the lineage of one-to-one, Received from the mouth of the sublime guru.
To lay the meaning of this out in stages: Because the authenticity of the scripture (lung) of the authentic word (bka’) of the sugata occurred first, it is the authenticity of scripture. Based on that, the treatise emerged [proclaiming that] the limit of an entity is interdependent origination, so it is the authenticity of the narrative (lo rgyus). Since those instructions are taught by the guru, it is the authenticity of the esoteric instructions of all the vajra guru masters. Since those must be brought into practice just as they were taught, what ascertains the first three authentic qualities is the meditation experience of the yogin himor herself authentically following them.[18] As for the order of practicing those, first one must practice the authenticity of the guru, as Jetsun Drakpa Gyaltsen said:[19]
At first, to establish the authenticity of the guru, meditate until devotion in the guru is deeply felt.
Then, one must put into practice the teachings of that guru for authentic experience. Those [two stages] accomplish the intention of the mighty yogin, which is the authentic treatise. And the supreme one of all authentic qualities that achieves the Buddha’s intention is the authentic scripture.
The essence of the four authentic qualities is that since exceptional conviction arises in oneself, nothing else has the power to steal one’s interest. The way that they cut through doubts is in the causal continuum (of the three continua), [that is, by affecting] the afflictive emotion that is the cause of the six types of beings, and the resulting six types of beings.[20]
Furthermore, the way that the four authentic qualities ascertain all the experiences of path and result should be learned from the explanations of the source text.[21]

It is said that all doubts about the instruction are cut through by means of the four authentic qualities and the four transmissions as soon as they are explained. The four transmissions are (1) undiminished river of empowerment, (2) unimpaired lineage of blessing, (3) unmistaken sequence[22] of instruction, and (4) a satisfied attitude through devotion. The first of those four has three parts: the undiminished nature of empowerment at the time of the cause, at the time of the path, and at the time of the result.
Second, secret mantra is endowed with four culminations (mtha’ ): it is the culmination of practice, the culmination of meditative experience, the culmination of blessing, and the culmination of accomplishment.
Third, when gathering the constituents[23] through the three ways of gathering, one must know them to be one’s path and interdependent connection, just as one knows that even a dangerous, narrow bridge that is difficult to cross is indeed one’s path when [chased by] the manifestation of obstacles such as marauding cannibal-demons or when experiences of fear and terror arise.
Fourth, since those experiences also befell one just as the guru had taught when saying, “things like this will happen,” an exceptional conviction arises and one develops an irreversible belief that the guru is a buddha.
As for the manner of cutting through doubts, those practices of the three continua that were presented above must be possessed of the four transmissions. If any one of these four is missing, then the instructions of this tradition will not be wholly complete. Those four, furthermore, are based on the transmission of the guru ancestors. This is the way to be certain.

There are five interdependent connections (rten ’brel ). The outer interdependent connection is obvious external appearances such as [those produced by] the reversal of energy currents and visual appearances. The inner interdependent connection is making the emanating and gathering of energy-mind in the palaces of the channel syllables.[24] The secret interdependent connection is the actualization of the four mandalas, such as the constituent elixir mandala, in the transcendent path. As for the suchness interdependent connection, on the first spiritual level and above, the outer signs arise in the vital essence drops, the inner signs arise in the energy currents, and the signs of suchness arise as qualities in the mind. The ultimate interdependent connection is the dissolution of the four pulsations[25] at the thirteenth level.
The way those five demarcate the path is that the first two interdependent connections demarcate the worldly path and the last three demarcate the transcendent path. Alternatively, the outer interdependent connection demarcates the path of accumulation, the inner interdependent connection demarcates the path of application, the secret interdependent connection demarcates the path of seeing, the suchness interdependent connection demarcates the path of meditation, and the ultimate interdependent connection demarcates the path of no more training.
In regard to this, each of these five—the three appearances and so on—present a complete perfect path to enlightenment. That is because they each present the Path with Its Result common to samsara and nirvana. Or, adding these five together, it presents a single complete perfect path. A single individual on the path to enlightenment requires these four: establishing the basis of the path, the main body of the path, cutting through the doubts about the path, and demarcating the path. Therefore they were presented in due order.
Even though each of the five presents a complete perfect path, there is a need to teach all five. The path of the three appearances is taught because it is explained that “all phenomena of samsara and nirvana are set forth as the arising of three appearances in three different circumstances.” The path of three continua is taught in order to understand that “all phenomena are included in the single continuity of one’s own mind.” The four authentic qualities are taught because the path is quickly traversed with the arising of exceptional conviction. The path of the four transmissions is taught in order to understand that a single individual’s enlightenment is based on the exceptional transmission of the guru ancestors. And the path of five interdependent connections is taught in order to understand that to traverse the levels to buddhahood through the path of vajrayāna, the five interdependent connections must be complete and in alignment.

The three ways of gathering the constituents are (1) those with karmic propensity gather their own constituents by themselves, (2) those with devotion gather the constituents through blessing, and (3) those with diligence gather the constituents through exerted effort. When applied to those with karmic propensity, the seven impartials are that (1) the impartial awakening of the karmic propensity (2) leads to the impartial reversal of the energy currents, (3) leading to the impartial blazing of the fire of inner heat, (4) leading to the impartial opening of the channels, (5) leading to the impartial gathering of the constituents, (6) leading to the impartial occurrence of dissipating clairvoyance, (7) which leads to the impartial arising of nondissipating clairvoyance. Applying those seven in a similar way to devotion and to diligence, it makes twenty-one.
Moreover, when the gathering of the constituents occurs in ordinary individuals, those lacking the esoteric instruction might depreciate it by saying, “it is not the gathering of the constituents,” or might exaggerate by saying, “it was done by bad spirits.” But if one understands these three ways of gathering, one will become free of those deprecations and exaggerations.

The three modes of mental abiding are the mental abiding through reversing the energy currents, the mental abiding through self-blessing of energy-mind, and the mental abiding through combining together with the support.[27] These three aspects of reversing the energy currents, and so on, arise appropriately from residual karma, devotion, or diligence as described above. From that, physical experiences, mental experiences, and so on cause unimaginable meditative absorptions to arise. Therefore, the reversal of the energy currents, and so on, should be known as the immediate direct cause and the residual karma, and so on, as the indirect cause.

Of the three kinds of meditation experience, body experiences are the leaping and jumping, and so forth, that occur due to the force of meditation causing the energy currents to be reversed inwards. Mind experiences are experiences of dread and despair, desire, and aggression, and so on that occur due to having hit the vital point of the channel syllables. Dream experiences are to dream of horses and other expressions of natural movement due to hitting the vital point of energy currents. Those lacking esoteric instruction explain the discomfort of the body and the suffering of the mind and such that occur as the normal course of afflictive emotions. Dream experiences are explained as normal dreams and are not known to be meditative absorption. But in this tradition, whatever arises as the three experiences coming from the gathering and projecting of energy-mind is known exclusively as meditative absorption.

There is guidance by energy currents, guidance by constituent elixir, and guidance by channel syllables. They are called the three modes of guiding that are like a captain. The experience that is born from that guidance is the gathering of the constituents. At the first gathering, there is great discomfort of the channels and energy currents. At the middle, the discomfort diminishes. At the final gathering, one is free of discomfort and gains the ability to dispel harmful conditions, such as the physical disturbance from the elements and so forth. These are the particular experiences of being guided by energy currents. At the first gathering, the meditative absorption is unclear and unstable. At the middle, it is clear and more stable. At the final gathering, there is no difference between formal meditation and post-meditation, and one cannot be affected by external conditions. These are the particular experiences of being guided by constituent elixir. At the first gathering, indefinite deluded appearances arise, evoking dread and despair. At the middle, indefinite visual appearances arise, experiences and visual appearances of the six realms. Finally, the very definite lucid appearances arise, causing one to think that the experiences of meditative absorptions up to the pinnacle of existence have occurred. These are the particular experiences of being guided by the channel syllables. In this way, those three different meditative experiences come about from the three individual modes of guidance, and one should know the particular distinctions.
These three modes of guidance on the path are demarcated by the three gatherings of the constituents on the worldly path and by the four culminations of accomplishment on the transcendent path. Although these two ways certainly occur, here I have explained by simply applying the three gatherings.

This is how the demarcations are known by applying three examples to the three gatherings: At the first gathering of the constituents, the force of meditation causes the energy currents to go to all the vital points of the channels. This slightly loosens the channel knots, causing discomfort in the channels and energy. It is like the example of the winter wind with its sharp biting edge. At the middle gathering, the knots are loosened more and the energy-mind becomes slightly limpid, quieting the discomfort of the channel energy. For example, it is like the diminished sharpness of the spring winds. At the final gathering, the channel knots are more and more loosened and the energy-mind becomes very limpid, producing the many qualities of meditative absorption. The example is the wind in summer, free of its biting edge. In this way, when there is great discomfort in the channel energy, the quieting of discomfort, and the occurrence of boundless qualities of meditative absorption, one knows undoubtedly that one has arrived at the first, middle, and final stages of gathering in order.

The three interdependent connections are the interdependent connection of reversing the energy currents, the interdependent connection of visual appearances, and the interdependent connection of dreams. The first is when the energy currents are reversed inwards due to the force of meditation, causing the body to jump and leap and so forth.
The second has three parts. The visual appearances associated with the body’s channels are visions such as mountain cliffs, due to the energymind entering the constrictions of the thirty-two knots in the right and left channels.[31] The visual appearances associated with the channel syllables are visions such as the six realms, due to the energy-mind gathering in the syllables of the six realms. The visual appearances associated with the constituent elixir are visions such as the five buddha families, due to the elixir’s quintessence gathering together into the heart-syllable bhrum, and others.
Third, the interdependent connection of dream is when those visions as the primary cause and the state of sleep as the condition make those visions occur in dreams.
What causes those three interdependent connections to occur are the physical channels, the channel syllables, the constituent elixir, and the energy currents. Those are all contained as part of one’s own body and do not depend on any external causes and conditions. Therefore, one does not hope for the spiritual power of seeing visual appearances of buddhas and such, or fear obstacles such as being attacked by cannibal-demons. Recollecting that all the causes—the energy-mind— are complete in one’s own body frees one from hopes and fears.

What type of person is afflicted by obstructions or obstacles? There are two kinds of yogins who fall into the partiality of either method or wisdom, and one yogin of total integration. Of these three, it is the first two types that can be afflicted with obstacles, but not the last.
Thus, a yogin who is partial to skillful methods has four obstacles and eight protections from them. The four obstacles are (1) on entering the path, there is the obstacle of worldly concerns; (2) once having entered it, there is the obstacle of external devils; (3) when the mind is somewhat stabilized, the devils’ increasing force is an obstacle; and (4) when there is great stability, there is the obstacle of not recognizing meditative absorption. The eight protections are, for the first obstacle, (1) firm faith. For the second obstacle, (2) protection circles, (3) repetition of mantra, and (4) mantra knots. For the third obstacle, since (5) all phenomena are the appearance of mind itself, and (6) mere reflections, (7) they are never divorced from the nature of the ocean of suchness. And for the fourth obstacle, (8) the knowledge of the dependent nature of interdependent connections. Those eight protect the practitioner.
The four obstacles for those who are partial to wisdom are (1) the obstacle of generating experiences and suffering, (2) the obstacle of manifested forms, (3) the obstacle of uttered sounds, and (4) the obstacle of changing views and tenets. The eight protections are that when those four are done by external devils, one is protected by the four tests[32] as the antidotes, and when done by internal devils, they are averted by the symbols of the four empowerments.

The fourteen common protections are protection against the six contaminations,[33] the six emissions of vital essence,[34] and the two obscurations.[35] Concerning the seventy great vital points of clearing away obstructions, it is said in the Summary:[36]
For discomfort in the channels, total release is most valuable,
Discomfort in the energy currents is averted by reinforcement.
For paralysis of energy currents, the three aspects of
Total release, blessing, and bliss meditation are taught.
Total release for discomfort in the channels is to direct the consciousness to the place where it occurs, and by drilling the awareness into it, it is pacified. Reinforcement for discomfort in the energy currents is to inhale the energy current inside and press down on its location. When it seems to become impossible, one inhales again and presses. There are three methods of fixing paralysis of the energy currents. Total release is the same as above. There are six kinds of blessing: (1) the blessing of the holy guru, (2) the blessing of the favored deity, (3) the blessing of the outer and inner ḍākinīs, (4) the blessing of the mahayana sutras and profound tantras, (5) the blessing of the variety of appearance, and (6) the blessing of profound interdependent connection. Two kinds of bliss meditation are taught: based on the upper waves of enjoyment and based on the lower secret union.
The six instructions for dispelling obstructions are, in relation to the view, (1) meditation on expelling poison, (2) relying on elixir, and (3) directed attention. In relation to meditative stability, they are (4) the meditation on expelling poison, (5) relying on elixir, and (6) total release. These can be learned in detail from the explanations of the source text in the section on the six instructions.
Removing obstruction with the mandala circle refers to uniting with the supreme bliss-emptiness of the blazing, wavering, and stabilizing of the vital essence by means of the path of the mandala circle. As stated in the Summary:[37]
Vital essence blazes and wavers and stabilizes,
These three aspects produce bliss-emptiness supreme. Discomfort in the vital essences occurs during blazing— Joining [the energy currents] it is stabilized.
The four animal movements reverse it,
And the waverings of vital essence in the body are stopped. In order to suffuse it everywhere and stabilize it,
Rotate the body like a pestle and
Throw the energy lasso with the four limbs. The conduct of a small child stabilizes it.
Thus it is taught that these methods will remove however many obstructions there are on the path and bring supreme spiritual powers.

To summarize the points of the practice in the instructions on the Path with Its Result, once one has been made into a worthy vessel in the four empowerments, such as the vase empowerment, one meditates on the four paths, such as the creation phase. From this, the four views arise, such as the three essential natures, on the worldly path. On the transcendent path, one reaches the four culminations of accomplishment. Thus, these eight views and culminations summarize the necessity for meditation on the path.
The four views are as follows: (1) the view of the vase empowerment in connection with meditation on the mandala is the three aspects of the essence—the experiences of the apparent aspect, the empty aspect, and the union aspect—which are primarily the experiences of nonconceptuality. These three each possess three characteristics: they are reality (chos nyid, Skt. dharmatā) free of mental imputation, a relative nature (chos can, dharmin) that has no connection to ignorance, and different facets of that singular essence.
(2) The view of the secret empowerment is the four naturally occurring pristine awarenesses in which clarity is primary. Due to the interdependent connection of some of the particular channel energies and vital essences dissolving in the central channel, a semblance of intense afflictive emotion appears. This is the pristine awareness on the path of naturally occurring afflictive emotion. A semblance of intense discursive thought is the pristine awareness of naturally occurring discursive thought. The appearance of a mixture of lofty and lowly experiences is the pristine awareness of naturally occurring mixed-up blankness.[38] The arising of the pristine awareness of clarity-emptiness without center or limit is the great naturally occurring pristine awareness of the path, luminous and light.
(3) The view of the empowerment of wisdom is the four joys in descending sequence, in which bliss is primary. This becomes sixteenfold when each is subdivided from the point of view of place, time, what is to be abandoned, and the essential nature.

(4) The view of the fourth empowerment is the four joys in ascending sequence, in which nondual bliss-emptiness is primary. These are the epitome of the result that is in accord with the cause, the fully ripened result, the results of human actions, and the result of freedom.
The four culminations of attainment are the ultimate results of attainment from meditation on the paths of the four empowerments. From the first through the sixth spiritual level, the culmination of attainment of the vase empowerment is called “the inseparability of samsara and nirvana” (’khor ’das dbyer med ) because it is mainly the wisdom of realization of the equality of samsara and nirvana. From the seventh up to the tenth level, the culmination of attainment of the secret empowerment is unmixed and completely perfect, in which the individual mastery of the four correct awarenesses [enables one] to teach the dharma without mixing it up, in harmony with the ideas and language of each sentient being. At the eleventh and twelfth levels, the culmination of attainment of the wisdom empowerment is bliss-emptiness of lesser extent, because the range of bliss-emptiness is measurable. At the lower half of the thirteenth level, the culmination of attainment of the fourth empowerment is called bliss-emptiness of greater extent because the range of pristine awareness is immeasurable due to the ability of moment-by-moment awareness to pervade all that is inanimate and animate.
To summarize all the methods for dispelling obstructions: knowing that faults such as the afflictive emotions and so on are one’s path and auspicious connection, they are taken as the eight qualities.[39] Gathering the energy-mind in the syllable ksha in the navel, the forms of obstacles such as being attacked by cannibal-demons are taken as spiritual powers. In a manner such as this—without hope to see buddhas and such, and without fear of being afraid and terrified and such—just knowing that everything is the appearance of experience naturally liberates evil and obstruction.

The results of accomplishing such a path are as follows: By dissolving the four pulsations of outer and inner interdependent connections, one will reach the culmination of attainment on the transcendent path of the spinning wheel. The entire variety of greatness for oneself is perfected. When the support, the four mandalas, is transformed then the universal ground itself, the supported, is also transformed. Then the stains along with their habitual patterns are permanently abandoned and the five kāyas—the four kāyas and the extremely pure and obscuration-free svabhāvikakāya—are actualized. The uncommon transformation is that the physical channels transform into the nirmāṇakāya, the channel syllables into saṃbhogakāya, the constituent elixir into dharmakāya and great bliss, and the core energy current of pristine awareness transforms into the svabhāvikakāya.
At that time, without wavering from the state of the equalness of space and pristine awareness, there occurs the greatness for others: the unceasing activity for whoever needs to be tamed according to the constitution, capability, and interest of each being. The greatness for both self and others is to become enlightened together with the entourage as one group.
In short, the practice of the three appearances provides the foundation of the path, the three continua make up the main body of practice, the four authentic qualities and the four transmissions clear up doubts about practice, and the five interdependent connections demarcate the path. During practice, when one knows the points of the three gatherings of constituents and has become skilled in the seven beneficial esoteric instructions and in the area of dispelling obstructions, if one practices one will reach the culmination of accomplishment. This is the way of guidance in the extensive path.

To condense that into the middling path, there are five topics with their subdivisions: What causes the birth of meditative absorption, what the meditative absorption is, its benefits, dispelling obstructing phenomena, and how to measure the levels of the path. Since there are no vajra lines concerning this, it is known as the “Path and Result without Root” (rtsa ba med pa’i lam ’bras).
Bestowal of the prediction of practice and the application of the basic words of its own source text[40] [to the three continua], application of them to the path, application of them to the esoteric instructions for common practice, and the application of them to the result is the concise path.
There are what are known as the four great pillars of the path for the practice of those paths and for the generation of successful realization and the five dharmas for the birth of realization. Of those, the four great pillars are to lead according to the source text, to lead by six vital esoteric instructions, to lead by eleven vital esoteric instructions, and to lead by means of the three faculty levels: superior, moderate, and inferior.[41] Of those, here we have been discussing the system of guidance according to the source text, which is currently the most famous tradition of guidance.
These profound instructions are famous as being the completion phase of the Hevajra Tantra. They are not found, however, in the words of the actual teaching of that tantra. They do appear in the very clear exposition in the same terms in the early translations of the Heruka Galpo Tantra,[42] the fragmentary section of the Rampant Elephant Tantra,[43] and the Stainless Confession King Tantra.[44] Therefore, it is actually the same kind of system as in the general highest yoga completion phases of the two traditions of the six dharmas.

These three stages were taught in the amazing vajra lines that have the power to summarize the entire meaning of the tantras of highest yoga. The glorious Nāropa and his spiritual heirs in the Kagyu lineage taught these instructions in their essential, eloquent explanations.

The former text states:[6]
The abiding nature of things is twofold:
The abiding manner of mind and of body.
In this way there are the two: the abiding nature of the mind and the abiding nature of the body. These texts also explain each of those two as threefold:[7]
Know that coarse, subtle, and very subtle
Are their common and inseparable stages.

The abiding nature of the mind is explained by Ronyam Dorjé, the student of Lord Marpa’s student,[8] as follows:
The abiding nature of mind-itself is presented as threefold. It involves the pristine awareness of three lights.
Its inherent nature is explained as the essence of the coarse aspect. The emptiness of everything, taught as the fourth emptiness,
Is the subtle aspect, and the very subtle aspect Is manifest awakening, the mind of awakening.
The three lights[9] manifest in a progressive order from pure mind. The coarse mind evolves from that, possessing the eighty natural conceptions.[10] After the reverse progression of the three lights has stopped and everything dwells only in emptiness, it is the subtle mind. The ultimate mind of awakening that is free of fixation on the characteristics of the emptiness experience, named “manifest awakening” (mngon par byang chub), is luminous clarity. It is explained as the very subtle mind.
Therefore, the mind that is referred to as the stained causal continuum (rgyu’i rgyud ) is the subtle aspect, and the stainless causal continuum is the very subtle aspect of mind.

In a similar way, the three of the body are described in the same source:
The abiding nature of the body is ascertained To be coarse, subtle, and very subtle.
All the aggregates, constituents, and sense fields
That have the inherent nature of the support and supported Mandalas of deities are ascertained to be coarse.
The channels, energy currents, and bodhicitta Are ascertained to be essentially subtle.
The single bliss existing in the support and supported— That coemergence is taught as the very subtle.
The coarse body is that physical impure body of aggregates, constituents, and sense fields that is the object of refinement into emptiness during the initial stage of creation phase meditation. The subtle body is the channels, energy currents, and vital essences that are accomplished as the deities of the mandalas of Body, Speech, and Mind.[11] The very subtle body is the native body that is inalienable from the coemergent three vajras or three kāyas at the time of fruition.
How are these the bases of refinement? The coarse is the imputed basis of refinement, the subtle is the short-term basis of refinement, and the very subtle body is the ultimate basis of refinement.
Of those, the meaning of the latter may be summarized by saying that the abiding nature of the mind is luminous clarity by nature, unrestricted, undivided, and free of all elaboration—the realm of reality (chos dbyings; dharmadhātu). The Liberative Essence[12] describes this same thing as inseparable profundity and clarity.[13] Native mind and the naturally abiding affinity (rigs) are also this very thing. The nature of this has already been mentioned many times.[14]

As for the abiding nature of the body, [the Hevajra Tantra] says:[15]
In the great bliss of the yogini’s bhaga[16]
The Teacher with thirty-two major marks,
And endowed with eighty minor marks,
Is present in the aspect called “seminal fluid.”
Without that, bliss would be lost. [Without bliss, that becomes naught.][17] Because it lacks capability, it is dependent. Bliss comes from deity yoga.
This itself is not the thing of buddhas.[18] Nor is it a manner of non-thing.
It has the form of faces and arms—
The form of sublime unchanging bliss.[19] Therefore all beings are coemergent.
The term “seminal fluid” (khu ba) refers to what is produced from relative awakening mind (byang sems; bodhicitta),[20] the quintessence of the channels, energy currents, and vital essences that is the apparent support of sublime unchanging bliss. Being beyond the reality of atoms, it is the essence of pristine awareness. This is the native body itself. The victor Rangjung Dorjé[21] explains:
Channels, energy currents, and vital essences are interdependently originated, arising from the appearances of mind.[22] Those appearances are produced from relative bodhicitta. Since [those channels, etc.] become the support for coemergent pristine awareness, they are taught as the abiding nature of the vajra body.
Concerning that, the Seventh Lord [Karmapa Chödrak Gyatso][23] said that the innate nature, lacking the stains of the eight groups of consciousness, abides as the four kāyas and is the fully developed affinity without a beginning in time. This is the same vital point as the position taken by lord Rangjung.
In this way the abiding nature of these two—body and mind—is impossible to separate, like water from ice. So it is called the union of two kāyas at the time of the ground. This itself has the capacity to be clarified as direct [valid cognition of] reflexive awareness[24] only on the strength of meditation, and not by any other means. That is because, as it occurs [in the Highest Continuum]:[25]
There is nothing at all to remove,
And not the slightest thing to be added. Look genuinely at the genuine.
When genuinely seen, it is total liberation.

In general, there are two types of path: ripening and liberating. The path of liberation has both creation and completion phases. Completion phase is further divided into with and without characteristics, or skillful methods and liberation, and so on. All of these are described above or below in this text. Here, it is time for the explanation of the completion phase paths of skillful methods and liberation and, more specifically, the path of skillful methods known as the Six Dharmas of Nāropa. On what tantras are these completion phases based? The past gurus have said:
These instructions are based on the father tantra Guhyasamāja, the mother tantra Mahāmāyā, the essence Hevajra, the quintessence Cakrasaṃvara, and the oath-bound guardian Catuḥpīṭha.[26]
The statement that these instructions are based on these exceptional five great root tantras and their concordant tantras and branches is just an approximation. In fact, these instructions are the ultimate completion phase of the entirety of tantric mahāyoga and especially of the nondual tantras. The following reasons were posited by Mikyö Dorjé[27] and his spiritual heirs:
It is because the cycle of father tantras such as Guhyasamāja
contain very extensive presentations on the energy currents and clearly teach the instructions on illusory body and luminous clarity; the mother tantra cycles of Cakrasaṃvara and Hevajra contain very extensive presentations on the channels and vital essences and clearly teach the yogas of inner heat and actionmudra; the yogas of dream and intermediate state come from the Vajraḍāka Tantra,[28]Saṃvara Origin Tantra,[29] and others; the Sampuṭa, Catuḥpīṭha, and so on clearly teach the instructions on transference; and especially, the root and condensed tantras of the nondual Kālacakra Tantra[30] and the Trilogy of Bodhisattva Commentaries[31] give very extensive and clear presentations on all three—channels, energy currents, and vital essences—and on the yogas of inner heat, action-mudra, and so forth.
The root scripture for this is the teaching of the pristine awareness ḍākinī, Perfect Words [Esoteric Instructions of the Ḍākinī].[32] Marpa composed commentaries on the meaning of its secret words. The main sources are those composed by Telo and Naro, such as the ones known as the former and latter Authoritative Texts on Six Dharmas.[33] There appeared about thirty such major and minor indisputable Indian works that form the main source of these teachings. Then there is the related authentic supportive literature from the dharma cycle of the Cakrasaṃvara Hearing Lineage, such as The Vajra Lines of the Hearing Lineage[34] and The Four Scrolls of the Hearing [Lineage].[35]

There are differences in the positions of the former masters as to the classification and summary of these instructions. Those of Lama Ngokpa[36] et al. summarize the essence of the six dharmas into mixing and transference according to Nāropa’s Eight Verses:[37]
The intermediate states of birth and death, dream, And the intermediate state of existence remain three,[38]
But in practice are subsumed into two: mixing and transference. Mixing is the means for awakening through meditation,
And transference is the method of awakening without meditation.
Thus they can be called lineage instructions of the “three illusions” (sgyu ma gsum) or the two instructions for “mixing and transference” (bsre ’pho). Lord Marpa’s Stream of Elixir[39] groups them in sets of four or eight:
Inner heat and illusory body are for awakening through meditation. Transference and action-mudra are awakening even without meditating. Dream and luminous clarity are for awakening by sleeping. Intermediate state and mahāmudrā are for awakening through knowing the intrinsic nature.
From Lord Milarepa we have “introducing the eight intermediate states.” In the Eight Lines, Tebupa[40] posits eight practices in four pairs:
Inner heat and action-mudra: two. Dream and intermediate state: two. Luminous clarity and union: two. Transference and entrance: two.
Lord Rechungpa[41] listed “three cycles of mixing or nine cycles of mixing and transference”:
(1) Inner heat mixes passion with great bliss.
(2) Illusory body mixes aggression with the lack of valid existence.
(3) Luminous clarity mixes stupidity with nonthought.
(4) Mixing inner heat and illusory body is daytime meditation.
(5) Mixing dream and luminous clarity is the nighttime meditation.
(6) Mixing intermediate state and transference is the deathtime meditation.
(7) Inner heat is for diligent individuals.
(8) Dream is for the lazy.
(9) The short-lived should mix with transference.

Drikung Repa[42] designated ten dharmas of Nāropa: First is the path of ripening by (1) empowerment. In the path of liberation, the gradual type of person practices (2) creation phase. The main practice of the path is (3) inner heat. The instantaneous type practices (4) luminous clarity. Resting clearly in reflexive awareness, (5) entrance, (6) transference, (7) dream, and (8) intermediate state are auxiliary practices. By meditating on those, the short-term results will be (9) the common spiritual powers of the five signs, the eight qualities,[43] the eight major attainments,[44] the four activities[45] and so forth. (10) The ultimate results will be the dharmakāya for one’s own sake and the two form kāyas for the sake of others.
Seben Repa[46] divided the instructions into those for attaining the supreme spiritual powers in this life and in the intermediate state. Based on inner heat, dream, luminous clarity, and transference, the diligent will attain awakening in this life. The method for the lazy to attain awakening in the intermediate state of existence is through the instructions on the intermediate state.
According to Lord Gampopa,[47] (1) inner heat is awakening through meditation, (2) dream is to awaken through making illusion the path, (3) luminous clarity is to awaken by making deep sleep the path, and (4) transference is how to awaken without meditating. Entrance transference is an auxiliary. Counting dream and illusory body as one, and making the intermediate state a branch of that, there are six dharmas, or alternatively, they are condensed into four root dharmas.
All the followers after that unanimously agree with The Latter Text on Austerities[48] and others that contain the enlightened intention of Nāropa and his spiritual descendents, and they hold the teachings of Gampopa et al. to be supreme. Therefore there are six dharmas: four root dharmas with two branches.

For a living person to attain awakening in the current body in a single lifetime, the stains of habitual patterns of the four states[49] that are to be refined must be refined away. That is, they must be made into the path of the four kāyas. The special instructions for the path that refines in that way are exactly these four sets of teachings—inner heat and so on. For that reason they have been posited as the root dharmas, as it says in the Latter Authoritative Text:[50]
Sleeping, dreaming, sexual union, And ordinary time; for these four There are practices of four times.
They should be known from the guru’s oral teachings.
The practices of the intermediate state and transference are taught as branch dharmas. Including those two, we have the basis for the definition of the so-called Six Dharmas of Nāropa. So which of the states is refined by which dharma? The Concise Illumination of the Five Stages states:[51]
Sleeping, dreaming, sexual union, And ordinary time; for these four,
Identifying them with the four chakras
And understanding the channels, vital essences, and mind....
Taking up that idea, Lama Ngokpa et al. say:
During ordinary time, mind—the sovereign—abides at the navel, during dreamtime at the throat, during sleep at the heart, and during sexual union it abides at the crown of the head.
As it states here, the mind abides at the navel during ordinary time. Its essence is to have an idea of things, which involves many thoughts. That state is refined by the esoteric instructions of illusory body and serves as the path of the nirmāṇakāya. The ordinary time is synonymous with “the time of waking apart from others” since it is not tainted by the other three states.
During dreamtime the mind abides at the throat. Its essence is that the energy currents create existent or nonexistent forms. That state is refined by the esoteric instructions of dream and serves as the path of the saṃbhogakāya.
During deep sleep the mind abides at the heart. Its essence is to be totally overwhelmed by darkness, taking a form like unconsciousness. That state is refined by the esoteric instructions of luminous clarity and serves as the path of the dharmakāya.
During sexual union the mind abides at the crown of the head. Its essence is to be coated by the stains of irresistible desire and to have the idea of contact between two sexual organs. That state is refined by the esoteric instructions of inner heat and serves as the path of the mahāsukhakāya (body of great bliss). What is called “the state of the fourth apart from others” is synonymous with the state of sexual union. The state of movement [of vital essence][52] also refers to that. Since the force of the habitual pattern of that movement causes the arousal of desire for the desire [realm], there is no difference in those two. Since it is fourth in the enumeration, following the waking state, it is also referred to as “the fourth.”

To apply the analysis of the four modes precisely to those Six Dharmas, first one develops an understanding by hearing the literal meaning of the Six Dharmas:
(1) The bliss of pristine awareness fiercely burns (gtum) and conquers afflictive emotion.
(2) All phenomena of samsara and nirvana appear only as illusory body.
(3) Dream indicates by example that all apparent phenomena appear to our deluded perceptions but do not truly exist.
(4) The abiding nature of all phenomena is luminous clarity free of all the extremes of elaboration.
(5) Because of our deluded concepts of dualistic appearances, we wander in between (bar ma dor) samsara and nirvana.
(6) The practice of the holy dharma of unmistaken sutras and tantras transfers (’pho ba) one onto higher and higher levels and paths.
You should know that the two perspectives of the scriptural traditions of sutra and mantra could be applied separately to each of those as well.
The general meaning of the Six Dharmas is the experience gained through reflection:
(1) Caṇḍālī (inner heat) is to bond with the pledge-mudra.
(2) Objective appearance is viewed as the illusory deity’s body.
(3) Dreams are recognized through the vital point of purposeful intent.
(4) One refines luminous clarity through apprehending the instant visualization and the subsequent dissipation.[53]
(5) The intermediate state is cut through by recognizing it.
(6) The pristine awareness of the moment of death transfers [the consciousness] up.
Each of those also has two: the meaning found commonly in tantras and esoteric instructions, and in the special pith instructions of the vital points in the hearing lineage.
The hidden meaning of the Six Dharmas is that which is realized through meditation:
(1) The great creative energy of bliss, warmth, and nonthought is consummated.
(2) Energy-mind[54] matures as the deity’s illusory form.
(3) Energy-mind arises as the deity’s form just from the four empties.[55]
(4) One’s own nature is recognized through example and actual luminous clarity.
(5) The union of appearance and emptiness is liberated as saṃbhogakāya.
(6) The ball of light is transferred by sound.
Each of those has two subdivisions: the arising of concordant experiences and the actual realization. The Six Dharmas that are explained as ultimate meaning are the concordant experiences of exalted beings in training. The actual attainments themselves are at the time of attaining the union experience that is beyond training.

Concerning those Six Dharmas as explained above, the subject matter to be explained on this occasion is the particular meditation topics that come from pith instructions on the vital points in the hearing lineage. We will describe the essence of each of them in sequence.
The name “inner heat” (gtum mo, caṇḍālī) is used to describe the esoteric instructions on inner heat, the meditation method, the union of bliss and emptiness that arises from it, and the means of expression that teaches those two. There are many applications of the name; however, all others are imputations. The real inner heat is the coemergent pristine awareness of bliss-emptiness and so that is called its essence. Such distinctions between real and designated should be applied to the other dharmas as well.
The essence of illusory body is the coemergent pristine awareness of appearance-emptiness. Although they are a union, one cannot realize it unless ultimate truth has been actualized. So the real illusory body is the manifestation of the illusion-like pure body from the three lights occurring in reverse order,[56] together with the pristine awareness energy currents, arising out of luminous clarity.
The essence of dream is the coemergent pristine awareness of intrinsic awareness (rig pa) and emptiness. Mere optical illusions appear and yet are none other than one’s own mind. Thus they are held to be awareness-emptiness.
The essence of luminous clarity is the coemergent pristine awareness of clarity-emptiness. The three consciousnesses[57] or three emptinesses are totally pure and everything is empty. Its clarity is not the clarity that comes from external conditions but rather it is like a gem that shines with its own light. This is explained in The Five Stages.[58]
The essence of the intermediate state is said to be the coemergent pristine awareness of the three times. This is because, as explained in the Vajra Garland,[59] although we imagine that we arise, abide, and cease in the intermediate state, it is just the subtle body of energy-mind.
The essence of transference is the coemergent pristine awareness of inseparability. This is because one may consider the essence that is free of a transferred object and a means of transference as the indivisible three kāyas or the inseparability of the three vajras.

The addition of the term “coemergent pristine awareness” (lhan cig skyes pa’i ye shes) to all of these indicates that those very unions [of bliss and emptiness, etc.] are not something that arise in former and latter stages, but that they abide simultaneously. This is called “coemergent.” In Coemergent Spiritual Power[60] it states:
When something arises simultaneously with anything It is called coemergent.
Thus, “coemergent” is described as being like the equal flavor of phenomena and reality. In the same way, since all of those six dharmas are in essence the transcendent path, they are referred to as “pristine awareness” (ye shes, Skt. jñāna).
Which means of purification is applied to which object of purification? The esoteric instructions of inner heat as the means of purification are applied to the pristine awareness aggregate and pristine awareness constituent, and so on, as the object of purification. Once they have been refined, the result of purification is the actualization of the sixth or Vajrasattva family spiritual powers and the jñānakāya (pristine awareness body).[61]
Applying this to the other dharmas, the esoteric instruction of illusory body refines the aggregate of form, the constituent of earth, and so forth, and actualizes the tathāgata family spiritual powers and the nirmāṇakāya. The esoteric instruction of dream refines the aggregate of feeling, the constituent of fire, and so forth, and actualizes the padma family spiritual powers and the saṃbhogakāya. The esoteric instruction of luminous clarity refines the aggregate of conceptions, the constituent of water, and so forth, and actualizes the vajra family spiritual powers and the svabhāvikakāya. The esoteric instruction of the intermediate state refines the aggregate of formations, the constituent of wind, and so forth, and actualizes the karma family spiritual powers and the dharmakāya. The esoteric instruction of transference refines the aggregate of consciousness, the constituent of space, and so forth, and actualizes the ratna family spiritual powers and the mahāsukhakāya.
Glorious Rangjung Dorjé, Lord Khachö Wangpo,[62] and others, thinking that a thorough comprehension of the objects of purification, the means of purification, and the results of purification in this way was important for a good understanding of the vital points of the path, elaborated on the brief mention of these subjects in Lord Marpa’s Stream of Elixir.

The pillar of the path is inner heat (gtum mo)[65] because by generating mundane and transcendent coemergence it is like a pillar or foundation stone of the path of union. The meaning of the name is this: “heat” or “fierce” (gtum) means that by targeting the vital point of something, the impure aggregates and constituents are burned up and all afflictive emotion and discursive thoughts are severed at the roots. Vajragarbha’s Commentary[66] states:
Because it burns, it is described as “inner heat.”
And from Saroruha’s Commentary on the Difficult Points of Hevajra: [67]
Inner heat is that which eradicates the afflictive emotions of existence from the roots.
And Nāropa’s Difficult Points states:[68]
Because it performs fierce burning actions It is called “heat.”
“Female” (the feminine particle mo) means that it swiftly gives birth to the coemergent pristine awareness of bliss-emptiness.[69] As it states in Abhayākara’s Source Commentary:[70]
Caṇḍ (from the Sanskrit caṇḍālī ) is the definite realization of the inherent essence of consummate wisdom, and ā is great compassion. Those are called the guide to the penultimate state, hence “inner heat.”
Specifically, there are three designations: fierce a (a gtum), short a (a thung), and stroke a (a shad ). The first is according to its function: conquering afflictive emotion. The second is its intrinsic nature: unborn. The third is its shape: the last part of a is like a brush stroke.[71]

There are a great many lists of the divisions of inner heat, but the glorious Khachö Wangpo set forth just three: outer, inner, and secret. His source for that was the Tantra That Equals Space:[72]
Whoever desires the pristine awareness of reflexive awareness Should investigate the particulars of caṇḍālī:
First, natural caṇḍālī, Second, fierce caṇḍālī, Third, caṇḍālī of joining.
Thus, three kinds are clearly presented here: Natural caṇḍālī is that the nature of all phenomena is emptiness, so that is the outer inner-heat. Fierce caṇḍālī is the short a in the navel, so it is the inner inner-heat. Joining caṇḍālī is the union of emptiness that is sublime in all aspects and the supreme unchanging great bliss. The first one severs conceptual elaborations about the view, the second brings the meditation topic into practice, and the third joins with the state of supreme, unchanging great bliss. Therefore, in general, the meditation sequence of a single individual follows that order. But there are also particular cases where one would first practice the inner inner-heat and then, as an enhancement of that, train in the outer inner-heat and the secret inner-heat.
It is also possible to draw forth the experiences of the latter ones [fierce caṇḍālī and joining caṇḍālī] when meditating on the former [natural caṇḍālī], once there is the ability to join with the supreme inner-heat and successfully receive the introduction [of mind’s nature]. Not wavering from the certainty of the meditation on secret inner-heat carries the outer and inner inner-heat as auxiliary practices of the path. This becomes a very amazing practice, as it guides practitioners according to the level of their faculties.

Of those, what is called “caṇḍālī that realizes the outer meaning with certainty” refers to coemergent union and other stages in the guidance of mahāmudrā and the experiences that arise from it. Lord Gampopa even spoke of it as the inner heat of mahāmudrā. This is in fact the ultimate inner heat, but there is no fault in referring to it as “outer meaning.” Since it presents primarily the discernment of emptiness it is consistent with the definitive meaning of both the middle and the final turnings of the wheel [of the dharma][73] and is thus even more distinguished. It also has the same meaning as the mantrayāna practice of dissolving all the eighty natural conceptions into emptiness through the force of mental visualization. It is because of this commonality with sutra and mantra that it is described as “caṇḍālī that realizes the outer meaning with certainty.”[74]
In the expression “space-caṇḍālī of most hidden secret meaning,” the outer meaning of space is the emptiness that is the intrinsic nature of all phenomena, as stated in the Supreme Glory:[75]
Everything has the characteristic of space;
Yet space itself has no characteristic.
The inner is the space of dhūti that will be explained.
The secret is the bhaga of the vajra queen.

The suchness is explained in the Kālacakra: [76]
Pervasive space endowed with the vajra of space.
Here, the inner space is the source of phenomena[77] within the unrestricted avadhūti, the expanse of space that contains the entire extent of the three realms. It is the realm of luminous clarity free of obscuration. The reflexive awareness of pristine awareness undivided by dualistic thinking, the absolute vajra, unchanging bliss, engages [with that inner space] in the practice of yoga. That is the caṇḍālī of space. It is described as “secret” or “hidden” in the Vajra Garland.[78] This means that it has the quality of being secret or hidden from those without the karmic fortune to be able to realize it.

Why is the nonduality of emptiness endowed with all aspects and unchanging bliss referred to by the term caṇḍālī ? The meaning can be found in the profound tantra:[79]
The blazing of inner heat in the navel Burns the five tathāgatas.
By burning Locanā and the others,[80] The moon of haṃ drips.[81]
The term is consistent in both etymology and function: the word “navel” (lte ba) signifies the middle or core of all phenomena, and “central” (dbu ma) means that all extremes are abandoned. “Inner heat” (gtum mo) is the reflexive awareness of pristine awareness, since it severs all conceptual thought and bestows nonconceptual pristine awareness of great bliss. “Blazing” (sbar ba) is made manifest through the force of the yoga. It signifies clearing away the stains of fixating to the actual true existence of the aggregates, constituents, and sense fields. This has actually been spontaneously cleared away since forever in the chakrawheels of tathāgatas, so “burns” (bsreg pa) applies to all thought formations that are not of the five masculine or feminine buddhas of the five families or the host of bodhisattvas. The word “drip” (’dzag pa) or “radiate” (’phro ba) is used to show that this process reveals bodhicitta (byang sems), the excellent moon of great bliss that is the eternal illusory display of all existence.
There are other lists of divisions. Three kinds of inner heat are described in the Awn of Esoteric Instructions:[82] action, yogic, and coemergent. The Tantra That Equals Space explains twelve divisions of “naked” (gcer bu) caṇḍālī. The Secret Elixir Tantra[83] makes divisions such as “dense” (stug po) caṇḍālī, and so forth. And there are many more ways to classify it: action and pristine awareness; ordinary and supreme; with or without characteristics; relative and absolute; ground, path, and fruition; substance, mantra, and pristine awareness; the three inner heats of channels, energy currents, and vital essences; and so forth.

In general, based on the yoga of channels, energy currents, and vital essences, these paths actualize the pristine awareness of coemergent bliss and emptiness and cause the accomplishment of the state of union, Vajradhara.[84] For that reason one must become knowledgeable in the arrangement of these channels, energy currents, and vital essences. However, here I will not elaborate for fear of being wordy. It was presented before in mere token fashion in the exploration of the stages of study.[85] For a thorough study, one should learn from the precious tantras and, in particular, the source commentaries on their intent that are equivalent to those tantras, such as The Profound Inner Reality.[86]
Here is a summary of the meditation object of whichever profound yoga and whatever object or support is to be targeted, from Telopa’s Lamp That Illuminates the Esoteric Instructions of Fourfold Suchness:[87]
What are the supports? Channels. How many are there? 72,000 main ones. From that it is reduced to three hundred and sixty. From that, one hundred twenty. From that, thirty-two. From that, twenty-four. From that, three. Those are the main ones. In those, the one hundred and twenty are in four chakras.
What are their locations? The navel, the heart, the throat, and the top of the head. How are they allocated? Sixty-four at the navel, eight at the heart, sixteen at the throat, and thirty-two at the head. What are their shapes? They open out in brilliance like when the sunlight converges on a bed of lotus flowers. In color, since they are made of lunar and solar substance, they are iridescent like moon-gems. What is their mode? Since they are the joining of method and wisdom, they abide joined faceto-face.
Telopa’s short sources and vajra songs that include the six dharmas teach that, among those various arrangements of channels, the three channels and the four chakras are the ones to target when doing the yogas.

The mount for the mind that engages objects, the maker that creates the array of beings and environments of the three realms, is the root and branch currents of energy (rtsa, Skt. prāṇa). Since binding them immovably is the foundation of all paths of liberation and skillful methods, one should know how they are used in yogic practice. The main technique is to join the upper and lower energy currents in the vase [of the abdomen] by employing the four applications and the five vital points. As it says in the Saṃvara Origin Tantra:[88]
Concentrate on uniting the upper and lower Circulating energy currents.
When accustomed to that application, You will attain a state of stability.
There are four ways that those applications control the energy currents:
(1) control of the duration as the inhalations get closer according to the measure of one’s own fingers[89]
(2) control of the numbers as the breaths become fewer
(3) control of the force as the external movement becomes more gentle and relaxed
(4) control of the benefits as the length of time increases that it stays in its own place, such as the navel, without moving out.
Of these, the first three also occur in some species of animals, so it is not the authentic yogic state. The last one is the authentic control of the energy channels since it will give rise to experiences in the mindstream.
The four applications are taught in the Latter Authoritative Text:[90]
Inhaling, filling, dispersing, and Shooting like an arrow:
If you do not know these four applications You risk qualities turning into faults.
The five vital points are
(1) the vital point of expelling, to prevent the energy current from reverting[91]
(2) the vital point of inhaling, to hold it in its own place
(3) the vital point of filling, to subdue it
(4) the vital point of dispersing, to send the energy into the channel apertures[92]
(5) the vital point of shooting, to blend the outer and inner energy currents.

There are a limitless number of vital essences (thig le, Skt. bindu) that spread out from the indestructible root vital essence.[93] The principal ones used in yoga practice are the red and white bodhicitta, the two vital essences of melting bliss that join together through the yogic exercise of blazing and dripping. Based on that, the movement of concepts is bound without emission.[94] That, then, is the meditation of the pristine awareness of coemergent bliss and emptiness. Since this body is produced from the full development of the semen and ovum in the womb, the red and white bodhicittas are the main constituents. The rest of the body parts are manifestations of those two.[95]
Of those two bodhicittas, the white abides mainly at the top of the head and the red mainly at the navel. The quintessence of the red aspect that was obtained from the mother is the short a of inner heat. It has four characteristics:
(1) It is the red color of the totally pure nature of the sun.
(2) It is hot to the touch, since energy currents are the essence of fiery warmth.
(3) It is experienced as bliss, because bodhicitta is the sublime elixir of pristine awareness.
(4) It is emptiness by nature, because the realm of reality is the essence of the perfection of wisdom.
The quintessence of the white aspect that was obtained from the father is the essence of bodhicitta as the letter haṃ. It also has four characteristics:
(1) It is white, because it is an aspect of the moon constituent.
(2) It is iridescent like the surface of a pearl, since it is connected to the caṇḍālī that is the intrinsic nature of wisdom.
(3) It is glossy, because bodhicitta has the potency of elixir.
(4) It is spherical, that is, totally and perfectly round, since it is easy to entice into any of the channel locations.
That white aspect itself mainly resides at the top of the head. Parts of it pervade the body in general, and in particular the four chakras. A melted aspect of the white aspect dwells in each of the four chakras. They have the quality of acting as support for the arising of the four joys of Body, Speech, Mind and pristine awareness that occur when the stains of the four constituents of body, speech, mind, and bliss are refined. A stream of melted aspect issues from the upper chakras that has the ability to generate that kind of quality. After the sixteen joys based on the sixteen white aspects occur, the coemergent joy arises.

The red aspect resides at the navel, but aspects of it pervade the chakras. So in each of the four chakras there resides individually a melted aspect of the red aspect that has the quality of acting as the support for the arising of the bliss of the three vajras that occur when the stains of motility, darkness, and buoyancy[96] are refined. A stream of its melted aspect issues from the upper chakras that has the ability to generate that kind of quality. After the twelve (three times four) joys[97] based on the twelve red aspects occur, the coemergent joy arises.
What is the reason for calling the white and red constituents “bodhicitta”? Bodhicitta has three aspects: cause, path, and result.
(1) The causal bodhicitta is the beginningless and endless bodhicitta that has been present in the mindstreams of sentient beings since forever.
(2) The path bodhicitta is of two kinds: general and hidden. The general meaning is the bodhicitta (“awakening mind”) of the two truths proclaimed in the causal vehicle. The hidden meaning is the bodhicitta that is the unobscured quintessence of the constituent that abides since forever. By binding the vital points[98] of the unobscured vajra body, that bodhicitta melts and through the power of interdependent connection the bodhicitta of the two truths arises in the mindstream. Thus, the quintessence of white and red is bodhicitta. Of these two bodhicittas, general and hidden, the latter one is sublime. The general is bodhicitta of merely the mind, that which is the supported, and therefore it cannot become the irreversible and unchanging bodhicitta. The hidden is the bodhicitta of both the supported mind and the body, the support, and thus it becomes both [irreversible and unchanging].
(3) The resultant bodhicitta is Vajradhara itself. In brief, the essential red and white bodhicittas reside in the navel and the top of the head as a and haṃ. At the time of being a samsaric person who proclaims “I,” the dualistic fixation of the self-entity of an individual and of phenomena is created. However, the interdependent connection created by the blazing and melting from binding the vital points of the support [the body] causes the pristine awareness of the two nonselves to arise naturally. One attains the self of nonself—the dharmakāya, which is the assurance of Vajradhara, and the form kāyas, which are the assurance of the tathāgatas. Then without moving anywhere else one accomplishes the state where enlightened activity is omnipresent and constant. This is taught in the Vajra Garland.

The uncommon, inner inner-heat that produces unchanging bliss has three phases: the time of the ground, the time of the path, and the time of the fruition.
[The Time of the Ground] [(1)]
Most tantras say that at the time of the ground inner heat resides at the navel. The Oral Teachings of Mañjuśrī[99] says it is at the secret place. Vajragarbha’s Commentary[100] explains that it is in both. These and other views are not contradictory because, as stated in that commentary, it is “like the moon’s form in water or in the sky.” That is to say, like the moon in the sky, the real inner heat resides in the navel, and like the moon’s reflection in water, an image of inner heat arises in the secret place. So either the navel or the secret place is acceptable, or it appears to be in both places.
What is its essence? There are three explanations: substance, mantra, and pristine awareness. Inner heat as substance is explained in four ways: as vital essence in Cakrasaṃvara, as fire in the Vajra Garland, as energy current in theVital Essence of Mahāmudrā,[101] and as channel in Vajragharba’s Commentary, since the lower end of the right channel has been referred to by the name “tummo” (gtum mo).
An explanation of inner heat as mantra is found in the Vital Essence of Spring,[102] where it accords with teachings on the intrinsic nature of short a:
The form of the letter a in the navel Is well known as “short.”
Inner heat is described as pristine awareness in the [Cakrasaṃvara] Abhidhāna Tantra:[103]
This fire of pristine awareness, once it is stirred by the karmic energy currents....
So from among all those modes of explanation, what is, in fact, the essence? Here, in the context of the two truths, it is reasonable to say, from the point of view of the relative truth, that the actual thing is the vital essence and its functional power is essentially fire. This is because this very thing is described as the quintessence of the rakta [or red vital essence] that was obtained from the mother, and as such it is the root of all the body’s warmth and the ruler of all the constituents of the red aspect. Also because it has the functional power of burning and melting, for when it is ignited the habitual patterns of the aggregates, constituents, and sense fields are burned up and the great blissful bodhicitta melts. The other descriptions are assigned from the perspective of its individual features: energy currents because they are the contributing condition for igniting inner heat, channels because that is its place or support, and mantra because that is what blesses the inner heat, and so on. In terms of the ultimate truth, since inner heat is really the essence of pristine awareness, even though relatively it has the nature of vital essence, in fact it is held to be pristine awareness.

[The Time of the Path] [(2)]
Three supports for the path are the conditions by which it is ignited:
(1) It is ignited by visualization of seed syllables, hand implements, deity forms, fire, vital essence drops, nāda,[104] and so on.
(2) It is ignited by the energy currents. In general it is aroused by the karmic energy currents. In particular, the Ocean of Ḍākas[105] says that it is ignited by the energy currents in the right and left channels, which are the intrinsic nature of the letters of the vowels and consonants [of Sanskrit]. The Vajra Garland says that it is ignited by the energy in the central channel alone. The Kālacakra says that it is ignited by the mixing of the vital energy current with the downward-clearing energy current in a mass or bundle.[106]
(3) It is ignited by skillful methods, by relying upon methods using one’s own body and another’s body.
The essence of the blazing fire is clear and unimpeded since it transcends the phenomenal nature of atomic particles, which are gross. It is experienced in meditative equipoise as a direct object of individual reflexive awareness. It is the power and force of energy current yogas and such. It elicits the four joys and four emptinesses while burning up the habitual patterns of the aggregates, constituents, and sense fields. It is what serves as the dominant condition for the fire of pristine awareness. Although it is not an external fire, it has the ability to warm like fire because of the force of the yoga’s blessing.

The degrees of blazing are the lesser, medium, and great blazing that occur in the three stages of entering, abiding, and dissolving.
The essence of that path, or the actual path, is the pristine awareness itself that occurs due to the bliss of the total blazing of the inner heat fire. Since inner heat is said to be the antidote to conceptual thought, it must be pristine awareness that is the actual antidote because mere warmth does not have that ability. Concerning that, pristine awareness has three aspects: nonthought, bliss, and clarity.
(1) The pristine awareness of nonthought: The appearance of inner heat’s blazing stops the movement of energy currents and the engagement with objects by the sense faculties. Once such emanating thoughts are brought to an end, one abides in total nonthought.
(2) The pristine awareness of bliss: Blazing inner heat melts the bodhicitta and the joy that is generated illustrates the pristine awareness of bliss.
(3) The pristine awareness of clarity: When all dualistic thoughts are purified within the central channel, the pristine awareness of the union of bliss-emptiness or clarity-emptiness arises through the progressive and reverse sequence of the three lights in the stages of visualization.
[The Time of Result] [(3)]
It is explained that discriminating pristine awareness has the function of conquering the hordes of devils and so on, as it says in the Kālacakra:[107]
The fully expanding flames of pristine awareness totally burn up all the hosts of devils along with their objects.

To accomplish pristine awareness of bliss-emptiness in that way through the yoga of channels, energy currents, and vital essences, one should first practice the total liberation of the upper door that relies on one’s own body as the method. The Latter Authoritative Text says:[108]
There are three vital points to that:
Body, time, and object.
As this indicates, one should meditate with these three: the vital points of body posture, the vital points of practice time, and the vital points of the object of visualization. The first is the six-point posture of meditative stability.[109] The second is during the time of equal movement [of breath in the two nostrils] and so forth. The third has three parts [in relation to the branches of approach and attainment]: to develop what has not been developed, to stabilize what has been developed, and to enhance what has been stabilized:
(1) To develop what has not been developed is to perfect the yoga of approach through four practices: accomplishing the body of reflected form, establishing the ground of the affinity, the movement of the three secrets, and the dance of the water moon.
(2) To stabilize what has been developed is successful attainment through evoking the activity of peaceful and wrathful caṇḍālī of the channels, currents, vital essence drops, and pristine awareness in the body’s chakras endowed with four hidden things.
(3) To enhance what has been stabilized is to genuinely enter into great attainment by the application of increase, the application of change, the application of the subtle, and the application of the supreme.
One turns without bias the wheel of introductory instructions that reveal the real face of caṇḍālī, the great profound mystery that all phenomena are the utter inseparability of the ground that is to be purified, the path that purifies, and the purity of the result. By being skilled at gathering all phenomena of the path and its result in the essence of caṇḍālī—the profound appearance of the yoga of every phenomenon—then it is all gathered into the single sufficient pristine awareness of all appearance. That is the meditation.[110]

This is a subsidiary practice that enhances pristine awareness by relying on action-mudra[111] with another’s body. It is for someone who has stabilized the path of total liberation of the upper door. As explained in the Saṃvara Origin Tantra:[112]
Now the characteristics of yoginīs
And their authentic virtues will be explained.
Ḍākinī is padminī (lotus),
Lama is hastinī (elephant), Khandaroha is śaṅkhinī (conch), Rupini is citriṇī (design).
The wise should examine partners to see Which of the four families they are.[113]
Following that brief presentation there is a more extensive discussion about their individual bodies, attitudes, ways to find the channels, and so forth. Accordingly, using the methods for examining, attracting, and invisibility,[114] one should find a partner with excellent outer, inner, and secret qualities. At the time of experiencing the bliss of sexual union with one who has been matured through study and empowerment, and who has perfectly pure vows and sacred pledges, both bodies are blessed and the secret channels located. Applying the descending, holding, reversing, and spreading techniques will produce the ultimate pristine awareness of great bliss.

By targeting the vital points of the body and meditating on inner heat, there are immediate benefits such as the ten signs, the eight qualities, and so on. The ten are the well-known signs of smoke, mirage, and the rest that arise.[115] The eight are mentioned in the Stream of Elixir:
Eight qualities will arise. The quality of earth is that the body is majestic and dignified. The quality of water is that the body is glossy. The quality of fire is that it is very bright. The quality of the wind is lightness. The quality of the moon is that others do not see your shadow. The quality of the sun is being invisible. The quality of space is that the eyes are always open without blinking day or night like the autumn sky.
And:
Since all the last ones are perfected qualities and arise from within coemergent pristine awareness that is bliss free from elaborations, luminous clarity manifests continuously.
In particular, ultimately, as it says in the Sampuṭa:[116]
So, what occurs from this?
In brief, one attains awakening. The awakening that is attained
Through ten million countless aeons, Will be attained in this lifetime Through sublime bliss.
The supreme method that is distinguished by great bliss enables one to attain the body of Vajradhara, the state of union, in one lifetime. In particular, by relying properly on another’s body, the immediate effects will be an unfolding of physical strength and radiance, longevity, attracting ḍākinīs, and an increase in mental clarity and meditative absorption. The ultimate attainment, like using quicksilver to transform iron into pure gold, is that the quintessence of the channels, energy currents, and vital essences will increase, gradually consuming the refuse[117] and transforming the body into the actual rainbow body of inseparable form-emptiness, the saṃbhogakāya. The mind is actualized as the luminous clarity of inseparable bliss-emptiness, the enlightened intention of dharmakāya. That is enlightenment—and that is what this does. So it is said.

The subject, great bliss itself, is enhanced by the arising of the illusorylike object. Therefore the enhancement of the path is the practice of illusory body. The name means that although there is no form, yet various forms are apprehended. Or that there is appearance without intrinsic existence. Hence “illusory body (sgyus lus).”[118]
The general divisions of illusory body are explained under seven headings: example illusions, appearance illusions, dream illusions, intermediate state illusions, luminous clarity illusions, emanated illusions, and pristine awareness illusions.
(1) Examples: These are given in the sutras where it says, “Those who create illusions emanate forms...” and so on.[119] Using substances and such, magicians can cause horses, elephants, and so on, to suddenly appear even though they do not, in fact, exist.
(2) Appearance illusion: As in the Root of Wisdom,[120] “like dreams, like illusions...” and so on, all phenomena are like dreams and illusions, appearing while having no true existence.
(3) Dream illusion: The Commentary [on Valid Cognition][121] states:
They have bodies, but since they are subtle
They are not obstructed by anything.
As it says, the body in a dream comes from habitual patterns and is composed of subtle energy-mind, but it is not obstructed by anything.
(4) Intermediate state illusion: The Abhidharma Treasury[122] says, “faculties are intact and movement is unhindered,” and so on. The body in the intermediate state arises from the mind. It has all faculties intact and it moves without hindrance.
(5) Luminous clarity illusion: Ocean of Ḍākas[123] says:
The King Tantra of the yogas
Explains it and its rites.
The illusions of luminous clarity Refers to illusions in the world.
Such statements refer to the forms of emptiness that occur on the strength of completion stage meditation, as in mirror divination.[124]
(6) Emanated illusion: This refers to the mandalas and so on that are emanated by the meditative absorption of stabilized creation and completion.
(7) Pristine awareness illusion: As it says in a sutra, “Tathāgatas are the emanated illusions of pristine awareness.” It is the ongoing cycle of the inexhaustible adornments of the three secrets of the tathāgatas.
In addition, there is a twofold division of the general meaning and the hidden meaning of illusory body and a twofold division of sitting meditation and post-meditation illusory body. There are threefold divisions into the illusory body of beginners, of the third stage,[125] and of union; and of outer meaning, hidden meaning, and union. There is a fourfold division into literal meaning, general meaning, hidden meaning, and ultimate illusory body. From those and other divisions, I now offer a brief presentation of the esoteric instructions from this precious lineage.

The esoteric instructions of the vital points of practice in this teaching tradition must be accomplished by stages. The first of three stages is known as impure illusory body. The meaning of this name “impure illusory body” (ma dag pa’i sgyu lus) is expressed in the first progressive division of the Vajraḍāka Tantra:[126]
In the three realms, all the beings Without exception are like illusion.
Inanimate and animate being
Is without a frame of reference. Visible and tangible things
Are all just like illusions.
The appearances of impure things in the three realms—inanimate or animate, visible or tangible—all appear, like an illusion, but have no true existence. They are therefore impure illusions. For those who do not realize that, these esoteric instructions were taught as a method for getting rid of the fixation on attributes that results from attachment to the true existence of things. The general training is described in the Pure Gold of the Six Dharmas:[127]
So, first you should view all external appearances as being like the eight examples of illusion. All of these forms and such appear to the deluded mind but there is nothing out there, as in a dream or an illusion. They arise from conditions, like echoes or reflections. They are impermanent, like dewdrops and water bubbles. They appear but have no intrinsic nature, like mirages and rainbows. By training in that way and becoming accustomed to it, you will discard any ideas based on appearances.
As it says, one ascertains through these examples of illusion, dream, and so on, that this whole appearance of samsara and nirvana—the external and internal things included in the environments and their inhabitants in the three realms—are appearing without any true existence, and one meditates on that.
The specific training is to establish that one’s own body is form-emptiness, similar to a reflection; speech is sound-emptiness, similar to an echo; and mind is awareness-emptiness, similar to an illusion. Since this topic is found in the Perfection of Wisdom sutras and in the tantras, it is a teaching common to both sutra and tantra.

Transformation of the impure appearances of the environment and its inhabitants into the pure mandala of deities is the reason that this is called “pure illusory body” (dag pa’i sgyu lus). This is held in common among all the lower sections of tantra, but it is greatly distinguished from the path of the perfections.
It is the way of the profound mantra to teach that the aggregates, constituents, and sense fields all exist originally as the intrinsic nature of the deity. In order to realize that very thing, which has not been previously realized, one must ascertain the manner of being. Then by meditating, the special meditative absorption of illusory display will develop. Visualizing the environment and its inhabitants as the deity will refine away the attachment to ordinary appearance and then ascertaining the illusory-like empty appearance of even the deity will refine any thoughts of attachment to the supremacy of the deity. That is the sequence.
Therefore, one regards all appearances of one’s own body and the environment and its inhabitants as a support palace and supported mandala of deities; all sounds as the innate sound of profound mantra; and all mental comings and goings as the play of pristine awareness. At the same time, one meditates on those too as being like an illusion—not truly existing other than as one’s own imputation. The way those are illustrated by the three examples is consistent with what was taught before in words from the Five Stages.[128]
In this Kagyu tradition, ascertaining that whatever appearances arise in the impure environment and its inhabitants are all illusion is impure illusory body, and transforming those very appearances to those of deities and ascertaining the same thing is pure illusory body, conventionally speaking. The explanations on the five stages in the Guhyasamāja Tantra explain that the illusory body at the end of the three isolations[129] is the impure, and the illusory body that is one part of the union refined by luminous clarity is pure illusory body.[130]

Pure illusory body is posited as “pure” simply because one clarifies ordinary appearances, meditating on them as the deity. However, since it is a meditation that is essentially conceptual imputation, it is not really totally pure. Here, this is “totally pure illusory body” (rnam dag sgyu lus) because the body produced from the quintessence of energy-mind, like the appearances in mirror divination, is not conceptually imputed. This is the illusory body of the hidden meaning unique to the highest mantra, the main stage of the path of self-blessing by energy-mind.
There are several different explanations of “self-blessing” in the tantras.[131] However, self-blessing of illusory body in the Guhyasamāja and self-blessing of forms of emptiness[132] in Kālacakra have the same meaning. Both illusory bodies and forms of emptiness share the following:
(1) distinctive time: they arise after gross and subtle appearances and thoughts have subsided
(2) distinctive method: they occur from stopping dualistic energycurrents and thoughts in the central channel
(3) distinctive cause: they are produced from the extremely subtle quintessence of energy-mind
(4) distinctive manifestation: they are seen as clear appearances without imputation like those in mirror divination
(5) distinctive essence: they are the appearance of pristine awareness that is totally sublime and beyond the phenomenal nature of subtle atoms.
For reasons such as these, the Eighth Lord Mikyö Dorjé and his heirs held them to be “totally equivalent.”

The basis for the practice of the illusory body that is the hidden meaning unique to the highest tantra, the preliminaries for its practice, the way it is practiced, the distinctions in the methods of the two stages of creation and completion, and so forth, that are summed up in the positions of the precious Kagyu were explained before.[133] Now, in the hidden meaning of caṇḍālī, once one has perfected the blazing appearances, the four supreme joys will arise from the continuous melting bliss of the blazing and dripping from the dissolving of pristine awarenessenergy into the supreme avadhūti. That engenders a distinctive mental isolation, which in turn produces a pseudo-illusory body with five distinctions. Then the real luminous clarity eliminates the stains and the ultimate illusory body with distinctions is produced. It is that which is called the kāya of union or saṃbhogakāya. On this subject, Lord Tepuba said:
Example illusory body is the reflection in a mirror. Real illusory body is the aggregate without obscuration. Illusory body’s own essence is the marks and signs of the pure vowels and consonants. The quality of illusory body is that it is the support for overcoming devils and actualizing enlightenment. Once that occurs, that form will remain for as long as space remains.
That is a perfectly complete teaching on illusory body as cause, path, and resultant body. In the Lamp Summary of Conduct[134] it is explained that this hidden meaning of illusory body is not [present beginning with] creation phase through the end of mental isolation. In the mantra tradition it is a required component in the accomplishment of the form kāyas in the full awakening in one lifetime.

Both the yogas that do not use elaborations and characteristics and those that do use elaborations and characteristics are foundations for accomplishing meditative absorption. Isolation of body is the basis for the isolation of speech, the vajra repetition.[135] Isolation of mind develops from that. Once these three isolations have preceded, the stages of illusory body that develop from emptiness or bliss arise automatically. In this context, making a connection with the special vital points in the yoga without characteristics brings the three doors [of body, speech, and mind] to rest without movement. In the yoga with characteristics, the vital points and functions of the body are bound. The speech is the vajra repetition of energy vase-breathing.[136] In the mind, impressions subside within melting bliss. This is slightly different than the three isolations and the way to practice them described in the Guhyasamāja. However, both make the same vital point: that the arising of meditative absorption, which is the actual thing to be accomplished, is a function of the energy currents entering, abiding, and dissolving in the central channel. In addition, this tradition is a profound esoteric instruction for those of lower or intermediate faculties.

Those who practice the yoga without characteristics should remain in the aforementioned three isolations in a solitary place. From within that state, one offers unconditionally one’s body, enjoyments, and roots of virtue and arouses total devotion to the guru. That will sever mental elaborations of the three times. Resting in that equipoise, the force of the blessing will pacify the characteristics of the two obscurations in their own place and the pristine awareness of mahāmudrā will actually manifest. Focusing on that itself, meditation leads to the mental concentration, which controls the energy currents. That gives rise to the following experiential appearances:
When earth dissolves into water, smoke appears. When water dissolves into fire, mirages appear.
When fire dissolves into wind, fireflies appear.
When wind dissolves into mind, candle flames appear. When mind dissolves into mental events, the moon appears.
When mental events dissolve into ignorance, the sun appears.
When all ignorance dissolves into emptiness, darkness like an eclipse occurs.
Then everything is empty, arising like the sky free of clouds.
Again, the three lights arise in reverse order: Awareness arises out of the emptiness of everything; from that, mental events; and from that, mind. From mind with energy currents, the illusory form—which is illustrated by the twelve examples of illusion— adorned by the major and minor marks, arises as direct manifestation to the pristine awareness of individual reflexive awareness. Not only that, this will cause the sense of unhindered perception of all the pure and impure worlds and beings in the three times. This will occur either gradually, by leaps and bounds, or all at once according to the specific mental capacities.

In practice based on the yoga with characteristics, one may use vajra repetition and the isolation of mind as actually found in the tradition of Guhyasamāja, or what arises from the caṇḍālī yoga that was described before. In either case, once one has become well accomplished in the basic foundation of the root yoga with its distinctive qualities of the three isolations, one may unite in action-mudra with a qualified awareness partner or with a pristine awareness-mudra emanated by meditative absorption. With this impetus, the cause of the nondissipating body, the primordially abiding affinity itself, arises with luminous clarity as the three vajras [following] the progressive and reverse manifestations of the three lights. This makes one free of obscuration.
This form transcends the phenomenal nature of sub-atomic particles; it is produced from the quintessence of energy-mind, adorned with the visually captivating major and minor marks. Like a reflection in a mirror, it appears while lacking any inherent nature, entirely free from the four extremes of being a thing, a non-thing, both, or neither. This form that is the intrinsic nature of the minds of all buddhas and not clothed in the characteristics of the aggregates, constituents, and sense fields, appears only to pristine awareness. It is the quintessential form of emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects, its unimpeded luminous clarity arising like a rainbow.
If meditative experiences, signs, and certainty do not arise, one should undertake enhancing practices, such as using laq-dye or the physical exercises of sword and mirror, and also practice.[137]
This process is the hidden meaning freely elucidated in the general commentarial tradition of the Kagyu in an unbroken continuity up to the present. It is the position of the Eighth Lord and others that there are two presentations concerning this instance of illusory body: in conjunction with Guhyasamāja primarily, when it is based on the three isolations, and in conjunction with the intentions of Cakrasaṃvara, Hevajra, and Guhyasamāja, when it is based on the mudras.

This [completely pure illusory form] is basically the same as the forms of emptiness—the mahāmudrā endowed with the supreme of all aspects—that arise from the self-blessing in the third of the five stages of Guhyasamāja,[138] and from the individual withdrawal and meditative stability of vajra yoga.[139] It is the extremely profound, hidden meaning from the oral explanations to disciples, a pith instruction of the main practice of the hearing lineage.

Dream yoga is the measure of [progress on] the path because the level of success on the path of recognizing the three illusions[140] can be identi- fied through the stable or unstable experiences in dreams. It is called “dream”[141] because it deals with the arising of the very form of habitual patterns or the apprehension of energetic forms of objects.[142]
There are several divisions:
(1) example dream: the actual dream
(2) real dream: daytime appearances
(3) dream at time’s end: the intermediate state.
From the perspective of essence there are
(1) dreams of beginners
(2) dreams of yogins
(3) dreams of noble beings.
Also:
(1) minor dreams: the fragmented appearances during sleep
(2) intermediate dreams: unstable appearances of the intermediate state
(3) major dreams: the stable deluded appearances of the waking state.
Here the presentation will concern example dream. Dreams arise due to the particular ways that the energy currents and mind congregate in the channel locations. The essence of dream is that it is the arising of various appearances of habitual patterns within the sleeping state.
The body in that dream may or may not separate from this gross body.[143] In either case, it is essentially a body of energy-mind. Since it mimics the habitual patterns of the present body it is also called the habitual body. That time of dreaming is double delusion,[144] because the power of the habitual patterns of this delusion, the current waking relative appearances, give rise to various appearances in the dream that do not exist even on a relative level. The instructions that enable one to take the dream state as the path are known as “dream instructions” (rmi lam gyi gdams pa).

In the beginning, in order to take dreams as the path, one must embrace two vital points: unbroken mindfulness in the day and the rigorous techniques of esoteric instructions at night. There are four impediments to recognition: excessive emptiness, excessive sleepiness, excessive wakefulness, and excessive complacency. Once these are dispelled by remedial esoteric instructions, the dream is recognized to be just that, and that is dream recognition [or lucid dreaming]. Moreover, like the dream, all phenomena are essentially empty and as such can appear as anything at all. Thus the two truths are combined. The dream practice in the causal vehicle is to think, “How amazing—these reflected forms arise interdependently with no separation between the relative phenomenon (chos can, Skt. dharmin) and its nature (chos nyid, Skt. dharmatā).” The dream practice in this context of the completion phase is when one can arouse dreams themselves as mahāmudrā illusory body deities.
In the middle, once dreams are recognized, one must train in emanating deities, transforming the four elements, and so forth. One refines the illusion by deliberately forcing the knowledge that it is not real, and attains mastery in the meditative absorption in which one trains in worldly and transcendent liberating actions.[145]
In the end, one blends dreams and luminous clarity. Using the esoteric instruction for combining dreams with a meditation on suchness, the illusion-like daytime appearances blend with the dream appearances of the night, and then dreams will arise as illusory bodies. One must mix and integrate[146] those illusory bodies in the luminous clarity [that arises during the meditative stabilities] of instant and subsequent dissipation. In particular, one applies the example of night dreaming to the actual appearances of the day to ascertain their unreality and then meditates on that. By that one ascertains that the death appearances are dreams. Meditating in that way obviates the difficult passage of the intermediate state. Just as in a sleeping dream it might appear that one has died and wandered in the intermediate state and again taken rebirth, and yet none of that was real, in the same way the death and intermediate state and rebirth of actual appearance occur but they are merely like that, without any true nature. Ascertaining that is the breakthrough.

The yoga of luminous clarity (’od gsal ) is the heart of the path because the root of all practice is to realize that the abiding nature of all phenomena is naturally luminous clarity. The meaning of the name is that the inherent luminosity (rang ’od ) of the abiding nature clarifies [or illuminates] (gsal ) without restriction. Or “luminous clarity” is used because even though there is no intrinsic nature, there is spontaneously present luminous appearance (snang ba).[147]
Of many divisions, the twofold ones are the most prominent: example and actual; experience and realization; day and night; thin and thick; mother and child luminous clarity, and so forth. But there are also divisions into four or five, such as natural luminous clarity and so forth, as in The Concise Illumination of the Five Stages, where it speaks of four kinds of luminous clarity: natural, of meditative absorption, conceptless clarity, and ultimate. Ronyam Dorjé’s Guhyasamāja Commentary[148] describes five:
Natural luminous clarity is illustrated; the luminous clarity of sleep illustrates it; one familiarizes with luminous clarity of the path; connects with luminous clarity at the time of death; and the luminous clarity of dharmakāya is the result.
The Latter Authoritative Text[149] presents five kinds of luminous clarity and the times when they arise:
This luminous clarity is of five kinds:
Natural luminous clarity,
Luminous clarity arising as consciousness, Luminous clarity of meditative absorption, Luminous clarity of suchness, and Luminous clarity of realization.[150]
The times of those are five:
The time of death and of abiding in the central channel, When in meditative equipoise and in sleep,
When meditation and postmeditation become one taste, When higher insight is realized.
In short, the reality of the basic ground, which is free of extremes such as eternalism and nihilism, is objective luminous clarity. The realization of that reality just as it is is subjective luminous clarity. This simple layout comes from both sutra and mantra sources, so it is called “general luminous clarity.” What is taught in the mantra highest tantras is called “hidden meaning luminous clarity.” There are several arrangements because different names are used according to contexts. The example pristine awareness that is born during an empowerment and the luminous clarity of creation phase are similar to luminous clarity. All that arises from completion phase practice is genuine luminous clarity.
The real luminous clarity that is presented on this occasion is a special real luminous clarity that is made evident. Once the actual illusory body or a similitude is gathered in the two meditative absorptions, luminous clarity is made evident. That is the luminous clarity of training or beyond training, and there is no better luminous clarity than this.

Here we will present what must be practiced from among those divisions. First, the nature of luminous clarity at the time of the ground must be introduced for what it is. The minds of all sentient beings are naturally luminous clarity. That pervading principle of all phenomena is called “the primordial luminous clarity of the basic ground” (gzhi gdod ma’i ’od gsal).
Concerning this there are many philosophical positions according to intellectual abilities. The Sautrāntikas[151] assert that luminous clarity is consciousness merely being aware of its own object. The Cittamātrins[152] believe that it is reflexively aware, reflexively illuminated consciousness without subject-object dualism. The Mādhyamikas,[153] such as Pakpa Namdrol and Haribhadra,[154] make the mind’s emptiness of true existence the natural luminous clarity and then teach that itself as the buddha nature affinity.[155] In the final wheel of Dharma and the commentary on its viewpoint, the Highest Continuum, it is explained that the natural luminous clarity of mind and buddha nature are identical. This is not the same as the Cittamātrins, who believe that luminous clarity is the obscured neutral universal ground. Here it is held to be virtuous.
There are many defining characteristics, but in short, since the essence of mind is naturally pure of any stains it is called “luminous clarity.” If you wonder what the difference is between this and the mind’s nature of luminous clarity as asserted by the Cittamātrins and lower philosophical schools, the Highest Continuum[156] states:
Since it is subtle, it is not an object of study. Since it is the absolute, it is not thinkable. Since it is the profound nature of phenomena,
It is not the realm of meditation by the worldly and such.
There is a great difference in being or not being the object of worldly people’s study, reflection, and meditation.

In this context of the profound path of skillful methods of highest tantra mantra, there are four distinctive assertions about the mind’s nature of luminous clarity: appearances as mind, mind as reflexive awareness, reflexive awareness as great bliss, and great bliss itself as united with emptiness.
As for the stains that obscure that luminous clarity, in the causal vehicle it is, of course, held that once the objects [of attachment] are disproved,[157] from that time on the mind that fixates on them is relinquished and cast off. Here in the highest tantra vehicle, it is by seeing the nature of mind that the obscuring stains are relinquished as a matter of course. It is not asserted that afflictive emotions are relinquished once objects are disproved. This position is illustrated by the example of people afflicted with jaundice who perceive a white conch as yellow. Even if they know that in truth it is white, that knowledge does not prevent the yellow appearance. When the jaundice clears up, the mind that perceives yellow ceases automatically.
The method to see natural luminous clarity is taught in the “First Concise Account:”[158]
Just as fire that is always present in wood
Is not seen by means of cutting or splitting
But twirling the rubbing stick on its base by hand Makes what abides there become visible,
In that way, the luminous clarity of mind
Will not be seen by means of conceptual meditation.
It becomes visible by the joining Of purified left and right channels.
Thus, the luminous clarity of mind will be seen based on the profound completion phase yoga that binds the dualistic energy-mind of the right and left channels in the central channel. This, then, is the so-called ground luminous clarity, and it is clearly introduced by saying “mind’s nature is thus.”

In ascertaining luminous clarity at the time of the path, the general technique is to rest evenly in the very essence of luminous clarity. Telopa said:[159]
Rest relaxed within the uncontrived native state; Bonds are released and freedom is sure.
This and other such instructions are expressed unanimously by the mighty adepts. Accordingly, with the body in the seven-point posture of meditative stability, the mind rests without support, relaxed and uncontrived. This will create the unerring yogic direct perception of emptiness.[160] This is the ultimate esoteric instruction of the completion phase found in the profound tantras. The reason is that once the vital points of the vajra body, which is the support, are bound, the mind, eyes, and energy currents remain in a state of nonthought. Because of the special interconnection between body and mind, the movement in the right and left channels is stopped and immobilized within the central channel, causing the direct experience of mahāmudrā, emptiness with aspects.[161] Therefore the luminous mind, which is the supported, is realized as empty appearance arising as the mahāmudrā of forms of emptiness. This, again, depends on the dissolution of the energy currents of the right and left channels in the central channel, the supreme support. There is no more profound method for affecting this dissolution than resting the mind once it is uncontrived and relaxed. Therefore, in all the esoteric instructions of highest tantra, this is called “the esoteric instruction of withdrawal” in the presentations.[162]
There is a special instruction for using a direct forceful method to identify luminous clarity. Through the profound meditative absorption in which the pure mandala of the environment and its inhabitants dissolves into luminous clarity, the energy currents of the moon, sun, and rāhula[163] are held at the heart center, causing luminous clarity to arise at the end of the three lights. If one trains in this right before going to sleep, one will easily recognize luminous clarity in sleep. If one recognizes that, one will also recognize the luminous clarity at death. Therefore it is known as the esoteric instruction that combines the three types of luminous clarity.
In addition, binding the vital points of the support and supported[164] will reveal the luminous clarity of the outer, inner, and common manifest awakenings.[165]

Outer manifest awakening
The predawn sky is naturally totally pure; it transcends even the darkness of the interval when the moon’s light has set and the sun’s light has not yet risen. Likewise, having transcended the elaborated, unelaborated, and even the middle—illustrated by the sun, moon, and interval—the strength of wisdom does not conceive of anything at all like beginning, end, or in between. This teaching is held in common with the causal vehicle and is called the “outer manifest awakening.”

Outer and inner [manifest awakenings]
In terms of recognizing luminous clarity based on another’s body, the arising of the sun of warmth, skillful methods with passion, is the experience of increase. The arising of the moon of bliss, wisdom without passion, is light. And the center, the interval that is neither one of those, is full culmination.[166] Beyond that is the experience of great bliss, from which arises the luminous clarity of an instant in which the three times are not conceived in any way. Since this is also in creation phase, it is not the experience of the pristine awareness of luminous clarity that comes about from the force of actualizing the four empties internally,[167]
but is nevertheless the manifest awakening through the force of connection with an awareness-consort. Therefore, it is referred to as common to both outer and inner manifest awakenings. That is because in addition to the presence of all the pure manifest awakenings described in the causal vehicle, luminous clarity is recognized at the climax of the three lights based on a spiritual partner.

Inner manifest awakening
In the first awakening, the karmic energy currents for the most part dissolve into the wind energy currents,[168] and one sees light with five colors like a mirage. The second is when concepts associated with desire dissolve and there is the [experience of] light, like the arising of moonlight in a cloudless sky. The third is when anger dissolves and there is the increase of light, like the arising of sunlight. The fourth is when stupidity dissolves and there is the culmination of light, which is like the pervasion of darkness of the interval [between moonlight and daylight]. The fifth is when all consciousness dissolves, and there is an instant of luminous clarity free of darkness. Since it is free from the darkness of perceived and perceiver (or subject and object), the luminous clarity of reality manifests to the eyes of nonconceptual pristine awareness. It is like someone without eye disease seeing through the true nature of illusory strands of hair.
The Eighth Lord, Karmapa Mikyö Dorjé, gave special oral instructions in this context for “manifest awakening when the consciousnesses are absorbed” (rnam shes sdud pa mngon byang) and “manifest awakening when pristine awareness arises” (ye shes ’char ba mngon byang).
Now, as for applying this to practice, first one develops the recognition of the causal luminous clarity that has not yet been recognized. From the Oral Teachings of Mañjuśrī:[169]
The minds of embodied beings are refined
When thoroughly familiar with experiences
That occur in mere moments of death, faint, sleep,
Yawning, and sexual union.

In general, there are five occasions that are explained in connection with the arising of luminous clarity. Of those, take the luminous clarity at the time of sleep as an example. The training is to recognize the emptiness of everything, which is the last of the four empties, by uniting [meditation on] the five seed-syllables in the avadhūti.[170] The essence of that luminous clarity is the sleep that occurs after the moments of consciousness before sleep has dissolved and before dream thoughts and energy-influenced sleep, during which there arise moments of consciousness in dreams that are similar to the earlier daytime states of consciousness that dissolved as one fell asleep. For ordinary people, that sleep in between daytime consciousness and dreams is obscured by stupidity. But for yogins it is the nonconceptual dharmakāya—the pure pristine awareness of nondual bliss-emptiness—arising as luminous clarity like the core of a candle flame or the brilliant autumn sky. Nevertheless, since the three lights are impure, these are not the final experiences of luminous clarity that are a direct perception of the ultimate truth. Therefore this should be known as example luminous clarity.[171]
Concerning example and real luminous clarity, example luminous clarity is that which is free from the manifestations of the two obscurations that are based on the delusion of sleep. It occurs through the force of gathering the energy-mind in the heart center by means of two kinds of meditative stability, and so forth. Real luminous clarity is ground luminous clarity freed from incidental stains. It occurs when the powerful luminous clarity of the path has eliminated even the seeds of the two obscurations, which are the factors to be eliminated during the paths of seeing and meditation in relation to the delusion of sleep.
In this way, when sleep has been refined by luminous clarity, the seeds of concepts of the aggregates and constituents are killed off. Then, like Lavāpa, if one performs the conduct of a bhasuku, one will achieve the illusory-like form in this very life.[172]

The methods for stabilizing luminous clarity once it has been recognized by the esoteric instructions for recognizing are as follows. The interdependent connection or method of absorption of energy-mind causes the inner heat to blaze. This brings about the realization of the bliss-emptiness of the melting bodhicitta. One arises as the illusory form following the signs of energy-mind of the three lights with luminous clarity. In order to manifest the real luminous clarity, the very subtle energy-mind must enter into luminous clarity by means of the three types of conduct and the two types of meditative stability. The three types of conduct will be explained below.[173]
The two types of meditative stability will be explained according to the Five Stages and the Lamp Summary of Conduct. The instant [meditative stability] (ril ’dzin) is withdrawal all at once, as illustrated by the vanishing of the condensation that forms when one breathes on a mirror. Subsequent dissipation (rjes gzhig) is the gradual withdrawal as illustrated by the ice on a river or pond. Once the illusory body is allowed into luminous clarity through those two kinds of meditative stability, it will re-arise as a body that follows a reverse order of manifestation. That support of the trained illusory body will manifest the illusory body without training. As stated in the Full Awakening of Vairocana:[174]
This rainbow-like body
Will be obtained by meditating on this very thing.
To put this into practice, one trains in the joining and re-arising of the two types of meditative stability, with the three gates of oneself and all sentient beings as inseparable from the three vajras and their indestructible sounds. That will dispel the manifest aspects of the two obscurations contained in the supported vital essences and their mount, the karmic energy currents. Then the clear autumn sky of luminous clarity will arise like the sky at dawn, free from the three adulterating conditions.[175] When familiarization with that is perfected, the recognition of luminous clarity will be stable.

The guru points out just how one’s own mindstream is luminous clarity primordially present as the ground. Using the daytime and nighttime luminous clarity as the path, one will perfect the realization of the actual result, the abiding nature. That is the resulting luminous clarity. It is the same as the stage of union that is stated in the Latter Authoritative Text:[176]
From the actualization of luminous clarity, From that, union arises.
This shows that the perfection of luminous clarity is [the state of primordial] union. In this context, the exalted Marpa says:
Example luminous clarity is the pristine awareness that manifests by relying on another’s body, that of a wisdom consort. Real luminous clarity is the pristine awareness that arises when the universal ground dissolves into luminous clarity in the interval of full culmination. The essence of luminous clarity itself is that it is the space-pervading vajra awakening of all buddhas. The excellent quality of luminous clarity is that it frees from all tendencies to perpetuate bad states by clearing away the veiling darkness of full culmination, and it produces the dharmakāya and rūpakāya, which abide neither in samsara nor nirvana.
Those few words of vast meaning convey the whole corpus on the cause, path, and result of luminous clarity in its entirety.

This yoga provides assurance about the path because it actualizes the state of union in the intermediate state of existence (srid pa bar do) through the single-minded assurance that was created by the practices of luminous clarity and illusory body. It is called “intermediate state” (bar do) because it does not fall into either side or because it abides in the middle between (bar) the former and the latter. It is classified in numerous ways, such as the following.
The exalted Milarepa listed six intermediate states:
(1) the ultimate intermediate state of reality
(2) the natural intermediate state of the path
(3) the appearing intermediate state of birth and death
(4) the intermediate state of dream and sleep
(5) the final intermediate state of existence
(6) the rebirth intermediate state of a continuum.
Milarepa also taught a division of eight intermediate states to Gampopa:
(1) the intermediate state of view
(2) meditation
(3) conduct
(4) dream
(5) creation and completion
(6) vital points
(7) three kāyas
(8) result.
Lord Rechungpa taught six:
(1) view
(2) meditation
(3) result
(4) with and without passion
(6) with and without faults
(7) the intermediate state of words and meanings.
Lord Khachöpa[177] referred to four:
(1) the unified intermediate state of the four kāyas
(2) the reflexive awareness intermediate state of pristine awareness
(3) the temporal intermediate state of intrinsic nature
(4) the unerring intermediate state of interdependence.
The Easy Guide to the Wish-fulfilling Heart of the Intermediate State[178] gives four:
Eradicate the intermediate state of birth and cessation,
Equalize the intermediate state of self and other,
Recognize the intermediate state of coming and going,
Steer clear of the intermediate state of being and nonbeing.
Of all these, Lord Marpa’s summary of three is widely known:
The appearing intermediate state of birth and death,
The dream intermediate state of sleep,
The final intermediate state of existence.
The first two of these are practiced as the path in the four root dharmas. So of all those divisions of the intermediate state, the topic of the exposition at hand, that is, the yoga that provides assurance, relates to the intermediate state of existence.

The Compendium of Abhidharma[179] states:
Like the rising and falling of scales in a balance
Is the death transference and rebirth [of consciousness].
This is saying that the cessation of death existence and the deluded intermediate state existence occur at the same time. So once beings have died and not yet taken birth, it is referred to as the “intermediate existence.” The characteristics [of a being in the intermediate state] are described in the Lamp Summary of Conduct:[180]
Beings totally relinquish their aggregates by stages as they enter the mandala of ultimate truth. Aroused by the wind constituent, they have sensation and are thoroughly bound by existence. They fully possess recollection, produced from causes concordant with the realm of reality. Having minds in the form of virtue and nonvirtue, they are the same as five-yearold children. They see everything and all of their faculties are whole. They partake of the food of gandharvas. Vajras and such cannot repel them. They are endowed with all characteristics. They possess the power of miraculous action. After they remain in the interim of transference for seven days, the virtuous or unvirtuous karma that comes from their own thoughts multiplies. Having obtained the causes and conditions, like a watermill again and again they will take rebirth as the five kinds of beings and experience the subsequent suffering of cyclic existence.
Thus, precise teachings were given in the descriptions of existence, and they are also clearly explained in a similar way in the early vehicle treatise, the [Abhidharma] Treasury.[181]

At the time of death, the four elements and all coarse and subtle appearances and thoughts dissolve. The four empties along with the outer and inner appearing signs arise. When that happens, it is blended with previous experiences from dharma practice, such as direct realization that happened during the instant or subsequent dissipation practices in recognizing luminous clarity.
Especially during the arising of the three lights and luminous clarity, one settles directly into the view that was introduced by the guru. If energy-mind dissolves into the central channel at the heart center during the luminous clarity of death, the elaborations of dualistic appearances will of course be completely quelled and something like the cloudless sky will arise. At that time, for those whose previous familiarization was excellent, it will be like meeting an old acquaintance or a traveler returning home. But even if one can settle in equanimity once that is recognized, it will not become the realization of the abiding nature without sustaining it by settling directly in the view with which one has earlier cut through doubts. Therefore, in this life one must exert oneself in the child or path luminous clarity,[182] which is to ascertain the view of emptiness and blend that in the meditation of great bliss.
Of course most people maintain that the ground luminous clarity of death is the mother and the meditation on the path luminous clarity during day and night is the child. According to the view of Lord Marpa, Mila, and others, however, the mother is the natural luminous clarity that is the abiding nature of all phenomena, while the child is the lucid arising of meditative absorption in this waking state that comes from the interdependent connection of the gathering of the five quintessences. That is because there is a connection between what is created and what creates it.

In any case, if one is able to combine one’s familiarity with the four empties from the gathering of the vital energy in the central channel now in the waking state with the luminous clarity of deep sleep, then one will be able to blend the mother and child luminous clarity during the basic death state through the force of the energy currents. If one can do that, then one will undoubtedly recognize the arising of the intermediate states subsequent to that, and so it is a most sublime method of recognizing the intermediate state.
Once the dissolution process concludes, the white and red vital essences blend. The potency of the channels, energy currents, vital essences, and mind and all of the quintessences coalesce in the center of the heart and the meditative absorption of emptiness, clarity, and great bliss is born. At that point the heat of inner heat, fanned by the energy currents of pristine awareness, burns up all obscurations. The vital essence of quintessential bodhicitta stirs. For yogins and yoginīs who have practiced the path luminous clarity, the power of their previous familiarity robs all the strength from delusion and obscuration in the supreme central channel. The rāhula of vajra pristine awareness devours all manifesting seeds of the dualistic sun and moon.[183] Meditating at that point, the essence of the luminous clarity of the realization that arose during whichever was the primary meditation—bliss, clarity, or nonthought—based on the luminous clarity of the previously mentioned occasions will at this time be intensified. The two obscurations will be conquered instantly by its power and one will attain freedom over the perfection of the two accumulations, like a wealth lord enjoying his wealth. Then, as is said, “bliss is saṃbhogakāya and clarity is nirmāṇakāya and nonthought is dharmakāya.” This refers to enlightenment in the essence of the three kāyas as explained in the direct guides on the five stages by previous masters. This is the infallible interdependent connection between the vajra body and mind.
That pristine awareness of realization is, of course, referring to the undifferentiated three kāyas. But in this context, since the luminous clarity of death mainly accomplishes the dharmakāya, we take it to mean that.

That same luminous clarity of the first intermediate state occurs at the time of death for all sentient beings possessed of six constituents.[184] However, those without some familiarity with the vital points of the esoteric instructions fail to recognize it or, if they do, they cannot remain with it. In those circumstances, the group of the five gathered quintessences comes apart and disappears. Then consciousness and its mount, the vital energy current (srog rlung), leaves through whichever of the nine orifices is appropriate.[185] As soon as awareness separates from the corporeal body, it immediately raises up as a mental body of the intermediate state. That birth is the actual defining moment of the intermediate state of existence. The defining characteristics [of the beings in this intermediate state] are as described before. On this occasion, most beings will be stricken by four frightening sounds,[186] three terrifying abysses,[187] and other such unspeakable horrors that are the apparent delusional manifestations of the habitual patterns of unwholesome minds. For people who have created some merit, those perverse appearances will not arise. Rather they will have pure visions of being welcomed by gods rendering service and such, and will proceed from one pleasantry to the next.
To make that intermediate state into an experience of the path, it must be recognized. In order to recognize it by means of the six definite signs, such as possessing miraculous action and so on,[188] one must apply whatever dharma practice one is familiar with—whether śrāvaka training, mahayana awakening mind, mantra creation phase, yogic view, and so on—to whatever positive or negative appearances arise. Just recalling that training will protect from fear and automatically liberate from danger. Therefore, one should not stray into those usual deluded appearances for even a moment. Keeping awareness in its true mind-state will strengthen consciousness and provide control over the energy currents. At that time, deluded appearances may arise fleetingly, but they will be taken as the path.

For practice to occur at a time like that, it is extremely important to be thoroughly familiar with it. Therefore, one should think, “right now is the intermediate state,” and integrate that with dharma practice. Particularly when frightening or painful kinds of circumstances occur, one can imagine that they are the deluded appearances of the intermediate state. Then one either rests within that state of suchness or meditates intently on their illusory nature, the lack of true existence. From time to time, one applies intermediate state training intently in the present moment, such as by examining whether the six definite signs of the intermediate state are present or not. Recognizing the intermediate state and meditating on it as the path are more effective than other methods. As Lord Nāropa taught:
In this intermediate state, the body, which combines energy and mind, is a most excellent support because the phenomena consistent with the saṃbhogakāya have been present in it since the beginning. Furthermore, consciousness in a dream is seven times clearer than during daytime appearances, and the intermediate state consciousness is seven times clearer than in the dream, so it is easier to change. Since the consciousness has no support, it is difficult to stabilize mindful intention. But if one can maintain mindfulness, traversing the path will be troublefree. Meditating for one session in that intermediate state may be liberating.
However, an individual of the highest capacity need not depend on this kind of technique. It is taught in the Lamp Summary of Conduct and Oral Teachings[189] and others that in place of the intermediate state that occurs at the end of the dying process for others, these [people of highest capacity] will attain a saṃbhogakāya illusory body and become enlightened on the basis of that.
That process is to identify the stages of death with its three lights and rest in equipoise for a while in that luminous clarity. Then, as the three lights in reverse order are about to arise, to revive oneself by the recollection that will incur the arising of the illusory body. That is, to arise instantly in the illusory body of the empty appearance of the deity’s form. Again, since that is refined by the ultimate luminous clarity, it surpasses the intermediate state existence of impure cyclic existence.
When one arises from luminous clarity, the three lights in reverse order together with the pristine awareness energy currents will arise as the body of union instantly, like a fish leaping out of water. That is why the previous masters said, “the lazy awaken in the intermediate state.”

Those who are not liberated in the second intermediate state will wander in the intermediate state anywhere from one week at the least to seven weeks at the most. Since they have no body in the intermediate state existence they become very distressed and then, as four-name vagabonds,[190] their consciousness is dragged around by energy currents and habitual patterns. Out of control, they seek a place to take birth, devouring smells.[191] Roaming around the entrance to wombs, the five karmic energy currents stir and the five toxic emotions gather. From the interdependent relationship of mind and appearance there may arise the five light-paths of perfection,[192] the good and bad wombs of six types of beings, or the appearances of four types of birthplace. When these happen, one focuses on the vital points of whatever dharma practice is familiar. As the cause, one will uncontrollably enter the light-paths of perfection. As condition, it brings to mind the meditative absorption that inhibits the notions of one who enters and the entry place in those who would take birth at this rebirth juncture. If nothing prevents it, then the choice of womb entrance will be as stated in the Verses on the Path of Method:[193]
Fourth is choosing a womb entrance. Those whose training is very weak
In birth, death, and dream intermediate states,
If they cannot attain awakening in the intermediate state, Should apply instructions for choosing a womb.
As impetus, do this:
Form a strong resolve with thoughts Of miraculously taking birth
In the pure land of Bliss Or in the Lotus pure land.
Form a resolve by thinking,
“Even if I must enter a mother’s womb, May I take a meritorious body
That can benefit sentient beings, Or be a Brahmin or world ruler.”
Wherever you direct your thoughts Is where you will undoubtedly go,
Like [the firing of] a catapult or mechanism. One should engage with the same attitude As the bodhisattvas. So it is said.
Meditating on the instructions in that body,
One will attain buddhahood in one body in one lifetime.
With this good support one can continue with the remainder of the path and strive to attain awakening as nirmāṇakāya in various rebirths.

Transference is called the escort (skyel ma) on the path because it liberates those of highest, medium, or lowest faculties from obstructions to taking a supportive rebirth to further their karmic continuity on the path. It is called “transference” (’pho ba) because one traverses to another state, or because it takes one somewhere despite the lack of inherent nature. The Latter Authoritative Text explains eleven divisions:
There is a great deal of division in transference:
Transference as training, and meditative absorption,
Transference by exertion and vital energy,
Transference by physical exertion,
Transference of consciousness to the guru,
Transference in forceful methods,
Transference to dharmakāya without elaboration,
Transference to rūpakāya with elaboration,
Transference to the saṃbhogakāya,
Transference to the nirmāṇakāya,
Transference to the ḍākinī that is pleasant.
Many early works give three divisions as the transference of dharmakāya, saṃbhogakāya, and nirmāṇakāya. Another threefold list is transference as training, transference of physical adjustment, and transference in forceful methods. Again, there is transference by substance, the force of energy currents, and meditative absorption. Twofold divisions are transference to a higher state and entrance into a residence; and with or without a support, and so on. Lord Khachö Wangpo spoke of three divisions: “ultimate transference of the ultimate great secret, innate transference of the native state, and luminous appearance transference of magical display.” There are limitless such divisions.
The purpose of this path is very significant, as stated in Oral Teachings:[194]
Using this ritual, any sentient being Will become liberated by it,
Even those who commit acts of immediate consequence
Or ignorantly kill a Brahmin every day.
However, this refers to those who may have committed sinful actions in this life but again take empowerments and keep their sacred pledges properly, first practice creation phase, and then do the special completion phase applications of channels and energy currents. Common evildoers who do a bit of energy training and transference visualization will not gain the genuine results of the training, though some benefit will accrue due to the blessings of the visualization.

Transference is said to be the instruction for awakening without meditating. This means that with the especially profound esoteric instructions of transference, even great evildoers who would otherwise fall into bad existences can sometimes postpone the results of negative action and take an excellent rebirth in a higher realm that supports mantra practice. From that point of view, with the special support for accomplishing buddhahood, one will attain just that. There is also the idea that one will accomplish it gradually through practice, based on that support. Is that the same thing? It says in Oral Teachings:
In case you do not attain the three kāyas,
You will most likely become an awareness-holder And gradually attain mahāmudrā.
Thus one attains the state of awareness-holder through transference, and in that life as awareness-holder meditates on the rest of the path and attains a state such as the first spiritual level that can be referred to by the conventional term “buddha.” It is also explained as carrying this intention.
To accomplish the authentic yoga of transference, one refines the yoga of vase-breathing, causing the downward-expelling energy current to ignite the blazing fire of inner heat. Using the force of the energy current, one must be able to move the indestructible energy-mind at the heart from its own abode as far as the crown of the head (gtsug tor) and pierce it. The Vajraḍāka states,
The limits of abiding must be purified.
Once purified, if the existence to be transferred Goes elsewhere, it is meaningless.
Binding the doors of vase-breathing,
The apertures of the doors will be purified.
This is also taught in the Catuḥpīṭha and Sampuṭa tantras. According to the explanation by Bhavabhadra,[195] this means that the abode of joy and pain is the body and its limit is the ultimate central channel. If that channel is not purified by training with fire, energy, and resolve in the yoga of inner heat, then transference will not be accomplished and one will become exhausted for nothing.

One becomes familiarized with the profound vital point of uniting the wisdom that realizes the abiding nature just as it is and the meditative absorption that abides one-pointedly within that state. Then, as death approaches, when the signs of the progressive dissolution of the elements arise, one rests effortlessly without resting or a place to rest, directly upon the unmistaken view of suchness that is free of any reference to the three spheres: transferring, something to be transferred, and a destination. That will blend inseparably with the luminous clarity of the basic ground, like pouring water into water. Death, which is designated as the first intermediate state, is thus enlightenment in the dharmakāya.

This is for those of intermediate faculties who will not recognize the luminous clarity at the end of the three lights and the dissolution process of the death phase, or who might recognize it but cannot remain in it. They should revive themselves with their previous impetus by thinking, “I will rise up in the illusory body of saṃbhogakāya,” and rise up as the deity’s illusory form at the end of the three lights in reverse order. That itself also involves refinement through the process of ultimate luminous clarity. Once one manifests the illusory form of union—like a fish leaping out of the water—totally transcending the intermediate state of cyclic existence, it is called awakening in the saṃbhogakāya intermediate state. In this lineage, the previous masters have asserted that the first two transference practices and the first two intermediate state practices are no different.

When training has not been finalized but one suddenly faces death, one prepares by generating the resolve to awaken and devotion in the presence of a blessed support. Taking the posture of the tathāgata when entering nirvana and applying the seed-syllable of nonarising,[199] one enters into a pure realm. This is said to be a profound instruction that produces tremendous benefit for ordinary people and animals.

The Concise Illumination[202] states:
The conclusive, quick path is transference. Entering a residence is an auxiliary.
This is an auxiliary of transference to a higher pristine awareness. It is called “entering a residence” (grong ’jug) because the consciousness moves from the residence of one’s own body and enters into the residence of another’s unimpaired body that has died. This instruction is taught in a great many of the highest tantras. But an individual who undertakes this must be someone who has appropriately obtained the empowerment, properly maintained the vows and pledges, and trained in the creation phase, which is just like transference in general. In particular, it is taught in the root tantras and their commentaries, such as Vajraḍāka, Catuḥpīṭha, and Sampuṭa, that for all three kinds of transference—the special transference, one’s own consciousness entering another’s body, and ejecting another’s consciousness that enters into one’s own body— one needs abilities. One must have the ability to block the energy currents after placing letters at the nine orifices; the ability to insert the vital energy into the avadhūti once those orifices are refined through vase breathing; and the ability to evoke the hūṃ letter of consciousness with its mount of the subtle vital energy at the heart through the force of igniting the short a in the yoga of inner heat.
Why are those required? Once one sees that a body does not serve the welfare of oneself or others, one takes a better one. This applies to such cases as exchanging a support that is of an inferior class for a good class, a sick one for a healthy one, an old one for a young one, and so forth. Based on the new body, the impetus of the path is extended. Since it is the latter body that accomplishes it, this is also called “entering a residence to extend the path.” The practice of this is described in Vajra Lines of the Hearing Lineage:[203]
With mastery of energy mind, and stability of creation and completion,
Propel the consciousness seed-syllable into a flawless corpse. And in the Six Dharmas Combined,[204] Nāropa sings [to Marpa]:
When your body reaches its time limit
The vital point is to use a qualified object, the other condition. In between, the seed-syllable rides the horse of energy currents.
Through yogic exercise, the vital essences, energy currents, and mind
Vacate your body like an empty house.
The other’s body is the very essence of nirmāṇakāya. This is called “instructions for entering a residence.” Translator, are your energy currents workable?
Thus, first one trains, then checks it, and finally applies the activity. This will extend the impetus of practice.

The results of consummating the profound path in this way are the attainment of the common spiritual powers, such as the ten signs, eight qualities, eight accomplishments, four activities, and so on. The consummate supreme spiritual powers are the seven branches, eight sovereign qualities, four kāyas, five pristine awarenesses, and so on. In particular, the ultimate six dharmas will be actualized: (1) the unchanging union of bliss-emptiness; (2) the rainbow body free of obscuration in the manner of an illusion; (3) the discrimination of naturally arising appearance-emptiness; (4) the great pristine awareness, the infinite expanse of dharmakāya; (5) the saṃbhogakāya endowed with five certainties; and (6) the great realm of space in which there is nowhere to transfer.

This widely renowned tradition called “Incomparable Dakpo Kagyu” is reported to be no mere lineage of words but rather the lineage of ultimate meaning. This refers to the fact that it is an uninterrupted lineage of flawless realization of mahāmudrā. One’s root guru is thus whoever was the source of one’s mahāmudrā realization, and that practice system has not deteriorated right up until the present. Here we focus on the most famous instructions of this precious lineage, the mahāmudrā.
There are two well-known traditions. The one that is in common with the sutra tradition instructs one to rest in equanimity with luminous clarity as the object, without any mental fabrication on the part of the subject. The mantra tradition is the mahāmudrā of the union of bliss and emptiness, joined coemergence.[205] The pristine awareness arising from empowerment[206] and targeting the vital points of the vajra body makes it special.

In the teachings of Dakpo Rinpoché[207] he says:
The sourcebook of this mahāmudrā of ours is the Mahayana Highest Continuum composed by the transcendent conqueror Maitreya.
Furthermore, the powerful lord Maitrīpa,[208] having received the instructions of the Great Brahmin Saraha[209] and his spiritual heirs, composed works such as The Ten Verses on Suchness[210] that give the esoteric instructions of the perfections consistent with the mantra tradition. Upon listening to them, Lord Marpa said:
The essential meaning of the ultimate vehicle Free of limits, unfabricated by mind,
The dharma of mahāmudrā is introduced... (etc., up to:)
...This is the tradition held by the great lord Maitrīpa.
And Milarepa said:
Right now in the intermediate state between samsara and nirvana,
Mahāmudrā introduces the abiding nature.
Seek to ascertain the view, the basic ground.
The meaning of all these is expressed in terms of the view and meditation:
There is nothing at all to remove,
And not the slightest thing to be added.
Look genuinely at the genuine.
When genuinely seen, it is total liberation.[211]
And again from the Mahayana Highest Continuum:[212]
The [buddha nature] constituent is empty of incidental [stains],
Which have the characteristic of being separable from it. It is not empty of unsurpassed qualities,
Which have the characteristic of being inseparable from it.
That is to say, this luminous clarity that is mind’s nature has no stains at all that need to be removed because it is naturally without stains since the very beginning. There is not the slightest quality that was not there before that needs to be newly created and added because the essence of the qualities has existed inherently since forever. For these reasons, the buddha nature constituent is empty of artificial, incidental stains that have the characteristic of being completely separable from that essence. But the constituent is not empty of the unsurpassed buddha qualities, such as the ten powers, that are its own genuine nature and have the characteristic of being completely inseparable from it. For example, when a jaundiced person sees a white conch shell as yellow, the conch itself is empty of the projected yellow but not empty of the white.
Thus the desire to remove stains and the desire to add qualities are both obscuring conceptualizations of hope and fear and ought to be abandoned. The genuine suchness is the ordinary mind of the present moment, appearance and emptiness inseparable, neither true nor false. Without corrupting it with acceptance or rejection, one should look at just that suchness with the wisdom of one’s own reflexive awareness and meditate.

The “view” (lta ba) is to know and see with discernment. “Meditation” (sgom pa) is to rest one-pointedly within that without distraction. Concerning how to do this, the honorable Rangjung said:[213]
Everything is neither true nor false,
The wise deem it all to be like water-moons. This ordinary mind itself
Is called essence of the victors, the realm of reality.
And in order to clarify further, glorious Khachö Wangpo said:
This simple clarity of appearance-awareness in the present moment
Is the very face of the relative truth of phenomena.
If you know the vital point of this uncontrived norm,
Then the ultimate truth is also just this.
Scholars of scriptural sophistry cite the two truths
With many references and reasonings but miss the point. Holding the two as different violates the nondual.
The relative truth is the incidental stains, like the yellow projected on the conch. The ultimate truth is the buddha nature, like the white of the conch. That is, there is only an appearance perceived by a confused subject. Other than that, the object of the conch itself has no white or yellow to be added or removed. Therefore, the esoteric instruction is to rest undisturbed in the uncontrived state.
In short, what are called “samsara” and “nirvana” are posited only from the perspective of mere appearances in relative reality. The inherent nature of them both is luminous clarity free of elaboration, which is said to be “buddha nature” (bde bar gshegs pa’i snying po, Skt. sugatagarbha). Therefore, in the definitive meaning, mere appearance and its inherent nature are not divisible into separate things, like fire and its heat.
For that reason, the Mother [Perfection of Wisdom sutras] say such things as, “Form is empty; emptiness is form,” and so on.[214] The honorable Rangjung said:
Mahāmudrā, the abiding nature free of elaboration,
Is empty of all characteristics of conceptual elaboration.
Without fixation on its clarity, this pure inherent nature
Is called the buddha nature.

Concerning this, the dharma lord Sakya Panchen[215] asserted:
Mahāmudrā is not designated in the tradition of the perfections. The pristine awareness of mahāmudrā only arises from empowerment.
Adhering to this position, the bigshots broadcast much meaningless chatter, but as the master Jñānakīrti stated in Entry into Suchness:[216]
The other term for the Mother Perfection of Wisdom is mahāmudrā, because it is the very essence of nondual pristine awareness.
Not only did he explain the use of the term in both the perfection of wisdom taught in the sutras and the mahāmudrā of mantra, he also explained the designations of the names:
Those of the highest faculties who thoroughly exert themselves in the perfections can be truly possessed of mahāmudrā, even as an ordinary person, through meditating on calm abiding and higher insight. With this genuine realization, the signs of irreversibility will manifest.
Sahajavajra also explained it in a similar way, which will come up below.[217] Dakpo Rinpoché induced the realization of mahāmudrā even in beginners who had not received empowerment. Therefore this is the tradition of the perfections. These are instructions arising primarily from the Kadampa tradition. The esoteric instruction found in the second part of Joined Coemergent Mahāmudrā[218] written by the lord and those of this present system are similar in all respects. Even the stages of the four yogas are clearly explicated there.[219]
Accordingly, it is said that the majority in a congregation should be guided in the stages of the path as laid out by the Kadampas, while those who are extraordinary should be guided in the path of method that comes from Lama Mila. It is the former that is meant here. With this in mind, the honorable Lord Mikyö Dorjé said:
The authentic spiritual power of mahāmudrā in the Kagyu, the lineage of the great Nāropa that began with Vajradhara, is only attained by actualizing the example and authentic ultimate pristine awareness by means of the higher three supreme empowerments. The system of guidance in calm abiding and higher insight taught these days that is shared with the causal vehicle of the perfections comes from the lineage of the protector Atīśa. It is the esoteric instruction of The Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment. Lord Gampopa and the protector Pakmo Drupa have given this the name of “joined coemergent mahāmudrā” (phyag chen lhan cig skyes sbyor) just for the sake of those disciples in the degenerate age who would like a “really high” vehicle.
It has been the practice of most of Dakpo’s heart disciples to present the mahāmudrā instructions after having first bestowed the empowerment. This is the position of the customary path held in common by sutra and mantra.

In general, the conventional designation of the term mahāmudrā (phyag rgya chen po, “great seal”) is used only in the mantra vehicle. It means this: the state of union is “seal” (phyag rgya, Skt. mudrā), while its inherent nature that pervades all phenomena is “great” (chen po, Skt. maha[nt]) because no phenomena are beyond it. Here, the entire extent of outer appearances is the union of appearance and emptiness; the entire extent of inner awareness is the union of awareness and emptiness, and the entire extent of feelings when appearance and awareness meet is the union of bliss and emptiness. Of these, the first two are called “emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects” (rnam kun mchog ldan gyi stong nyid ) and the last is called “supreme and unchanging great bliss” (mchog tu mi ’gyur ba’i bde ba chen po). The name mahāmudrā is also used to describe emptiness and great bliss individually:
Beyond the reality of subtle particles, Of the nature of magical mirror images,
She who is endowed with the supreme of all aspects, To Lady Mahāmudrā I bow.
And:
Mahāmudrā is unchanging bliss.
The total perfect meaning is this: emptiness endowed with all aspects is the object to be known. When the knowledge of this emptiness in its entirety as unchanging great bliss is the knowing subject, then both object and subject are said to blend into one.
From the Supreme Original Buddha Tantra:[220]
Reflections arising from emptiness are the cause,
Bliss born from the unchanging is the result.
The result seals the cause,
And the cause also seals the result.
And:
The kāya of knower and known as one.
Initially, the time that this is actualized is when the fourth empowerment is received. Ultimately, the realization is when one obtains and consummates the state of Vajradhara endowed with seven aspects.[221]
Coemergence is twofold: Natural coemergence is the beginningless and endless existence of Vajrasattva in all animate and inanimate things, without any distinction of before or after. The coemergent bliss of melting is produced from the four joys arising successively from the sexual union of method and wisdom. This causes the engagement with the former, actual coemergence, so the same language is used.

The meditation method is not the mere conceptual meditation used on the path of inference, with the nonaffirming negation that is the result of logically analyzing and not finding anything. Rather, it is the path of actual nonconceptual experience, free of thoughts that fixate on anything in the unhindered [display of] appearance-awareness. Instructions can be found in Joined Coemergent Mahāmudrā[222] and the illusory body and luminous clarity yogas from the Six Dharmas. The meaning can be summed up by the phrase “maintain luminous clarity directly upon appearances.” Those skilled in this method will purify conceptual fixation on the reality of appearances and transform all appearance into forms of emptiness. The forms of emptiness—such as smoke and so on that appear during dark retreats and other practices—are merely signs and indications on this path of methods that cause the realization of the abiding nature itself that was not yet realized. What one must actually realize with absolute certainty is that all of these ordinary appearances, right here and now, are themselves forms of emptiness in every respect. Therefore, the teachings about there being nothing to add to the luminous clarity of buddha nature from the Highest Continuum[223] and the way to meditate on the mahāmudrā of inseparable appearance-emptiness in the mantra tradition must both be the same view of abiding nature as the middle way (dbu ma, Skt. madhyamaka). The middle way view is expressed as
To say “it exists” is an eternalistic view.
To say “it doesn’t exist” is a nihilistic view.
For that reason the wise do not dwell
In existence or nonexistence.[224]
And,
Not existent, not nonexistent, not both,
Also not the nonexistence of both—
Totally emancipated from these four extremes:
Such is the middle way known by followers.
The Eighth Lord, Karmapa Mikyö Dorjé, and his successors maintain “it is just that.”

The first of the three traditions is the sutra tradition or what later came to be held as the mahāmudrā that mixes ideas of sutra and mantra. In the Commentary on the Ten Verses on Suchness[225] by Master Sahajavajra it says:
In essence it is the perfection. It is consistent with mantra. Its name is mahāmudrā.

The abiding nature of the basic ground entity does not exist as the essence of either samsara or nirvana. It has no bias in any direction whatsoever and is free from all extremes of elaboration such as existence, nonexistence, eternalism, or nihilism. Therefore it is beyond the object of expression in speech or thought. From the beginning it has not experienced bondage through delusion or liberation through realization. Its vital point, which does not exist as a specifically characterized phenomenon,[227] pervades like space throughout all phenomena of samsara and nirvana. This is the abiding nature—mahāmudrā, the perfection of wisdom, buddha nature, the original buddha, the causal continuum, and so forth—many names are used in the sutras and tantras. It is nondual profundity and clarity, the absolute truth, the totally pure ground of purification, and the very essence of mind that has been explained and will continue to be explained. It is the abiding nature of all that is to be known.

Natural, perfectly pure luminous clarity is the vajra of mind. When its natural expressive energy is not aware of its own essence, the afflicted mind stirs from the universal ground. On the strength of that, awareness is taken to be a self and its reflexive appearance is taken to be an object; [this is] the basic subject-object split. Under the power of this dualistic perception, various karmic action and habitual patterns are accumulated, turning into an interlinking chain of delusion and endless drifting in cyclic existence. This mode of delusion is relative truth. It is the incidental stains of the mind that are to be refined away. Since they do not abide as its basic character, they appear and yet are not truly existent. Therefore, one can become liberated through the antidote of self-recognition.

All of samsara and nirvana comes from the total play of the mind. That itself abides naturally as the union of clarity and emptiness. Therefore, even though it is mere appearance, it is the great play of the three kāyas free from arising, abiding, and ceasing. That is, its unborn basic character is dharmakāya, its unhindered radiance is saṃbhogakāya, and its expressive energy arising as anything at all is nirmāṇakāya. All three are essentially inseparable and spontaneously present since forever. This is the way it is. By recognizing it, [one realizes that] the native state of all phenomena, suchness free of accepting, rejecting, adopting, or removing anything in the wheel of infinite basic space is the abiding nature of the ground. This is the recognition of the view of mahāmudrā.

At the time of the path, making the meaning of the view that one has ascertained into yoga is called mahāmudrā meditation. The great charioteers who founded this system laid out this process: in order to give rise to meditation that has not arisen before, one engages in [two sets of] four preliminary practices.[229] Once it has arisen, it is brought to the path by three introductions. Then there are the ways to enhance it and generate good qualities.

The Inconceivable Coemergence Tantra[230] states:
Mind itself is coemergent with dharmakāya. Appearance is coemergent with dharmakāya’s light. Appearance and mind inseparable are coemergent.
In accordance with the mighty spiritual adepts who commented on the meaning with limitless vajra speech, it is maintained that the introduction to coemergence is subsumed into three:
(1) Coemergent native mind itself is dharmakāya. That is introduced with calm abiding and higher insight. Calm abiding is practiced both with and without support. In higher insight there are three stages: revealing the essence, recognition, and introduction. These will dispel delusion on the path.
(2) Mind’s own expressive energy is coemergent with thought. The three methods of practicing with the abiding or moving of thoughts, back-toback thoughts, and cutting through ego-fixation will cause the thought process to blend with dharmakāya.
(3) Mind’s own radiance—appearance—is coemergent with dharmakāya’s own light. One conclusively distinguishes the reflexive appearances of uncontrived awareness and the deluded appearances of fixated mind. Realizing reality itself to be the play of the native state, delusion will arise as pristine awareness.

Always remembering that “renunciation is the foot of meditation,” “devotion is the head of meditation,” and “mindfulness is the body of meditation,”[231] the stages arising from skillful methods will produce the good qualities as enhancement of the practice.
Briefly, the absorption of meditative equipoise in this system is summarized into three methods: resting in freshness without distraction, resting loosely without meditation, and resting in the native state, unfabricated natural radiance. Through these ways of resting, all the conceptual elaborations in the three times are naturally liberated and subside into reality. This is the meaning of the three doors of total freedom.

When meditating like this, fixation on the emptiness of all phenomena is to stray in the basic nature. Being satisfied with the attainment of just a little understanding and experience of emptiness, and so discontinuing accumulation of merit and purification, is to stray on the path of emptiness. Once one has made emptiness the path, hope of fruition at some later time without understanding that the thing to reject and its antidote are inseparable is to stray in the antidote. And one can stray in the intellectually fabricated sealing of appearance with emptiness. These are the four areas of straying based on higher insight.
If one gets attached to the three experiences of bliss, clarity, and nonthought, then one will cycle into the three realms respectively and deviate from the spiritual path. These are the three deviations to avoid based on calm abiding. One must also escape the treacherous paths where emptiness, compassion, and cause and effect rise up as enemies.

Since the four joys are just an example of pristine awareness, real pristine awareness goes beyond them. Since the three conditions of bliss, clarity, and nonthought are meditative experiences, the innate countenance of realization transcends them. It is beyond even the objects of the three kinds of wisdom: the understanding from listening, the experience from contemplating, and the experiential perceptions from meditating. Once one has arrived at the vital point of meditation that is untouched by the mind of the big three afflictive emotions, the stages arise in any of three ways: gradually, by leaps and bounds, or all at once. With that connection, one will effortlessly traverse the inner levels and paths by way of the four yogas: one-pointedness, freedom from elaborations, one taste, and nonmeditation—each with the division into lesser, medium, and greater, making twelve in all.[232]
The stages of these four yogas are described in the Ali Kali Inconceivable Secret Tantra:[233]
The absorption of the majestic lion[234]
Clarifies consciousness as unmoving, one-pointed, and radiant. Reflexive pristine awareness is awakened from within.
Stabilized patience eliminates the suffering of the lower realms.
Second, by the illusory-like absorption,[235] In the great equipoise free of elaborations,
The inconceivable arises as the creative energy of absorption. Attaining warmth is gaining control over birth.
Third, by the absorption of heroic behavior,[236]
The tenth level realization of the single taste of many arises.
The heirs of the victors of three times act for the welfare of others. Having attained the peak, progress is uninterrupted.
Fourth, by the vajra-like absorption,[237] Diligence in the practice of nonmeditation
Leads to the pristine awareness of knowledge that sees the buddha realms,
The effortless, spontaneously present state of supreme dharma.

With the same intention, this was also taught extensively in the Descent to Laṅka Sutra.[238] The meaning has been clearly explained by the great Master Padmasambhava, Śāntipa, Nāropa, and others, with the Lord Dawö Zhönnu[239] (Gampopa) providing extensive elaboration. There are various ways of explanation found among all the extensive and concise arrangements done by the great spiritual adepts who hold the Kagyu lineage. Mainly, by dividing each of the four yogas into the understanding, experience, and realization of mahāmudrā, one gets twelve divisions. Each of those is further divided into lesser, middling, and greater degrees of attaining stability, making thirty-six in all. Alternatively, the four yogas each have mundane and supermundane calm abiding, and mundane and supermundane higher insight, making sixteen divisions. Dividing each of those by greater, medium, and lesser degrees of attaining stability, which become the three categories of excellent, low, and average, it makes forty-eight in all. To wrap up it all up into one, the omniscient Chen-nga Chökyi Drakpa[240] said:
In this context the four yogas according to the system of guidance in the mantra tradition of mahāmudrā are explained as the pristine awareness of mahāmudrā that is the essence of the four descending and ascending joys. In terms of the system of guidance common to both sutra and mantra, it refers to the mode of arising of mahāmudrā experiences similar to these four joys.
Concerning the terms “understanding” (go ba), “experience” (nyams), and “realization” (rtogs), the Eighth Lord Mikyö Dorjé stated in his Hundred Thousand Expressions of Mahāmudrā:[241]
The view and meditation of whatever is to be realized has three parts: understanding, experience, and realization. Understanding occurs when what is to be realized becomes an object of wisdom through hearing and contemplating the terms and concepts. Experience occurs when what is to be realized is held as the frame of reference and then becomes the object of wisdom resulting from meditation in the abiding aspect of that mental focus. Realization occurs when one transcends the aspect of calm abiding of mere one-pointedness resulting from meditation that mentally grasps what is to be realized as the object, and instead makes it the object by thorough discrimination of wisdom with or without thought.

The view is that the abiding nature of the ground is both appearance and mind dwelling inherently as the three kāyas. Cutting off all doubts about this meaning, one will reach an irrevocable understanding through the direct introduction. One gains experience of this through the meditation of settling the mind without contrivance directly in its own state, the abiding nature. This is enhanced by the conduct that arises automatically as a result of unhindered emptiness and compassion in union. The realization of the intrinsic nature of the abiding nature manifests, and when it is perfected, that is the fruition. Buddha is found in the mind. By encountering the very face of the three kāyas, dharmakāya mahāmudrā is no longer a wish for the future but is attained right now.
This gradual path accords with Dakpo Rinpoché’s dream visions and Milarepa’s prophecies. Dakpo Rinpoché said, “With these Kadampa teachings I can benefit many beings,” and, “Now whatever bit of good I have done for sentient beings is due to the kindness of the Kadampa lamas.” Once he dreamt that by beating a drum many wild deer came to listen and he fed them milk.[242] These and other reasons caused him to remain with this system of guidance. This is because we have reached the age where degeneration is rampantly increasing and there are progressively fewer individuals with the fortune to practice the extraordinary vajrayāna. However, those of lesser fortune and duller faculties can be guided by the gradual stages of the path of the three types of individuals and ultimately evolve into disciples of the highest fortune and become worthy recipients of the extraordinary mantra. They can gain liberation in one lifetime or, even if not, a great many of them will see the meaning of mahāmudrā and thereby enter the irreversible path through this method. This is the intention.
Therefore, this method of guidance has been upheld from the reverend lord Gampopa himself until the present time and has been the customary practice for guiding all disciples whether of greater or lesser fortune. In addition, when the fortunate ones are taught mantra’s profound path of method, these instructions are named “instructions at the time of the cause,” or “foundational teachings.” About this, the great reverend one of Jonang[243] said such things as
These days the so-called abiding nature mahāmudrā
Is a meditation sequence in the sutra tradition of the final turning.
For the different levels of faculties it is congruent with mantra,
And so it becomes like a lamp for beings.
It is similar to the path with result practitioners’ three appearances.[244]

The famous “great bliss mahāmudrā” (bde chen phyag rgya chen po) comes from the traditional methods of the highest inner tantras. It arises from the paths of skillful methods, which include the conferral of the supreme empowerment, the self-blessing, the stages of mudra practice, and so on. The mighty Marpa said:
The essence of the completion phase is that great bliss arises based on bliss.
And from the second chapter [of the Hevajra Tantra], “The Examination of Illusion,” it says:[245]
In this yoga of the completion phase Bliss is called “great bliss.”
The etymology is that since pristine awareness really arises it is called “completion phase” (rdzogs rim). The one from Puṣpahari [Nāropa] said:
It is impossible for pristine awareness not to arise when at this time your body is put in this posture and your mind is focused like this.
These are the divisions: The bases of refining are the waking state with many ordinary thoughts, deep sleep, the dreaming of many dreams, and sexual union with an ordinary person. The refining agents are mahāmudrā based on inner heat, mahāmudrā based on luminous clarity, mahāmudrā based on illusory body, and experience based on action-mudra. Thus according to this teaching it will be realized from the meditation on the instructions of the Six Dharmas of glorious Nāropa, and so forth.

More profound than the previous two, this path to forcefully realize the profound essence is extraordinarily amazing and incredible. Just the descent of blessings in the vajra pristine awareness empowerment bestowed by a realized guru on a fortunate student of the highest and sharpest faculties awakens ordinary mind in his or her innermost heart, causing realization and liberation to occur at the same time. Since it does not depend on elaborate techniques or strenuous training, it is this that really occurs in the prolific[246] liberation stories and legends of the great spiritual adepts of the four greater and eight lesser Kagyu lineages who had arrived at the higher levels. And this is the way it is described in Indrabhūti’s Accomplishment of Pristine Awareness:[247]
Conferral of the vajra pristine awareness empowerment
That attains the sublime excellent pristine awareness of
Thoroughly abandoning all thought
Brings accomplishment of the supreme spiritual power.
If you have all genuine pristine awarenesses
But still take empowerments elsewhere,
Using mandalas that are drawn,
This will damage your sacred pledge.
The sufferings of damaged pledges
Are that your body and likewise your mind
And all functions will deteriorate
And very quickly death will come.
Once you are dead, you will taste
The suffering of hell for millions of aeons. Even when you escape from that place
You will be born as an outcaste or in a low caste,
As a deaf person or a mute, Blind in lifetime after lifetime. You will take such birth,
Of this there is no doubt.
The pristine awareness of all the tathāgatas Is explained as “pristine awareness.”
When the wise confer its empowerment, This is what empowerment is all about.
So it is taught extensively. It is in this way that ripening and liberation arise simultaneously for those of highest faculties in this unsurpassable, supreme path.

The lord of beings Pakmo Drupa,[248] who was really the sugata Krakucchanda (“Samsara Destroyer”), condensed all the meanings of the Three Baskets and the tantra collections into five practice systems and taught them publicly to an assembly of five thousand of the most excellent assembly. While the others did not find certainty in the profound meaning, the protector of the world Drigungpa [Jikten Sumgön],[249] took these teachings to his heart like a vase filled to the brim and put them into practice. He understood that each of these systems could immediately and ultimately relieve all sickness and obstacles and produce all supreme and common good qualities without hindrance. Whatever profound and vast proclamations of the Buddha’s word one may find, they all point to this same meaning. The so-called Ten Dharmas Three Dharmas (bcu chos gsum chos) also teach this vital point, for it is the great treasury of the speech of all tathāgatas.
As for the way to practice, as is said:
Practice the dharma
Of awakening mind, the yidam deity, The guru, mahāmudrā,
And dedication.
Of these five—awakening mind, devotion, creation phase, completion phase, and dedication—the first and the last are common to all vehicles, but the middle three are practices that are exclusive to the secret mantra. Therefore, it is said:
Mahāmudrā is like a lion, But blind if it lacks the five.
At the time of the ground, the vital point aims at the five afflictive emotions. At the time of the path, five special aftereffects are produced. The five classes of negative spirits are pacified and the five kinds of beings are subdued. At the time of fruition, five kāyas and five pristine awarenesses arise.[250]
When one attains stability in those, everything becomes mahāmudrā. Awakening mind without frame of reference, the deity’s body of inseparable appearance-emptiness, samsara and nirvana as the play of the guru, mahāmudrā of inseparable awareness-emptiness, and the dedication with threefold perfect purity, and so on, can be aptly called awakening mind mahāmudrā, deity mahāmudrā, devotion mahāmudrā, abiding nature mahāmudrā, dedication mahāmudrā, and so on. Abiding in this meaning, then, is widely renowned as “possessing the Fivefold Mahāmudrā.”[251]

The sixth buddha to come, Siṃhanāda (“Lion’s Roar”), abides in bodhisattva activity as the glorious Karmapa Rangjung Rolpai Dorjé.[252] Impartially, he turned the dharma wheel of the reality of Body, Speech, and Mind, and the four vital points. Miracles of accomplishment pervaded all the realms. The root of all these dharma doors that are revealed continuously throughout the three times is this: Individuals of lesser intellect should train their mindstreams with the four preliminary teachings. Those of medium faculties should train in the postures as the vital point of the body, the vital energy control as the vital point of the energy currents, visualization as the vital point of the mind, and the physical training as the vital point of yogic exercise. The root of all four of these is the yoga of inner heat with its bliss-heat. When that occurs, individuals of the highest faculties are introduced to the three kāyas and guided on the genuine path of instantaneous mahāmudrā.
Furthermore, [when Nāropa said to Marpa], “In the lower floor of Pullahari, unhindered nirmāṇakāya rains down,” it was the symbolic indication for the introduction to nirmāṇakāya in relation to relative awakening mind. “In the middle floor of Pullahari, saṃbhogakāya indicates with symbols” was the symbolic indication for the introduction to saṃbhogakāya in relation to energy control. There was no symbolic indication for the introduction to dharmakāya in relation to the vital point of the natural resting in the native state because that transcends designations. The infinite realization of mahāmudrā is naturally occurring pristine awareness. It is said that this very sequence of practice, even if cultivated for only seven days before death, will not fail to bring one to the level of Vajradhara.[253]

In the glorious Drukpa Kagyu tradition, the very famous Upper Drukpa are known for the Eight Great Guidances and the Eight Lesser Guidances. “And so forth” above in the root text indicates the Lower Drukpa, who emphasize and explain the Fivefold Capability, the six cycles of the root Kagyu traditions, and so on.[254]
The basis for the famous name “Glorious Drukpa” came from the dharma lord Tsangpa Gyarepa.[255] He taught three cycles of mahāmudrā: the Cycle of Words of Explanation, the Cycle of Instructions for Practice, and the Cycle of Blessings for Realization.[256] There were six cycles of vital points on the path of method: the Cycle of Vital Points of Mixing and Transferring in the Six Dharmas, the Cycle of Mentally Striking Down Livelihood, the Cycle of Pervasive Engagement and Rejection, the Cycle of Actualizing Realization, the Cycle of Vital Oral Instructions, and the Cycle of Making Concepts the Path and Expelling Disease.[257] In the teachings of Equal Taste,[258] there is the Treasure Treasury with Sealed Command, The Further Treasury, Mind’s Mirror, and the Secret Treasury, Opening the Hidden Eye. [Tsangpa Gyaré said,] “Interdependent relation is our system.”[259] He opened up and explained all of the chariot traditions of the profound path of great devotion.
The Eight Great Guidances of the Upper Drukpa are (1) Guidance on the Profound Path of Devotion, (2) Guidance on the Joined Coemergent Mahāmudrā, (3) Guidance on the Special Path of Methods, (4) Guidance on the Reverse Meditation on Secret Conduct, (5) Guidance on Training in Pure Realms of Sacred Outlook, (6) Guidance on Suppressing the Eight Worldly Concerns, (7) Guidance on Love and Compassion, and (8) Guidance on Causality and Interdependence.[260]
The second helper of the doctrine of Upper Drukpa was Gyalwa Yangönpa.[261] He composed the Mountain Dharma Trilogy consisting of the Cycle of Origination that teaches the necessity of all the practice teachings to accomplish, the Cycle of Hidden Explanation that clearly teaches the abiding nature of the vajra body, and the Cycle of Liberation from the Treacherous Path of the Intermediate State that brings death onto the path.[262] The first is the root, like the body, that is the three dharmas. The extensions, like the limbs, are the nine dharmas. The profound meaning, like the heart, is the six dharmas. The cherished, like the life force, is the six dharmas. The red instruction, like the five senses, is the five dharmas, and so forth.
In the notes on the six dharmas by Barap Gyaltsen Zangpo[263] that were augmented by Jamyang Chökyi Drakpa[264] in the Trilogy of Great Bliss there are instructions for the paths of both instantaneous realizers and gradual realizers.
The Five Capabilities of the Lower Drukpa consists of five instructions: Mahāmudrā Death Capability, Inner Heat Cotton Capability, Secret Conduct Mountain Capability, Disease and Spirit Disturbance Capability, and Antidote Condition Capability.[265]

Among Lord Milarepa’s heart disciples, Rechung Dorjé Drakpa was like the moon. “And others” above in the root text refers to Ngen Dzong Tönpa.[266] These two were holders of teaching systems of the Cakrasaṃvara Ḍākinī Hearing Lineage that came from the Treasury of Three Cycles of the Wish-fulfilling Gem.[267] In that, after the conferral of empowerment into the mandala of the father Cakrasaṃvara, “tantric instructions related to empowerment” refers to the root and explanatory tantras. The “instructions of the hearing lineage related to blessing based on the four empowerments,” in which sindhūra[268] is the blessing object in the mandala of pristine awareness, refers to the esoteric instructions of the Three Gems.[269] And the “introduction instructions related to symbols” based on the symbol empowerment of the formless ḍākinī are found in the Three Dharma Cycles of the Formless Ḍākinī.[270]
Those two teaching traditions [of Rechungpa and Ngendzong Tönpa] are the most widely renowned of the ones that Jetsun Mila bestowed in individual portions to his eight heart disciples when explaining the instructions of the hearing lineage. In particular, the special transmission of the profound and vast instructions of ripening and liberation of the Dakpo Hearing Lineage fell to the Zurmang Kagyu and it continues unbroken up to the present.
Each spiritual adept of the four great and eight lesser Kagyu lineages opened such an infinite multitude of dharma doors that it cannot be measured or encompassed. Nevertheless, it is said that it can all be subsumed into two: the path of method related to the tantras and the hearing lineage related to blessing from the extent of Jetsun Mila’s instructions. The root of all that is mahāmudrā and the six dharmas.
The extensive application from scriptures in connection with the intention of the profound sutras and secret tantras of those two subjects can only be realized from the excellent teachings of the all-knowing Garwang Chen-nga,[271] and others.

The Shangpa Kagyu developed from the teaching system of Khyungpo Naljor,[1] a king among scholar-adepts. The Shangpas retained inconceivable traditions of practice and explanation in sutra and mantra and performed vast enlightened activity in exegesis, study, meditation, and practice. To summarize them, they could be subsumed into three stages of the path: exegesis, debate, and practice. An overview of these was described before.[2]
In the last of these, the stages in the path of practice, one finds the five dharma cycles of Niguma, Sukhasiddhī,[3] Vajrāsana, Maitrīpa, and Rāhula, as well as miscellaneous esoteric instructions. But those are just a conventional summary of the principal sections of teachings, and do not represent the entirety of the dharma cycles that Khyungpo himself received. If, right from the outset, the whole of his teachings could not even be contained in a single lineage system, no need to speak of the current situation.

It is the tradition of this precious lineage that a person’s stream of being is matured through the conferral of the four empowerments in the manner of a blessing, for it is well known that “blessing is the basis of empowerment.” Then the person with faith, diligence, weariness, and renunciation, who has properly completed the common preliminary practices, refines his or her being with the exceptional purifier called the “hollow interior of a” (a’i stong ra).[4] The meaning of “purifier” (dag byed ) is found in The Fifteen Especially Exalted Instructions of the Ḍākinī of Pristine Awareness:[5]
It will purify stains of breaches and breaks of vows in one’s mindstream;
This is the defining characteristic of the hollow interior.
This, then, is a special yoga for refining away all the stains from sins, obscurations, faults, downfalls, and so on, in one’s stream of being. It says in the Testimonial:[6]
In the hollow interior, the preliminary purifier, There are three supplications and three visualizations.
As is taught here, the three supplications[7] are done first and then one does the visualizations. They are the hollow interior of a, the purifier;
the hollow interior that clears away disease and negative spirits; and the three signs that distinguish the hollow interior. To posit this last as visualization is to apply the name of the cause to the result.[8] In this tradition there are many other cases such as this.
Next, one should engage in the main body of this profound path. As it says in the Vajra Lines [on the Six Dharmas of Niguma]:[9]
Having first been matured by four empowerments, faithful and diligent,
Weary of impermanence and deficiencies, Whoever strives at this supreme path
Will awaken in six months, a year, or in this lifetime.

In the six dharmas, which are the root of these Golden Dharmas, the first is the natural blazing of bliss-heat, the defining characteristic of the path of method. As is said:[10]
The arising of emptiness-clarity in the nature of bliss-heat Is the defining characteristic of the path of method.
Thus, this is a yoga in which the blazing and melting of a and haṃ generate the bliss-heat of the vajra body, giving rise to the distinctive pristine awareness of emptiness-clarity. By means of the two yogas of one’s own and another’s body as method and wisdom, there arise the four descending dissipating joys and the four ascending nondissipating joys that do not move or change. This stabilizes the coemergent pristine awareness of bliss-emptiness.
In this, one first tames the wild channels and wild energy currents by applying the fierce “wild fire of inner heat,”[11] and then forcefully generating the heat. This is inner heat’s own preliminary practice. Then the main practice, called “eating the food,” is the gentle yoga of the blazing and melting of the “springtime drops”[12] in connection with the fourfold vase-breathing. The branches—“wearing the clothing,” “spreading the seat,” and “riding the horse”—are practiced in connection with any activities.[13] The concluding practices are taking the empowerment of existence[14] and naturally liberating obstructions. Then the fullest benefit is derived from the inner heat of the guru’s blessing. It is accomplished through these practices.

The defining characteristic of illusory body, which is the natural liberation of attachment and aversion, is this:[15]
Although appearing, its intrinsic nature is not real; This is the defining characteristic of illusion.
This is a yoga that liberates attachment and aversion naturally in its own ground through the understanding that all phenomenal sights and sounds are illusory. For its instructions, those of the highest faculties rely on the friendship of a holy guru, those of medium faculties are guided without interruption by other words,[16] and those of lesser faculties develop meditative absorption on a single seat. The first of these three involves both integrating on the path one’s devotion to the guru and integrating the knowledge that whatever appears is unreal. The second involves both integrating one’s own body appearing as the empty appearance of the deity’s form and integrating whatever appears as illusion. In the third, once free of the four challenges,[17] meditating in the absorption with eight vital points causes the six classes of beings to arise as illusion. Then one integrates sickness and negative spirits as illusion and produces the six groups of qualities.[18] The natural arisings of illusion without attachment will occur automatically from those.

The defining characteristic of dream, which is naturally pure double delusion, is this:
Double delusion, lacking validity, arises as bliss. This is the defining characteristic of dreams.[19]
All double delusions arise without valid existence, so all the delusions of dreams just dissipate on their own in this special yoga. In these instructions, first one learns to recognize whatever dreams arise based on the vital point of lucid dreaming [or grasping that it is a dream while dreaming], by practicing the four empowerments of vital essences[20] and the nine unerring vital points.[21] Then one clears away the obstructions of excessive delusion, excessive wakefulness, excessive euphoria, and excessive emptiness through devotion, accumulation of merit, and so on.[22]
Once dreams are lucid at will, one refines the mind by means of the body, refines the body by means of the mind, [refines by means of meditation on the goddess] Nairātmyā, and by purposeful intent. When the skill with dreams is thus energetically refined, they are blended with luminous clarity.
One trains in increasing and emanating the four elements and sentient beings, large and small, that one encounters and in increasing and emanating worldly and transcendent beings for subduing them. One trains in transforming the four elements and sentient beings, large and small, and various deities, which are all transformed into empty appearance free of attachment. Thus one accomplishes the naturally arising deity’s form possessed of three characteristics: bliss without attachment to it, clarity without concept of it, and appearance without intrinsic nature.
Appearing objects are ascertained through clear understanding with no reference point, clear seeing of whatever is imagined, and the mental body flying through space, which are connected with those of highest, medium, and lowest faculties, respectively, and through the three instructions on clarifying the appearance of a visualized object. Through these one will master the liberating actions of dream.

The defining characteristic of luminous clarity, by which stupidity is naturally dispelled, is this:
Clarity-emptiness, the sky without center or circumference, This is the defining characteristic of luminous clarity.[23]
Clarity and emptiness are inseparable and free of all fixations, something like the sky without center or circumference. To bring this into spiritual practice, one sets the foundation by four preliminary practices:
(1) [the contemplation of] impermanence and weariness is the root, (2) the conduct and sacramental substances are the branches, (3) the path of method and natural radiance are the leaves, and (4) supplication creates the flowers.
The main practice is to recognize deep and light luminous clarity through three means of grasping it.[24] It is integrated on the path night and day by the natural arising of the three kāyas. The training in the blending of inseparable clarity and emptiness, sitting meditation and postmeditation, day and night, and bliss and emptiness causes the sequential development of luminous clarity. The first realization of luminous clarity is the inseparability of clarity and emptiness, second is the inseparability of bliss and emptiness, third is profound tranquility free of elaboration, and fourth is the ultimately inseparable luminous clarity. Finally, luminous clarity endowed with twofold purity manifests.[25]
The concluding practices are to keep the general and specific sacred pledges, to clear up obstructions through the natural purity of faults and failings, to enhance practice by cutting through doubts, to identify the especially eminent doors of perception,[26] and the distinctions of daytime and nighttime experiential realizations. Thus one crosses the stages and consummates the four kinds of luminous clarity—bliss, clarity, nonthought, and inseparability—by means of sixteen modes of emergence. Those sixteen modes of emergence of luminous clarity are as follows: the luminous clarity of experience and realization are two. Each of those occurs as daytime and nighttime luminous clarity, making four. Those four are each divided into two [categories of] being with or without appearance, which is eight. Those four having appearance are divided into four that have an external connection and four that do not, making eight. Those without appearance each have both light luminous clarity and deep luminous clarity, or eight. Putting them together makes sixteen.
Those first four dharmas are known as “blending illusory body”[27] or the four root dharmas.

The defining characteristic of transference, which is buddhahood without meditation, is this:

This is a yoga that causes one to traverse to the celestial realm by merely remembering it at the point of death. The instructions for it are the transference of suchness of dharmakāya, the transference of union with the yidam, the force of blessing of the guru, and the transference higher through the path of the unerring celestial realm (Skt. khecara). These are the four doctrines in the source text, Vajra Lines.[29] There is also the supplemental instruction on transference, “Skylight of Pristine Awareness.”[30]

The defining characteristic of the intermediate state for attaining the saṃbhogakāya of the victors is this:
Appearance-emptiness, free of attachment, the great bliss kāya, This is the defining characteristic of saṃbhogakāya.[31]
This is a yoga for actualizing the great bliss kāya that is inseparable appearance and emptiness free of attachment. The way to put it into practice is through the natural arising of luminous clarity as dharmakāya, the natural arising of the victors’ saṃbhogakāya, the natural arising of unimpeded nirmāṇakāya, and the unerring general vital point that must augment the last two appropriately. Through these practices, those of highest, middle, and lowest faculties will attain liberation in excellent, medium, and lower ways during the first or successive two stages of the intermediate state, respectively. The essence, definition, divisions, and so on, of these are no different from those already discussed in the chapter on the Six Dharmas of Nāropa and therefore will not be repeated.

This is the theme of all sutras and tantras. It is the pith of all esoteric instructions. It is the supreme one among all the methods to expediently produce the supreme spiritual power. These are the instructions of the deepest meaning of mahāmudrā, which is not mind-made. Of the many ways to guide a fortunate individual, here we are considering the one included in the Five Golden Dharmas that were Vajradhara’s actual instructions to the awareness ḍākinī Niguma. They are known by the name “amulet box” (ga’u ma) because the scholar-adept Khyungpo Naljor valued them so highly that he put them on a paper scroll inside a Nepalese amulet box like a heart and hung it around his neck.[32]
The preliminaries are to practice the profound method of devotion to the guru and to accomplish faultless calm abiding through the three methods of settling body, speech, and mind in their natural condition while developing higher insight through seeking the mind, and so on.
In the main practice, a sly glimpse[33] of pristine awareness is introduced by the descent of blessings of the vajra-sealed secret words and one decisively determines the nature of mind itself by means of the liberation of the four faults in their own ground. The four faults are (1) although one’s own mind and the dharmakāya are beyond unity and separation, it is too close to recognize; (2) although it arises in oneself, it is too profound to grasp; (3) although just recalling it suffices, it is too easy to believe; and (4) although the three kāyas arise in oneself, it is too good to accept. These are the four faults from which one is liberated.
The concluding practice is the conviction that the ordinary mind that was from the beginning the unity of clarity and emptiness is itself the naturally arising three kāyas—its emptiness is dharmakāya, its clarity is nirmāṇakāya, and the union of those is saṃbhogakāya. Once such certainty has been born, one maintains within the settled state of just that.
The enhancement practices are to rely on immeasurable devotion, immeasurable compassion, and the special methods of blending the energy currents with ordinary consciousness, with the luminous clarity of the deity’s body, and with unity consciousness. The uncommon clearing away of obstructions is to make an effort not to get caught up in one’s experiences and not to lean toward either appearance or emptiness. In this way, one ascertains the three measures of natural arising[34] and actualizes the natural liberation of the four kāyas.
This is amulet box mahāmudrā or the so-called “three naturally settled states” (rang babs rnam gsum). It is the trunk of the excellent wish-fulfilling tree of the Five Golden Dharmas.

The way to practice the three integrations of the guru, the yidam, and illusion on the path based on appearances is this: (1) Whatever appears is all viewed as the play of the three secrets of the glorious guru. (2) All appearing form is perceived as the form of the yidam deity, the rainbow body of empty appearance, and all sound resounds as the vibration of indestructible naturally occurring mantra. (3) Understanding appearance as mind and mind as illusion and dream, one trains in the yogas of day and night.[35]
The ways to practice are to exert effort in devotion based on the three convictions and on the union [of appearance and emptiness];[36] pure perception based on having the six constant vital points;[37] and the meditative absorption in clarity-emptiness free of fixation on the validity of the doors of perception.
If done like this, devotion arises based on the guru, from that comes [appreciation of his or her] kindness, from that the accumulation of merit, and from that the three kāyas arise naturally. Pure perception based on the yidam leads to the accumulation of merit, and from that the mahāmudrā of the deity’s form arises naturally. [Realizing] appearance as one’s own mind produces [the realization] of illusion, from that dream, and from that luminous clarity occurs as a natural arising. Through these three practices, the natural arising of clarity, emptiness, and great bliss as the three kāyas will be actualized in a matter of months or years.
Since these “Unerring Three Integrations” (’phyug med lam khyer rnam gsum) are subsidiary practices, they are known as the dharma of the branches.

The fourth Golden Dharma is the flowers, the pair of Red and White Khecarī.[38] To put it into practice, one evokes the stream of the vital power of nondissipating compassion of the Bhagavatī, Vajra Queen of Great Bliss, with the ardent vajra words of an especially exalted supplication. In the chakras of the four places in the body, appropriate to the specific support, the bliss-emptiness supported by the individual paths of passion and liberation intensely blazes like a lamp. In that meditative absorption, that very support becomes the engagement in the space[39] of great union. Those of inferior capability will easily traverse to the vajra city of the celestial realm (Khecara) based on the secret path of forcefully blocking the five birthplaces all at once.

These instructions are a combination of the unerring body precepts transmitted to Gyalwa Nyentön Chöjé[40] and the deathless mind that came from Khyungpo himself. In The Ocean of Pristine Awareness Tantra[41] it says:
This body and mind are indivisible,
Mutually dependent as support and supported. This should be known as the vital point of all.
This means that one first thoroughly refines the channels, vital essences, and energy currents with the thirty-two yogic exercises for accomplishing deathlessness. Once those are done, the body must be apprehended as being on the path of liberation. The master Virūpa said:
Through a great share of merit
One certainly obtains a human body. From the blessing of the guru’s speech It goes forth on the path of liberation.
The main body of the practice is described by the reverend lord Mokchokpa:[42]
Sutras, tantras, esoteric instructions, and experiences teach
The vital point of deathlessness, awakening without meditating: How this body of karma fully ripening
Arises as a naturally pure awareness body.
Visualize the fully ripening karmic body as the deity’s form
And meditate without fixation on it. It is itself inseparable from mind.
No essence of mind is established, So where is something that dies? “Death” is just a concept.
The hosts of concepts are nonexistent phenomena of samsara and nirvana.
According to this and other statements, since one’s own mind in essence has no real existence whatsoever, it was always unborn. Therefore the great natural liberation of deathlessness is attained. As for this body of fully ripening karma, since it is a conglomeration of inert matter, it is not a basis on which to attribute the designations of birth or death. In fact, the body even arises as a mere appearance of mind. When one gains con- fidence in the realization that the mind is unborn and undying, then the body appears as the deity’s form in mahāmudrā and one becomes bound to basic space without erring into the path of deluded appearance. By this kind of instruction one discovers the kāya of union in this lifetime. Even just hearing it can cause one to get enlightened in the intermediate state as the saṃbhogakāya of the victors. Of the Five Golden Dharmas, it is said to be like the ripened fruit.

Furthermore, Khyungpo Naljor received the six dharmas of the path of method and mahāmudrā pure awareness from the awareness ḍākinī Sukhasiddhī. He received The Practice of Four Deities Combined[43] and the instruction cycles of Guru and Protector Inseparable[44] from the great adept Rāhulagupta.[45] “And so on” above in the root verse refers to the profound dharma of Vajrāsana-Abhaya[46] that was actually taught in the Jewel Ocean Tantra[47] for accomplishing the five tantras in a single mandala together with the profound body mandala, and so on.[48] There are many such profound dharmas with undiminished continuity of blessings that ripen and liberate. In general, the great adept Khyungpo Naljor fully received the spiritual essence of one hundred and fifty scholaradepts of the exalted land of India. He is famous without rival in the Land of Snows as one teacher with countless dharma doors.
Currently, the individual vajra lines for Niguma’s Six Dharmas, mahāmudrā, integration on the path, unerring, and deathlessness are extant. The first two and the last of these are the transmitted word of Vajradhara. The remaining two exist as vajra line treatises spoken in the first case by Niguma, and in the latter case by Virūpa.[49] This has occurred in other lineages as well. For example, the vajra lines of the Cakrasaṃvara Hearing Lineage are the transmitted word of the Buddha, whereas the Vajra Lines of the Path with Its Result and the Vajra Lines of Non-Elaboration and others appear to be treatises.[50]
In this system of instructions, even the supplications and numbering of the verses for visualization were established by the awareness ḍākinī herself in the Testimonial, so it is free of the suppositions, fabrications, and alterations of later individuals. Thus it is most exceptional and exalted.
In general, the long tradition of the Shangpa Kagyu was divided into three: the extensive, abbreviated, and very abbreviated paths.

If these are abbreviated, they are subsumed into the instructions on the three bodies. As is said:
If you do not recognize the three bodies through the instructions
You simply follow after delusion.
Fully ripening, habit, and mental bodies
Are the victor’s kāyas if grasped through vital points.
Until samsara is emptied,
The uninterrupted welfare of beings continues.
The three bodies are the fully ripening karmic body, the habit body, and the mental body. An exposition of them is found in the scholar-adept Khyungpo Naljor’s Instructions for Unerring Three Intermediate States.[51] There, the yogin’s bases of refinement are the three intermediate states. The refining agents are creation and completion, dream, and luminous clarity. As it states in the Display of Pristine Awareness Tantra:[52]
Those three bodies in the intermediate states
Are refined by creation and completion, dream, and luminous clarity.
And in Hevajra:[53]
Just as illusion and dream,
Just as the intermediate states...
The three intermediate states that are the bases for refinement are the intermediate state between birth and death, the intermediate state of dream, and the intermediate state of existence. The intermediate state between birth and death lasts from the time of being born until dying, during which one has a fully ripening karmic body. Why is it called fully ripening? The virtue and nonvirtue that one has accumulated ripens as various kinds of pleasure and pain that one experiences, so it is called the body of fully ripening karma. The second, dream intermediate state, lasts from the time that one falls asleep until one wakes up, and is the habit body. Why is it called the habit body? The various habitual patterns of this life come up in one’s dreams, so it is the dream body of habitual patterns. The third is the intermediate state of existence that lasts from death until one takes another birth, and it is the mental body. Why is it called the mental body? While consuming odors as its food, the mind, like a phantom, has full powers and is unobstructed by materiality, so it is a mental body.
Secondly, that which refines them: The mahāmudrā of the deity’s form refines the fully ripening body; the emanation, transformation, and so on, of dreams refines the habit body; and luminous clarity refines the mental body.

Alternatively, each of those bodies has body, speech, and mind as the bases of refinement and they are refined by the three experiences of bliss, clarity, and nonthought. The result obtained is the inseparable three kāyas. This way, those of highest faculties are enlightened in the fully ripening body, those of medium faculties are enlightened in the habit body, and those of the lowest faculties are enlightened in the intermediate state due to the practice that was done during the fully ripening and habit bodies that acted as a seed.[54] This was all taught clearly by the scholar-adept Khyungpo, Nyentön, and others.
Thus, if one masters the fully ripening body through the methods in the instructions, then the habit body and, by that, the mental body will be mastered in turn. Therefore, first of all one should practice with this fully ripening body, which is the nature of channels, energy currents, and vital essences. Then one practices the esoteric instructions with method based on one’s own body, the yoga of the blazing and dripping of a and haṃ, and the yoga of wisdom based on another’s body, joining with khagamukha.[55] Refining and controlling the bodhicitta, it will travel from the tip of the “jewel” to the crown of the head by means of the four dissipating ascending joys and the four nondissipating descending joys. When the body is completely filled it becomes the rainbow body or vajrakāya. The speech becomes the harmonious song of the invincible nāda, and the mind without concept is the dharmakāya. Since this is actual, complete enlightenment, it was given the designation “highest faculties enlightened in the fully ripening body.”
Those of medium faculties practice illusory body through recollection and purposeful intent during the daytime, and the recognizing, refining, increasing, and transforming of dreams at nighttime, by which the natural purity of this double delusion is refined. Therefore this is given the designation “medium faculties enlightened in the habit body.”
Those of lowest faculties practice during the fully ripening and habit bodies together. When this acts as a seed, those of highest, medium, and lowest [subdivisions within the lowest faculties] will be enlightened during one of the sequence of three intermediate states [of death]. This is given the designation “lowest faculties enlightened in the mental body.”

As is said:
The three bodies are the three kāyas of the victor, One’s mind is undying and naturally liberated.
How wonderful! A precious treasure,
The intention of the victors of the three times.
Thus, one traverses through the final stages of the path and connects to the supreme fruition only by settling without wavering directly on the singular mind itself.
The instructions for experiential practice known as the three or four wisdoms of blending in the practice of transference and the special profound vital points of application are found in the excellent teachings of the great honorable lord of Jonang.[56] The specific layout of the general stages of the path in this tradition is found in the root and commentary called Evolution of Illusion,[57] which were created by the ḍākinī of pristine awareness herself. It is most important to come to a realization of these and other such teachings.

The mighty lord of accomplishment Dampa Sangyé[1] mastered the semantic meaning of the unborn Ali Kali[2] and through Inconceivable Secrets[3] taught countless approaches to dharma corresponding to the faculties and dispositions of the disciples. Thus, there is not one single definite system, but an undeterminable amount of instructions. But since all of these are mostly consistent in that they guide the students, as in [Dampa Sangyé’s] own life example, by means of the three levels of vows as the support, ascetic exertion as the path, and the activities for the welfare of others as the fruition, these methods became known collectively as the Sacred Dharma That Pacifies Suffering (Dam chos sdug bsngal zhi byed ). It states in a sutra:
Dharma that pacifies the suffering and misery of beings with many dispositions.
And from a Dhāraṇī:[4]
The noble son or daughter who desires the pacification of outer, inner, and secret suffering ...
And from a King Tantra:[5]
Pacifying the suffering of the three sufferings,
Removing three, limitless beings obtain three freedoms,
Are definitely liberated from all obscurations,
And dwell in space-like equalness.
Based on such teachings, Dampa Sangyé initially set forth the Three Lamps of Pacification.[6] The Lamp of Conduct[7] contains the meaning of the Vinaya, the collection on discipline. It principally teaches the training in higher ethical conduct, physical actions, and the semantic meaning of the thirty consonants. The Lamp of the Path[8] contains the meaning of the Abhidharma, the collection on phenomenology. It principally teaches the training in higher wisdom, verbal utterances, and the semantic meaning of the sixteen vowels. The Lamp of Mind[9] contains the meaning of the Sutras, the collection of discourses.[10] It principally teaches the training in higher meditative absorption, mental images, and the semantic meaning of the fifty-five sounds: the fifty consonants and vowels, the four neutral letters, and the a within them all. These are also subsumed under practices for inferior, medium, and superior faculties.
Since this was seemingly the first of all the spoken mysteries of Dampa Sangyé, all of the instructions promulgated in Tibet from then on also came to be known by the name “Pacification.”

There are limitless methods for actual realization connected with the vital points of practice and instruction in the individual lineages of this profound dharma. They could, however, be arranged according to general ground, path, and fruition. It says in the Lamp of the Yogic Path:[11]
Myself and all living beings
Are primordially unborn luminous clarity,
But confused by the winds of ignorance
We experience the suffering of cyclic existence.
Where do the three sufferings come from? They come from karmic actions and afflictive emotions. These depend on the mind or energy current of coemergent ignorance.[12] That itself, having primordially passed into peace in the great unborn luminous clarity, is the ground for refining away the defilements. The three poisons that are the root of the three sufferings[13] are removed in the best cases through realization, in moderate cases through meditational experience, and in inferior cases through devoted supplication. Thus limitless beings obtain the three kinds of total liberation of śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas, or the actualization of the three kāyas of the victorious ones. This unerring method is the path that refines. Having been released from all bonds of emotional and conceptual obscurations, dwelling in the equalness of the space-like ultimate realm of reality is the fruition of refining. As it says in the Lamp of Secret Mind:[14]
Mind itself, when ready, is Nonconceptual genuine meaning,
Nondual, yet not contrived as nondual, Unelaborated space,
Liberated from existence and transcendence.

Most of the guidance methods adopted in Tibet were primarily to encourage the student to turn away from nonvirtue, and subsequently to work at refining away the afflictive emotions within the mindstream. In this case, the name was designated based on such passages as “the mantra that utterly pacifies all suffering,”[15] which were taught in order to immediately pacify suffering such as having an inferior or sickly body due to previous karma. From the Lamp of Conduct:[16]
To beings tormented by suffering,
Explain immaculate, comforting pacification.
In general, all of the sacred dharma is the same in pacifying suffering. But in particular, this method immediately pacifies the suffering of suffering and the others. Therefore, the general term came to be used for this specific system. In essence, it is called “the perfection vehicle that is consistent with the mantra vehicle.” It is the special instruction that combines all the sutras and tantras into a single vital point.

The eleven lineages of ḍākinī symbol and pristine awareness that descend from the yidam deities are contained in the wheel-like instructions. By shooting like an arrow, falling like a thunderbolt, spinning like a wheel, and settling like a butter lamp, the ten qualities such as “seeing the root”[18] are brought to perfection. When the most excellent pristine awareness arises, the four kāyas and five pristine awarenesses will be spontaneously present.
The general subsequent practice to all of these is to integrate the intermediate states as the path. Appearances are the intermediate state of illusion, and by practicing accordingly, the signs will arise in the intermediate state of habitual dreaming. Once that arises, one develops skill in the painful intermediate state of dying. When that develops, liberation from the deluded intermediate state of existence is certain.
The manner of liberation is this: The obscuration of afflictive emotion is purified by the experience of meditative equipoise in something, and the confused clinging to reality is expended. Through that vital point, the three realms are transcended. The obscuration of knowledge is puri- fied by the experience of post-meditation and one is no longer confused by mere appearances. Through that vital point, one transcends the ten stages and actualizes unborn dharmakāya.
As an aid in this process one should apply the three levels of vows to one’s conduct at the appropriate times. Then all attachment to impure appearances will change into bounteous purity. By mastering that, the immediate result will be the experience of the equal flavor of acceptable or unacceptable thoughts, overcoming male and female negative spirits, controlling the four categories of disease, and the incapacity of signs and concepts to do any harm whatsoever, but instead assist in the birth of pristine awareness. Ultimately, it will result in actualizing the three kāyas.

In the Ma system[19] of the middle transmission, sixteen direct guidances based on the meaning lineage introduce it and sixteen important vital points based on the word lineage cut off misconceptions. In the first, one comes to the recognition of the pristine awareness of one’s own awareness through four endeavors that integrate characteristics, lack of characteristics, utter lack of characteristics, and the breakthrough to space. One enters directly into meditative absorption by four kinds of meditative sessions: long, short, partial, and continuous. Meditation is enhanced by four vital energy exercises and four thought severances. Mahāmudrā is recognized through the two placements. Nonmeditation is ascertained by two breakthrough experiences.
In the second, knowing [four things] integrate the mind on the path: the viewed object, the viewing method, the measure of seeing, and the benefits. The manner of existence, of being, of appearing, and of being empty[20] set the foundation of a sending session.[21] Four miscellaneous points capture the juncture of meaning: knowledge without foundation, essence without support, experience without change, and the natural liberation of characteristics. Four vital points of critique ascertain it. [Finality and increase] resolve it.[22]

In the So system[23] the main instruction concerns seeing awareness nakedly, along with the three vital points. It says in the Symbol Tantra:[24]
The sevenfold posture causes energy-mind to enter the abode.
The vital point of the body is to establish practice through training with the physical postures and gazes. The vital point of energy currents is to fill up by settling in fresh exhalation, inhalation, and abiding of the breath. The vital point of the mind is to settle by pressing and placing through great all-pervasiveness in superior cases, the encounter of nakedly seeing in moderate cases, and various methods of pressing in inferior cases. There are also three methods of introducing them: those of superior faculties are introduced to pristine awareness in a forceful way, those of moderate faculties are introduced by examples and words, and those of inferior faculties are introduced by relying on persuasive words.
Obstructions of dullness and agitation are cleared away by checking the success of reversing the spills, leaks, and overflows. Practice is enhanced with the realization of the unity during meditation and postmeditation of essence, nature, and characteristics.
It is taught that one should practice with these ten clinchers of practice:[25] the clincher of the key instruction of certainty in changeless view; the clincher of the key instruction of fast, straightforward meditation; the clincher of actual fruition of ultimate stability; the clincher of the equal flavor of surprise circumstances;[26] the clincher of being like a skillful doctor realizing success; the clincher like a wheel weapon cutting through good and bad thoughts; the clincher like arriving at the golden land of ultimate experiential realization; the clincher like a precious jewel that fulfills desires and needs; and the clincher of the intermediate state practice of bliss-warmth at the point of death.

The essential guidance in the meaning of the Heart Sutra is the preliminary to all the instructions in the Kam system.[27] These occur in the sixfold format of guidance in the meaning of supplication, devotion, purification of obscurations, accumulations, meditation on love and compassion, and engendering of the awakening mind. The last is divided into two: the forceful severing of discursive thoughts in meditative equipoise, and the post-meditation practice of taking discursive thoughts as reality. A great many such guidance systems arose, but later only these guidances of the Kam system continued to exist.

The principal or root teaching of Pacification is the last transmission, which is from the instructions to the four-direction yogins, and is the system of the guru bodhisattva Kunga.[28] This teaching consists of instructions on the perfection of wisdom that are consistent with the secret mantra. The root is conferred to the mindstream, the essential meaning is introduced, and one is adorned with methods of numerous, great interdependent connections. Then one practices all the Buddhist teachings at one time on one seat. This key instruction is called the Practice Cycle of the Immaculate Drop.[29] In the Great Gradual Path of Zhikpo Nyima Sengé[30] it says:
This is a mahāmudrā teaching presenting the three immaculates; This key instruction presenting three practices called “drop”
Is a wonderful presentation of three guidance systems of the three teaching cycles.
Initially, this consists of a preliminary empowerment which ripens the support that was not ripened before. Then the white, red, and black guidances cause spiritual experience that had not emerged to emerge by way of exertion. The guru’s blessing causes realization that has not arisen to arise and makes it the path. Severing conceptions that were not severed, the meaning of the word collections [of the last transmission] fill the mind.
As for empowerment, in this system there are four exceptional ones mentioned in the Ali Kali Great River Tantra:[31]
The meaning of absolute unelaborated coemergence
Is in the complete four empowerments, the vital point of Ali Kali:
The precious volume confers the four vase empowerments; It stabilizes and washes the body’s impurities.
The skullcup of elixir confers the four secret empowerments; It stabilizes and fulfills the victors’ commitment.
The profound introduction confers the four third empowerments;[32]
It stabilizes and arouses understanding of symbols.
Receiving the mantra transmission confers the four word empowerments;
It stabilizes and the guru dissolves into oneself.

And from The Gradual Path:
This vase empowerment conferred by the scripture is a path wherein it is sufficient to behold.
This elixir that is the secret empowerment is elixir that is sufficient to grasp.
This introduction that is the third empowerment is the teaching that is sufficient to know.
This mind training that is the fourth empowerment is the lineage[33] that is sufficient to meet.
Thus, the vase empowerment that ripens the body is elixir sufficient to behold in that it is the vital point that refines the pure appearances of objective reality by relying on the natural, total purity of the aggregates, constituents, and sense fields. The secret empowerment that ripens speech is the elixir sufficient to grasp in that it is the vital point that refines the habitual habit or mental obscuration of inward clinging by relying on the letters of the four chakras. The wisdom empowerment that ripens the mind (sems) is the vital point sufficient to know in that it is the vital point that causes the birth of pristine awareness in one’s being by relying on the four yogic exercises. The word empowerment that ripens the afflictive mind (yid ) is the lineage sufficient to meet in that it is the vital point of resolving by antidotes and traversing the paths and stages by relying on the four vital points of the seed-syllables.
On the path, the white guidance concentrates solely on mind training, the red guidance concerns the practice of the five or three paths, and the black guidance brings about the realization of the types of letters. All of them produce results by way of exertion.
Furthermore, those of superior faculties behold the actual unadulterated abiding nature of the native mind beyond duality, causing instantaneous enlightenment. This is the vital point of nakedly seeing awareness in the white guidance. Those of medium faculties refine the vital essence of the three gates equally, and by consummating the path of the guru’s four kāyas, attain the four kāyas in crossing over (thod rgal ). This is the vital point of the sole sufficiency of devotion in the red guidance. Those of inferior faculties attain the five paths by engaging gradually. This is the vital point of the instruction on subtle cutting through (phra chod ) in the black guidance.
To make the guru’s blessing the path, initially when the guru is supplicated as dharmakāya, unrestricted realization arises. In the middle, when the guru is supplicated as saṃbhogakāya, unrestricted qualities arise. Finally, when the guru is supplicated as nirmāṇakāya, unrestricted benefit for beings occurs. Afterwards, when the guru is supplicated as the mahāsukhakāya, unfluctuating buddha activity occurs.
There are also four word collections: the sutras and tantras with their practices, the transmissions with the hearing lineage, the immaculate with the subtle vital essence; and the minute examinations with the collection of explanations. These are all common sections of teaching.

The main part is the red guidance of the five paths. From the Great River Tantra:[35]
The final thing to preserve is the ultimate three vows. Engage in preserving the restraints of yoga as taught.
As this teaches, possessing the three vows as support, preserve the six restraints of yoga undamaged. As is said:[36]
Outwardly sacred in the discipline of the śrāvakas, Inwardly vast in the vows of the bodhisattvas, Ultimately pure in the sacred pledge of secret mantra.
And Zhikpo Nyima Sengé explains in The Great Gradual Path:
With the lower vows as the foundation, the middle are the path and the higher are the fruition.
Inwardly, when there is choice, they are fundamentally the same; nevertheless, measure externally.
Look again and again at your own mind, the mirror of the three vows’ purity.
The six restraints of yoga are not to supplicate worldly deities, not to request attainments from demons, not to expend vigor on this life, not to give one’s nose-rope to others (i.e., give away one’s freedom), not to emit secrets through the gate of the lips (i.e., speak of attainments), and not to brandish the tip of the victory banner of acclaim (i.e., exult proudly in attainments).

There are five yogas of the path, which is the agent. From The Gradual Path:
Mind training, austerities, subsequent activity, equal flavor meditation, and self-confidence.
The three practices, and preparation, main part, and subsequent, are carried in the four sessions.
First, the mind training on the path of accumulation lays the foundation of the path. Second, when the austerities of the path of application have been thoroughly refined, one also enacts the secret activity of deliberate behavior,[37] the branch that connects to the path of seeing. Third is the subsequent activity of the path of seeing. Fourth is the equal flavor activity of the path of meditation. And fifth is the final path, the yoga of self-confident freedom from action. In all five of them the preparation, creation of the support, gathering of the accumulations, and working with the path, magnify the blessings, the vital point of the lineage.
In the main practice, the manner of uttering sounds is integrating the letters on the path.[38] The special visualization of the four empowerments is the meditation sequence on the four chakras. The special basic introduction is the practice in both meditative equipoise and post-meditation. And the special permission blessing transmission is the four ways of invoking the guru’s realization that perfects the levels and paths in one stroke. In the subsequent activity, while guarding against the four stains of reversing the spills, leaks, and overflows, the retreats are set by the four indicators of essence, signs, qualities, and amount.

The five paths also need to be produced by way of exertion. Three examples are that cutting through misconceptions while depending on a master is like a śrāvaka, practicing and accomplishing by oneself is like a pratyekabuddha, and heroically accomplishing the welfare of others is like a bodhisattva. The three types are monastic, layperson, and mendicant. The three times are long, short, and medium. The three systems of conferring empowerment are single, turned, and parallel in conjunction. These twelve divisions are crucial to avoid spills and leaks in the practice. The Gradual Path states:
In all the esoteric instructions, training in time, support, and system of practice,
The guru recognizes the object and sets up whatever connections are auspicious.
Carrying an unbearable load is the source of sickness, the holy ones teach.
This path did not occur previously in India and Tibet, but is the special teaching of Dampa Rinpoché. Outwardly, it draws on the heart of the Three Baskets. Inwardly, it takes the life of the four classes of tantra. Secretly, it opens the eyes to the essential meaning. In suchness, it opens the command-seal of the ḍākinīs and is the avenue of accomplishing the practice of the entire buddhadharma at once and is adorned with many great techniques of auspicious connection. From the previously quoted source:
The salt of the general practice lineage, the great gradual path, the avenue of accomplishment,
This key instruction of general tantra and sutra united is certainly not common.

This is the yoga of the fruition free of action. The essence of one’s own mind is by nature totally pure. Taking that itself as the directive on the path, and with the guru’s blessing as a preliminary, the incidental defilements are purified and ultimately the pristine awareness of intrinsic awareness is liberated within basic space. This is dharmakāya. In addition to that, its nature is the root of clarity, which is limitless perfection. By obtaining control of awareness, the pure kāya adorned with the marks and characteristics manifests to the perception of those to be tamed. This is saṃbhogakāya. In addition, the defining characteristic of mind is inseparable appearance and emptiness. From within that, the deeds of skillful methods appear in whichever way appropriate to whomever is to be tamed. This is nirmāṇakāya. The inseparability of those three is the mahāsukhakāya. Having found these four kāyas spontaneously present, effortless activity taming those to be tamed comes from the pristine awareness of the two knowledges.[39] In the formerly quoted source, there are many comments to this effect:
The fruition yoga is the four kāyas with the natural radiance of the five pristine awarenesses.
The disciple who is karmicly ready to meet such an excellent path as this,
Without waiting for a future juncture, will achieve the exalted purpose in this life.
As for the time of attaining that fruition, the superior obtain it in the very life in which this teaching is encountered, the medium at the time of death, and the inferior no later than in the intermediate state. It is said that it will be realized in that very instance by essence, at death by signs, and in the intermediate state based on number [of repetition]. The birth of qualities comes through the lineage.

For the yogin who practices in this way, clearing away obstructions occurs by clearing away the obstructions of imbalance in the four elements, eliminating proliferation through methods and wisdom, and clearing away the four stains on each path. Realization is enhanced by invoking the guru with devotion and the ḍākinīs’ secret words on the four vital points of expertise. The “one to one” crucial approach to the way of accomplishment is to attend and please the guru, since during mind training one cannot be on one’s own. “One three” means that by completing mind training, three things are accumulated, three causes abandoned, and the three blessings received. Having first done the three yogas, one engages in the three practices of austerities, subsequent activities, and equal flavor. Until the final success on the path, this is the pinnacle of the stages of accomplishment. “One to one” again means that one has reached the ultimate accomplishment of heroic self-confidence[40] and engages solely in altruistic activity. Thus in The Gradual Path it says:
In the gradual path divided into foundation, path, and yoga,
The foundation has six and three, making nine; the path has five and three, making eight;
And the fruition yoga has four and three; in short, there are twenty-four.

This system is called Sacred Dharma, Severance of Evil Object (dam chos bdud kyi gcod yul ). The meaning of “severance” (gcod ) is explained by Brāhmin Āryadeva in the short source text:[41]
To sever the root of mind itself,
And sever the roots of five toxic emotions
And sever extreme views, disturbed meditation, And hopes and fears about results in activity— To sever all inflation—
That is the definition of “Severance.”
The term “object” (yul ) is explained in the Abhidharma Treasury:[42]
From unforsaken latent tendencies
And direct contact with objects
And improper concepts
Afflictive emotions arise...
That which is to be severed is afflictive emotion. When afflictive emotions originate from latent tendencies and external objects and improper concepts, the yogin directly engages the object, which conjures up habitual patterns. The afflictive emotions that were preceded by improper concepts are then severed right there directly upon the object. Hence it is called “severance object” [or “the object to be severed”] (gcod yul ).
Alternatively, it is widely held to mean “activity object” (spyod yul )[43] because it puts into practice the meaning of the phrase [found in the Perfection of Wisdom sutras], “In this way one should train in performing the activity of the profound perfection of wisdom.” Also, in the Heart Essence of Profound Meaning:[44]
Mahayana dharma overwhelming the four devils,
Neither inhibiting nor indulging samsara and nirvana, the gist of the perfections,
Making negative conditions the path; the approach of the Lord Mother[45]
Who taught the severance instructions to those who wish to befriend adversity.

Thus when it bears the name through being analogous to what is described in the highest yoga tantras of secret mantra, such as Cakrasaṃvara, Hevajra, and so on, it is the sequence of activity that enhances the path by means of instructions in the vital points of method and wisdom, such as the “secret activity,” “awareness activity,” “public activity,” “victorious in all directions,” and so on.[46] When it bears the name through dissimilarity, in terms of being a remedy, it refers to instructions in the causal vehicle of the perfections. In order to integrate on the path the truths of causal origination and resultant suffering from the reversed application of what to practice or abandon of the four truths,[47] the instructions on practicing the profound vital points of the remedial reverse meditation and equal taste are given. This is called “severance of evil object” (bdud kyi gcod yul). From The Collection:[48]
In fact ultimately there is nothing to sever. To conquer cowardice, severance is explained.
In these instructions, the Guru’s Secret Severance, the Meaning Precept Lineage Severance, Dampa’s Pacification, and Nāro’s Secret Conduct are known as the four basic sources of Indian teachings that flourished in Tibet.[49] Of these, the lineage descending from Dampa produced “male” and “female” severance,[50] of which the female severance has the further designation of being principally from Machik herself.[51] Machik realized nonorigination instantly by merely seeing the extensive and intermediate [texts on the perfection of wisdom] of the middle turning of the wheel of dharma, and the instructions of severing egotistical delusion were born in her heart. It is these very instructions, which contain all of those teachings in the aforementioned four rivers of lineage of experiential liberation based upon the Buddha’s word, that will be explained here.

Famous even now, this unbroken tradition of ripening and liberating instructions has the sutras on the perfection of wisdom (prajñāpāramitā) as the scriptural source of its view and the various methods which distinguish the mantra vehicle. Therefore it is accepted as the combination of sutric and tantric realization. In the Collected Verses [of the Perfection of Wisdom],[52] the meaning of this doctrine is presented as four reasons to practice:
Through four reasons a wise and strong bodhisattva
Will be unmoved by four devils that are difficult to resist:
Abiding in emptiness, never forsaking sentient beings,
Acting according to one’s word, and possessing the sugatas’ blessing.
These four—the view that abides in emptiness, the compassion that never abandons sentient beings, the bodhisattva’s discipline of acting according to one’s word, and the sugatas’ blessings—are the root of practice. Of these, the practice of receiving the blessings of the sugatas is going for refuge and supplication to the guru and lineage. From the short source text:[53]
Offer to the guru and the Jewels
Vast offerings of real and unreal mental appearances, Prostrate and confess negative actions,
Then respectfully go for refuge and arouse awakening mind.

Acting according to one’s word is not senseless bragging but adhering to the promises and abstentions sworn after having given rise to awakening mind. For instance, it says in the former source:[54]
Renounce and encourage others to renounce
The ten nonvirtues such as killing.
Speak well of the advantages
Of the renunciation of killing and so on.
Not renouncing the ten nonvirtues,
The sublime path will not be found.
Practice and encourage others to practice
The six perfections.
Speak well of the advantages Of these six perfections.
Not to forsake a sentient being means not to harm even nonhuman beings, but rather to compassionately disengage them from harming other beings and introduce them into the path of awakening. Machik said:
Give generously with an awakening mind.
Since everything is the naturally occurring mind,
Be without partiality towards apparently existent phenomena. Rest in great expansive nonself.
The view of abiding in emptiness is first of all to stop regarding the aggregates that compose one’s own being as the self and then to not conceptualize about the existence and characteristics of others as objects. This is taught extensively in many sources, such as the Further Collection:[55]
Leave the body like a corpse; Leave it as if ownerless.
Leave the mind like the sky; Leave it without reference point.
And in the Scattered [Teachings]:[56]
Like the sky, without hopes and fears, Relax without indulging hopes and fears. Like the sky, without clinging to self,
Do not cling to a self; give up attachment.

The qualifications of a master who imparts teachings are described in
Heart Essence of Profound Meaning:[57]
Realized in the meaning of the words, well adorned by loving kindness, endowed with eight skills, personal quest complete, accomplished in emptiness and compassion, and skilled in clearing away faults.
And the qualifications of the disciple who receives teachings:
Endowed with faith, enthusiasm, devotion, courage, perseverance, aspirations for higher existences, safety from dangers, and the desire to attain omniscience.
The reasons for needing this practice:
In order to sever the lack of realization, mistaken realization, biased realization, and doubts, the wise should adhere to this path of the victorious ones.
The object to be severed:
The devils are the gods, afflictive emotions, aggregates, and the lord of death. The special ones are these four: material, immaterial, exaltation, and inflation.
The method of severance is taught in the Appendices:[58]
When mental inflation does not enter into
Appearance and its intrinsic emptiness,
All devils are severed within mind
And mind is liberated in unborn basic space.
The place to practice is presented in Profound Meaning:[59]
Charnel grounds, desolate valleys, temples, isolated trees, deserted houses, etc.
Stay wherever your own mind is anxious and afraid.
And the time to practice is taught:
At night, the terrifying gods and demons gather, and thoughts abound.
This is the time to sever doubts, clear away obstructers, and enhance realization.
Concerning these, first of all:[60]
Obtain the excellent empowerment and become worthy to receive the profound.
Through the path of accumulation and purification, seeking mind is introduced.
Thus to become worthy of the path one must first receive empowerment. According to the great source text[61] there are one hundred empowerments of the transforming lama, one hundred empowerments of the transforming buddha, and one hundred empowerments of the transforming ḍākinī. These are known as the three hundred empowerments of Severance. There also seems to be “a hundred feasts a hundred empowerments,” “the eighty empowerments of Severance,” and so on. The practice that is done these days is the empowerment called “the ten open doors of oral instruction” to actually open the door of dharma, and the ripening by means of the introduction, blessings, and so on in connection with “opening the door to the sky.” This is the meaning of Machik’s statement:
It is not deity empowerment bestowed on the body,
It is the ultimate empowerment bestowed on the mind.[62]

Machik’s Severance Object consists of many systems, such as the sutra tradition, the combination of the realization of sutra and tantra, the pure vision of the later severance revealed treasures (gter ma), and so on. Since the root practice of them all is related to the four main points mentioned before, we could summarize as follows: In the exceptional preliminary practice, gathering the accumulations internally through the body, the devotional supplications bring down the vital blessings. In the main practice, by focusing exclusively on awareness, one searches for the faults within the mind. When this is straightened up, the methods of settling are presented. Based on “Opening the Door to the Sky,”[63] the meaning of the Mother is introduced: the guidance on meaning reveals it, the guidance on words establishes the meditation, and the guidance on experience cultivates the meditation. These methods are also taught in the Great Collection of Precepts:[64]
Placing your body however it is comfortable,
Thinking has no object; you won’t find it.
Better to rest within nonthought.
And:[65]
Since everything is naturally occurring mind,
A meditator does not meditate.
Whatever arises, however it arises, all feelings of arising—
Let them rest: clear, steady, and relaxed.
As for the general manner of introduction, there are countless methods, such as the introduction to the sixteen kinds of emptiness from the instructions of seeing the face of the Great Mother, the introduction to the six perfections from the revealed treasures of the female severance tradition, and also the introduction of appearance as mind, mind as emptiness, emptiness as coemergence, and coemergence as dharmakāya. In any case, it is said in the Collection of Precepts:[66]
When there is nothing whatsoever to practice,
That itself is the practice.
So-called experience is an object of the intellect.
In the absolute sense, there is nothing to experience.
In other words, in meditative equipoise effortless mindfulness maintains the inherent countenance of the unutterable, unimaginable, and ineffable, and dharmakāya is accomplished on the spot. As is said:[67]
When the mind does nothing at all,
Habitual patterns do not occur, stages and paths are consummated.
In post-meditation, the four devils are severed in the realm of reality. As is said:
The fetters of material objects are severed,
The fetters of immaterial mind are severed,
The fetters of exalting attachment are severed.
The fetters of inflated ego are severed.

It is said that the first three are included in inflation alone. From The Great Collection of Precepts:[68]
The material devil and the immaterial devil,
The devil of exaltation and the devil of inflation:
The devil is divided into these four,
But they are all included in the devil of inflation.

The method by which to sever these is also explained in the same source:[69]
Absence of hope and fear is sublime severance.
Free of the extremes of accepting and rejecting,
If the rope of dualistic fixation is severed
Buddhahood will definitely be reached.

How should one sever it? From the Scattered [Teachings]:
With fearless determination Use whatever is difficult to sever
To enhance experience and realization; Qualities and capabilities will be perfected.
At what time should one practice severance? From the Appendices:[70]
This sacred teaching of Severing Evil Object 
Is different from other instructions:
Others just pertain to a later time,
Whereas this severs right now.
In a haunted place you will see if you have cut through or not. Others gradually abandon discursive thinking,
Whereas this assimilates right now.
Furthermore, it states in Severing Delusion:[71]
There also occurs a classification into three: the best is the severance in the view of reality, the middling the severance by strong mindfulness, and the least is the severance of conceptual thinking.
With this kind of view and meditation, the yogin cuts through right on the spot in a haunted place and then integrates the experience of equal taste on the path. To forcefully enhance the production of experience and realization, one should go by the four modes of travel to a haunted place with the right characteristics and actively engage the path of deliberate conduct. From the Appendices:
Go to a haunted place and arouse awareness. Encountering circumstances, put them into practice.
Other methods aim for results later on; This one actually manifests now.
Initially, when gods and demons outside, discursive thoughts inside, and sickness in between are aroused by the meditative absorption in which the gods and demons of the place overpower the self, then as Machik said:
Separate awareness from matter and blend it with basic space.
Rest within emptiness as long as it remains.
The practice is casting out the body as food.

So it is taught that the meditative equipoise is to blend awareness and basic space, and the post-meditation practice is “casting out the body as food.”[72] The first is explained in the short source text:[73]
The most excellent method
Is to blend awareness and space,
Stopping things and characteristics.
Utterly abandon fixating on reference points.
Free of both subjective and objective fixation.
With body and mind uncontrived,
Wherever empty space pervades:
Settle in this expanding vastness.
This is the essence of the practice. For working with the particular practice, it says:[74]
Go to a haunted place and when the charismatic presence Of gods and demons occurs, separate awareness from matter. The body is matter, like a stone,
[So it cannot be harmed.]
The mind is immaterial, like the sky. So who harms and who is harmed? Think like that and rest in reality Without fear and worry.
Secondly, after that meditative absorption there are three cycles of integrating the white feast on the path,[75] which are peaceful. The three cycles of the red banquet of throwing and taking and so on are wrathful. Alternating those and alternating with the peaceful and wrathful of the mixed banquet, and so on, equalizes the value of good and bad thoughts. This is enhanced by concentrating on the outer gods and demons and the inner ego-fixation as the extreme of nonself. Through this, initially ego- fixation and discursive thinking will rise up as the very embodiment of emptiness, as mentioned before. Ultimately, circumstances themselves will be the indicators of success, as taught in the Appendices:[76]
Spiritual powers will come from nāgas and devils.
Tsen and king spirits will act as patrons.
Mamos and ḍākinīs will provide food and wealth.
Fame will be spread by gods and demons of apparent existence.
It is said that ultimately, imbued with three great confidences,[77] one’s mind will be happy. Once the three great confidences have been attained, the paths and stages will automatically be consummated. When this kind of view and action coexist, then one is a most excellent Severance practitioner, as stated in the great source text:[78]
The yogin invested with view and action Is like the weapon-wielding warrior, And like conquering hordes of enemies, All evil and ego-inflation are conquered.
Lacking the confidence of view but engaging in various pretentious nonsense is called “perverse severance” and is said to be a terrible mistake.[79] Possessing the view but being unable to take up the conduct on the path is also of no benefit, as instructed in the Further Collection:[80]
If you do not know adversities as allies,
Though your view is lofty, you are lost.
Not internalizing the instructions
Or establishing confident understanding,
Nothing is resolved from just listening to words.

To sum up, as stated in The Appendices:[81]
Danger is great when view is wrong.
Enemies arise when sacred pledge is wrong. Obstructions arise when mind is agitated. Poisons develop from ego-fixating thought.
Thus, do not get lost in those things that should be rejected. And from the Further Collection:
Wandering in isolation is the vital point of place, Relaxing the four channels is the vital point of body, Singing songs of experience is the vital point of speech, Eradicating beliefs is the vital point of mind.
Always keep these four crucial points of what to practice. And:
By facing the demon of disease, it is released in its own place harmlessly.
By employing enemies as your escort, they will carry you fearlessly to the end.
By using circumstances as the path, there are no unharmonious adverse conditions.
By resolving negative circumstances inside, it is as if there were no objective enemy.
This is the way to actively engage the path of deliberate conduct. From the Appendices:
When afflictive emotions and thoughts arise,
Feelings of passion and aggression, happiness and misery:
That is the devil, so practice!
At that time adhere to the cure, Severance.
One should sever discursive thoughts internally, without a perverted understanding of the severance object or eagerness to do the practice of giving the body. And, from the Appendices:[82]
Indeed there are many that desire Severance Object,
But there are very few who do the practice
For other than desire for fame in this life.
If this is so, do not give it to them.
This is about inappropriate recipients. And:
Desiring to attain perfect buddhahood, Go into seclusion and practice.
Staying in a haunted place, control the mind.
Relax without distraction and liberation will be certain.
Thus, the vital points of the instruction, along with the general path and result, are taught briefly in these and other sayings. Definitely do it!

This is the sublime meaning that is plainly presented with one intention and one voice in all of the extensive root tantras, such as the Supreme Original Buddha.[1] It is called the Six-Branch Yoga of Mahāmudrā, the ultimate pinnacle of all completion phase practice, renowned as the profound path of vajrayoga. Its essence is taught in the Kālacakra Root Tantra[2] and the Guhyasamāja Latter Tantra:[3]
Withdrawal, meditative stability, Vital energy control, retention, Recollection, and absorption—
These are accepted as the six branches.
The glorious Ocean of Ḍākas[4] also has the six branches as the meditation topic, the conduct that enhances it, and the result that is obtained, teaching the complete path and result by means of these eight topics. Also the Cakrasaṃvara Root Tantra,[5] the [Ḍākinī Vajra] Tent,[6] and the [Hevajra Tantra] in Two Parts[7] fully present the meaning, though in an unclear manner. What is more, this is the very path that is presented in all tantras.

How is one guided along this path? One needs to practice with three kinds of confidence, as taught in Stainless Light:[9]
The Blessed One spoke of three types of confidence for this mantra vehicle:
First is the period of confidence in the tantra, Next there is confidence in the guru,
And after that confidence in oneself.
With these three, the path of genuine buddhahood will be totally complete.
Confidence in the tantra means confidence that these are the esoteric instructions of definitive meaning derived from the precise words explicitly presented in the definitive pure tantras that came directly from the mouth of the perfect Buddha, whose meaning has been expounded by authentic scholar-adepts.
Confidence in the guru is confidence that such a teaching has come from the Buddha directly to oneself in an unbroken lineage of gurus who have attained spiritual powers based on this path, or who have had special experiences in accordance with this tantra, such that there has been no degeneration in its blessings.
Confidence in oneself is to gain confidence in meditative experience, the tantra, and the esoteric instruction, as one’s own meditation leads to the arising of experiences in harmony with those explained in the tantra, and [those experiences] have occurred just as the guru said they would. When one has these three kinds of confidence, the reason for dharma will be understood and one will gain the initial inspiration[10] from which arises the pure path to the attainment of supreme spiritual powers.
The uncommon preliminaries along with the main practice are included in the four branches of approach and attainment. The Kālacakra Condensed Tantra states:[11]
Approach through the five elixirs and so on, the ocean vajras,[12] the mantra repetition, and so on.
Near attainment comes through withdrawal and so on, and the elixir born from the vajra and lotus.
Attainment occurs in meditation upon the equal flavor of the three vajras, such as joy and so on, and the water-born lotus.
Great attainment definitely occurs from the union with wisdom whenever there is no emission and by the subtle yoga.[13]

In general, there are many divisions of the four branches of approach and attainment in the main practice of the completion phase. However, at this point we should calculate one time what the four branches of approach and attainment are in terms of the completion phase preliminaries and main practice in conjunction.[14] Since the fourfold disregard in the preliminaries lays the foundation of the deity’s form in the completion phase, it is the branch of approach. That very deity’s form during withdrawal, meditative stability, vital energy control, and retention constitutes the branch of near attainment. Recollection of the passionate desire of the three mudras is the unchanging bliss of great passion, the branch of attainment. And since meditative absorption accomplishes the actual sublime form of pristine awareness, it is the branch of great attainment.[15] The meaning of the first verse of the tantra above is explained in Stainless Light:[16]
Here the beginner should first approach through the ritual of the means of accomplishment (grub thabs, sādhana). Regarding the statement “approach through the five elixirs and so on,” the external five elixirs are feces and so on. “So on” refers to cow, dog, and such.[17] Eating these in order to please the deity is the approach. The five inner elixirs are the five aggregates. “So on” refers to the five senses, which are the five lamps. To disregard those is the approach—it is the total renunciation of bodily and material craving. Through that approach, the deities will bestow the supreme spiritual power. It is not through eating feces and such.

“The ocean vajras” refers to the disregard for physical enjoyment, the disregard for vocal enjoyment, the disregard for mental enjoyment, and disregard for the enjoyment of emission, which is restraint (vows) of body, speech, mind, and pure conduct. That is what it means. Through this the deities will bestow the supreme spiritual power, not because of attachment to the enjoyments of existence.
Possessing this fourfold disregard is the same as what is called in general terms “reliance on three isolations” (dben gsum bsten pa): isolation of the body from activity, of the voice from expression, and of the mind from thought.
Since the six branches of the main practice are the yogas of the four vajras, and the preliminaries that establish the foundation for that must include the four kinds of disregard, they are therefore termed “ocean vajras” (chu gter rdo rje). Disregard for the physical enjoyment is the preliminary that lays the foundation for the yoga of the Body vajra using withdrawal and meditative stability. Similarly, disregard for vocal enjoyment is for the Speech [yogas] of vital energy control and retention, disregard for mental enjoyment is for the Mind [yogas] of recollection, and disregard for enjoyment of emission is for the yoga of absorption in pristine awareness vajra.
As for the meaning of those terms, “approach” (bsnyen pa) is so called because one will grow close to the supreme spiritual power, such as when the road that takes one to the city is in sight. “Near attainment” (nye bar sgrub pa) means nearer to that accomplishment, as when one is preparing to travel that road. “Attainment” (sgrub pa) is just the beginning of engaging in the uncommon cause of attaining the result, like entering the road and traveling upon it. “Great attainment” (sgrub pa chen po) means unhindered engagement with the result, like entering the city gates.

Furthermore, as occurs in the King of Tantras:[18]
In the approach, the ten aspects of the first yoga use the Cakrin’s wrathful gaze into space.
With the gaze of an uṣnīṣacakrin[19]and the vital points of binding the bodily functions, all connections between the ordinary five sense organs and their five objects are individually severed and the consciousnesses that stray to objects are drawn inside. Five other faculties that are the nature of pristine awareness then interact with five alternate objects that are the nature of luminous clarity. As it says:[20]
In withdrawal within the body, the ten physical subjects and objects are not engaged.
Those stages of yoga cause the right and left channel mandalas of method and wisdom to cease within the central channel, and the ten signs are quickly completed. The great adept Śavaripa said:[21]
Having the threefold immobility
Introduces the ten energy currents into the dhūti.[22] Outer and inner thoughts stop and the ten signs occur. This is the branch of individual severance.
Now, many past masters have cited the Kālacakrapāda Transmission,[23] which says, “All should be understood as sixfold.” Applying this idea, all the branches are explicated using a sixfold system: (1) the meaning of the individual name, (2) the time for meditation, (3) the branches of the meditation techniques, (4) the valid signs of meditation, (5) divisions of what is purified and what purifies, and (6) the results obtained from the meditation.

The first time for doing the meditation on the initial withdrawal is immediately after the energy current moves from the left nostril to the right, when the earth energy falls. If one meditates at that time, since the movements from the right [nostril] are the circulation of the sequential withdrawal [or dissolution] of the elements,[25] it becomes the special interdependent connection for impure appearances to absorb into space. Regardless, beginners should pursue meditation at all times except when sleeping.

The essence is to have the ability to withdraw the energy currents into the central channel by means of nonconceptuality with threefold immobility. The two yogas, daytime and nighttime, are for the purification of the twofold divisions into method and wisdom, such as the development and destruction of the environment, the birth and death of its inhabitants, the two declinations [of the sun] in a year, the two phases of the moon, day and night, right and left movement of the constituents, the balance and imbalance in the movements of time-conjunctions and energy currents,[26] and so on. Therefore, one definitely needs both day and night yogas. As stated in the [Guhyasamāja] Latter Tantra:
At night, the yoga with smoke and so forth, and again during the day, blazing in the sky and so forth....
In particular, the vital point is that the night yoga gathers the five mandalas on the right into the central channel and the day yoga gathers the five on the left, causing the ten definite signs of day and night and so forth to arise. This is the main significance.

There are ten objective signs of the meditative absorption of withdrawal. The four signs of the night yoga are given in the [Kālacakra Condensed] Tantra:[27]
In emptiness, there is smoke, mirage, brilliant immaculate sky light, and lamp flames.
The six signs of the day yoga in the Tantra are[28]
Blazing, moon, sun, vajras, lightning, and spheres will be seen.
The ten signs are definite signs included within whichever one of those ten is appropriate. But since the signs of indefinite form are limitless, they are referred to as “seeing various images.” Furthermore, they are called signs because they are the cause of the birth of the confidence that the pristine awareness of ultimate truth resides in oneself and that by meditating on the path it will be actualized. They are not signs that are merely relative deluded appearances.
The consciousness that perceives such signs is a valid cognition (tshad ma). The Kālacakra Tantra states:[29]
Whatever the frame of reference for the deity, it has two aspects: direct and inferential.
Direct [valid cognition] is union with thatness, causing many forms of the saṃbhogakāya, like stars in the sky.
As is taught, the valid cognition of the creation stage is inferential, but all valid cognition of the Six-Branch Yoga is direct. In terms of the defining characteristics of valid cognition, there are four: sensory direct valid cognition, mental direct valid cognition, yogic direct valid cognition and reflexively aware direct valid cognition. But in terms of essence there is a single direct valid cognition. Therefore all direct valid cognition during each of the six yogas does fully include the four parts of direct valid cognition. However, in this situation the sensory direct valid cognition is primary and, of the five eyes,[30] its sensory basis is the flesh eyeball. As stated in Stainless Light:
Here, since at first the beginner yogin lacks clairvoyance, the flesh eye sees various things.
The Sanskrit term for eye is akṣa, but it also means all the sense organs. Thus it is not taken as only the basis of seeing images of form but is applied to the entire apprehension of the form, sound, smell, taste, and sensation of emptiness. This pertains similarly to the topics below.

The ground of the stains that are to be refined in all six yogas is nothing but the reality of buddha nature, so there is nothing to divide. However, to classify that which is to be purified, in general there are thirty-six aggregates and constituents. Of those, what is to be purified in connection with withdrawal is the single set of six constituents of pristine awareness, such as the aggregate of pristine awareness and so forth.[31]
There are ten divisions in the agent that purifies, which is the yoga of withdrawal itself. By virtue of there being a sequential arising of ten signs, there are ten divisions of higher or lower levels of experience and realization.

The immediate result is the attainment of [the power of] true words[32] and the efficacy of mantra. The [Kālacakra Condensed Tantra] says:[33]
Through withdrawal, the yogin who is totally free of objects is blessed by all mantras.
The ultimate result is that at that time of attaining the state of complete awakening, infinite mandalas of the sixfold set of the pristine awareness constituent appear as deities such as Vajrasattva.

As stated in Stainless Light:[35]
Meditative stability in the various forms that are the single unity of the ten objects and subjects.
This means resting in equipoise with one-pointed mental focus on the luminous clarity of images of emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects,[36] allowing one to attain control of abiding and moving [of thought] as desired. When the five branches of meditative stability such as conception, analysis, and so forth[37] are well completed, infinite appearing images with five properties arise endowed with the three certainties. The certain object is the great vital essence sphere, the certain time is throughout meditation and post-meditation, and the certain manifestation is with all marks and characteristics.
This also has the six topics, such as the meaning of the name, and so on.

From the Short Presentation on Empowerment:[39]
Form will be seen as a dream. Meditate constantly on that form.
Thus the essence of meditative stability is the absorption of one-pointed focus on the manifest signs of luminous clarity. The branches of that are taught in the [Kālacakra] Condensed Tantra:[40]
Meditative stabilities are the one-pointed mental focus of discernment, conception, analysis, joy, and unwavering bliss.
(1) Discernment[41] is the mind in one-pointed focus on the ten signs of luminous clarity.
(2) Of conception it is said, “So-called conception (rtog pa) is apprehension (’dzin pa) of an entity.” Therefore, knowing the defining characteristic of the form of emptiness that bears the name of entity is conception. However, the manner of knowing the defining characteristics is not just through ideas but through direct experiences.
(3) The branch of analysis is the experiential certainty of mind itself arising as forms of emptiness without any overlay of elaborated characteristics whatsoever from dualism or subject-object concepts.
(4) The mental bliss that is evoked by meditative absorption occurs in two stages: focused internally and focused externally. Focusing externally is the arising of experiences of happiness and joy, like finding unprecedented great contentment. That is the branch of bliss.[42]
(5) The branch of unwavering bliss is the internal focus on the experience of that very absorption arising as bliss. With that as the stimulus, one is pervaded by the special bliss of an utterly pliant body—an added benefit of unwavering bliss.
First discernment alone arises. Then with conception it occurs as twofold. Similarly, it becomes threefold with analysis, fourfold with joy, and fivefold with unwavering bliss. With just that, the branches of meditative stability have fully arisen in one’s mindstream. Therefore if one sustains the continuity of that very experience and meditates, the qualities of consummation will quickly arise.

The Tantra says:
The forms of the buddhas in the center of it are the many saṃbhogakāya forms totally free of object.
This presents the uncommon signs of meditative stability. Consolidated by the ten signs, the images of the entire three existences are much greater than seen before at the time of withdrawal. Those multicolored images of various forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and sensations are seen marked by many vital essence spheres and have a form endowed with five properties called radiant, minute, glittering, vibrating, and durable.[43] Many images of buddhas arise in the center of the spheres. Since that too is realized to be the pure appearance of mind itself, all relative karmic appearance naturally arises like illusion. From the [Guhyasamāja] Latter Tantra:
Mind, through stable meditative stability, even abandons utterly the external entities.
The valid cognition is the same as for withdrawal, but the sensory base for it is the divine eye, and for that reason one also achieves the five clairvoyances.[44]

The basis of purification is the same as explained in the section on withdrawal. To classify that which is purified, it is divided into a single set of six aggregates and constituents of space, such as the aggregate of consciousness.[45] That which purifies is the branch of meditative stability itself. It has ten divisions: the five branches of meditative stability as subjects, and the five forms of emptiness that are their objects.

There are two versions of this: the real branch of vital energy control with full characteristics, and the analogous vital energy control that is to be accomplished by beginners. For the time being, it will be explained with reference to the latter.
The instructions from the lineage of the great paṇḍita Śākyaśrī[48] and the two traditions of Ra[49] and Dro[50] are combined into a single instruction known as the Six Vajra Lines:
(1) The preliminary refines the channel pathways through vajra repetition.
(2) Once refined, the yoga of filling and expelling with gentle breathing exercise directs the vital energy into the central channel.
(3) Once it enters, the yoga of forceful vase-breathing binds the vital energy in the central channel.
(4) When it has not entered the central channel and one is unable to bind it, the yoga of forceful methods binds the paths of sun and moon and blocks it. When it is blocked at the lower door by the forceful methods, it is released upwards by the yoga.
(5) By the yoga of utilizing the uvula, the potency of inner elixir is tasted.[51]
(6) The yoga of blazing inner heat blends vital and downward-clearing energy and accomplishes immortality.
The first four are considered esoteric instructions of vital energy control, and the latter two are esoteric instructions for retention.
Here, again, the six topics such as the meaning of the name can be applied.

Prāṇa in Sanskrit can be translated as vital energy [or life force]. Āyāma is to stop (’gog pa) or to control (rtsol ) or to extend (ring tu byed pa).[52] Through grammatical linkage, it becomes prāṇāyāma, which means to control vital energy (srog rtsol ) or to stop vital energy (srog ’gog). Here, “vital energy” (srog) is a name for energy currents (rlung, Skt. prāṇa) and to halt or control means to direct them [into the central channel].

And from Kālacakrapāda’s Esoteric Instruction:[54]
In order to generate unchanging bliss
Meditate on the branch of vital energy control.
One portion of the set of causes of unchanging bliss is the mahāmudrā of forms of emptiness that was already accomplished during withdrawal and meditative stability. The other portion is attaining sovereignty over energy currents and binding them in the avadhūti that totally purifies the vajra body, bringing about immortality and mastery over vital essence. That is the need for vital energy control.

When meditating on the yoga, one should continue until the energy currents flow exclusively in the central channel. With that, one will achieve the power to retain and reverse the coarse bodhicitta.

By six months for diligent ascetics the sensation of lower bliss will balance and become the mind of the path.

[The Kālacakra Tantra] states:[56]
In vital energy control, the pathways are both deposed and the vital energy totally enters the central channel and becomes pure.
This is a meditative absorption that causes the energy currents of the right and left channels to be stopped, the energy currents that circulate in the channels of feces and urine below are also stopped in the conchbearing channel.[57] Similarly, the vital energy that circulates in the central channel and the downward-clearing energy current that circulates in the conch-bearing channel are gathered into one.

The practice is the vajra repetition. It is presented in the Kālacakra Tantra:[58]
Through moon, sun, “a” and so forth and “ka” and so forth, the three movements abide and there is repetition of the Body vajra, and so forth.
Filling [or inhaling] and expelling with the gentle breathing exercise straightens out the deviation of breath. As it says:
Pressing with strength on the breasts and the right and left armpits, vital energy is stopped. From that, the vital energy will suddenly flow from the right to the left channel and from the left armpit to the right. By half a month, the yogin possessing yoga will cheat the death-bringers and death-omens.
The main practice of filling and vase-breathing are also presented:[59]
The mouth too is closed, and from the two nostrils all outer energy currents are drawn in by the force of the vital energy [exercise] and like immaculate lightning, joined with the downward-clearing energy currents.
Also the benefits are presented:
It robs hunger and thirst for food and such for the body, and is also immortality itself.[60]
Furthermore, the Stainless Light states:
The yogas of exhalation, filling, and vase-breathing are always the approach.
Thus all the different esoteric instructions of vital energy control are also presented as such. Here, since the vase-breathing is foremost, it is definitely necessary, but the others may be applied however they are appropriate.
In the meantime, in order to prevent obstructions to one’s life, it is appropriate to draw the increasingly strengthened energy currents into the central channel or to perform any other means of removing obstructions. The time for it is also presented in this and other passages [of the Kālacakra Tantra]:[61]
In fully doing vital energy control, whenever the heart or head is afflicted by fire...

The immediate results are taught in the Kālacakra Tantra:[63]
Purified by vital energy control, divorced from the paths of the rabbit-bearing moon and sun, the yogin is worshiped by bodhisattvas.
Among the benefits of stopping the erratic energy currents that move in the right and left channels are that the buddhas and bodhisattvas will confer prophecies and blessings, one will enjoy the sensory pleasures of form and the other five objects as manifestations of pristine awareness, develop clairvoyance of the six senses, and acquire power over humans and nonhumans. The ultimate result is that the sixfold set of the wind constituent will be attained as the deity Amoghasiddhi and so on.

From the Tantra:[64]
Through the vital energy fully entering the vital essence and overcoming the circulation in both, single-pointed mind is retained.
And from the Latter Tantra:
Exhalation and inhalation again holds down; the branch of retention involves the vital essence.
And it is taught in Stainless Light:
Here “vital essence” (thig le) means the vital energy (srog) fully entering at the forehead. “Overcoming the circulation in both” means that it is free of coming and going. “Single-pointed mind” is the retention of the vital energy at the forehead.
With the yoga of extremely stable vase-breathing, the vital energy is retained without coming and going. During vital energy control, the ten mandalas of the left and right energy currents had previously come to abide in the central channel. Now, as a continuation of that, the same vital energy and downward-clearing energy currents that were blended in one mass enter into the indestructible vital essence or imperishable vital essence in the central channel. There, the energy currents with the characteristics of coming and going dissolve or vanish. Of course, that can occur in the six chakras, but the ultimate location of this is the forehead chakra. Therefore when the vital energy or energy current enters there and stabilizes without emission, the branch of subsequent mindfulness commences.
The six topics, such as the meaning of the name and so forth, apply here also.

In particular, it is the meditative absorption of mental focus on the nondissipating vital essence stabilized at the forehead once the vital energy fully enters the vital essence at the forehead.

For a beginner, the way to meditate on analogous retention is just as was previously explained. Real retention involves the energy current held at the central channel, which was the right and left and vital and downward-clearing energy currents that were formerly blended together in the six chakras by the yoga of vase-breathing. That energy current now dissolves into emptiness in the manner of entering the vital essence, which causes the inner heat to blaze.
Regarding this, there are many cases where most of the tantric commentary that presents retention does not mention an arrangement of more than four chakras. Where there is a tenfold division, the explanation includes the chakra at the crown of the head (gtsug tor, Skt. uṣnīṣa), indicating the necessity of practicing retention even at the crown. Therefore there are two methods: one for attaining what was not previously attained at the five chakras of navel, heart, throat, head, and crown of the head, and another for stabilizing and increasing more and more what was already attained. The so-called forehead vital essence should be understood as the place where a branch of the central channel curves down from the crown of the head to between the eyebrows.[65]
The secret vase-breathing is not actually mentioned in the commentary on the tantra, but it is there implicitly. Since it will clear away obstructions and enhance the previous practices, it should definitely be done. It is not counted separately because it is applied as part of the vasebreathing at the crown of the head.

In general, this is the same as the previous branches, but in particular the Kālacakra Tantra says:[66]

The immediate results are mentioned in the Kālacakra Tantra:[69]
The force of retention weakens devils and afflictive emotions and such, and the ten powers are engaged.
Thus, the sufferings of the aggregates, such as old age and sickness, are cleared up. By understanding the nature of afflictive emotion, one is able to make it into the path. One attains some control over life, and some conquest of the four devils,[70] since one is not fettered by attachment to the sense pleasures. Neither will one fall under the power of afflictive emotion. There is also the special achievement of physical, verbal, and mental powers due to the force of the ten energy currents dissolving. According to the Kālacakrapāda Transmission:[71]
No eating, no hunger; if eating it is digested. Downward-clearing energy drips; bliss expands. Magical big vajra belly,
Physical lightness and so on—nonconceptual bliss.
And also:
Long life, health, balance of the elements.
The ultimate result is that the sixfold set of the fire constituent is actualized as the deities Ratnasaṃbhava and so forth.

The Kālacakra Tantra states:[72]
Whatever occurs as the appearance of inner heat is definitely recollected in the body as well as in the sky.
Also the [Guhyasamāja] Latter Tantra says:
Through recollection, like the moon in the sky, great rays of light will certainly move in one’s body.
As taught there, the real recollection does not depend on physical training or control of the energy currents and so forth. This is for the situation when the knots in the channels of the six chakras have already been released, one has mastery of the bliss energy currents, and one can enjoy the blazing appearances of inner heat whenever one likes. Therefore, it is sufficient to practice simply according to the explanation in the actual presentation of the tantra.
Furthermore, real recollection is to accomplish primarily the various images of emptiness and bliss by recollection in either action-mudra, awareness-mudra, or mahāmudrā, depending on the difference in the thinness and thickness of the vital essence of persons of the three levels of faculties.
Analogous recollection is for beginners to stabilize the blended vital and downward-clearing energy currents by practicing the physical postures. As a branch of that, one refines the energy currents through retention, reversal, and so on, and learns the physical yoga exercises of binding the physical functions. Having done that, the main practice is to blend the three—the meditated action-mudra, the hand-mudra of one’s own body, and the action-mudra of another’s body—with the mahāmudrā of forms of emptiness. Meditation on the blazing and dripping based on inner heat is a branch of that.[73]

The term anu can apply both to inferior (dman pa) and to superior (lhag pa), but in this case, it has the meaning of superior. Thus anusmṛti or subsequent recollection means superior recollection. Recollecting again what was previously cultivated in meditation, it is intense recollection (shin tu dran pa).

One should keep meditating until the first moment of unchanging bliss arises.

The essence is the single-pointed absorption in the recurring arousal of melting bliss without emission that results from meditative equipoise in a nonconceptual and unconfused manner on subtle and coarse forms of emptiness of the manifestations of the three worlds—primarily the forms of emptiness of the mother-father deities in union that are the blazing appearance of inner heat.

The Kālacakra Tantra says:[74]
There is a variety according to divisions such as inferior and so on, but primarily the three methods of accomplishment,
The three mudras and three states, by virtue of three modes of progress, are the action, the conceptual, and the sublime.
Accordingly, in the initial state of dull faculties and thin vital essence, when one is unable to completely elicit the four joys without relying on an action-mudra partner, one meditates on the recollection that combines the three practices of action-mudra, awareness-mudra, and mahāmudrā into one.
Then there is a jump[75] in the faculty level, and at this intermediate stage one’s faculties become moderate and the vital essence thickens somewhat. Once this state occurs, when one is still unable to completely elicit bliss through mahāmudrā alone but can do without an actionmudra partner, then one should abandon the action-mudra practice and meditate on the recollection that combines the two practices of awareness-mudra and mahāmudrā into one.
Again there is a jump in faculties, which now become acute. For the state in which the bodhicitta has become quite thick, one can completely elicit the bliss of melting through mahāmudrā alone. While one has not yet attained unchanging bliss, one should meditate on the recollection that relies solely on mahāmudrā.
These [three levels of recollection are all described] with reference primarily to meditative equipoise. The connection with the behavior of deliberate conduct in post-meditation is indefinite.
Regarding these three states, there is also the view that maintains the “application of four mudras,” “application of three mudras,” and “application of two mudras,” and the progression called “application of three,” “application of two,” and “application of one.”[76]

Every occasion in which the four joys are completely elicited, the emanation of infinite blazing appearances of inner heat arise in increasingly enhanced ways. Even if one tried to emit the white jasmine bodhicitta,[77] it would not be emitted, but would forcefully reverse itself upwards from the tip of the jewel. Even one’s own body appears as the light mandala of forms of emptiness. The images of emptiness of the pure and impure three existences radiate and absorb continuously.
As for valid cognition, all four kinds of direct valid cognition are present, but since it is the pristine awareness of intrinsic awareness involved in experiencing sublime inner bliss, it is primarily reflexively aware direct valid cognition.

The divisions of what is purified are the single set of the element of water, six aggregates and constituents, such as perception and so on.[78] The agent that purifies is the branch of recollection, which has ten divisions. As stated in the Kālacakra Tantra:[79]
Thought, desire, physical plague, a mouth with dry lips, aversion to food,
Trembling, insanity, idiocy, a befuddled mind, a deep swoon,
Ten brilliant forms, such as vajra-bearing smoke, which to the body of a living creature in the world are totally clear and certain.
Who desires victory over those disturbing situations?
Thus, when each of the forms of emptiness in the tenfold division of signs sequentially elicits bliss, it is equivalent to the state of contemplation. One attains the different ten kinds of bliss in sequence, such as the attainment of the first bliss of total purity and so forth.

The immediate results are mentioned in the Kālacakra Tantra:[80]
Thoroughly purified through recollection, pure mandalas of stainless light come from the forms of pristine awareness.
Since all of the channels are filled with bodhicitta, mandalas of light pervade everywhere inside and outside. Even though the body matured [by karma] has not been transformed, one’s mind actually becomes the deity’s form. Additionally, one attains infinite clairvoyance, miraculous ability, and so on. The experience of bliss-emptiness is unceasing.
The ultimate result is that the mandala of the sixfold set of the water constituent is actualized as the deity Amitābha and so on.

The Kālacakra Tantra says:[81]
This is meditative absorption in the form of pristine awareness by virtue of unchanging bliss that is the embodiment of wisdom and method.
In accordance with this, the meditative absorption of union is the culmination of melting bliss without emission, accomplishing the transformation of the vital essence substance into forms of emptiness, that into a vital essence, and that into unchanging bliss.
While the real meditative absorption is mostly similar to the practice of recollection of mahāmudrā, practicing with many different actionmudra partners is taught as a method for advancement. Practicing in that way, once one is able to generate the complete melting bliss in forward and reverse order through the totally complete ten signs of mahāmudrā,[82] then it will not be long until the vital essence of the previous instant will transform into a form of emptiness in the next. Also, the form of emptiness that is the blazing of inner heat together with the blazing of the action inner heat consumes the vital essence.[83] With that kind of melting bliss, the [resulting] form of emptiness is bound at the tip of the jewel.[84] When that happens it blocks one action current that is a portion of the ten energy currents, one white [vital essence drop] in the area of the jewel, and one red [vital essence drop] in the area of the crown of the head. Hence consciousness—the phenomena made up of three elemental constituents of the seminal fluids (sperm and ovum) and the energy currents—dissolves into the forms of emptiness of pristine awareness. Through this, one attains the first instant of unchanging pristine awareness comprised of emptiness, bliss, and clarity. From that point on, each previous instant of pristine awareness changes to one progressively more sublime and as each one is attained, one should know that it is the successive instant of meditative absorption. In this manner up through twelve spiritual levels,[85] the movement of 21,600 breaths of the karmic energy current ceases and the unchanging joy increases proportionally. At the end of the culmination of meditative absorption, one attains the embodiment of wisdom and method, the union kāya or pristine awareness kāya. This is the attainment of the lesser level of buddhahood and the first level of a vajra-holder.[86]

Now, as for the vital energy as a form of emptiness: since it is free of being corporeal form and is essentially pristine awareness, it is not subject to fluctuation. Therefore it has been established as “the vital essence stabilizing.” Moreover, since it is completely bound at the end of its descent, the energy current is first blocked after the ascent. Then one portion of the red aspect stabilizes at the top of the head, causing the red to blaze downwards. That condition causes one portion of the white to stabilize at the jewel. In this, the binding of all 21,000 instants takes place only in the jewel. At first the place of stabilizing is, of course, the jewel for the white and only the top of the head for the red. There, all those that have been stabilized stack up on the previous ones, so that it appears to be filling up gradually. From this process, there are references of from “half-filled secret chakra” to “crown chakra completely filled and stable” and “the red also stabilized in each place from the crown to the jewel.” As for the energy currents, while certainly a portion will be stabilized along with the white and red [aspects] in the crown and the jewel, primarily those that were previously located above the heart were controlled by the vital energy and those involved with the functioning of darkness (mun pa can) and rāhu (sgra gcan) dissolve at the navel. Those that were previously located below the navel and mainly controlled by the downward-clearing energy current, the energy currents of darkness, the one named fire, and fire of time, dissolve at the heart and cease.
These are the main locations. In general, the three constituents of male and female seminal fluids and the energy currents all become blocked in every part of the body.
Now, the six topics, such as the meaning of the name and so forth:

The essence of meditative absorption is the single pristine awareness. [When it is conceptually] divided into two isolated aspects, it is wisdom that is unchanging bliss, and skillful method that is the pristine awareness kāya endowed with the supreme of all aspects. Meditative absorption is the experience of union without any aspect of dualistic appearance from perceiving these two separately.
The culmination of melting bliss without emission is the catalyst for stopping one karmic energy current. One tenth of the three channels dissolves into the central channel.[87] The individual movements of the white and red constituents are “stabilized,” that is, immobilized, within the central channel. In that way when the channels, energy currents, and constituents are henceforth indestructible and become unceasing forms of emptiness, the pristine awareness that is essentially one with that is called unchanging bliss.
Thus it is said, “forms of emptiness are known by bliss; great bliss is known by itself.”

From the Kālacakra Tantra:[88]
Here, the yoga of coemergent pristine awareness that is peace, the singular, undiminished bliss is great attainment.
And from the Kālacakrapāda Transmission:
With mind resting firmly without wavering in the equal taste Of meditation with reference to forms of emptiness
And without reference in bliss, All things arise as bliss.
The unchanging bliss of the vital essence that was previously transformed, and the melting bliss without emission produced by the descent and reversal of vital essence that will be transformed later but is not now transformed turn into a single group. The mind within this state of bliss is utterly passionate towards the forms of emptiness, causing the melting bliss without emission to be experienced again and again. In post-meditation, one should always practice the conduct with elaboration, or practice whatever is appropriate as a way of enhancement or advancement.[89]

The signs of this branch start from the genuine perception of one realm of worlds in the ten directions that was not previously perceived in its ultimate significance, up to the genuine perception of the significance of 24,000 world systems.
The valid cognitions are the complete set of four valid cognitions. However, with respect to the uncommon specialty, it is the yogic valid cognition, since this branch is analogous to the pristine awareness of the exalted ones.

In the divisions of what is to be purified, it is the single sixfold set of aggregates and constituents connected with the earth constituent, such as the aggregate of form and so on.[90]
Meditative absorption as that which purifies can be divided into twelve by dividing [two aspects into] the six chakras in which the karmic energy currents cease. Alternatively, it is said that there are ten meditative absorptions because the ten energy currents cease. Thus there are ten stages by distinguishing the total cessation of the ten energy currents, such as the downward-clearing and so on, that have the attribute of never again arising.

The immediate result is described in the Kālacakra Tantra:[91]
Then, through the purification of meditative absorption, in a few days one will achieve the pristine awareness kāya.
If one meditates without interruption from the first arising of meditative absorption, one can actualize the level of the genuine truth of the true nature in three years and three fortnights. The karmicly ripened body will dissolve into basic space and one will attain the great pristine awareness kāya of union. This is to be a great bodhisattva adorned with the many qualities of the ten spiritual levels and so forth.
The ultimate result is that the mandala of the sixfold set of the earth constituent is actualized as the victor Vairocana and so on.

Branches of the path are valuable for beginners who have not gained full confidence in the yogas. These are the yoga of sleep, the recognition of luminous clarity at death, the instructions of transference at the moment of passing away, recognition in the intermediate state through purposeful intent, and blending meditative equipoise and post-meditation by meditating in sessions. The demarcations of the spiritual levels and paths, and the arrangement of the results, is extremely important, but they are explained only generally.
The branch of preventing the yogas from diminishing and causing their increase concerns the removal by general and specific remedies of the obstructions of devils that harm both body and mind, the obstructions of meditative absorption that harm mainly the mind, and the obstructions of the physical disturbance of the elements and their consequences that harm mainly the body.
Meditative absorption is enhanced through outer and inner instructions for introducing [mind’s nature], ascertaining the valid signs, and through devotion, compassion, and deliberate behavior. The four branches of sealing with the four commands, removing obstacles, guarding the sacred pledges, and maintaining the conduct are methods for protecting and preserving the continuity of the yogas. They are also added as supplements.

These six branches of yoga also exist in a cause and effect way. If we apply cause and effect as a pair, the first five branches would be the causal path, because they cause the accomplishment of forms of emptiness. Meditative absorption would be a branch of the effect because it is the accomplishment of unchanging bliss. If we apply a threefold set, then withdrawal is the branch of the cause, with meditative stability as the branch of the effect. Similarly, vital energy control is the causal branch and retention is the result, and recollection is cause with meditative absorption as the resultant branch, according to Vajrapāṇi’s intention.[92]
Those are included in the division of three virtues as taught by Bodhisattva Vajragarbha,[93] in which withdrawal and meditative stability are virtuous at the beginning, vital energy control and retention are virtuous in the middle, and recollection and meditative absorption are the virtuous path at the end.
In regard to that, generally the doctrine of the Teacher is virtuous at the beginning, the middle, and the end. That is because a beginner trains exclusively in virtue as the cause, which leads to the attainment of the virtues of the noble dharma on the path, and the actualization of the virtue of reality as the result. However, here we are discussing the uncommon context. While the other aspects are held to be virtuous, from the point of view of this ultimate definitive meaning, [methods that] possess the characteristic of being causes of relative cyclic existence are not very virtuous. These are conceptual meditation, fixation on the bliss of action-mudra as ultimate, and meditation on the nonconceptual emptiness at the end of analysis. They are not, in fact, the ultimate mandala of great bliss and emptiness.

In this path, at first one accomplishes the absolute mandala of forms of emptiness, so it is virtuous at the beginning. In the middle, since one stops the karmic energy currents that cause conceptual thought, it is virtuous in the middle. And in the end, one accomplishes the absolute unchanging vital essence, so it is virtuous in the end. There are those three, and during all three phases—beginning, middle, and end—it is virtuous because it is the actual appearance of genuine pristine awareness that is nonconceptuality acquitted of analysis. In general, the meaning of virtue is identified as bliss and its causes.
Thus, those virtuous at the beginning accomplish uncommon meditative absorption of calm abiding and higher insight. Those virtuous in the middle blend energy and mind early on, and later open the entranceways of the chakras. Those virtuous in the end achieve the unchanging pristine awareness kāya. It states in the Glorious Approach to the Absolute:[94]
The vajra rising is said to be the first.
The vital energy entering the vajra fire is the second.
The glorious bodhicitta not falling is the third.
These are the three virtues of deliberate behavior.
The branches are included in these three deliberate behaviors.[95] The first two branches are the deliberate behavior of vajra rising, because the vajra of the ten signs is stacked up firmly in the central channel. The middle two branches are the tantric behavior of vajra fire, because the inner heat of pristine awareness is accomplished. The final two branches are the deliberate behavior of bodhicitta, because unchanging melting bliss and unchanging vital essence are accomplished.

Furthermore, there are applications of the three bases of channels, energy currents, and vital energy; the three states of inferior, middling, and superior; the four vital essences of body, speech, mind, and pristine awareness; the four states of waking, dreaming, sleeping, and deep sleep; the four branches of approach and attainment; the four yogas of shape, mantra, dharma, and purity; the four unions; and the four kāyas and four vajras.
Since the last ones are well known, their meaning will be explained. Withdrawal and meditative stability are the yogic methods for accomplishing the vajra Body because a tathāgata’s Body is the nature of a form of emptiness. Vital energy control and retention are the yogic methods for accomplishing vajra Speech, because a buddha’s Speech is the indestructible vibration itself arising as all sound and speech. Recollection is the yogic method to accomplish vajra Mind, because a victor’s Mind is emptiness endowed with all aspects. Meditative absorption is the yogic method for accomplishing the pristine awareness vajra, because the pristine awareness vajra of the conquerors is the ultimate great bliss itself.
In those sequences, the object to be accomplished is the form of emptiness. The way it arises is as follows: During withdrawal it is merely an image. In meditative stability that itself is understood to be the mind free of elaboration. In vital energy control it arises as forms of emptiness. In retention it arises as the quintessence of the vital essence drop. In recollection it arises as the essence of the blazing and dripping inner heat. And in meditative absorption it arises as the unchanging vital essence drop.
The bliss is also sixfold, applied in sequence: mere mental subtle bliss, bliss of very refined joy, bliss of blending the vital energy and downward-clearing energy currents, bliss of the blazing and dripping of physical inner heat, bliss of the blazing and dripping of mahāmudrā, and unchanging bliss.
There are also six ways that dualistic appearances are abandoned. In withdrawal they are abandoned in the way of nonconceptuality. In meditative stability they are abandoned through realization of them as the essence of mind. These only happen on the basis of forms of emptiness. In vital energy control they are abandoned by means of stopping the right and left movement in the channels. In retention those two are abandoned in the manner of disappearing in their own place. Those two branches slightly suppress subject-object dualism. In recollection they are abandoned by way of sealing with bliss-emptiness. And in meditative absorption they are abandoned in the way of the transformation of all that is included in one’s mindstream. These two branches abandon by preventing the manifestation of subject-object appearances while resting in equipoise.

By practicing the Six-Branch Yoga in that way, at first one obtains a portion of the vajra pristine awareness and eventually completely obtains the blessings of the vajra descent. The visual experiences are the arising of whatever signs are appropriate, while the mind automatically rests in a nonconceptual state. The physical experiences are the jumping, shaking, and pain. The vocal experiences are various mantras and utterances occurring in the state of equipoise, while various mental experiences such as joy, regret, anger, and desire occur in post-meditation. Without regarding those experiences as problematic, the knots of the three doors will be gradually released by maintaining whatever occurs. Ultimately, the result of practice is that the three constituents of male and female seminal fluids and the energy currents will be purified and then the pristine awareness kāya of the six buddha families will be accomplished, as explained individually above.

The birth mother of all victors, the Vajra Queen, conferred the four empowerments by the progression of the four joys on Drupchen Orgyen Rinchen Pal[1] in the emanated place of Orgyen (Skt. Uḍḍiyāna), and blessed his mindstream.[2] The renowned guidance system called Approach and Attainment of the Three Vajras or Dorjé Sumgyi Nyendrup (rdo rje gsum gyi bsnyen sgrub, Skt. sevāsādhana) is the oral transmission of the exceptional, secret path that enables those of sharp faculties and diligence to progress to the level of Vajradhara in a single lifetime, as found in the Vajra Verses composed in thirty-five verses.[3] From the Guhyasamāja:[4]
Your body is like mind And mind is like body
And mind is like an utterance—imagine that.
In these special instructions, at the time of the ground, the three vajras [of Body, Speech, and Mind] are established as indivisibly connected. Then by meditating at the time of the path on the yoga of the inseparable three vajras, the principle (bdag nyid ) of the three secrets will be actualized at the time of the fruition. As it is taught in the Vajra Verses:[5]
Refining the channels purifies the body’s stains.
Refining the energy currents purifies the stains of speech. Attaining non-emission conquers the habitual patterns of mind.
The chakra knots are destroyed by the progression of the four joys.
The sleep of ignorance is clarified by reversing unconsciousness. The experience of detachment is mind relieved of aggression.
Attachment purified liberates into great bliss.

The bases of refinement are the 72,000 energy currents of the body endowed with six constituents.[6] They are purified by the branch of approach in withdrawal and meditative stability, or the approach of vajra Body. First one gathers the necessities from proper livelihood and performs the common preliminary practices. Then the upper, lower, and middle energy currents are bound according to the esoteric instructions of the three postures: the upper posture for the upper energy current, the lower posture for the lower energy current, and the middle posture for the middle energy current. By exerting effort day and night in this yoga, the ten root and branch energy currents and all discursive thought will enter the avadhūti and be halted, binding the relative and ultimate bodhicitta. This causes nonconceptual meditative absorption to arise. One sees limitless signs of forms of emptiness appearing, such as smoke and so on. The measure of attainment is the supreme gift of words: the attainment of words of truth. Then when the five branches of meditative stability,[7] such as discernment and so on, are consummated, one attains the five clairvoyances.[8]

What is to be refined are the 21,600 energy currents that are the intrinsic nature of speech. They are purified by the branch of attainment in vital energy control and retention, or the attainment of vajra Speech. When the visions of the forms of emptiness are stabilized, one does the meditation on the esoteric instructions concerning the energy currents of vital energy control above, the downward-clearing energy currents below, and the joining energy currents in between.
Also, at the outset one trains on the path by the vajra repetition that applies the arising, abiding, and concluding practices to Mind, Speech, and Body. The energy currents are made into the path by having no frame of reference, which is sought in the basic ground by applying the energy currents of the five elements. One meditates on the seat and sequential stacking of the elements by applying the lower downwardclearing energy current. The seed syllables are created by applying the upper vital energy control currents. The implements are created based on the middle energy current. Once one has attained mental control over those energies, in retention one does the yoga of raising the deity’s form by applying the joining energy current; the vajra repetition of Body, Speech, and Mind, with no bead-counting, by means of vital energy control; and the silent repetition for the peaceful and other activities by applying the four energy currents of water, [and so on].
In this, “vital energy” (srog) refers to the upward-moving energy current, and “control” (rtsol ba) is the practice of guiding it that makes energy currents into the path. So by the yoga of blocking the vital energy, when the coming and going of the sun and moon[9] have been blocked, the all-knowing pristine awareness energy current will become manifest. This is called “vital energy entering the vital essence” (srog thig ler tshud pa). Holding the energy-mind in the syllable haṃ is called “retention” (’dzin pa). This is the result of vital energy control. It enables the accomplishment of all twelve great activities[10] just by thinking of them.

The mind and the “seven-births” vital essence[11] are what is to be refined. They are purified and become immutable by recollection and meditative absorption in the branch of great attainment, or the great attainment of vajra Mind. Consuming the five-plus-five elixirs[12] outwardly, inwardly, and secretly generates the body’s strength. Applying the binding of upper, lower, and middle energy currents causes the pristine awareness fire of inner heat to blaze and burn up the seeds of the six realms that are in the six chakras of space, wind, fire, water, earth, and pristine awareness. From this, the force of the four joys in both progressive and reverse order destroys the knots of the chakras. Liberated from the obscurations of the four states,[13] the ignorance that is the root of cyclic existence is eliminated and recollection is perfected.
As enhancement of this practice, the mutual exchange in the union of method and wisdom, where spiritual partners join body and mind as method and wisdom, causes the blazing of the three fires in the heightened passion. These are the fire at the time of youth, the fire of meditative absorption, and the fire that arises from practicing union. By this means, rāhula swallows the sun and moon and all residue is transmuted into quintessence. Finally, after the energy-mind is progressively blocked starting from the secret place, the refined essence of bodhicitta and the energy currents is stabilized in the crown chakra, and one achieves unchanging great bliss, the culmination of the branch of meditative absorption.

The introduction to the view of the basic ground is this: The three kāyas abide spontaneously in the essence of mind itself since forever. How do they abide there? They abide in three ways: appearance the way it is, emptiness the way it is, and union the way it is. The last two are introduced as dharmakāya and the first is introduced as dharmatākāya.
The introduction to meditation on the path: The three kāyas are introduced as the path through the meaning of the names, the manner of experience arising, the measure of attainment, and the necessity of practice in each of the three: withdrawal and meditative stability for vajra Body, vital energy control and retention for vajra Speech, and recollection and meditative absorption for vajra Mind.
The introduction to the fruition: Practicing the approach and attainment of the three vajras results in the purification of the three-timesthree obscurations,[14] which introduces the three kāyas obtained in one body in one lifetime.
The extensive scriptural application should be learned from the Vajra Verses and the four great commentaries of verifiable texts by Dasengwa,[15] Butrawa,[16] and others.[17]

Calm abiding is engendered when an appropriate level of abiding is attained by relying on three external supports for visualization and five internal mental foci,[6] and then settling into an unfabricated state without a frame of reference. Higher insight is developed through the eight cycles of introduction, such as the introduction to the mind’s natural luminous clarity.[7] Clearing away the obstructions of drowsiness and agitation in the flow of thoughts, practice is enhanced by bliss, clarity, and nonthought.

As a preliminary, refining the path of the channels through energy currents, channels, and vital essence blesses the channels. In the main practice, one trains the energy currents through four yogas: the culmination of inhalation, filling up, holding the vase breath, and immobilizing. One trains in visualization of the fire of inner heat through concise, middling, extensive, and reverse methods. One trains in the yoga of the vital essence with the four chakras in general, and in particular the vital essence substance at the secret place, the indestructible vital essence in the heart, the vital essence of light at the tip of the nose, and by the yoga of channels, together with the branch of meditation on the inside and outside of the body. In the vajra repetition with three syllables, there are two vajra repetitions based on vital energy and on the downward-clearing energy current, and [vajra repetitions called] the four protectors, the four goddesses, and the six senses.[8] The two-syllable vajra repetition applies to inhalation and exhalation.[9]

As the preliminary, one refines the illusory body through the four methods of resting in equipoise, and the two recognitions of emptiness and illusion in the post-meditation. One should cultivate illusory waking state, illusory dream, and illusory intermediate existence along with the supplementary branch of transference of Body, Speech, Mind, and pristine awareness. The main practice is to recognize luminous clarity in light, increase, and culmination[10] based on the extensive, middling, or concise visualizations and the application of whatever vital points are appropriate in the mudras of action, awareness, or pledge. Instant and subsequent dissipation are the enhancement.

The special preliminary is the guru yoga and offering to the pure realms,[11] which cleanses the channels in the four chakras. The main practice is engaged once one has become accustomed to the four applications of energy currents.[12] The path is cultivated through the ten vital instructions, such as sublime drawing up, drawing up through the channels, drawing up through the branches, and so on. [In the main practice], the vital energy and downward-clearing energy currents are blended through gentle and forceful breathing and the mudra of vajra crown.[13] These are applications involving oneself only.[14] To clear away obstructions, first rely on the awareness mudra, in the middle on the hand mudra, and in the end on a qualified action mudra partner. The pristine awareness of the four joys will be consummated.

There are the esoteric instructions of meditation on the yidam and on the guru. There are esoteric instructions for clearing away obstacles according to the traditions of Virūpa[15] and Gorakṣa.[16] Among the instructions on five hundred mental foci, there are sixteen of the more common ones. And there are many sequences for clearing away obstructions and enhancements to increase one’s development of meditative absorption and qualities.
The term “and [more]” in the root text is a connective particle as the last word, meaning that there is more. As illustrated by the Six Guidances of Mitra,[17] and all kinds of red instructions, there are yet an enormous number of minor guidance systems of esoteric instructions that developed in the Land of Snows. It would be impossible to describe them individually, but there is nothing that could not be subsumed into the concise meaning of two stages, or into the two practices of calm abiding and higher insight, or into the two practices of emptiness and compassion.
