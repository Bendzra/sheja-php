The Higher Training in Sublime Intelligence
Whatever teachings you have heard [3.110b] concerning general objects of knowledge, and profound and extensive topics in particular, it is necessary for you to come to a complete certainty about the significance of all this through conceptualization and investigation; hence, Book 7 concerns the stages of contemplation. This book has four parts, which present: (1) a definitive treatment of the keys for evaluating the teachings; (1) a definitive treatment of pro visional and definitive meaning in the three cycles of teachings, the two levels of truth, and interdependent connection; (3) a definitive treatment of the view that is the principal factor; and (4) a definitive treatment of the four contemplations that reorient the mind.

That is to say, by using the sublime intelligence that derives from contemplation, you come to complete certainty concerning the significance of the teachings you have heard. This means that, under the circumstances, you reflect thoroughly on the conventional words used and their meanings, eliminating any superfluous indecision through a precise process of examination and investigation. For even though you might understand something in a rough way after having heard it once, this does not bring you the certainty that comes with a definitive conclusion concerning what exactly is meant. It is when you examine each and every word and its meaning, bringing numerous scriptural citations and kinds of reasoning to bear on these, that you authentically arouse in yourself an awareness that entails certainty on a very fundamental level.
As to how this process of contemplation is carried out, it involves what can be called an “internal dialogue,” involving both conceptual thinking on a more obvious level and mental investigation on a more subtle level. These are used to evaluate the topics concerning what one needs to know.

In this regard, the first stage, termed “internal dialogue as an all-absorbing state of sensation,”[26] consists of conceptual thinking that may be either an ordinary process of thinking about some topic to be understood or a function of sublime intelligence. It is a more obvious state of mind that is simply aware of things in general[27] (“this is a vase,” “this is a blanket”).[28] If we analyze it further, it may constitute either a more ordinary conceptual process (that is, a mundane process of conceptual thought that entails what is merely ordinary mind), or a transcendent thought process (which entails a sublime intelligence, that of one's reasoning mind engaging with the meaningful experience of the way in which things actually abide).[29]
The second stage, called “discerning internal dialogue,” consists of mental investigation that, again, may involve either ordinary thinking about some topic to be understood, or a function of sublime intelligence. It is a more precise state of mind that comes to a definitive conclusion by discerning the state of things more accurately (“this is a well-made vase,” “this is a badly made vase,” “the color of this blanket is a good one [or a bad one]”). If we analyze it further, the same categories apply as in the preceding case.[30]
Thus, the sublime intelligence that derives from contemplation is aroused by conceptual thinking and mental investigation being applied to the topics of the teachings you have heard.

As for the first factor, there are tools for evaluation that are ordinary and extraordinary. The ordinary tools are primarily the following: the four aspects of provisional vis-à-vis definitive meaning and direct vis-à-vis indirect intention; the four reliances; and the four logical principles.

When the things under consideration fall principally within the range of sensory appearances that are well known in one's ordinary perception (for example, one's sense of individuality; the state of ordinary beings; the mind-body aggregates, sense fields, and other components of ordinary experience; and the origin and cessation and the coming and going of these), as means to gain access to the fundamentally unconditioned nature of reality, they are evaluated in categories that can be described, imagined, and expressed, and are presented through the use of some conceptual overlay. Such presentations, along with the scriptures[31] and commentaries that discuss them, are referred to as “the relative level of provisional meaning” According to the Most Majestic State of Meditative Absorption:
Just as when emptiness was spoken of by the Sugata, so one understands the specific topics in the discourses on definitive meaning. [3.112a]
Whichever texts discuss things in terms of an ordinary being, an individual, a person—all these teachings are understood to be provisional in meaning.[32]
And the Discourse Taught by Akṣayamati:
One might ask, “Which discourses are those of definitive meaning, and which are those of provisional meaning?” Whichever discourses present discussions for the purpose of one's engaging in the spiritual path are said to be of “provisional meaning ”... Whatever discourses explain things in terms of identity, the state of an ordinary being, life force, the “surface level” of perception,[33] a person, an individual, a member of the human race,[34] a human being,[35] the agent of actions, the experiencer of feelings; or use myriad technical terms; or speak of what does not exist as some agent as constituting such an agent—these are called provisional in meaning.”[36]
And In Praise of the Inconceivable Middle Way:
Whatever discusses origination and cessation,
the state of ordinary beings, life force, and so forth,
that is provisional in meaning—that is on the relative level.[37]

The profound significance of the true nature of all phenomena, free of such elaborations as origination and cessation, can be subsumed within the framework of the three avenues to complete liberation (emptiness, the absence of subtle traits, and the absence of naive speculation)[39]; or, alternatively, four avenues (the fourth being that of the absence of any overt states of ordinary mind).[40] All such presentations, and those that discuss the significance of the fundamentally unconditioned way in which things abide (which is utterly lucid by nature, beyond all describing, imagining, or expressing), [3.112b] as well as the scriptures and commentaries that discuss these topics, are considered to be what is referred to as “the ultimate level of definitive meaning.” According to the Discourse Taught by Akṣayamati:
Whichever discourses present discussions for the purpose of one's engaging with the fruition state are termed those of “definitive meaning.”... Whichever discourses explain things in terms of emptiness, the absence of subtle traits, the absence of naive speculation, the absence of any overt states of ordinary mind, nonorigination, nonoccurrence, the absence of any substantiality in things, the lack of identity, the nonexistence of ordinary beings, the nonexistence of life force, the nonexistence of an individual, the nonexistence of any agent, up to and including the nonexistence of any avenue to complete liberation—these are called “definitive in meaning.”[41]
And In Praise of the Inconceivable Middle Way:
The emptiness of phenomena is presented as “the definitive meaning.”[42]
Some cite such passages as the following from the Highest Continuum:
Faintheartedness, belittling lesser beings,
fixating on what is inauthentic, disparaging what is authentic, and
egocentric attachment: the Buddha spoke of these five specific faults
so that those who had them could eliminate them.[43]
Such citations are indeed used to claim that the texts that are provisional in meaning are those that present a purpose for the teachings they contain.
But this is not definitive, for the fact that all teachings are entirely for the purpose of guiding those to be guided would then mean that all teachings were provisional in meaning,[44] and all those that anyone holds to be definitive in meaning were nevertheless taught for a purpose.[45]

Generally speaking, the Discourse Taught by Akṣayamati states that those discourses are definitive in meaning that speak of seven topics (engagement with the fruition state, ultimate reality, the totally pure state of total enlightenment, the exhaustion of karma and afflictive states, the nonduality of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, the direct perception of profundity that is difficult to assimilate thoroughly, and mind functioning with certainty[46]), [3.113a] and an eighth set of topics (that is, such topics as the three avenues to complete liberation, the absence of ordinary mental states, nonorigination, nonoccurrence, the absence of any substance, and the lack of identity). The sūtra speaks of discussions dealing with anything else being taken to be provisional in meaning. A parallel discussion of the foregoing eight topics is also found in the Most Majestic State of Meditative Absorption.[47]
The authentic way of distinguishing provisional from definitive meaning can also be found in the tantras. Vajrapāṇi, the Lord of Secrets, makes such statements as the following:
Provisional discussions speak of the bhaga of the karmamudrā: those that are definitive discuss the transcendent perfection of sublime intelligence—emptiness,... On the mundane relative level, there is the “bringing together of the circle of ḍākinīs”; with the definitive meaning, there is also the “bringing together of the circle of ḍākinīs.” In the latter case, however, the term “dakinls” is a reference to the thirty-seven factors that contribute to enlightenment;[48] the consolidation of these is called the “circle.” These factors are expressions of the emptiness that characterizes dharmakāya.[49]
These methods will be dealt with in the next section.[50]

There are cases in which some inference can be made that is different from a more obvious explanation—from how one understands the words and their meanings. These two aspects, the actual wording and its hidden meaning, can be revealed, through a single method of interpreting them, not to be in contradiction. Because many who are to be guided are guided by the actual wording on which they rely, a teaching is said to be “intentionally interpretable” when it meets three criteria:
1) the underlying motive involves some other meaning;[53]
2) the function is that of those to be guided being guided by such a method; [3.113b] and
3) it seems to involve scripture and reasoning incompatible with the actual wording per se, and so undermine it.
There are four cases:
1) Direct intention concerned with equalness includes such statements as, “At that point I became the tathāgata Vipaśyin,...”[54] which takes into consideration equalness with respect to dharmakāya.[55]
2) Direct intention concerned with implied issues includes such statements as, “All phenomena are such that they have no finite essence per se,” which takes into consideration the three ways in which things have no finite essence.[56] That is to say:
(a) Things that are imputed[57] have no finite essence with respect to their characteristics, because they definitely cannot be found to exist in actual fact.[58]
(b) Things that are dependent[59] have no finite essence with respect to origination,[60] because they cannot be found to originate through any of four alternative processes:[61]
► things are not produced from themselves, because there is a substantial contradiction in the product and the producer being simultaneous;
► things are not produced from other things, because nothing “other,” if examined critically, can be found to exist in and of itself;
► things cannot be found to be produced from both themselves and other things, for this also involves a substantial contradiction;[62] and
► things being produced without cause is an impossibility.[63]

However, the seeming origination and so forth of all that manifests as it does is a process of interdependent connection, simply as is an illusion or a dream, and so things are apparent yet nonexistent. The sūtra Manifest Adornment of Timeless Awareness states:
O Mañjuśri, a dream manifests without being something that exists; similarly, all phenomena manifest without being things that exist...[64]
It continues in the same vein, using the analogies of an illusion, a mirage, a fata morgana, a reflection of the moon in water, a reflection in a mirror, and a phantom.
(c) As for the absolute,[65] this has no finite essence in any ultimate sense,[66] for given that this constitutes ultimate reality, what it epitomizes has no finite essence defined by such conceptual elaborations as “pure” or “impure.” As the sūtra Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent states:
Taking into consideration that things are nonexistent in their very essence with respect to their characteristics, that things are nonexistent in their very essence with respect to origination, and that there is nothing that ultimately exists in its very essence, I have taught, “All phenomena do not exist in their very essence.”[67]
3) Direct intention concerned with eventualities [3.114a] includes such statements as, “By simply recalling the name of the tathāgata Vimalacandra-prabha, you will attain buddhahood.” While the attainment will not come from that alone, one will awaken to buddhahood at some point after pursuing spiritual development initiated by that act of recall.
4) Direct intention concerned with the attitudes of individuals includes such statements as those that disparage discipline while extolling generosity, spoken to those who are obsessed with the opinion that discipline is an absolute principle in its own right.

The words that express ideas may not be definitive but may nevertheless be used in consideration of their simply being capable of providing guidance. As a means of educating those to be guided, teachings may be spoken using words with a certain connotation. This is known as “indirect intention.” In this regard, there are four cases of such intention—that which is concerned with edification and so forth—because they are concerned, respectively, with those who belong to the śrāvaka type, with the three aspects of the very essence of things, with the overcoming of flaws, and with the profundity of what is expressed.
1) As for indirect intention concerned with edification, some who are of the śrāvaka type are daunted by emptiness and so do not follow the Mahā-yāna approach. In order for them to embark on it, the Buddha said “Forms exist”; while those listening understood by this that these can actually be proven to exist and so embarked on the approach, the intention of the one explaining this was that these “exist” in the way that dream images do.
2) As for indirect intention concerned with characteristics, in order that people come to understand the way in which things actually abide, without any finite essence per se, the Buddha said, for example, “All phenomena are such that they have no finite essence per se” For those who held that phenomena do not exist, he spoke of nonexistence in consideration of what is imputed, while for those who held that they do exist, he spoke of existence in consideration of what is absolute.
3) As an example of indirect intention concerned with remedies, in consideration of some who felt, “Śākyamuni has such a small stature and short life span that he is inferior to other teachers,” [3.114b] the Buddha said, “At that point I became the tathāgata Vairocana.” Those hearing this understood the form manifestations of these two to be equal, while the intention of the one explaining this was of three considerations—equality in the perfection of spiritual development, equality in the attainment of dharma-kāya, and equality in the ensuring of benefit for beings. As the Treasury of Abhidharma states:
All buddhas are equal in their spiritual development, in dharmakāya, and in their conduct to benefit beings, but not on account of their life spans, their family background, or their physical stature.[68]

4) Indirect intention concerning transformation refers to cases in which something very difficult to fathom was taught in order to remove the flaw of thinking, “This dharma is so easy to understand that it must be inferior to other systems.” To give an example, in Didactic Aphorisms we read the following:
Having slain the father and mother,
and vanquished the ruler and the two ritually pure ones,
as well as the kingdom and subjects,
that person who has done so becomes purity itself.[69]
In this passage, the two factors of compulsion and perpetuation[70]— because they contribute to the patterning that sustains saṃsāra—are the “father” and “mother.” The basis of all ordinary experience,[71] serving as the support or basis for myriad habitual patterns, is the “ruler” The “two ritually pure ones” are the brahmin who believes in the reality of the perishable mind-body aggregates and the spiritual practitioner who believes that personal rules of discipline and deportment are absolute principles in their own right. The eight avenues of consciousness[72]—the inner aspects of the sense fields[73] and the dualistic consciousness of subject and object they entail—are what is meant by “as well as the kingdom and subjects.”
To “vanquish” them—that is, to become purified of them—is to awaken to buddhahood.

These two—direct and indirect intention—are essentially identical, with certain differences, so that occasionally they are in accord. But if we make a distinction, we may cite from Explanatory Essays Commenting on the “Compendium of the Supreme Spiritual Approach,” which gives the following explanation:
Direct intention simply plants the idea in the mind; [3.115a] it is not asserted to depend on the other persons absorbing what has been said;[74] indirect intention depends on the other persons absorbing what has been said.[75]
In this regard, the omniscient Drimé Özer says:[76]
“Direct intention” refers to cases that depend on some circumstance or another, so that the explanations follow suit, although they do not depend on whether the other person is influenced or not. The term “intention” is used because when, for example, others ask about the issue at hand, whatever meanings are not fully understood are left within the underlying basis of that intention.
“Indirect intention” refers to cases in which, in order to benefit others, teachings take place in accord with someone’s perceptions, using a somewhat oblique approach. This is because the speaker speaks, the other persons understanding is awakened, and this message serves as a basis for understanding of other topics to be further perfected, while nevertheless falling shy of being a falsehood.[77]

The term “reliance” means that one can place one's complete trust and confidence in the object in question.[78] In this regard, we read such passages as the following from the Discourse on the Supreme Passing Beyond Sorrow:
O monks, you should focus on four things. What are these four?
To focus on the teachings and not focus on the individual; to focus on the meaning and not focus on the words; to focus on timeless awareness and not focus on ordinary consciousness; and to focus on the definitive meaning and not focus on the meaning that guides.[79] These four things are things to be realized; they are not four kinds of spiritual individuals.[80]
This theme is developed very extensively in the Discourse Taught by Akṣayamati.

The “meaning” refers in general to the presentations of factors that contribute to the transcendent state of enlightenment and more particularly to the path of the complete purity of the three focal points (and the fruition it entails) [3.115b]—in brief, the extraordinary methods that make fully evident the completely omniscient state of timeless awareness. It is on this meaning that one should rely.
Mundane terms and conventional designations, ordinary fields of knowledge, and so forth, up to and including the eighty-four thousand collections of the dharma—to follow after the mere terms and words and letters is of little consequence, and so one should not rely on these.

There are individuals who embody unmistaken view and conduct with respect to the causes and effects of the completely refined state of enlightenment and the unenlightened state of all-consuming afflictive states and who in particular have thoroughly assimilated the methods of the Middle Way, or Madhyamaka, school in the Mahāyāna approach. It is on the fact that they are not in conflict with the mainstream tradition of the Buddha-dharma that one should rely.
These individuals may be from great families of aristocracy; they may be descended from great lineages of noble ancestry; they may enjoy great fame as recognized incarnate teachers, or erudite scholars, or accomplished masters; they may be very wealthy, with retinue and students and material possessions. However, while any of these may be the case, if these individuals contradict the dharma in general in their view and conduct, or if in particular they are not in accord with the Mahāyāna tradition, one should not rely on an individuals more superficial appeal.

Timeless awareness entails (a) understanding that the way in which phenomena actually abide is, from the ultimate perspective, free of all limitations imposed by elaborations of origination, cessation, and so forth; (b) realization of the nonexistence of the two kinds of identity;[81] and (c) unerring knowledge of sugatagarbha[82] as utter lucidity, the way in which things actually abide, beyond any context of speculative value judgments.[83] It is on this awareness that one should rely.
Ordinary consciousness entails (a) belief that what one immediately perceives constitutes something truly existent; (b) conceptualization in terms of characteristics, such as the sense of personal identity and the mind-body aggregates; and (c) mental states that are conditioned, for example, [3.116a] by attitudes of naively fixating on the pleasures of the senses.

It is this meaning that one should rely on.
Those teachings that arouse a sense of disenchantment with saṃsāra; that deal with the will to be free[84] as defined in the various spiritual approaches; that present things in terms of substantial versus nominal existence, or as “mind only,” or as an empty state of nothingness—these are provisional teachings that are presented as temporary expedients, and so one should not rely on them.

The term “logical principle”[85] refers here to what is logical and valid if one examines what is commonly accepted in mundane contexts to be proven as authentic purely on the conventional level. There are four cases of such principles:
(1) The first is the establishment of things through dependent relationships. It is logical that a seedling occurs in dependence on there being a seed; it is logical that formative factors and the other links of interdependent connection occur in dependence on there being ignorance;[86] and while visual consciousness does not occur by its own nature, it is logical that it occurs in dependence on there being both the visual faculty and the forms that are the sense objects involved. Such cases are examples of “the logical principle of dependent relationships.”
(2) In the second case, the sense faculties, sense objects, avenues of consciousness, and so forth, contribute to performing the particular function of perceiving a specific kind of object and do not perform this with respect to anything else. Thus, it is logical that if visual consciousness occurs, [3.116b] it performs the function of seeing forms but is not appropriate for the hearing of sounds. In the case of the visual faculty, moreover, it is suitable to perform the function of generating visual consciousness but not suitable for generating auditory or other kinds of consciousness. It is logical for grains of barley to produce barley but not logical that they produce buckwheat or millet or some other grain. Such cases are examples of “the logical principle of the performance of functions.”

(3) The third case may involve valid cognition based on inference, such as knowing that there is a fire from the fact that there is smoke, or realizing that there is water from the presence of water fowl; valid cognition based on the direct experience of what is perceived by the six avenues of ordinary consciousness or the mind of an advanced spiritual practitioner; or valid cognition based on scriptural authority—the infallible words spoken from the mouth of a buddha. These are cases of “the logical principle of what is validly cognized,” “the logical principle of establishing what is reasonable.”
(4) As for the fourth case, it is logical for water to flow downhill (but not logical that it flow uphill), for the sun to rise in the east, for earth to be solid, for water to be wet, for fire to be hot, for wind to be motile, and so forth. The fact that phenomena are such that they have characteristics in common (including being empty and lacking any identity), as well as their individual ones, and are known to continue always to be that way by their specific natures is termed “the principle of the nature of things.”
These successive topics are known as the “four logical principles.” The foregoing discussion has been summarized on the basis of the source verses.

In this regard, as the source tantra of the Kālacakra cycle states:
The language of what is intended to be interpreted, and likewise what is not;
what is to be taken literally, and likewise what is not;
the provisional meaning and the definitive meaning:
tantras are characterized by six parameters.[88]
Which is to say, the vajra words[89] of the tantras, which plumb such profound depths, are embraced within these six parameters.
The first pair is that of provisional vis-à-vis definitive meaning. Out of consideration of the fact that some have the fortunate capacity to realize the significance of the reality of suchness itself, while others do not, a single tantra of vajra words conveys distinct meanings.
Of these, the provisional meaning is found in the methods for engaging on the inner level of spiritual practice—colored sand maṇḍalas, offerings, symbols, ritual hand gestures, fire rituals, development stage practice, practices to carry out specific activities, and so forth.
The definitive meaning lies in the presentations of the causal aspect of tantra[90] as the true way of abiding and the completion stage of practice.[91] These are found in the sources that discuss the control of subtle channels, subtle energies, and bodhicitta;[92] or the “universal ground”[93] (that is, the way in which mind truly abides, utterly lucid by nature), the buddha nature, the sublimely unchanging state of mahāmudrā.[94] To cite, for example, from the Hevajra Tantra:
Supreme and timeless awareness abides in the body.
All ordinary concepts have been truly eliminated.
This is what permeates all things.
Although it abides in the body, it is not produced by the body.[95]

(A) With respect to a single topic of development stage practice, there may be different vajra words that seem to be making contradictory statements about that topic. The meaning being expressed must be understood in relation to the underlying intent, and so this is “explanation requiring interpretation” [3.117b]
Alternatively, different intended meanings can be imbedded in a single vajra word. When this approach is adopted, there is interpretation with respect to time frame, interpretation with respect to implied meaning, and interpretation with respect to understanding.
(i) The first case is, for example, the statement
In a single instant there is perfect buddhahood.[96]
Here the intention concerns something that will occur at some future point in time.
(ii) The second case is, for example, the lines from the tantra Supreme Illusion'.
Having kidnapped her from all the buddhas,
enjoy the maiden born of the sublime deity.[97]
Here the intention is that one should constantly be experiencing emptiness endowed with the most sublime of all distinct manifestations[98]— Prajñāpāramitā, the feminine principle that embodies the transcendent perfection of sublime intelligence, the mother of all buddhas[99]—the nature of which is like that of a diviner.[100]
(iii) The third case is, for example, like the passage from the Hevajra Tan-tray which reads:
You should slay living beings...[101]
Here the intention is that one should “slay” the fixation on personal identity that is referred to here by the name of the supreme subtle energy that sustains life force.
(B) In cases in which the meaning being expressed does not depend on the underlying intent but is clearly understood simply through the direct presentation, there is “explanation that does not require interpretation.” For example, there are the statements:
You should not slay living beings.
You should not speak false words.[102]

Topics and terms that are described in language that is well known in mundane treatises and other such sources—ceremonies involving maṇḍalas, fire rituals, tormas, and so forth—are to be taken literally as stated. Those that use language not commonly found in mundane treatises—the secret language of tathāgatas—and that are bound up in symbolism are not to be taken literally; for example, when terms such as koṭākhyāḥ are used in naming the ten aspects of subtle energy, or when the tantra the Heart Essence of Secrets refers to the processes of union and release as the Sanskrit vowels and consonants, respectively.[103]
Since the foregoing principles are such that all words and meanings found in the secret approach do not fall outside them, [3.118a] they are referred to as the “six parameters.”

The shared meaning is concerned with three situations:
(i) In the first situation, any misgivings one had at following the sūtra tradition are alleviated. Suppose someone were to feel misgivings and think, “This is not good. Instead of following such a path as the inner level of the secret approach,[107] which is so straightforward and swift, I am following the sūtra tradition, or that of kriyā and carya.”[108] The “shared meaning” would then be to point out that these latter are springboards to that path and that even in the sūtras we find such passages as:
For those who are endowed with supreme skillful means,
afflictive states become the supports of enlightenment.[109]
That is to say, even the sūtra tradition and others accept that, if one is of sharp acumen and endowed with an extraordinary understanding of skillful means, that very path can be straightforward and swift, so that a single, very powerful act in one's spiritual practice can ensure the accelerated development that otherwise would have taken many eons.

(ii) In the second situation, any misgivings one felt at following the inner level of the secret approach are alleviated. Suppose someone were to feel misgivings and think, “In this inner approach, one's conduct is like that of a pig or a dog, with no concern for impurity versus cleanliness, or for such things as bathing and ritual purity. Things such as union and release are like the dogma of those with extreme views, who profess that harmful actions are somehow spiritual.” The response would then be to point out that one engages in this conduct with the thought, “This is to eliminate my fixations,” for if one has not eliminated such fixations as those with impurity versus cleanliness, one cannot realize the significance of the true nature of phenomena; this is something accepted even in the sūtra tradition. Furthermore, as in the cases of the slaying of the evil one with the spear or the enjoyment of the captains daughter,[110] due to one's having a virtuous mind, even if one engages in union and release, one will not be sullied by any flaw; rather, one's merit will be increased immeasurably. This, too, is something accepted even in the sūtra tradition. This is the “shared meaning” because these are common guidelines of training.[111] [3.118b]
(iii) In the third situation, the shared meaning for practitioners of the stage of development lies in those factors that are connected with the development stage—such as meditation on immeasurable mansions as supports and deities as what is supported within these. This is the “shared meaning” because these are guidelines of training that are common to the stages of both development and completion.[112]

Because the presentations of karmamudrā, ceremonies involving sexual union, and so forth, are unsuitable for public exposure, the teachings on desire are hidden. The process of “self-consecration”[113]—the completion stage practices involving subtle channels, subtle energies, and bindu, are cases of the hidden meaning of relative truth. Generally speaking, these teachings are “hidden” because they constitute what is comparable to the very core of something since they bring one to the central position between dualistic extremes. In this regard, the meaning of higher, middling, and lesser degrees with respect to what lies at the core is as explained previously.[114]

Serving to authenticate the foregoing is the consummation of the path of the completion stage that focuses on utter lucidity and the consummation of the fruition state (which is the realization of the primordial unity of the two levels of truth).[115]
All four of these modes need to be clearly differentiated in even a single vajra word, in accord with the levels of peoples' acumen, from greater to lesser. These are, therefore, referred to as “the four modes of explanation.”
Lacking these foregoing keynote instructions,[116] no matter how meticulous one's thinking and mental investigation, one will not be capable of developing an authentic state of sublime intelligence;[117] whereas in having access to them, if one applies them to the techniques employed in the sūtras and tantras, this will arouse in one the flawless sublime intelligence that derives from contemplation.

The principal topics that are to be evaluated with the foregoing means for evaluating the teachings constitute the treasure house of the precious dharma, what is known in the Mahāyāna tradition as the “three cycles of the Buddhas word.”
In this regard, from among the words of the Buddha, a clear classification of these three cycles is found in the sūtra Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent, which speaks of the first cycle being concerned with the Four Truths, the intermediate cycle with the absence of characteristics, and the final with a thorough and precise analysis of reality. Expansive Gem merely refers to them in passing,[118] while the sūtra the Discourse Requested by Dhāraṇīśvararāja speaks of them as the mode of the Four Truths, that of emptiness, and that of the very heart of attaining the state of suchness.[119] In the Highest Continuum, Lord Maitreya uses the terms “bringing the world to the path of peace,” “bringing complete spiritual maturity,” and “uttering prophecies.”[120]
The exalted Nāgārjuna refers to the first cycle as teaching on identity, the intermediate as teaching on the lack of identity, and the final as undermining all bases for dogmas. In commenting on the significance of such terminology, the master Āryadeva states that the first cycle undermines all that
is not conducive to spiritual merit, the intermediate cycle undermines the [false] sense of identity, and the final cycle undermines all dogmas.
As for the ways of analyzing these as provisional or definitive, let us consider the characteristics in general of provisional and definitive sūtras. As for the characteristics of a sūtra containing provisional meaning, it is a sūtra that principally teaches on the relative level of truth, which serves as a means to ensure that the path to the definitive state of excellence can arise in the experience of those who are to be guided along any of the three spiritual approaches.[121] As for the characteristics of a sūtra containing definitive meaning, it is a sūtra that principally teaches on the ultimate level of truth, so that the few to be guided who can patiently accept its profound meaning can attain nirvāṇa that is not defined by extremes,[122] by meditating on the path to definitive excellence.
The classification of these within the three cycles of teachings is twofold: (A) how this is found in the Buddhas word [3.119b] and (B) how this is found in the commentaries on his enlightened intent.[123]

(A) In the first place, according to the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent:
O transcendent and accomplished conqueror, at the deer park of Ṛṣipatana in the region of Varāṇasī, you first turned the wheel of the dharma, presenting the Four Truths of spiritually advanced beings[124] to those who had authentically embraced this spiritual approach. This cycle of teachings is amazing and marvelous, for you turned the wheel in an excellent manner and in a way that had not been done in this world previously by anyone, whether a god or a human being. Nevertheless, this wheel of dharma that you turned, O transcendent and accomplished conqueror, is still surpassable, is for the shorter term, is provisional in meaning, and is a context that is open to debate.
Then, O transcendent and accomplished conqueror, beginning with the fact that phenomena have no finite essence, beginning with the facts that they have no origination, that they have no cessation, that they are forever a state of peace, and that they are by nature nirvāṇa, you turned the wheel of dharma a second time, by way of speaking about emptiness to those who had authentically embraced the Mahāyāna approach. This cycle is yet more amazing and marvelous; nevertheless, this wheel of dharma
that you turned, O transcendent and accomplished conqueror, is still surpassable, is for the shorter term, is provisional in meaning, and is a context that is open to debate.
Then, O transcendent and accomplished conqueror, beginning with the fact that phenomena have no finite essence, beginning with the facts that they have no origination, that they have no cessation, that they are forever a state of peace, and that they are by nature nirvāṇa, you turned the wheel of dharma a third time, concerning a thorough and precise analysis of reality, to those who had authentically embraced all spiritual approaches. This cycle is exceedingly amazing and marvelous; this wheel of dharma that you turned, O transcendent and accomplished conqueror, is unsurpassable, is not for the shorter term, is definitive in meaning, and is not a context that is open to debate.[125] [3.120a]

And in the Discourse Requested by Dhāraṇīśvararāja:
O children of spiritual heritage, it is thus: Suppose, for example, that someone skilled in the knowledge of gemstones, who knows how to refine them, should take from among such precious stones one that is still totally untreated. He dips it in heavily salted water and rubs it with a piece of haircloth, and so treats it thoroughly. But he does not abandon his efforts with this alone, for following that he dips it in a strong broth of foodstuffs and rubs it with woolen cloth, and so treats it thoroughly. But he does not abandon his efforts with this alone, for following that he dips it in a powerful medicinal solution and rubs it with fine silk and so treats it thoroughly. Once it is totally treated and free of all blemishes, it can then be described as a great specimen of a gemstone.
O children of spiritual heritage, in a similar way the Tathāgata, knowing the totally impure condition of ordinary beings, uses talk of impermanence, suffering, the nonexistence of identity, and uncleanness to arouse dissatisfaction in those beings who take delight in saṃsāra and to cause them to engage in the discipline that is the dharma of spiritually advanced beings. But the Tathāgata does not abandon his efforts with this alone, for following that he uses talk of emptiness, and the nonexistence of subtle traits, and the absence of speculation[126] to cause them to realize the ways of the tathāgatas. But once more the Tathāgata does not abandon his efforts with this alone, for following that he uses talk that constitutes the cycle of nonregression[127] and talk of the complete purity of the three focal points to cause these ordinary beings, whose fundamental temperaments are so various, to engage in the scope of the tathāgatas.[128]

(B) In the second place, the foremost among those skilled at commenting on the Buddhas enlightened intent[129] is his regent Maitreya, who made the following comments on the ultimate meaning of the sūtra teachings:[130] [3.120b]
Initially the teachings are for the purpose of using discussions that are discouraging to urge those to be guided who are fascinated with saṃsāra to enter the path to peace; next, of using discussions of emptiness to completely mature them into the Mahāyāna approach; and finally, of using discussions from the cycle that ensures no regression[131] to cause them to embrace the scope of the tathāgatas and obtain the supreme prophecy.[132] In one of his synopses, the exalted Asaṅga cites from the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent to establish that the final cycle of teachings constitutes the consummate level of definitive meaning,[133] and Vasubandhu and others are in agreement with this. While Asaṅga and his brother,[134] however, do not state that the intermediate cycle of teachings is provisional in meaning, in the source Reasoning for a Detailed Explanation and its commentary, it is explicitly stated to be definitive in meaning.[135] The great spiritual guide Dharmapāla, in his Decision concerning Conscious Awareness,[136] explains that both of these cycles concern the definitive meaning of the teachings.
The exalted Nāgārjuna considers the three stages of refinement referred to in the Discourse Requested by Dhāraṇīśvararāja to be from the point of view of definitive meaning, and Āryadeva concurs with this. Among Tibetan teachers, there should be no one who does not agree that this treatment is in accord with the three stages of beginning, middle, and end found in the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent, for in fact such is actually the case.[137] Those who upheld the genuine lineage of Maitreya and composed commentaries on these teachings[138] in later times did not contravene this tradition, while Candra,[139] in commenting on Nāgārjuna's treatise, did not employ the model of three cycles—initial, intermediate, and final—but simply used the analysis on the basis of provisional vis-àvis definitive meaning as found in the Discourse Taught by Akṣayamati.[140]

It would seem that—due to a failure to examine accurately the meaning of the underlying intent of this source—there have occurred cases of Tibetan teachers indulging in a lot of nonsense concerning two cycles (that is, the intermediate and the final), as to which is provisional and which definitive, and which is “higher” or “lower” than the other. In this regard, as was mentioned earlier,[141] this sūtra speaks of eight topics that distinguish provisional from definitive meaning. The others[142] apply equally to both the intermediate and final cycles of teachings as topics of definitive meaning; [3.121a] as for the eighth topic, however—that of the lack of identity—Candrakīrti assigns as the definitive meaning the mere fact that things are empty of both kinds of identity,[143] while Asaṅga, his brother, and their followers analyze this point more precisely and thoroughly, for the point here is that of the lack of any such identity as is construed by spiritually immature people. As the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent states:
It would be inappropriate to conceive of things in terms of identity;
I have not taught this to spiritually immature people.[144]
And in Aṅgulimālā we read such passages as the following:
Even though the transcendent and accomplished conquerors investigate all phenomena assiduously, a self in the mundane sense, neither something about the size of one's thumb, [145]... nor anything that can be described as “it is like this” is found by any of all the buddhas, or by any of all the śrāvakas, and once they have awakened to manifest buddhahood, they explain this fact to living beings.[146]
And in the Journey to Śrī Laṅka:
Teaching concerning the buddha nature [tathāgatagarbha] is not equivalent to theories that those who hold extreme views entertain concerning self-identity[147]... [bodhisattvas] are not obsessed with self-identity.[148]
With a definitive conclusion having been reached concerning the significance of the foregoing citations, it is shown that the intermediate and final cycles of teaching are equally definitive in meaning, with the distinction that the former concerns the definitive meaning that puts an end to conceptual elaborations in the shorter term, while the latter concerns that which reveals the true way of abiding in the far-reaching sense.

“The intermediate cycle, putting an end to elaborations, is definitively meaningful in the shorter term; the final cycle, bringing a definitive conclusion concerning what is ultimate, is definitively meaningful in the far-reaching sense.” So says the tradition of Yogic Practitioners.
Their scriptural authority is found in the distinctions made by the Victorious One himself,
and the further distinctions made by the tradition of the prophesied exalted one, who attained the third level of realization.

The intermediate cycle of teachings—because it puts an end to the conceptual elaborations of thinking of the view in terms of absolute principles—is concerned with definitive meaning in the shorter term; while the final cycle—because it clearly brings a definitive conclusion that the true way in which things abide is that of individual self-knowing timeless awareness—is concerned with definitive meaning in the far-reaching sense. Such statements are found in the mainstream tradition of Yogic Practitioners, or Yogācāra.
Their scriptural authorities, as cited previously, are those conferred by the Victorious One himself,[151] making such distinctions in his discourses. In addition, in the Discourse of the Great Drum we read the following:
Any and all those discourses that teach on emptiness should be understood to be intentionally interpretable, while such unsurpassable discourses as this one should be understood to be explanations that do not require interpretation.[152]
As this passage illustrates, the modes of provisional and definitive meaning are analyzed very clearly, over and over again, in the sūtras that teach on the buddha nature.
In addition, the foregoing is the tradition of one who codified the distinction between provisional and definitive meaning—the exalted Asaṅga, whose coming was prophesied and who had attained the third level of realization—and his brother.[153] [3.122a] Their reasoning[154] would appear to be that of applying such models of metaphors and their underlying meaning as the threefold refinement of a gem spoken of in the Discourse Requested by Dhāraṇīśvararāja,[155]
From among the masters of the Tibetan tradition, the all-knowing Rangjung Gyalwa, the omniscient Dolpopa, the omniscient Drimé Özer,[156] and others, together with their followers, would seem to have professed this latter interpretation.[157] The majority of renowned teachers in Tibet were proponents of the former interpretation.[158]

In particular, the exalted Nāgārjuna and his spiritual heirs[160] state:
What is nonvirtuous is undermined initially; intermediately, any sense of identity is undermined; and finally, all bases for dogmatic opinions[161] are undermined: Whoever understands this is wise.[162]
Thus, they say that what is nonvirtuous, the belief in identity, and all bases for dogmatic opinions are what are undermined respectively in the initial, intermediate, and final cycles of teachings; and teachers of the Tibetan tradition have also adopted this progressive model of the three turnings of the wheel of the Buddhadharma.
In this regard, the first cycle ensures that, by becoming unerringly involved with moral choices of acceptance and rejection on the level of what is relatively true, one is more capable of perceiving what is ultimately true. For the purpose of undermining perception based on a sense of identity, the second cycle presents ultimate truth in a quantifiable way, negating one extreme of conceptual elaboration.[163] And in order to undermine all bases for dogmatic opinions about existence, nonexistence, and so forth, the third cycle presents ultimate truth in actuality, in the sense that transcends all elaboration.
According to this model, then, the intermediate cycle previously discussed is considered by those who profess unqualified emptiness to be the final word;[164] this is even accepted by certain of those who profess qualified emptiness. As for the vast majority of those who profess qualified emptiness, they interpret the undermining of identity in the sense of proving the absence of identity (that is, an absence that is a freedom from conceptual elaboration), and the undermining of all bases of dogmatic opinions in the sense of transcending some emptiness that could be investigated intellectually.[165] [3.122b] They explain the underlying intent of these cycles[166] to be in accord, in keeping with the progression found in the previous two citations from the sūtras.[167]

Furthermore, the omniscient Rangjung[168] gives the following explanation:
The cycle of the Exalted One[169] (which undermines all dogmas) and the cycle of the venerable Maitreya (who was prophesied by the Buddha), generally speaking, both come down to the same crucial point; for this key point is the fact that if something constitutes the final cycle of teachings, of necessity it is a cycle that demonstrates a freedom from conceptual elaboration.
In certain particulars, however, these are not identical, for the former does not speak of anything but that freedom from elaboration, while the latter explains that timeless awareness, which is free from elaboration, is a particular way in which one’s own individual self-knowing timeless awareness can be experienced.
But if one were to wonder, “Does that mean that Nāgārjuna and his heirs did not accept timeless awareness free of elaboration?” such is not the case because they actually demonstrate this acceptance in such works as the “Collection of Praises” and the Four Hundred Verses for Engaging in a Bodhisattva's Conduct.[170]

Some, who lack the immaculate vision of sublime intelligence, think that everything spoken by the Buddha as provisionally meaningful is false in being unreliable because it is not true from the ultimate perspective. But this is an incorrect opinion due to their own ordinary minds’ being ensnared by myriad layers of delusion. The words of the Buddha never entail any falsehood or deceptiveness because the provisional meaning itself is true, albeit as what is provisionally meaningful, and so leads one in an authentic manner toward the profound way in which things actually abide.
This being the case, to boast, “I am a follower of the Middle Way!” could be a case of one’s implicitly denigrating other aspects of the Buddha’s sublime words; and to claim, “I am a tantric practitioner!” could be a case of one’s dismissing the repositories of teachings in the śrāvaka approach and so forth as though these were useless straw. In particular, the lord Mikyö Dorjé[171] said:
Those who claim nowadays to be Nyingmapas, but who do not regard the Buddha Śākyamuni to be their teacher and have never heard of the thirty-seven factors conducive to enlightenment [3.123a] are not worthy of inclusion among the ranks of Buddhists![172]
Therefore, one should examine and investigate the possibility of one’s rejecting the Buddhadharma and exercise caution!

The ways in which conceptual elaborations on the relative level (the manner in which things appear) are eliminated and the ultimate perspective (the way in which things actually abide) is actually demonstrated can be more obvious or more subtle, depending on the audience's specific level of acumen.[173] It is for this reason that the great spiritual guide Nāgārjuna and others accept that all avenues of teaching taught by the Victorious One have a single underlying intent. As we read in the Source Verses on Sublime Intelligence:
The transcendent and accomplished conqueror, understanding what is real and what is not, refuted both existence and nonexistence in his advice to Kātyāyana.[174]
That is to say, since there is advice concerning freedom from the extremes of existence and nonexistence even in the initial cycle of teachings, all the Buddhas statements concerning the “existence” of things within the range of one's ordinary experience are intended to refer to what merely manifests.[175]
Furthermore:
“Nirvāṇa, the transcendence of sorrow, alone is true” is what victorious ones say.
At that point, would anyone who is wise not think that everything else is false?[176]
That is to say, in the intermediate cycle, everything else—from forms up to and including the state of omniscience[177]—is false due to being relative and conditioned.[178] That these are, in essence, empty of any elaborations is nirvāṇa, which is unconditioned and is taught to be solely what is true.

And from Stages of Meditation in the Middle Way tradition:
Therefore, through pure sublime intelligence this ultimate essence in and of itself is thoroughly ensured as being the case,
and so anything else, being imputed, does not have any reality.[179]
Thus, all of Nāgārjuna's statements on the topic of meditation are in accord with the final cycle of teachings. In particular, he emphasizes the meaning found in that final cycle in his “Collection of Praises,” and in his Commentary on Bodhicitta he discusses the connection between that cycle and the profound meaning of the mantra approach, without these mutually excluding one other.[180] [3.123b]
This is also illustrated by the fact that the exalted and venerable Asaṅga also states quite clearly:
To claim that there is a contradiction between one sūtra and another sūtra is to reject the sacred Buddhadharma.[181]
It is for this reason that the venerable Maitreya emphatically advises one not to misinterpret the tradition of the Sage,[182] which was established by the Buddha himself.[183] With folded hands, I beseech all to respect this.

However many avenues of the sacred dharma were presented by the Tathāgata, these were all spoken on the authentic basis of there being two levels of truth. According to the Reunion of Father and Son:
O Knower of the World,[184] without having of them from others you yourself taught these two levels of truth.
What are they? The relative and likewise the ultimate; there is not in any sense a third level of truth.[185]
And as the venerable Nāgārjuna states in following this citation:
The dharma taught by buddhas is authentically based on two levels of truth— the mundane level of relative truth and the level of ultimate truth.[186]

Concerning these levels of truth, there are numerous ways in which the individual philosophical systems posit them and identify what they are in essence. But generally speaking, the interpretation of those who follow the Mahāyāna approach is that relative truth constitutes what is contrived and conceptually imputed, while ultimate truth constitutes what is uncontrived and not imputed. In particular, the Entrance to the Middle Way states (according to the Consequentialist system, the pinnacle for those who profess Buddhist philosophical systems):
Due to all things being perceived either authentically or erroneously, [3.124a]
any and all things can be taken two ways in essence.
Whatever is the object of authentic perception is ultimate;[187] erroneous perception is said to be relative truth.[188]
That is to say, all phenomena—from forms up to and including the state of omniscience—can be thought of in terms of being perceivable in two ways in their nature or essence. Thus, there is the individual makeup[189] of things that is detected by the ordinary mind of spiritually immature beings, which engages by taking things at face value, without examining or investigating them further; and there is the essence that is discovered by spiritually advanced beings in formal meditative equipoise through nonconceptual timeless awareness.

Of these two cases, the former is termed “relative truth” Due to a lack of recognition—that is, the obscuring of the perception of suchness itself—it is termed “completely overlaid.”[190] This level is taken to be true, and as long as one has not realized the significance of suchness itself, this level continues to perform a function that accords with one's misconstruing of it; because it is thus infallible for spiritually immature beings, it can be termed “truth.” For as the same source states:
Because ignorance[191] obscures the true nature, everything is completely overlaid.
Whatever this contrives nevertheless appears to be true, which the Sage said to be “relative truth.”
Things that are contrived are on the relative level.[192]
The latter case is termed “ultimate truth.” This is because the state of formal meditative equipoise for spiritually advanced beings—that is, nonconceptual timeless awareness—can be referred to as “sublime,”[193] for it engages with the actual way in which things abide, just as they are, and because that is its domain, and so it is infallible in all ways and in all that is truly meaningful, being “truth.”

As for the derivation and meaning of the terms for the two levels of truth, due to the rules governing the formation of words in the Sanskrit language, the term “relative” can be explained to be interpreted to mean (1) “obscuring what is authentic”; (2) “gathered together,” or “composite”; (3) “symbolic,” or “conventionally designated”; (4) “all-differentiating”; and (3) “deceptively masking.” [3.124b]
(1) The term “relative” refers to a lack of recognition that entails afflictive mental states and that obscures what is ultimately true—the authentic nature of things. This exerts an influence over the ongoing experience of an individual, such that the conditioned phenomena that manifest in the valid experience of one who is under that influence are “true” in a relative sense, which is why the term applies. The Entrance to the Middle Way gives explanations such as the following:
Because a lack of recognition[194] obscures the true nature, everything is completely overlaid.[195]
(2) The term “relative” means that things that are gathered together[196] are ensured only due to their dependent relationships with one another, like a stack of poles leaning against one another, and not due to their very essence.
(3) According to Clear Words:
Alternatively, “relative” means “symbolic”; it is an equivalent term for “conventional designation” in the mundane context. It is characterized by such factors as verbal descriptions and what is being described, or consciousness and what is known.[197]
(4) In Blazing Logic we read the following:
Due to its function of thoroughly differentiating all things— forms and so forth—it is relative.[198]
(5) It is relative due to the fact that it cannot stand up under mental investigation, as the master Haribhadra states:
Since it cannot withstand the force of thorough mental investigation, it is relative.[199]

In the case of the one level known as ultimate truth—the “truth of the sacred meaning”—what is actually sacred is the timeless awareness in the ongoing experience of spiritually advanced beings in formal meditative equipoise; what is meaningful is the emptiness that serves as that awareness domain; and truth lies in the fact that this is infallible under any and all circumstances. That is why such terminology is used.
A parallel to what is sacred is inferential knowledge based on reasoning; to what is meaningful, the emptiness that is characterized as an unqualified negation, which serves as the domain of that knowledge; to what is truth, the fact that this is infallible in light of the reasoning that involves mental examination and investigation. Again, that is why such terminology is used. This latter aspect is termed the “approximation”[200] or “quantifiable aspect of ultimate truth.”[201] In treatises of the Middle Way school, all the debate concerning the process of investigating the two levels of truth has taken place on solely the basis of this aspect, for ultimate truth in actuality[202] is not something to be investigated with the conceptual thought process.[203] [3.125a] Blazing Logic discusses clearly there being, from a conventional perspective, two aspects of the ultimate and their characteristics.

As for the respective characteristics of these levels, what characterizes relative truth is that it is, in essence, imputed or contrived—a false state of perception, in which the meaningful objects that are discovered are discovered in light of a consciousness that is spiritually immature and does not investigate them. What characterizes ultimate truth is that it is, in essence, not imputed or contrived—an authentic state of perception, in which the
meaningful objects that are discovered are discovered in light of the awareness of spiritually advanced beings.[204] As Mabja Jangchub Tsöndrü, the foremost among the spiritual descendants of Patsap,[205] explains:
The relative level is the scope of consciousness that is confused and does not investigate things;
the ultimate level is the scope of a spiritually advanced being's awareness that is unconfused.[206]
There are many who consider that the mere fact that confusion is involved in one's individual perception of sensory appearances qualifies this as consciousness based on confusion. That would mean that inferential knowledge based on reasoning definitely was also, but because this is knowledge that involves investigation, the qualifier “does not investigate things” is used to exclude it.[207]
In this present context, however, the criterion for whether an object is true or false lies in its being nondeceptive or deceptive, while the criterion for whether the subjective perceiver is true or false lies in the way it apprehends, being one of a lack of confusion or one of confusion.
As for the synonyms for these levels, due to the styles of individual philosophical schools, these are very numerous. According to the Middle Way tradition, to cite from Distinguishing Center and Limit'.
As for emptiness, in brief
suchness, the final authentic state,
the absence of subtle traits, the ultimate,
and the basic space of phenomena are its synonyms.
Because it is nothing other,[208] is unerring,...[209]
The venerable Vimuktisena, following the sūtras, explains that there are eleven synonyms,[210] [3.125b] while the master Candrakīrti explains that there are many synonyms.[211]
The opposites of the foregoing terms would serve as synonyms for relative truth; in addition, such terms as “merely symbolic level” “mere labeling,” “merely imputed level,” “mere conventional designation,” and so forth are used.

Generally speaking, the relative is not something that can be known in light of pure awareness, while the ultimate is not something that can be known in light of confusion. However, in the context of things being taken at face value without being examined or investigated further, the sūtras speak of what simply can be known as the foundation for an analysis of relative vis-à-vis ultimate. As is said:
Concerning what can be known, this amounts quite simply to the two levels of truth.[212]
On this note, as is said in the Source Verses on Sublime Intelligence'.
the mundane level of relative truth and the level of ultimate truth.[213]
This means that there are two levels, that of deceptive phenomena, constituting relative truth, and that of what is undeceptive, constituting ultimate truth; alternatively, the analysis can be into the two levels of relative and ultimate truth on the basis of the way in which things appear and the way in which they abide, respectively.

As for the way in which things appear, there are actually two ways, a confused one and an unconfused one. In the first place, that of the confused way in which things appear, this consists of any and all ways in which what is based on confusion—sensory appearances, fixated perceptions, and consciousness—occurs in the mind of ordinary beings. Since these are deceptive and untrue, all that manifests such that it can be thought of or described, from hell realms up to buddhahood, [3.126a] is imputed by the designs of the ordinary mind and is not something one can be aware of in any actual sense,[214] and for this reason it is explained as being a state of confusion. Furthermore, things such as the four elements[215] that manifest and are capable of performing a function are considered to be what is relative in an authentic sense, while things such as a hallucination of two moons that manifest but are incapable of performing a function are considered to be what is relative in an erroneous sense.
The unconfused way in which things appear is also twofold. The timeless awareness together with its attendant qualities that is experienced on the spiritual path and is not confused with regard to the fruition state is impermanent due to the fact that it evolves; nevertheless, it is unconfused from the point of view that it leads to the fundamentally unconditioned level of being.[216] The unconfused way—due to the fruitions having been attained— consists of the timeless awareness of buddhahood together with the manifest expressions of enlightenment[217] that abide in the pinnacle pure realm.

The foregoing points are by and large posited by the Autonomist school. In this regard, what this school considers to be relative in an authentic sense is posited on the basis of the fact that they hold that one is unconfused about one's own individual perception of sense objects—that is, the direct experience of one's sense faculties in apprehending the forms, sounds, and so forth, that one perceives in one's immediate situation. But those who follow the Consequentialist school hold that these cognitive states are confused with respect to one's own individual perception of sense objects, and therefore they do not accept that there is anything relative in any authentic sense—for them, rather, if something is relative, it is erroneous. More recent generations of dialecticians have said that this is a subtle point, for the issue hinges on whether or not to hold that things are established due to their specific characteristics.[218]
Alternatively, one can discuss the two aspects of the relative as that of ordinary mortal beings and that of spiritually advanced beings. The first aspect consists of such things as the reflection of the moon in water or an echo because even spiritually immature people can determine these accurately as having the qualities of being false and deceptive. The second aspect consists of such things as forms, sounds, and so forth, on which spiritually immature people are completely fixated, because those who perceive what is true for spiritually advanced beings can thoroughly appreciate that these are fallacious, hollow, and lacking in any real substance.

As yet another alternative, the teachings speak of an analysis into the relative level for mundane people and the relative level for advanced spiritual practitioners. Śāntideva says:
[3.126b] What is relative for advanced spiritual practitioners is without flaw,...[219]
And Candrakīrti states:
“Being nonexistent due to this seven-step analysis, how could it exist in any way? ”
Thus, advanced spiritual practitioners do not find it to exist.[220]
As for the basis of what is being defined, the relative level for mundane people constitutes the more obvious things in the phenomenal world, perceived in light of confusion, in which things are taken at face value without being examined or investigated further. The relative level for advanced spiritual practitioners constitutes both the appreciation of impermanence on a more subtle level (the meaningful experience discovered by an ordinary mind of conventional values in light of some small degree of examination) and the perceptions experienced in postmeditative awareness by spiritually advanced beings (from those on the path of no more training in the śrāvaka approach to those on the spiritually advanced levels of the bodhisattva approach).[221]
As for synonyms, the former aspect is also referred to as the relative “of what is not examined,” or “of spiritually immature people,” or “unconnected with knowledge based on reasoning.” The latter aspect is referred to as the relative level “of what is investigated,” or “that entails knowledge based on reasoning for spiritually advanced beings,”[222] or “of the follower of the Middle Way.”

With respect to what is ultimately true, from the point of view of its essence, this cannot be subjected to any analysis because it is in all ways of “one taste,” like space, and because it transcends the purview of conventional designations. In the Amassing of the Rare and Sublime we read:
O monks, this ultimate truth is unique. It is thus: it constitutes nirvāṇa, the transcendence of sorrow, which has the quality of being infallible.[223]
If one analyzes this level in a purely semantic way, a brief treatise on the levels of truth speaks of two aspects of ultimate truth, a quantifiable one and an unquantifiable one.[224] The former aspect is free to a certain extent of conceptual elaborations, as in the case of its being “unborn,” which negates its having origination; the latter aspect is free of absolutely all conceptual elaborations.[225]
As for the quantifiable aspect of ultimate truth, if one analyzes it from the perspective of what is being negated, there are two aspects to the lack of identity—in the individual and in phenomena. If one analyzes it from the perspective of characteristics, there are the three avenues to complete liberation—emptiness, the absence of subtle traits, and the absence of naive speculation—or the four avenues (the fourth, its being completely unconditioned). If one analyzes it from the perspective of the topics under discus-
sion, there are sixteen aspects of emptiness; the phrase “and so forth” in the source verse refers to analyses into eighteen or twenty aspects. [3.127a]

Thus, the reasons underlying this analysis into two levels of truth derive from the differing ways in which the minds of two kinds of individuals—the spiritually advanced and the spiritually immature—perceive. Therefore, it is from the point of view of the subjective perceiver that truth can be analyzed into two levels not because these abide in any actual sense. For if the relative level abided in any true sense, it would not, in fact, be the relative level; and besides, this would mean that there would be two ultimate truths! For this reason, other than the fact that what is relative does not abide in any ultimate sense, there does not exist whatsoever anything “ultimate”[226] because the classification that assigns two levels of truth[227] is established on the basis of their mutual dependence.
Therefore, the statement that “ultimate truth is reality free of limitations, while everything else is relative truth” applies in the representational language used by those with such fixations; but in the tradition of the Middle Way itself,[228] there is nothing whatsoever to be classified on either side, relative or ultimate. For as long as one has not realized the significance of what is ineffable, for that long one is not even a follower of the Middle Way because one has not realized the meaning of the middle way.

What is true is certainly to be enumerated as twofold—what is relatively true and what is ultimately true, as we read in the Journey to Śrī Laṅka:
There is the relative and the ultimate;
there is no third alternative bom of some cause.
The relative is imputed by concepts;
the exhaustion of that is the domain of the spiritually advanced.[229]
And according to the Reunion of Father and Son:
Thus, the Tathāgata has thoroughly mastered the relative and the ultimate. The knowable amounts to this as well—relative and ultimate truth.[230]
The logic behind this, moreover, is as follows: The relative level, which emphasizes the principle of skillful method, is indispensable for making moral choices of what to undertake or avoid; whereas the ultimate level is indispensable for the nonreferential state of complete purity, [3.127b] which is foremost among all that is to be undertaken. This being the case, allowing for any fewer levels of truth would not take account of the situation, while these alone ensure the welfare of a given spiritual practitioner in its entirety because any more levels are unnecessary. Alternatively, it is certain that the minds that are the subjective perceivers of things are of two kinds, confused and unconfused. The relative level is assigned with respect to the former case, while the ultimate level is assigned with respect to the latter case. This classification is indispensable, and so it is certain that there are two levels of truth.

Regarding the way in which these levels of truth are identical or separate, the philosophical schools hold their individual and disparate positions. However, according to the glorious Rangjung:
Concerning the two levels of truth explained thus, this itself is simply the way things are—phenomena and the true nature of those phenomena—and so completely free of any other consid-
eration, so there is nothing whatsoever to be discussed concerning these being identical or separate.[231]
This means that it can be accepted that, in light of one's not having investigated the issue, on a purely conventional level, the two levels of truth constitute a single nature with separate facets, while from the ultimate perspective, there can be no discussion whatsoever of their being identical or separate in essence.
That is to say, if they were identical, this would entail many problems. Spiritually immature people would realize ultimate truth just as they do relative truth, because the situation would require that they gain freedom without any effort. As well, if the relative were, like the ultimate, not subject to any division, this would require that it be the cause of the state of complete purity; or if the ultimate were like the relative, this would require that it be subject to myriad divisions and be a framework for the increase of deeply ingrained afflictive states.
If they were separate, this situation would require that even though advanced spiritual practitioners had realized the ultimate they would nevertheless be incapable of eliminating their overt fixations on the relative level and that this ultimate level could not be the true nature of the relative. This would entail many such issues that make the possibility invalid.
It is for the foregoing reasons that the Definitive Commentary on Enlightened Intent states:
The characteristics of the realm of ordinary mental states[232] and the ultimate are the characteristics of being free of being identical or separate. [3.118a] Those who conceive of them as either identical or separate have fallen into fallacious ways of thinking.[233]

Generally speaking, the classification of two levels of truth is something that is accepted by all Buddhist philosophical schools. Of these, followers of the śrāvaka approach[234] say:
Whatever can be dismantled or mentally dissected such that the mind no longer entertains a concept— such as a vase or water—exists on the relative level;
Anything else exists on the ultimate level.[235]
This means that if something is dismantled by an instrument of destruction such as a hammer or if it is mentally dissected to eliminate individually all extraneous material factors, such that the mind no longer entertains the concept of that thing that is capable of being done away with, then that thing—such as a vase, or the water it contains—is relative. When the mind still entertains something after attempts to dismantle or mentally dissect it, and it still presents itself to one's consciousness as something autonomous—as with such things as perceived forms, sounds, and so forth—this is ultimate. Both cases, however, are considered “truth,” given that the things concerned exist with their respective essential qualities.
To summarize, the followers of the Particularist school hold that substantial things of the more obvious kind and ongoing streams of consciousness are relative, while indivisible moments of consciousness and indivisible particles of matter are ultimately true.[236]

According to the Detailed Commentary:
Whatever is ultimately capable of performing a function, that exists ultimately in this context.
Anything else exists relatively.
These are held to be specifically or generally characterized, respectively.[237]
Things that are capable of performing functions in an ultimate sense (such as a vase or a pillar) constitute ultimate truth, while things that are
ultimately incapable of performing a function (such as space, or the generic idea of “vase,” or the generic idea of “pillar”) constitute relative truth. To put it concisely, these categories are held to correspond to those of things existing with specific characteristics versus those existing only with general characteristics; [3.128b] and “to exist” is held to mean “to be true.” This is the tradition of the Followers of the Sūtras, or Sautrāntikas.[238]
Some more recent scholars explain that in this tradition the terms “ultimately true,” “impermanent,” “substantial thing,” “conditioned thing,” and “specifically characterized thing” are synonymous, while “relatively true,” “permanent,” “nonsubstantial phenomenon,” “unconditioned thing,” and “generally characterized thing” are synonymous.[239]

The perceived objects and perceiving subjects experienced by dualistic consciousness constitute relative truth, while nondualistic consciousness only is considered to constitute ultimate truth: such is the tradition of the Mind Only, or Cittamātra, school. The Anthology on the Heart Essence of Timeless Awareness states:
“Nothing with facets exists;[240]
even minute material particles are not existent.[241]
Perceptions of individual things, moreover, are like dream images,
experienced[242] in a state without any fixed point of reference.
Consciousness free of object-subject dualism
is held to be what has ultimate meaning.”
In the vast range of sources for Yogic Practitioners, those who follow the approach of the transcendent perfections expound in such language.[243]
If we tie this in with the three principles, things that are imputed are relative in the true sense of the term because they are nonexistent as anything substantial and are determined to be merely conventional designations.[244] Things that are dependent constitute the quantifiable aspect of what is ultimate in the true sense of the term, and the quantifiable aspect of the relative
because (respectively) they can be determined to have true existence if they are examined in the light of reason and because they obscure one's perception of suchness itself.[245] What is absolute constitutes the ultimate in the true sense of the term because it is the domain for the timeless awareness of spiritually advanced beings.[246]

All that appears as it does, which is proven to be relative, constitutes relative truth, like horses and elephants in an illusionists trick.

[3.129a] In Overcoming Confusion, we read the following:
What involves a frame of reference is relative; in the ultimate, there is freedom from anything to focus on and any attempt to focus.[247]
The analysis of the relative level according to this system is as discussed earlier.[248]

Things that are imputed by ordinary consciousness as describable, imaginable, and expressible constitute relative truth; these are accepted in accord with whatever is known through being commonly accepted in the world.[249] The fundamentally unconditioned nature that is free of all such description, imagination, and expression constitutes ultimate truth. This is the tradition
of the Prāsaṅgika, or Consequentialist school; as Candrakīrti states:
With respect to the arousal of a frame of mind that is in accord with emptiness, this can be referred to as “realizing emptiness,” but it does not constitute the realization of emptiness.[250]
Otherwise, this would be similar to one's realization that the nature of space is one of providing a dimension of openness meaning that space itself and one's ordinary mind had become inseparable. In this context, the omniscient Drimé Özer remarks in his commentary to his own Finding Ease in the Nature of Mind Itself:
In this context, let us analyze this clearly and in accordance with the pith instructions: Within the unique scope of the basic space of phenomena as the basis for this analysis, the manifest aspect of sensory appearances is similar to an illusion, or a mirage, or the reflection of the moon in water. That is, the nature of these appearances is that of being apparent yet nonexistent per se, and so we call this “relative truth.”

As is stated in the sūtra the Discourse Requested by Druma:
Just as the clear image of one's face appears in the flawless surface of a mirror, so too,
O Druma, know that phenomena cannot be found to have any independent nature.[251]
According to what such sources say, even though an ordinary being perceives sensory appearances as though they were so very true, an advanced spiritual practitioner sees them with no such conviction, but merely as dream images. [3.129b] Being merely indeterminate yet vividly apparent, if these are not investigated, they manifest, but if investigated are known to be wholly nonexistent; this is termed “realization of relative truth,” which is not undermined by the influence of those sensory appearances.
If this realization becomes further refined, this ensures such miraculous powers as one's being able to pass without impediment through these appearances[252] and so forth. Without one's committing oneself to any opinion about these whatsoever,[253] these very appearances have no independent nature, and so one's mind becomes trained in the fact that they have no separate status as “true.”

Once one has gained the timeless awareness of a spiritually advanced being, even though pure realms of experience[254] and so forth manifest, one has no fixation on these as being truly existent, and so they constitute what is called “valid on the relative level.” All concepts and perceptions that involve attitudes of fixating on things as truly existent constitute what is erroneous on the relative level. I hold that what is valid on the relative level is all avenues for the arising of awareness and all perceptions where these do not involve fixation on the seemingly true existence of things.
As for what is ultimate, this constitutes the way in which mind itself truly abides, without any independent nature, and inner mastery of the experience of all phenomena without any fixation on their seemingly true existence—their nature rather being like that of the reflection of the moon in water—so that one understands them in essence as having no independent nature, merely manifesting without there being any fixed basis to support perception based on confusion. Once such concepts as “exists” and “does not exist” have vanished in basic space, it is said that one has “realized the ultimate way in which things truly abide.”

As is said in In Praise of the Mother by Rāhula:
Indescribable, inconceivable, and inexpressible,
the transcendent perfection of sublime intelligence is unborn, unceasing, the very essence of space,
yet experienced as the domain of one's individual selfknowing timeless awareness—
I pay homage to the mother of victorious ones of the three times.[255]
Thus, it is accepted that one's individual self-knowing timeless awareness is what is ultimate and that to realize this constitutes the realization of ultimate truth.
In this regard, the two levels of truth are not separate from one another, like an animal’s horns, even as the way in which what is relative truly abides is perceived to be comparable to the reflection of the moon in water: from the point of view of the mani-
festation of the moons image, there is the relative, while from the point of view of the moon's having no true existence,[256] there is the ultimate. [3.130a] Just as these two aspects are in essence identical, even as what does not exist nevertheless manifests in the water of a pond, these levels of truth are inseparable, or a primordial unity. A mind that has realized this[257] to be the case is said to have “realization of the two levels of truth.”[258]

What is imputed and what is dependent constitute relative truth, while the ultimate is considered to be what is absolute—self-knowing timeless awareness: this is the tradition of those who profess the Middle Way interpretation of zhentong, or qualified emptiness.
In this regard, the omniscient Dolpopa[259] maintained that what is imputed has no true existence even on the relative level (being comparable to dream images) and what is dependent has true existence in a merely conventional sense, while the absolute is constant, stable, and truly existent. The interpretation of Serdok Paṇchen[260] accords with the position of the Mind Only school in the two former cases[261] and that of Dolpopa in the latter case. I will discuss the interpretation of the venerable Rangjung, Lord of Victorious Ones,[262] later.
As for that of the great and venerable one of Jonang,[263] all phenomena subsumed within the perceptions of dualistic consciousness—substantial and nonsubstantial things, perceived objects and perceiving subject, and so forth—are relative, while he considers self-knowing awareness (that is, the basic space of ultimate reality, timeless awareness empty of such dualism) to be what is ultimate. Thus, he does not consider the ultimate to constitute simply a freedom from elaboration but rather considers it to constitute pure awareness devoid of the elaborations of dualistic consciousness of object and subject. Therefore, concerning the three principles Tāranātha states, while the dependent constitutes consciousness that entails perception based on confusion, the imputed constitutes the confusion that manifests to that consciousness, and the absolute is that consciousness, empty of the
confusion imposed by subject-object dualism but not empty of being, in essence, self-knowing awareness. And so what is imputed, other than constituting what is assigned on the basis of symbolic and conventional designations, has no status whatsoever as anything existent; what is dependent exists in the relative sense but does not exist ultimately; and what is absolute exists in the ultimate sense. [3.130b] In this, Tāranātha aligns himself with the enlightened intent of Dolpopa.

In the mantra approach, there is further embellishment due to its special features.
In particular, the relative consists of the appearances that manifest to dualistic consciousness,

The way of interpreting the two levels of truths in the mantra approach is explained as being one that is based on the Middle Way view of these truths, further embellishing this with special features, such as that of viewing sense objects and the perceiving subject as the circle of the maṇḍala and as a state of supreme bliss. The master Jñānapāda[264] speaks of the view of “profound and lucid nonduality.”[265]
In this regard, the relative constitutes saṃsāra—an adventitious manifestation of what is actually nonexistent, like a mottled rope being misper-ceived to be a snake; the ultimate consists of mind as a profound and lucid state of nonduality, analogous to the actual rope.[266] For a mind that entails confusion, saṃsāra is comparable to the purely adventitious consciousness that mistakenly perceives the mottled rope to be a snake, while nirvāṇa's becoming fully evident is comparable to that adventitious consciousness’s being dispelled, so that the perception of a snake is invalidated, and the actual nature of the rope is seen. The fact that the ordinary mind of saṃsāra is by nature nirvāṇa is analogous to the fact that the rope is by nature not a snake, but remains with its own properties.
The very fact that saṃsāra has no independent nature of its own means that it is by its actual nature nirvāṇa, and this means that the profound nature of saṃsāra and the lucid and unceasing quality of what is simply the manifestation of saṃsāra constitute what is, by nature, the maṇḍala of the support and what is supported.[267] As for the consciousness to which this clearly manifests, given that its nature is one of supreme and uninterrupted bliss, the lucid aspect of that nature is nirmāṇakāya, while the supremely blissful aspect of that nature is sambhogakāya. While these aspects constitute a lucidity, these two are acknowledged to abide as a primordial unity, similar to that of a mirror and the mirror s clarity.

In particular, the venerable and omniscient Rangjung gives the following interpretation: [3.131a]
Relative [kun rdzob] refers to the perceptions that manifest to dualistic consciousness; while not existing in actuality, these are imputed by the conceptual process—the manifestations of the animate and inanimate universe and so forth; truth [bden pa] refers to the fact that, while all of this manifests, it has no independent nature, being like the reflection of the moon in water.
Thus there is a nominal truth in what is meaningful to a confused mind.
Ultimate [don dam pa] refers to emptiness as the actual nature of things—that is, emptiness of what is internal and the rest of the eighteen aspects of emptiness that are discussed; while truth [bden pa] describes naturally occurring timeless awareness, which entails none of the dualism of subject and object; this awareness is present in the ultimate sense.[268]
In this respect, the meaning of this discussion is as expressed in the glorious tantra Compendium of the Vajra of Timeless Awareness:
The enlightened intent concerning the two levels of truth is as follows: there is the truth of what is relative and the truth of what is ultimately meaningful. O children of spiritual heritage, the relative consists of the inanimate[269] and the animate; the truth of that is like the reflection of the moon in water. What is ultimately true consists of the eighteen aspects of supreme emptiness; the limit of that is one of abiding.[270]

Thus, if one does not understand the way in which the two levels of truth are present, one does not understand their profound suchness. But through understanding them, one becomes undeluded concerning the unerring topics that constitute the meaning of the words spoken by the Lord of Sages.[271] So, becoming learned with respect to what is relatively true, one is aware of the skillful methods involved in all moral issues—what to accept and what to reject—in their entirety and applies this in a practical manner. And having realized what is ultimately true, one is aware of that which derives from those skillful methods—that is, nirvāṇa as defined in any of the three spiritual approaches,[272] which is totally pure by nature and entirely free of all adventitious distortions—and so reaches the level beyond saṃsāra, that of supreme nirvāṇa that is not confined to any extreme. As we read in the Two Levels of Truth:
Those who understand the differentiation of the two levels of truth
are undeluded concerning the words of the Sage.
They are those who augment all spiritual qualities without exception
and reach the far shore of excellence.[273] [3.131b]

The totally pure nature of the foregoing—the relative and the ultimate, or saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—is the process of interdependent connection with respect to the way in which things are fundamentally unconditioned, or the ground of being, and that moreover is free of all limitation imposed by conceptual elaborations. The true nature of the universe of appearances and possibilities (whether of saṃsāra or nirvāṇa), its actual nature, is such that nothing has come from anywhere whatsoever, goes anywhere whatsoever, or abides anywhere whatsoever. Given that objects in the phenomenal world are sustained by their true nature, even as these phenomena appear as though originating and ceasing, they are free of all limitations due to origination, duration, and cessation, and so their nature is said to be that of the middle way. According to the Source Verses on Sublime Intelligence:
Whatever occurs through being connected interdependently is explained as being emptiness.
This is designated contingently;
this itself is the path of the middle way.[274]
The foregoing statements are not at odds with utterly lucid timeless awareness[275] (which is beyond the domain of interdependent connection). This is because even though it transcends the domain of the relative level of conventional designations, what is itself ultimate manifests as the nature of that level and because the former[276] constitutes the definitive meaning, while the latter[277] is a classification based on conventional designations.

That which arises in the usual progression—originating in dependence on causes and conditions, whether external or internal—is termed “the interdependent connectedness of saṃsāra.” To explain the significance of this a bit, there are two considerations: the connection with causes and the connection with conditions.
Of the two aspects of the process, the external and the internal, the external aspect of interdependent connectedness that involves connection with causes is as follows: From a seed through a seedling and on to the fruit, the situation remains such that without one, the next does not occur. Even though there is no conscious deliberation—“I will produce this” or “I was produced by that”—on the part of these factors, if the causes are present, the results will occur. [3.132a]
Second, as for the external aspect of interdependent connectedness that involves connection with conditions, the earth element serves the function of supporting the seed; water, of moistening it; fire,[278] of maturing it; air, of stimulating its growth; space, of ensuring that this proceeds without impediment; and time, of allowing the seed to change. Thus, even though these six elements and the seed have no conscious deliberation vis-à-vis one another, the situation remains such that without a given factor, another will not occur. None of the foregoing factors is created by the things themselves, or by any other thing, or by a powerful creator god, or by time. They neither occur by their very nature, nor are they causeless. Rather, through the coming together of the elements, once the seed ceases, the seedling is ensured.

This external aspect of the process of interdependent connection is not one of permanent things. Moreover, the seed and the seedling are not one and the same, for the seedling is not produced by whether or not the seed ceases, because the cessation of the seed and the occurrence of the seedling are simultaneous events. Nor is this aspect of the process one of a nihilistic void, for the cessation of the seed and the occurrence of the seedling are like the rise and fall of a balance. Nor is it a case of transference, because the seed is one thing and the seedling is another.[279] In addition, a small cause can ensure a large result, such as the case of the seed of a banyan and the actual tree.[280] There is a continuity of like type, for it is impossible for the relationship of cause to effect to become random.
Of the two considerations for the internal aspect of the process of interdependent connectedness, that which involves connection with causes constitutes the process from ignorance up to and including aging and death.[281] Although there is no agent involved, and these factors have no conscious deliberation vis-à-vis one another, as long as there is a cause, the corresponding result occurs.
The internal aspect of interdependent connectedness that involves connection with conditions is as follows: With the coming together of the six elements of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness, these serve their functions (from earth providing solidity to space providing the cavities and orifices of the body),[282] ensuring the formation of the “seedling” of the mind-body complex in a manner similar to a stack of spears.[283] With the coming together of the six avenues of ordinary consciousness,[284] there is consciousness. Although the body is formed with the coming together of all of these factors, there is no agent involved, and these factors have no conscious deliberation vis-à-vis one another, but the situation remains that their nature is such that when a factor is absent another does not occur. Moreover, none of these factors—from earth to the coordinating function of mind—is something with identity, [3.132b] or an ordinary being, or a life force, or a life form, or a member of the human race, or a human being. There is neither a woman, nor a man, nor even an androgyne. There is neither a self nor anyone else.

In this regard, one has the impression that these six elements constitute a single thing; or a unit; or something permanent, stable, and standing on its own; or something satisfying; or anything from an ordinary being up to a human being[285] or an “I.” These and other such aspects of unknowing are termed “ignorance,” because this constitutes a greatly benighted state and because there is a lack of understanding of suchness and an erroneous concept of it.
With that serving as the cause, the three patterns of attachment, aversion, and delusion occur; due to the influence of ignorance, there is “formative karmic patterning” given that such patterning becomes fully evident. Because this patterning gives rise to specific expressions of consciousness that lead toward states that are meritorious, nonmeritorious, or neutral, there are three aspects to this patterning.
This gives rise to consciousness that is cognizant of individual types of things; this constitutes the six avenues of consciousness. Occurring concomitantly with these are the four aggregates—of forms, sensations, perceptions, and formative factors—that perpetuate cyclic existence. There is mind, since there are ordinary fixated perceptions of “this is such-and-such”; and there is body, because there are ordinary fixated perceptions of “the specific form of this is such-and-such.” These two are combined in the single term “the mind-body complex,” because this serves as the basis for the sense faculties.

The faculties that depend on this complex are the six sense fields, so called because they are avenues for the arising of experience, or because such experience can arise and develop.[286] With the coming together of three factors— sense objects, sense faculties, and the coordinating function of mind—there is contact, because contact is made.[287] The experience of that is sensation, because sensations are involved. Further fixation on those brings compulsion, because there is deeply rooted attachment and fixation. The increase of this brings perpetuation, because the causes of those sensations are perpetuated. The perpetuation of those brings about involvement in conditioned existence, because it leads to actually taking rebirth in conditioned existence once again. From this come the mind-body aggregates—that is to say, rebirth—because one is reborn into whatever state of existence is appropriate. [3.133a] Once rebirth has taken place, the maturation of the mind-body aggregates brings aging, and their destruction brings death; these two factors are combined as one—aging and death. On account of that, there is sorrow due to attachment, because this gives rise to inner torment; verbal expressions of grief due to that; suffering due to the experience of unhappiness; mental anguish due to distressing states of mind; and so forth: secondary afflictive states render the mind completely turbulent.
These twelve links neither constitute anything from a self or an individual up to and including something that is “mine”[288] nor belong to anyone else. They are neither permanent nor impermanent, neither conditioned nor unconditioned. They are neither acausal and aconditional, nor do they exist as agents of experience. Nor are they phenomena that become exhausted, are subject to destruction, or cease to exist. They have, however, played out continuously throughout beginningless time due to other causes and other conditions; they have played out in succession without interruption, like the flow of a river.

These twelve links can also be subsumed under four categories: (1) karma, because it is like a fertile field; (2) ignorance, because it is like the sower of a seed; (3) compulsion, because it “moistens” like water; and (4) consciousness, because it is like the seed. While consciousness as the seed is ensured
by these conditions, there is no agent involved, and these factors have no conscious deliberation vis-à-vis one another and do not constitute anything from a self up to and including something that is “mine.” Nevertheless, if the “seed” of consciousness is supported by the “field” of karma, moistened by the “water” of compulsion, and planted by the “sower” of ignorance, it perpetually takes rebirth in wombs. But no one at all causes this to happen; it does not come about without cause; and it does not “come” from anywhere. All the same, when conditions come together—the cells of the father and mother uniting, the disembodied consciousness[289] entering, and so forth— the “seedling” of the mind-body complex forms in the womb. This, too, does not constitute anything from a self up to and including something that is “mine.” It is not some subjective agent; rather, it is analogous to space, having as its nature that which characterizes an illusion.
Visual consciousness, too, comes about due to five causal factors: (1) the eye serves to provide the support, (2) forms, to provide the frame of reference, (3) illumination, to provide the cause for clear perception, (4) space, to ensure that there is no physical obstruction, [3.133b] and (5) the mental focus that gives rise to this consciousness, to perform the function of cognition. Although these factors bring about visual consciousness, that visual consciousness is not an agent, and it does not have any conscious deliberation, being like an illusion. The same is true for the other avenues of consciousness.

Therefore, although it is indeed the case that no phenomenon whatsoever passes into some future state, and no phenomenon whatsoever comes from some past state, once the coming together of causes is complete within the context of a state of confusion, things appear as though they have passed forward from past states and are produced in future states. But in the case of all these phenomena, that situation is like that of one's face appearing in a mirror even though it is not transferred to the mirror, or like the reflected image of the moon, which moves forty-two thousand yojanas above in the sky,[290] appearing in a vessel of water on the earth s surface, or like the burning that occurs if the causes and conditions for fire come together.
As well, this internal process of interdependent connection is not something permanent, for the mind-body aggregates at the final moment of death are one thing and those that are then born are another. Nor is this process a nihilistic void, for the aggregates that are born do not occur due to whether or not those at the final moment of death cease; rather the cessation of the aggregates at death and the occurrence of the aggregates at birth are like the rise and fall of a balance. Nor this is a case of transference, because the rebirth that takes place can be that of a different type of being.[291] In addition, a small cause can give rise to a large result, such as the case of a single moment of an extremely malicious attitude propelling the mind toward rebirth in a hell state, or a loving attitude of short duration propelling it toward rebirth as a king among the Brahma gods. There is a continuity of like type because results are experienced according to actions committed.

These processes are discussed in the Journey to Śrī Laṅka:
O Mahāmati, just as a pot comes from a lump of clay, so too a blanket comes from yarn, thick cloth from carded wool, seedlings from seeds, and butter from human efforts such as churning and from curds, so too, O Mahāmati, the external aspect of the process of interdependent connection occurs such that what is later comes from what is earlier.... As for the internal aspect of the process of interdependent connection, [3.134a] it is as follows: ignorance, compulsion, karma, and such phenomena as these are given the name “interdependent connection.”[292]
In summary, the initial failure to recognize one's own self-knowing timeless awareness constitutes a supreme state of ignorance. From that comes the formative karmic patterning for conditioned existence, leading to consciousness and all the way down to aging and death, these occurring in an uninterrupted succession, which each relying on the last, as is stated in Letter to a Friend:
From ignorance comes karma,[293] from that
consciousness, and from that the mind-body complex fully forms.
From that come the six sense fields, and from them, said the Sage, contact occurs in all situations.
From contact come all sensations.
From sensations as a basis comes compulsion.
Compulsion brings about perpetuation;
from that comes the process of becoming, and from becoming, rebirth.
Once there is rebirth, there is sorrow, illness, aging, feeling poverty-stricken due to desires, death, destruction, and so forth—
a huge amassing of suffering comes about.[294]
With respect to these aspects of the process of interdependent connection, the expression “coming from causes” is used from the point of view that what is later comes from what is earlier, while the expression “coming from conditions” is used due to there being a process of giving rise to things from the point of view of the coming together of six elements—earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness—on the internal level.
I have previously discussed to a small extent the particular ways in which this process is interpreted in the Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna teachings—of it forming a continuum over one, two, or three lifetimes and so on; of how it is complete in any given instant; and so forth.
The foregoing constitutes what is called “the usual progression, the interdependent connectedness of saṃsāra.”

Interdependent connection with respect to nirvāṇa, which is the reversal of the usual progression, has two considerations: the path and the fruition state.
In the first place, as for the spiritual path, [3.134b] given that ignorance is the root of the usual progression of the twelve links that constitute interdependent connection with respect to saṃsāra, this is removed by pure and timeless awareness. Through becoming familiar with the evolution of sublime intelligence through studying teachings to contemplating them to meditating on them, one removes the initial root factor, that of ignorance.
Once that has been removed, the other factors that depend on it are successively removed. When the causes for engaging further in conditioned existence have come to an end, one moves beyond the state of saṃsāra. Letter to a Friend states:
With the stopping of rebirth, all of this stops.[295]
In this regard, since advanced spiritual practitioners who wish to attain liberation have not reinforced the karmic causes that sustain saṃsāra, any future result of saṃsāra does not come about because formative karmic patterning has stopped. This is why it is said:
The root of saṃsāra is formative patterning; therefore, the wise do not engage in such patterning.[296]

As for interdependent connection with respect to the fruition state, this is the fact that the benefit that buddhas ensure for ordinary beings takes place in the manner of a dream or an illusion. That is to say, whoever beholds the fact that all phenomena simply occur through a process of interdependent connection does not view things as self, or other, or existent, or nonexistent, and does not conceive in terms of the limitations imposed by the three phases of linear time. They are not involved with such views as the atman theory of Brahmanical practitioners, and so have uprooted belief in the reality of the perishable mind-body aggregates. Those for whom objects in the phenomenal world are unborn and unceasing have access to the key points of the limitless collections of teachings that are the speech of the Buddha; therefore, having thoroughly assimilated the meaning of these as true, they also have access to the state of all-seeing enlightenment. The Source Verses on Sublime Intelligence state:
For those who behold that things occur in interdependent connection, suffering and its all-pervasive origin stop, and they behold the spiritual path.[297]
Thus, having contemplated in a dedicated manner these two levels of truth and the way in which things occur through interdependent connection, [3.135a] one should not leave it at following a path of studying teachings, but rather should truly realize the significance of these topics. In the foregoing discussion I have again spoken of the significance of interdependent connection, this time according to the enlightened intent of the sūtra Verdant Rice Seedling.[298]

Given that the peace of nirvāṇa, the deathless state, is that goal that those who wish for liberation strive for, whether or not that is made fully evident hinges on whether or not the potential, or source, of obscuration has been eliminated. This, in turn, will not take place if one lacks the sublime
intelligence that is the remedy eliminating the deluded state of ignorance. “What kind of intelligence?” one might wonder; it is sublime intelligence that realizes the lack of identity in things. It is this intelligence that ensures that one's view is totally pure and that one gains the most excellent degree of perspicacity concerning what is definitively meaningful.
In order for that to become fully evident, moreover, one is aware that one must apply the aspect of skillful means in a practical manner and in every way possible. By one's truly engaging in such means, one's conduct becomes totally pure, and this awakens in one the most excellent degree of perspicacity concerning what is provisionally meaningful.
In this way, one's totally pure view and conduct are integrated, not becoming divorced from one another. And so, it is said, one swiftly gains access to the bliss of complete freedom. [3.135b]

Moreover, of the two—view and conduct—the former is especially important. All of the limitless collections of teachings spoken by the Victorious One, whether of provisional or definitive meaning, are entirely directed toward, and come down to, the basic space of phenomena. And so, for one to seek out the authentic view—that which accords with this fact—through the eye of sublime intelligence becomes the direct cause for one's gaining the experience of that basic space. Initially, then, one should come to a definitive understanding of the true and abiding nature of this view. As we read in Letter to a Friend:
Even though individuals with erroneous opinions may conduct themselves well,
they will endure all manner of intolerable results.[299]
Thus, erroneous opinions, which conflict with the authentic view, together with anything associated with them, constitute the source of all flaws and faults. Initially, then, one should use the minds powers of thorough discernment, relying on scriptural authority and reasoning, to understand the role of such opinions and, having gained certainty about this, one should discard them.
In this respect, non-Buddhist doctrines based on naive affirmation or nihilistic denial,[300] and even Buddhist schools that profess materialist tenets,[301] are subject to the flaw of philosophical absolutism. The authentic view, therefore, lies entirely with the Middle Way path. So one should accept the profound and flawless definitive meaning of the mainstream traditions of the two “charioteers,”[302] seeking these out with a perspicacity that does not fall into any extreme, marshaling the forces of good by reinforcing one's merit, and striving with the sublime intelligence that derives from the threefold process of studying, contemplating, and meditating on teachings.

With ignorance serving as the cause, [3.136a] there ensues the “belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates.” That is, due to the deluded attitude that completely fails to understand that the collection of the mind-body aggregates has no identity, there develops the confused belief in the reality of these aggregates, that they constitute some identity.
While this belief is a mode that is perceived as a clear image in the mind,[303] ignorance is an unclear impression without any such differentiation whatsoever. So these two modes[304] are in contradiction with respect to the impression they present and the way the mind perceives them. Therefore, while ignorance does not, in actuality, develop from this belief, it nevertheless
develops through the force of the potential that derives from habituation to this mistaken attitude—belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates.[305]
Furthermore, this belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates, when analyzed with respect to the three realms, functions in three ways. The belief as it is experienced within the states of the realm of desire constitutes an entirely negative influence, whereas the belief as it is experienced within the states of the two higher realms constitutes a karmically neutral obscuration.[306]
The belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates is synonymous with “false perception of identity,” which is the root of four mistaken ideas. These four are: misperceiving what is impure to be pure; misperceiving what is productive of suffering to be pleasurable; misperceiving what is impermanent to be permanent; and misperceiving what has no identity to have identity. With the first three of these being accessories to the false perception of identity, these ideas all serve as the basis, or root, as it were, of all thought patterns that derive from mistaken perceptions.

If this term is interpreted in the broadest sense, “identity” refers to something that is able to stand on its own, without depending on anything else; it is in this sense that it is meant when referring to “the identity in phenomena.” If the term is interpreted in a narrower sense, it refers to the “I,” or “self” falsely perceived with reference to the mind-body aggregates; it is in this sense that the term is meant when referring to “the identity in the individual.” In this regard, what is called “belief in identity” constitutes that selfsame belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates, for that itself constitutes the false perception of a self with reference to the collection of these aggregates, [3.136b] which are by nature perishable and impermanent. This misperception is itself connected with ignorance. For as long as there is ignorance, which consists of delusion concerning the Four Truths,[308] there is this misperception; and once that ignorance has been eliminated, this misperception has also been eliminated.[309]
The remedy to this misperception is sublime intelligence that realizes the lack of any identity because it serves as a counterbalancing force that is the opposite of the belief in identity, which is allied with ignorance.[310] If ignorance and the belief in identity, together with their potentials, are not uprooted and eliminated, there is no way for one to become free of the three realms. And if one lacks the sublime intelligence that realizes the lack of any identity, one is incapable of eliminating the belief in identity. Thus, one
should train in that completely authentic view through the three means of studying, contemplating, and meditating on teachings, and so develop that flawless and sublime intelligence.

Conditioned phenomena are momentary and impermanent;
all that is corruptible is of the nature of the three kinds of suffering;
both the deeply ingrained afflictive state and the totally refined state are empty and lack identity;
nirvāṇa alone is liberation, the state of peace.

It is said that, in coming to a definitive understanding of the lack of identity through studying and contemplating teachings, if one has not aroused a sense of certainty concerning these four axioms that denote the Buddhas words—that is, the view—it will be difficult for one to develop the certainty that will finally resolve this issue of lack of identity. So one should initially examine these axioms precisely:
(1) In this regard, all conditioned phenomena[311] subsumed within the outer and inner levels[312] are found to be impermanent because there is never any situation in which they exhibit permanence. And this impermanence is not simply and completely accounted for on the more obvious level of impermanence; there is also the more subtle level of impermanence, in that the characteristics of things are such that they cease in the very moment they come about, having no independent status that allows them to last for even an instant. [3.137a] Just as the flame of a lamp can be understood to be momentary (as the oil fueling it is consumed moment by moment), likewise so can all that is conditioned. And just as it is impossible, in the case of a rider and mount, for one to proceed and the other not to, so too the sense faculties and their respective sense objects are found to be momentary because they constitute the support for momentary consciousness.

</d>
<d e="2">
(2) That being the case, suffering can also be understood because things must disintegrate moment by moment, without any independent status that would allow them to endure. In this context, subliminal suffering—the subtle aspect of suffering—lies in the fact that conditioned things, merely by having come about, can be characterized as producing suffering. It is not appropriate to think that whatever entails suffering constitutes some agent that somehow causes happiness or suffering, for the thing itself has no independent status. This is why it is a contradiction for any phenomenon that is impermanent to also be something with identity or a producing agent.
Regardless of which phenomenon one considers, everything that serves as a cause to perpetuate afflictive mental states is corruptible,[313] and these things do not transcend the nature of suffering. In this regard, the suffering of actual pain, as experienced by beings in the states of animals and lower, can plainly be understood to be suffering, and so we need not prove it to be so through reasoning. The suffering of change can be understood to be actual suffering by ordinary mortal people with good powers of discernment, and so it too need not be proved to be so through reasoning. The suffering that needs to be proved to be so through reasoning is the subliminal suffering that spiritually immature people do not understand to be suffering and instead hold to be happiness.

<d e="2">
On this note, all conditioned things come about and disintegrate moment by moment, their nature being one of impermanence, and so there is not the slightest chance of them enduring. Without the independent status that would allow them to endure, they constitute suffering itself because they disintegrate even though we do not wish them to do so. Furthermore, if we put aside the case of something that we do not wish to disintegrate nevertheless disintegrating and so constituting suffering, [3.137b] even something that disintegrates whether we wish it to or not is suffering because its disintegration is due to its lacking any independent status to prevent that disintegration.
From among the Four Truths, in the case of those of suffering and its all-pervasive origin, from the point of view of their common ground, the all-pervasive origin is considered to be the cause and suffering the effect. To give an example, if one is motivated by an afflictive state of aversion and so commits the act of taking another being s life, from that cause (that is, the all-pervasive origin) comes the effect (the truth of suffering), in this case the formation of a body in a state of hell.[314]
But while, as a general rule, these two—suffering and its all-pervasive origin—are related to one another as effect and cause, respectively, it is by no means certain that the all-pervasive origin will always be the cause and suffering always the effect. All suffering comes about through the force of impermanence, for things are such that they do not endure in their respective situations; those situations change into others and eventually things disintegrate, so that they are productive of suffering and are sources of disappointment. To give an example, when a seed as the cause is thoroughly augmented by water, fertilizer, warmth, and other factors, it does not remain in the state of being a seed. Rather, it completely disintegrates, and there ensues the state of a seedling. That, too, does not last, but completely disintegrates, and there ensues the complete state of a fruit. And that, too, does not last forever, but eventually disintegrates.

(3) All phenomena that pertain to either deeply ingrained afflictive states or the totally refined state[315] are empty and lack identity. Generally speaking, those who believe that things have a creator are mistaking an inappropriate cause to be the cause.[316] This serves as the avenue for ordinary consciousness to perceive things in an erroneous way—in fact, for all manner of afflictive mental states and flaws. And even though there are mistaken ideas of taking something that is not a cause to be a cause—such as that of taking a seedling to come about from some cause other than itself, such as impermanence— [3.138a] it is not as though these serve as the avenue for all flaws to come about, as is the case with believing in a creator.
In this regard, all of the happiness and suffering in the world comes about through the force of positive and negative karma. The fact that one commits negative actions and experiences suffering as a result, or that one commits positive actions and experiences happiness as a result—these are not due to some creator imposing these on each and every ordinary being as some ultimate essential principle. And so, although simply as a general rule it is definitely the case that the results of happiness and suffering come about due to positive and negative actions, respectively, this is not ever made to be so, as non-Buddhists believe, by some eternal, unitary, autonomous entity,[317] such as the soul of an individual or a powerful creator god. If such were the case, one would incur the effects of actions one had not committed, the effects of actions one had committed would be ineffectual, and there would be no predictability in ascertaining causes and effects—the entire framework of moral choices of acceptance and rejection, which is based on cause and effect, would be subverted. This would serve as the utterly intolerable avenue for ignoble opinions based on exceedingly warped interpretations of which actions to embrace and which to avoid.

Therefore, if one understands that all phenomena, although they are devoid of identity and have no creator, nevertheless can and do come about through a process of interdependent connection, unceasing in their manifestation, then all of the afflictive mental states pertaining to the three realms are completely undermined.
(4) If the belief in identity is thus eliminated, one gains the state of cessation—which is to say, nirvāṇa, the transcendence of sorrow. In this regard, the happiness of higher states of rebirth and so forth are temporary states of well-being, which are very limited, deceptive, unreliable, and lacking in any real essence. And so nirvāṇa alone is the liberation that is an ongoing state of well-being—the state of peace that is undisturbed by the waves of afflictive mental states. If we analyze it, however, there are many different interpretations in the Indian and Tibetan traditions of Buddhism regarding the state of nirvāṇa according to each of the three spiritual approaches,[318] and the consummate level of the truth of cessation. I will discuss the essential points of these in the section on the fruition state.[319]
Let me use an analogy to describe the role played by these four axioms that denote the general teachings of the Buddhas words. [3.138b] Just as a ruler's subjects uphold the edicts of their ruler and would not contravene them, in a similar fashion, it would be inappropriate for those who consider themselves followers of the Lord of Sages[320] ever to stray outside the guidelines of this view. So one should contemplate these axioms thoroughly and at the very outset arouse a sense of certainty concerning them.

Once one has already cultivated one's authentic intelligence, such that it is capable of becoming totally pure, one then must follow the Middle Way path that avoids the dualistic extremes of conceptual elaborations involving either naive affirmation or nihilistic denial. As the means to follow it, one uses the perceiving agent of sublime intelligence that knows ultimate reality to pare away conceptual elaborations concerning the object that is to be known. This is, in general, the tradition of each of the Buddhist schools of thought. Therefore, those who follow philosophical systems that profess materialism[321] may, with recourse to the scriptural authority and reasoning that pertain to their own traditions, eliminate naive affirmation and nihilistic denial as these apply with their specific context. Nevertheless, if their positions are evaluated according to the Middle Way tradition and the reasoning that concerns the absence of conceptual elaborations, they still fall into extremes of overstatement and understatement.
Sublime intelligence, generally speaking, can be of two kinds: sublime intelligence that knows the relative and sublime intelligence that knows the ultimate; the latter is the basis of what is being characterized in this present context. Concerning that kind of intelligence, moreover, within the Mahāyāna approach we can ascertain three distinct interpretations: (1) followers of the Mind Only school understand all phenomena to be simply conscious awareness; (2) those who assert unqualified emptiness understand all phenomena to be free of conceptual elaborations; and (3) those who assert qualified emptiness understand that freedom from conceptual elaborations itself to be endowed with the potential for all manifestation.[322] [3.139a]

In general, proponents of all philosophical systems, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist, presume that they are espousing a “middle way,” refuting dualistic extremes in light of their own understanding of what this means. This is because they hold that they profess, according to their own systems, a middle way that avoids two extremes—although lower approaches, in exaggerating what does not exist as existing, incur the extreme of naive affirmation, while relatively higher approaches, in denying what exists as not existing, incur the extreme of nihilistic denial.
With respect to our own Buddhist schools:
(1) For followers of the Particularist school, the way in which the extremes of naïve affirmation and nihilistic denial are avoided is as follows: the extreme of naive affirmation is avoided due to the fact that all conditioned things disintegrate moment by moment, while the extreme of nihilistic denial is avoided due to the fact that minute and irreducible subatomic particles are truly existent.
(1) For those who are Followers of the Sūtras, the extreme of naive affirmation is avoided due to the fact that causes in their own individual essences are subject to cessation, while the extreme of nihilistic denial is avoided due to the fact that their accordant results ensue.[323]
(3) For those of the Mind Only school, the extreme of naive affirmation is avoided by the fact that what is imputed has no independent nature, while the extreme of nihilistic denial is avoided by the fact that what is dependent can be proven to be truly existent.[324]
(4) For those of the Middle Way school,[325] the extreme of naive affirmation is avoided by the fact that the nature of things is a freedom from conceptual elaboration, while the extreme of nihilistic denial is avoided by the fact that what is relative comes about through a process of interdependent connection.
(5) For those who profess qualified emptiness, the extreme of naive affirmation is avoided by the fact that all phenomena on the relative level (which come about due to other factors) are primordially such that they cannot be proven to exist, while the extreme of nihilistic denial is avoided by the fact that the heart essence of the attainment of the state of bliss[326] (which is naturally occurring and unchanging) abides as the fundamentally unconditioned mode of being.[327]

Because they largely fall into the extremes of overstatement and understatement, the majority of the foregoing views of the respective schools of
thought have some element of truth, but for the most part contain much that is untrue.[328] But because it entails the realization of things just as they are—of the fundamentally unconditioned mode of reality as a freedom from conceptual elaborations and as the utter lucidity of unconditioned basic space, and of the way in which things manifest as such, that by nature they come about through a process of interdependent connection— [3.139b] it is the Middle Way tradition that is entirely true. As we read in the Brief Presentation of Buddhist Views:
In the scriptural sources of the Particularists,
Followers of the Sūtras, and Yogic Practitioners, there is some small element of truth and there is untruth.
The Middle Way tradition is entirely true.[329]
In this present context, to summarize the path that avoids dualistic extremes, there are two considerations: the way in which to dispel dualistic extremes with respect to conduct and the way in which to dispel dualistic extremes with respect to view.

1) In the first case, if one asserts that phenomena (whether of deeply ingrained afflictive states or the totally refined state[330]) that can be validated through what is considered valid cognition in the ordinary mundane sphere[331] are in fact nonexistent, one falls into the extreme of understatement.[332] On the other hand, if one asserts that phenomena (whether of deeply ingrained afflictive states or the totally refined state) that are tainted by causes of confusion in the present circumstances,[333] or are posited in schools of thought that espouse extreme views, are in fact existent, one falls into the extreme of overstatement.[334] On the Middle Way path that avoids these two extremes, one's conduct is that of training in the six transcendent perfections.[335]
2) As for the two extremes with respect to one's view, if one naively accepts the existence of all objects of knowledge that there are in general, and all the limitless aspects of the relative level of truth in particular, one falls into the extreme of overstatement because one is asserting that these exist even though valid cognition cannot prove that they do. On the other hand, if one naively asserts that, on the same relative level of truth (which can be validated through valid cognition), things are not existent once they are thoroughly investigated (using such reasoning as whether things are unitary or manifold[336]), one falls into the extreme of understatement because one is asserting that emptiness is the cause of things disintegrating.[337] On the Middle Way path that avoids two such extremes, one's view is such that it pares away conceptual elaborations.

Given that the scope[338] of the view in the Middle Way tradition is that of emptiness, the significance of that term “empty” is one of “absence.” What is it that is absent? The two kinds of identity. The “-ness” component signifies that this constitutes the “circumstance” of things.[339]
In this regard, according to the school of Yogic Practitioners, what is alone explained as being the actuality of what is ultimate is timeless awareness—entailing no duality of perceived object and perceiving subject, such that the two kinds of identity (as what is to be negated) have been negated. According to those who have an unqualified interpretation of emptiness, this actuality is, rather, an aspect of unqualified negation that is simply the negation of the two kinds of identity.

More specifically, the basis for emptiness lies in objects in the phenomenal world[340]—which is to say, all possible phenomena, as many objects of knowledge as there may be. These are, at one and the same time, what is to be negated—that is, what it is that is empty—and the basis on which there can be this negation.[341] In brief, they constitute two kinds of things—individuals and phenomena.
As for the way in which these are empty, all phenomena that could be considered as bases for negation are empty by virtue of their very essence— for example, just as form is empty of form, any given thing is empty of being that very thing; because when one evaluates it using the reasoning that investigates from the ultimate perspective, the thing in question cannot be found to be that thing. To give an example, when a vase is investigated to establish whether it is something unitary or manifold, it cannot be established to be a “vase.”
To summarize, to say nothing of things that are unsuitable to be objects of ordinary consciousness,[342] as many phenomena as are suitable are all explained as being empty of their respective essences. The Entrance to the Middle Way states:
Since that[343] is its nature, the eye is empty of the eye; the ear, the nose, the tongue,
the body, and the mind are to be described likewise.[344]
The basis for emptiness lies in its sixteen aspects, such as the emptiness of outer and inner objects in the phenomenal world.[345] If these aspects are summarized, [3.140b] they fall into the four categories of what is substantial, what is insubstantial, nature, and “alternate reality.”[346] As is said:
Furthermore, O Subhūti,[347] the Mahāyāna approach of the bodhisattva consists of the following aspects of emptiness: emptiness of what is internal, emptiness of what is external, emptiness of what is external and internal, emptiness of emptiness, emptiness
of what is great, emptiness of what is ultimate, emptiness of what is conditioned, emptiness of what is unconditioned, emptiness of what is beyond limitations, emptiness of what is without beginning or end, emptiness of what is not to be discarded, emptiness of nature, emptiness of all phenomena, emptiness of specific characteristics, emptiness of what has no frame of reference, [348]... and emptiness of the very essence of what has no substantiality.[349]

Of these aspects:
(1) The first aspect refers to the six internal components of the sense fields (the faculty of vision and so forth).[350]
(2) The second aspect refers to the six outer components of the sense fields (forms and so forth).[351]
(3) The third aspect refers to the foregoing outer and inner components of the sense fields but not in this case to the physical bases for the senses.[352]
(4) The foregoing explanations confirm that phenomena on the relative level are empty of any finite essence on the relative level, but the fourth aspect of emptiness is explained in order to negate any fixation that the fact that things are empty of being things itself constitutes something that is their “nature.” The topic under discussion in this fourth explanation is that of emptiness in the three aspects just explained. The purpose of presenting this fourth aspect of emptiness is to negate any fixation that emptiness, moreover, “exists,” or “is,” something.
(5) Concerning the fifth aspect, the term “supreme” is used because there is a pervasiveness throughout the entire animate and inanimate universe, without exception.[353]
(6) The sixth aspect refers to nirvāṇa because this is the most sublime purpose concerning what is ultimate.[354] In this context, this is not held to refer to nirvāṇa that does or does not entail residual traces,[355] but to either nirvāṇa as the natural state[356] or nonlimited nirvāṇa.[357]
(7) and (8) As for the seventh and eighth aspects, what is conditioned and what is unconditioned refer, respectively, to that which entails the three phases of production, duration, and cessation, and that which does not.[358] [3.141a]
(9) Concerning the ninth aspect, “what is beyond limitations” refers to a freedom from the dualistic limitations of naive affirmation or nihilistic denial. It applies to all three topics of emptiness, interdependent connection, and the path of the Middle Way.
(10) As for the tenth aspect, “what is without beginning or end” refers to saṃsāra.

(11) Concerning the eleventh aspect, in the expression “what is not to be discarded” “to discard” in general implies there being some “thing to be discarded,” which is another word for a “flaw.” To say “not to be” with regard to that implies “what is to be accepted,” which is another way of saying “the phenomena that pertain to the totally refined state of enlightenment ”[359]
(12) Regarding the twelfth aspect, “nature” refers to the emptiness of phenomena of any finite essence on the relative level because this constitutes the essence of phenomena on the ultimate level. Although there really is no difference between this aspect and the topic discussed as the basis for emptiness under the fourth aspect of emptiness, they are explained in these distinct ways in order to negate the fixation on emptiness per se and the fixation on that emptiness as being some “nature.”
(13) As for the thirteenth aspect, “all phenomena” refers to as many phenomena as there are, whether conditioned or unconditioned.
(14) Concerning the fourteenth aspect, the “specific characteristics” referred to are as many characteristics as there are that are specific to phenomena (such as anything that is suitable to be a form and so forth)—“from forms up to and including the state of omniscience.”[360]
(15) With respect to the fifteenth aspect, “what has no frame of reference” refers to the three phases of linear time. As it is said:
The present is not something that abides, nor are the past or the present things that exist.[361]
This aspect of emptiness must be discussed in light of the foregoing citation; it is not to be discussed in the sense of “no frame of reference,” meaning a situation in which one thing is absent in another.[362]
(16) Regarding the sixteenth aspect, the expression “the very essence of what has no substantiality” means that any substantial thing is empty of being that substantial thing itself. That emptiness being in turn empty of itself is termed “emptiness of the very essence of what has no substantiality.”

Thus, a detailed analysis discusses these sixteen aspects, while a less elaborate treatment subsumes them into four categories. In the extensive and middle-length “Mother” texts,[363] we find these words following the discussion of the sixteen aspects of emptiness:
O Subhūti, what is substantial is empty of what is substantial, [3.141b] what is insubstantial is empty of what is insubstantial, nature is empty of nature, and alternate reality is empty of alternate reality.[364]
This passage, then, speaks of four aspects of emptiness. In this regard, if we summarize all objects that there are in the phenomenal world, which are bases for emptiness, they can be subsumed within the two categories of relative and ultimate truth. As for the relative level of truth, it comprises two categories, what is substantial and what is nonsubstantial.[365] And although the ultimate level of truth cannot be analyzed from the point of view of what it constitutes in essence, from the point of view of its aspects, it can be shown to consist of both nature and what is termed “alternate reality.”
The points to be understood from such a presentation are:
(1) that phenomena on the relative level have primordially never known existence, but it is not the case that timeless awareness has newly made them nonexistent (this is the logic that shows emptiness to be the nature of all that is relative); and
(2) while this is the case, it is not appropriate for emptiness to be an object either of a consciousness that is subjectively perceiving what is relative, or of its verbalizations (this is the logic that shows it to be “alternate reality”).
“Well,” one might wonder, “why is this term ‘alternate reality’ used?” The commentary to the Entrance to the Middle Way gives three reasons[366] in discussing the use of the term “alternate reality”:
(1) due to the fact that, while objects in the phenomenal world—that is, things on the relative level—are not constantly present, this is constantly present;
(2) due to the reason that, while things on the relative level are not what is realized by timeless awareness, this is what is realized by that awareness; and
(3) due to the reason that, while what is relative does not transcend saṃsāra, this does transcend it.

The basis on which there can be negation is what is absolute[367]—that is, basic space, suchness beyond the confines of conceptual elaboration. The factors to be negated are what can be characterized as imputed or dependent.[368] As to the way in which emptiness is so, given that the basis for negation is empty of the two factors to be negated, [3.142a] it is the absolute itself that is described by Yogic Practitioners—that is to say, those who uphold the tradition of qualified emptiness—to be “empty of other.”[369] In this regard, Serdok Paṇchen[370] provides the following explanation:
That which serves as the basis for emptiness is that which is dependent—that is to say, the limitless aspects of the consciousness imbued with the dualistic framework of perceived objects and a perceiving subject. The factor that is to be negated is that which is imputed, which is in turn twofold according to an analysis of what is perceived and what perceives. Each of these aspects of perceived and perceiver has two further divisions, from the point of view of the individual and that of phenomena.[371]
As to the way in which these are empty, the basis for the negation is empty of the factors to be negated in the sense of being “empty of other,” not in the sense of being “empty in itself.” For the factors to be negated—the two aspects of what is imputed, that is, perceived and perceiver—are in essence “other” with respect to the two aspects of perceived and perceiver that pertain to consciousness based on dualistic perception (which are the bases on which negation can take place) because the former cannot be considered to be of the essence that is specific to the latter.
“What,” one might ask, “is the essence that is specific to that consciousness based on dualistic perception?” It is nondual timeless awareness itself—the bare lucidity and awareness of experiencing whatever is knowable.[372]

In general, while timeless awareness—entailing none of the duality of perceived objects and perceiving subject—is explained as being the basic space of phenomena, when its ramifications are analyzed, there are fourteen
aspects of emptiness; when the significance of these are summarized, these are understood as being subsumed within two categories.[373]
These fourteen aspects as follows:
Emptiness of what is internal, of what is external, of what is external and internal,
and of what is great; emptiness of emptiness,
of what is ultimate, of what is conditioned, of what is unconditioned, of what is beyond limitations, of what is without beginning or end, of what is not to be discarded, of nature, of characteristics, and emptiness of phenomena.[374]
In this case, the bases for these aspects of emptiness are referred to in Distinguishing Center and Limit:
There is emptiness of that which experiences and what it experiences, of their body, and of the basis for existence;
there is also such perception of how, what, and why, which are also emptiness.[375]

This passage constitutes a brief summation of all aspects of emptiness without exception. The specific contexts that are the bases for these aspects of emptiness are the inner components of the sense fields, the outer components of the sense fields, [3.142b] the body that constitutes the context for of these two, and the inanimate universe that serves as their support; that is to say, what pertains to the relative level of truth. The timeless awareness that has direct knowledge of the emptiness of these four categories is the specific context that is the basis for the emptiness of the fifth and sixth aspects;[376] this is from the point of view of the ultimate level. So the specific contexts that are the bases lor emptiness in the six foregoing cases are assigned on the basis of an analysis of the two levels of truth, while the specific situations that are the bases for emptiness in the last eight cases[377] are assigned in light of their usefulness. As is said:
Because the two kinds of virtue are to be gained,[378]
because there is constant benefit for beings,[379]
because saṃsāra is not to be relinquished,[380]
because virtue becomes inexhaustible,[381]
because, moreover, their spiritual potential becomes evident in its total purity,[382]
because the major and minor marks of perfect form are gained,[383]
and because the attributes of buddhahood are revealed in their purity,[384]
bodhisattvas pursue spiritual accomplishment.[385]

The foregoing points identify the specific contexts that serve as the bases for the emptiness for the eight latter aspects of emptiness. Because bodhisattvas base their spiritual practice on these eight specific contexts, one might wonder for what purpose any given aspect is undertaken.
Because the two kinds of virtue—(1) conditioned and (2) unconditioned—are to be gained in the more consummate sense, one pursues the practice of these two kinds of virtue—conditioned and unconditioned—in the shorter term. These two kinds are the specific contexts, respectively, for the emptiness of what is conditioned and the emptiness of what is unconditioned;
(3) using the same model, because there is the specific purpose of benefiting beings, one pursues spiritual practice on the path of the Middle Way;
(4) in order not to abandon beings, one pursues practice to engage in saṃsāra;
(5) in order to ensure that virtue becomes inexhaustible in the state in which there is not residual traces,[386] one pursues the accomplishment of virtue that accords with the true nature of phenomena;[387]
(6) in order for it to be purified of adventitious distortions,[388] one pursues practice that focuses on one's naturally indwelling spiritual potential;
(7) one pursues spiritual practice in order to gain the major and minor marks of perfect form;[389] and
(8) in order to gain the attributes of buddhahood, [3.143a] one pursues practice to accomplish the powers and so forth.
The first four of these aspects of emptiness[390] are from the point of view of what is held in common with the ordinary approaches of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha; the latter four aspects,[391] of what is extraordinary about the Mahāyāna approach. It is in order to promote one's understanding of this that the citation states:
... bodhisattvas pursue spiritual accomplishment.[392]

In addition, it is for this or that particular purpose that one pursues accomplishment with respect to this or that corresponding aspect of emptiness. To give one example, if one did not understand saṃsāra to be emptiness, one would feel disheartened and relinquish saṃsāra.
In this context, with respect to the explanations of the specific contexts that are the bases for aspects of emptiness, there are distinctions in how this interpretation differs from that found in the sources of the interpretation of unqualified emptiness—specifically, the naturally indwelling spiritual potential, as distinct from emptiness of nature; the major marks of perfect form, as distinct from the emptiness of specific characteristics; and the qualities of the level of buddhahood, as distinct from the emptiness of all phenomena.[393]
As to the way in which there is emptiness,[394] the true nature of phenomena is empty of what is “other”[395]—which is to say, dualistic consciousness from the point of view of the individual and phenomena.[396]
A concise analysis consists of two aspects—emptiness of what has no substantiality and emptiness of the very essence of what has no substantiality.[397] These two aspects, moreover, can be analyzed into their own aspects. Emptiness of what has no substantiality is designated from the perspective that there is a negation of an imputed individual and imputed phenomena as factors to be negated. Emptiness of the very essence of what has no substantiality is designated from the perspective that there is a negation of what remains in the wake of the negation of the foregoing factors to be negated— that is, the existence of the individual and phenomena as being the true nature of things. These two aspects are not two separate “emptinesses” that can each stand on its own; however, they must be designated as a means of dispelling the two extremes of overstatement and understatement with respect to each situation involving things that are actually emptiness. The point here is that one understand that these two aspects must be seen as applying to all fourteen aspects of emptiness.
The two extremes here are explained as being that of overstatement (that is, of naively assuming the existence of an individual and phenomena that are imputed) and that of understatement (that is, of denial that states: “The factors of the true nature of reality and the entity of the individual do not exist”).[398] [3.143b]

That which acts as a hindrance to one directly perceiving emptiness consists entirely of ten digressive concepts.[399] As the Summary of the Meaning of the Eight Thousand Verses states:
Due to the ten ways in which mental distraction occurs, the mind is distracted to other things, so that spiritually immature people have no chance to develop nondual timeless awareness.[400]
The remedy that dispels these concepts is timeless awareness that directly realizes the twenty, or sixteen, aspects of emptiness. If these aspects are summarized, they are twofold, due to an analysis into realization of the lack of identity in the individual and in phenomena.

Concerning the lack of any identity in phenomena, there is a more obvious aspect (in which the factor to be negated—which is in fact negated—is the sense of this identity having true existence) and a more subtle aspect (in which even something having no true existence is negated). Of these two, first and foremost one should come to a definitive conclusion concerning the more obvious aspect, for the following reasons: (a) because this aspect is an issue common to Buddhists and non-Buddhists; (b) because the realization of this more obvious aspect of the lack of identity in phenomena must precede the realization of the more subtle aspect of that lack of identity; [3.144a] and (c) because once one has come to a definitive conclusion that all phenomena on the relative level are empty in and of themselves of any finite essence, this proves as a consequence that anything called “the identity in the individual”—which is imputed by an almost innate level of nonrecognition—is empty in and of itself of any finite essence.

The identity in phenomena, in its essence, is discussed in the commentary to the Four Hundred Verses, which states that this is
a case in which something exists solely due to there being a concept of it, but is not something existent in the absence of that concept. These are cases like that of a coiled rope being unhesitatingly imputed to be a snake; this is certainly a case in which something cannot be established to exist in its very essence.[401]
In accord with this citation, it is due to the influence of this almost innate level of nonrecognition—to which one has become habituated throughout beginningless time—that all phenomena, both external and internal, all forms, and so forth, that manifest to the ordinary mind, are fixated on as though truly existent things that have their own specific and innate characteristics. In any way that this occurs, it comes down to nothing more than something being imputed by conceptual thinking—like a rope being mistaken for a snake—for things by their very nature cannot be found to exist. And so they are things that are negated through reasoning when one is focusing on suchness itself.

Such overt fixation is the cause for misconstruing things to have identity, which lies at the root of the two kinds of obscuration.[403] This is discussed in the Precious Garland:
As long as there is reification of the mind-body aggregates, for that long there is the belief in an “I.”
If there is belief in an “I” there is, furthermore, karma, and due to that there is rebirth.[404]
That is, furthermore, the foremost factor in the cognitive obscuration, as is pointed out in the Highest Continuum:
Whatever conceptual thoughts involve the three focal points[405] is held to constitute the cognitive obscuration.[406]
Therefore, those who wish to attain liberation and omniscience[407] by eliminating the two kinds of obscuration [3.144b] must eliminate overt fixation on the root of these two kinds of obscuration. This, in turn, must be eliminated through negating the sense that objects are truly existent things. As we read in the Four Hundred Verses:
With one having perceived that no identity exists in sense objects, the potential for conditioned existence will come to an end.[408]
And according to the Detailed Commentary on Valid Cognition:
In this context, without repudiating an object, one is unable to eliminate it.[409]

What is simply the most obvious aspect of the lack of identity in phenomena is found in all philosophical systems, for it is explained in such texts as the Ornament of the Middle Way[410] that this is found even among non-Buddhists. But even though this will suppress the more obvious aspect of the cognitive obscuration (which is in direct opposition to it), it is not the view that becomes the path to omniscience. It is not possible for one to directly perceive the lack of identity in the subjective perceiving agent[411] by familiarizing oneself simply with this because it is devoid of the basis for positive qualities that is in accord with liberation.[412]
Concerning this issue, the followers of the Sāṃkhya school believe objects in the external world to be mind and further believe that dualistic consciousness becomes a nondual state with the dissolution of mind into primal matter.[413]
In the systems of the Particularists and the Followers of the Sūtras, there are no explanations that bring one to a definitive conclusion on the basis of all limitless objects in the phenomenal world, and so they lack a completely perfect understanding of suchness as it pertains to the lack of identity in phenomena. Nevertheless, their explanations bring a definitive conclusion on the basis of ephemeral objects in the phenomenal world, and so they must have a partial understanding.

That is to say, source texts of the Particularist school explain that external objects on the coarse level have no true existence; while the sources of the Followers of the Sūtras do not stop there but make the distinction of a duality between what is material and what is a mental determinant[414] and explain that mental determinants, too, have no true existence. The rationale for this, moreover, is as follows: whenever a given phenomenon is examined in the light of sublime intelligence from the ultimate perspective [3.145a] and nothing whatsoever is actually found, that fact alone means that it does not truly exist. This, in fact, is the general tradition for these systems,[415] and so it is said:
Whatever can be dismantled or mentally dissected such that the mind no longer entertains a concept— such as a vase or water—exists on the relative level...[416]
And generally speaking, as soon as a given phenomenon is accepted to be relative, it must be accepted that it does not truly exist; this is in fact the tradition of all who profess a Buddhist system of philosophy. And in a source of the Followers of the Sūtras, we read:
Due to this, in any way that something is imputed, it does not exist in the ultimate sense.[417]
There are a great number of such scriptural citations explaining that exclusionary mental determinants have no true existence.[418]

To say nothing of the lower philosophical systems, even the Mind Only school of the Mahāyāna approach holds that, according to its own tradition, both aspects of the lack of identity are realized. But if this is evaluated with the reasoning of the Middle Way, the two aspects of the lack of identity have not yet been brought to consummation since there remains a rudimentary sense of identity in phenomena because consciousness per se, devoid of the dualism of perceived objects and perceiving subject, is held to be ultimate. Nevertheless, the obvious and subtle aspects of identity in the individual and the more obvious aspect of identity in phenomena have been eliminated.
In particular, those Mind Only proponents who hold sense data to be valid,[419] even though they accept that objects in the external world do not exist, also accept sensory appearances to be mind, and so do not accept the emptiness of both perceived objects and perceiving subject. Therefore, they accept the lack of identity in the individual in a completely perfect way, but their way of establishing emptiness on the internal level has not been fully developed. This is because even though they accept that any identity that is entirely imputed does not exist, they do not establish the identity that is imputed to be a perceiving agent does not exist.[420]

In the Middle Way school, there are many traditions of individual masters, such as Asaṅga and his brother,[421] for lines of reasoning that bring one to a definitive conclusion concerning the lack of identity in phenomena. However, the tradition associated with the Exalted One, Nāgārjuna, uses five—four that investigate, respectively, the essence, the cause, the result, and both the latter, and a fifth that is the reasoning concerning interdependent connection. I have explained earlier in this work[422] the way in which these lines of reasoning usher in the state of timeless awareness in which emptiness and the process of interdependent connection are integrated.
Candrakīrti discusses two distinct methods that have been developed for coming to a definitive conclusion concerning the lack of identity in phenomena. He states:
If no object of knowledge exists, the negation of consciousness is ensured;
at the outset [the Buddha] negated objects of knowledge.[423]
Accordingly, one method is to begin by negating the objective pole of consciousness, following which the evidence that perceived objects do not exist negates the subjective pole of consciousness. On the other hand, as is said:
Whatever is the seeing of the one is the seeing of everything.[424]
This, the other method, is one of coming to a definitive conclusion that a given single relative phenomenon is empty in and of itself, so that by the very same reasoning one comes to a definitive conclusion that as many objects of knowledge as there are—subsumed within the two levels of truth—are all empty in and of themselves of any finite essence.
This process of coming to a definitive conclusion is from the point of view of someone progressing from a purely mundane path to embarking on the path of the Middle Way, without having been conditioned by any other philosophical system, Buddhist or otherwise. It does not apply to other cases because those who have already become involved in other systems of thought may have reached a definitive conclusion that coarser objects in the external world do not truly exist, [3.146a] but due to the conditioning of their belief systems, the reasoning they employ cannot be reassigned to some other specific situation.[425]

As just mentioned, even among non-Buddhists there is realization on a more obvious level of the lack of identity in phenomena, as well as some degree of virtuous conduct. So the real distinction between non-Buddhists and Buddhists must be made on the basis of whether or not there is acceptance of identity in the individual because the lack of identity in the individual constitutes the unique and extraordinary feature for all those who profess some system of Buddhist philosophy.
In this regard, identity in the individual has two expressions: a more obvious expression as imputed by belief systems, and a more subtle one that is imputed by an instinctual sense of fixated perception. What is called the “self” is that which is the object misconstrued by this instinctual fixation—that is, belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates. If one has not realized that this “self” is empty in and of itself of any finite essence, one is
incapable of completely realizing the lack of identity in phenomena. And so if one has not completely realized the lack of identity in the individual, one cannot have realized the lack of identity in phenomena.[426]

In essence, what is known as the “self” of the individual is something that all ordinary beings, even down to animals, are naturally born with. It is simply this conceit of thinking “I,” which is the object of fixation for an instinctual sense of “I” and “mine.” According to the commentary to the Four Hundred Verses:
In this regard, what is called the “self” is what is imputed on the basis of the mind-body aggregates...,[427] In this regard, what is called “identity” is that which would naturally be the case in things such that in its essence it did not rely on any other factor.[428] [3.146b]
This, indeed, cannot be found to exist in the ultimate sense, as it is presumed to by holders of extreme views, as something permanent, unitary, and autonomous. However, just because this perception is capable of functioning on the conventional level, it is not the case that this does not exist simply as an imputation. This is because such thoughts as “given that I am following the path to liberation, this is, in fact, that path to liberation”[429] or “my path to liberation,” and various other conventions of perceiving what is “mine,” are well known in the world and pose no problem.[430] As Entrance to the Middle Way states:
Just as the Buddha, although free of any belief in the reality of the transitory aggregates, taught in terms of “I” and “mine,”
similarly, even though things[431] have no independent nature, they are taught as “existing” in a purely provisional sense.[432]

While this can be established as a convention, it cannot be found to exist in the ultimate sense, and so must be negated through reasoning. All emotionally afflicted views and all afflictive mental states (such as attachment and so forth) derive from overt fixation on “I” and “mine” with respect to this “self.” The Detailed Commentary on Valid Cognition states:
If there is an existent self, there is a sense of “other.”
From self and other come attachment and aversion.
All flaws derive
from a complete involvement with these.[433]
And as Entrance to the Middle Way explains:
Once there is first fixation on the identity of “I,” attachment develops to things that are “mine.”...[434] ... Having used their intelligence to see that afflictive mental states and flaws all, without exception, derive from belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates, and having understood that the self is the object of that belief, advanced spiritual practitioners negate the self.[435]

The significance of emptiness, and the conventional terms used concerning this, are found nowhere other than in the Middle Way school. And so,
given a distinction that is to be made—between a general way in which realization takes place and a consummate degree of this— [3.147a] those who follow all four systems of Buddhist philosophy realize at least the lack of identity in the individual. For if this lack of identity in the individual is presented in a complete way in the source texts of the Particularist school, it goes without saying that the Followers of the Sūtras also accept this.[436]
Therefore, through gaining familiarity with the lack of identity in the individual as definitively presented in the source texts of the Particularists and Followers of the Sūtras, one comes to experience this lack directly. And through becoming familiar with that experience, one becomes capable of making fully evident the state of nirvāṇa (in the sense that the potential for fixated perception of individual selfhood has been eliminated).
However, these systems accept that the two aspects of the lack of identity[437] are substantial things because they accept these to be ultimately true (based on the reasoning that they are capable of performing functions in the ultimate sense). As for the bases on which they characterize these things, with the negation of any agent above and beyond the internal factors[438] (as the specific case in point), they specify either of two things that are irreducible.[439] And with the negation of any materially existent thing above and beyond objects in the external world (as the specific case in point), they specify substantial things that are irreducible particles of matter.[440]
While it is axiomatic that those of the Middle Way school have realization of the foregoing to a consummate degree, even those of the Mind Only school have a similar degree of realization.[441]

Generally speaking, the object that serves, as the frame of reference for concepts that involve the belief in a self consists of the five mind-body
aggregates that are subsumed within one's ongoing experience. These constitute the objective pole that expresses itself in the way that the mind perceives, believing in the identity of “I” while focusing on that object. It is for this reason that the idea of believing in a self functions at all times with respect to any of the five aggregates subsumed within one's ongoing experience.[442] In all kinds of other situations, there are thoughts of what pertains to the self—“This is my friend, my family, my house, my land,” and so forth; because if someone else causes harm to any of these, [3.147b] there is the thought, “So-and-so has harmed me.” Nevertheless, the objective pole in the way that the mind perceives—that on which the thought fixates —is nonsubstantial and an abstract concept.
Forget about identity in the individual not existing in light of reasoning that investigates from the ultimate perspective; identity in the individual does not even exist in light of reasoning that investigates from the conventional perspective! An individual, a person, is held to exist only to be in accord with what is commonly accepted in the world, taking things at face value without examining them or inquiring further. But this is not under any circumstances existent in the sense of being a material and substantial thing. Therefore, while this is not existent on either of the two levels of truth, it is accepted to “exist” as something imputed merely on the level of what is relatively valid.[443]

In negating the object of that, the Buddha spoke, for example, of some twelve kinds of reasoning that negate in a general way the objects of belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates. These, however, must be learned from other sources. As for the specific negation of the objects of the twenty aspects of belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates, in general the transcendent and accomplished conqueror[444] spoke in the sūtras about the “twenty beliefs in the reality of the perishable aggregates” as follows: belief concerning any one of the five aggregates (making five);[445] belief that any one of the five aggregates is a possession of the self, by way of being partnered with it, or a secondary attribute (making ten); belief that the self serves as the support, with any one of the five aggregates being supported by it (making fifteen); and belief that any one of the five aggregates serves as the support, with the self being supported by it (making twenty). As is said in Letter to a Friend:
“Forms,” it is said, “are not the self”
Nor does the self possess forms, nor do forms depend on the self,
nor does the self depend on forms.
In a similar fashion, understand that the four remaining aggregates are empty.[446]

So in the case of these twenty alternatives, to prove the nonexistence of a self [3.148a], the master Nāgārjuna and his heirs use the reasoning of the chariot and so forth to negate identity in the individual, as was discussed previously.[447] To describe the form this takes clearly, it is as stated in the first version of Stages of Meditation by Kamalaśīla:
The individual is not thought of as something aside from the mind-body aggregates, or the components of ordinary perception, or the sense fields. The individual is also not the essence of the aggregates and so forth. This is because the aggregates and so forth are, in essence, impermanent and manifold, and because the individual is imputed by others to be, in essence, permanent and unitary.
It is not suitable for that (or, alternatively, an individual that cannot be described[448]) to be an existent thing because there is no other form it could take as an existent thing.

Therefore, it is thus: one should investigate the fact that what is called “I” and “mine” in the world[449] is confusion, pure and simple.[450]
This identity is a fixated concept of selfhood based on the conceit of thinking in terms of “I,” imputed with respect to the aggregates that perpetuate one's body. If it could truly be found to exist, would it be identical to, or separate from, the aggregates of forms and so forth? One might suppose it would be identical, but this is not the case, because their characteristics are not in harmony. The aggregates are impermanent, compounded of manifold factors, and subject to external influences, while the self, it is presumed, would be something permanent, unitary, and autonomous.
In this regard, it is not the case for the following reasons:
(a) because the aggregates can be determined through reasoning to be impermanent and conditioned, while the self is supposedly provable through some experience of one's taking it to be permanent, such as assuming that what one recognizes it as now is what one perceived it to be previously;
(b) because the aggregates can be determined through reasoning to be manifold groups of forms, sensations, and so forth, while the self is supposedly provable through some experience of one's taking it to be unitary, such as assuming, “I endure as a single entity”; and
(c) because the aggregates can be determined through reasoning to be subject to external influences such as origination and disintegration, while the self is supposedly provable through some experience of one's taking it to be autonomous, of the inward sense of “I.” [3.148b]
One might suppose that it can be determined to be separate from the aggregates, but this is not the case:
(a) because the fixated concept of selfhood could not function with respect to anything other than the aggregates; and
(b) because it would thus be deprived of the characteristics of the aggregates and so be nonsubstantial and, if it were therefore nonsubstantial, this would contradict its being capable of performing functions.[451]

On this note, the Source Verses on Sublime Intelligence state:
If the self were the aggregates,
it would be subject to origination and disintegration.
If it were other than the aggregates,
it would lack the characteristics of the aggregates.[452]
In addition, substantial things amount to just these five aggregates— forms, sensations, perceptions, formative factors, and aspects of consciousness; one cannot directly detect in the slightest a self that is separate from these. Because the vision and the other sense faculties are the subjective perceivers of the external components of the sense fields (visual forms and so forth) as their objects, and because even reflexive consciousness[453] is the subjective perceiver of consciousness as its object, it is not logical that any of these be the self. Because the nature and effects of such an identity—not subsumed within the aggregates—would be unable to be perceived, there is no line of reasoning that can support there being such, and it cannot even be provable through valid inference.[454]
One might suppose that this mental attitude of thinking in terms of “I” is a valid state of subjectively perceiving in terms of a self as its object. But
since this is just a concept that embodies an overt form of fixation, it does not constitute direct experience, and because it cannot be supported by any valid line of reasoning whatsoever, it also does not constitute valid inference.[455] Rather, it amounts to nothing more than the conceit of thinking in terms of “I” without any real reason for doing so, due to the influence of a familiarization process that has extended throughout beginningless time, similar to the case of a rope's being mistaken for a snake.

Therefore, given that the self and the individual are imputed on the basis of what is merely the collection of the mind-body aggregates, if they are examined with authentic sublime intelligence, no substantial thing that is an identity can be found. In the sūtras it is stated:
O monks, any spiritual practitioners or brahmins[456] whose belief is one of thinking in terms of “self” [3.149a] are all focusing solely on the five aggregates that perpetuate saṃsāra. That being the case, all fixated perception of a self is solely with respect to the lack of such identity.[457]
And:
Thus, just as the name “chariot”
is given to an assemblage of parts,
similarly on the basis of the mind-body aggregates,
there is the relative term “ordinary being.”[458]
If such investigation negates there being any “I” that can be found to exist by its very nature, this also negates anything “mine” that can be found to exist by its very nature. This is similar to the fact that since one cannot conceive of the child of a barren woman, one also cannot conceive of that child’s having its own eyes and so forth. In the Source Verses on Sublime Intelligence, we read the following:
If the “I” itself is not existent, how could “mine” exist?[459]
And in Entrance to the Middle Way:
Because there are not actions without agents, there is, therefore, no “mine” that exists without “I.”
And, therefore, seeing “I” and “mine” to be empty, advanced spiritual practitioners gain total freedom.[460]

In the regent Maitreya's source Distinguishing Center and Limit, there is discussion of some ten ways of believing in identity. The text states that identity in the individual can be (1) misperceived as something unitary; (1) believed to be the cause that gives rise to all other things; (3) believed to be an agent of experience that appreciates sense objects; (4) believed to be a creator; (5) believed to have control over sense objects; (6) believed to be permanent; believed to be the basis (that is, the support) for (7) deeply ingrained afflictive states or (8) the totally refined state;[461] (9) believed to be a spiritual practitioner; or (10) believed to be that which is not free and then free.[462]
Given these beliefs, the text speaks of the ten ways of becoming learned as their remedies:[463]
(1) The remedy to the first belief is to become learned about the mind-body aggregates; because these are by their nature collections of myriad factors, [3.149b] this serves as a remedy to the belief in something unitary.
(1) To become learned about the components of ordinary perception[464] serves as the remedy to the second belief; given that the significance of these components lies in their being causes, to become learned about these eighteen components becomes the remedy to believing in a self as being a cause.[465]
(3) One's becoming learned about the sense fields serves as the remedy to the third belief; there is no existent self as that which enjoys sense objects because the process of appreciating sense objects is due to the interdependent connection between the twelve constituents of the sense fields.[466]
(4) To become learned about interdependent connection serves as the remedy for the fourth belief; things are not created by a self because they are the manifestation of what is simply the interdependent connection between causes and conditions.

<d e="2">
(5) To become learned about what is or is not in accord with the nature
of things serves as a remedy to the fifth belief; things are not controlled by a self in any way whatsoever because they proceed from a process of harmonious cause and effect.[467]
(6) To become learned about the faculties becomes the remedy to the sixth belief; there is no individual as the governing condition[468] because the twenty-two faculties serve as the supports that govern our experience.[469]
(7) To become learned about time serves as the remedy to the seventh belief; there is no permanent self because the three phases of linear time ensure that things are subject to origination and cessation.
(8) To become learned about the Four Truths acts as the remedy to the eighth belief; there is no identity in the individual that is the basis for either deeply ingrained afflictive states or the totally refined state because the first two truths constitute the basis for deeply ingrained afflictive states, while the latter two constitute the basis for the totally refined state.
(9) To become learned about spiritual approaches serves as the remedy to the ninth belief.[470]
(10) To become learned about what is conditioned and unconditioned serves as the remedy to the tenth belief.[471]
Given that there are a great many ways of reasoning such as the foregoing, one should learn about these from the traditions of the scriptural sources.[472]

Given that the two aspects of lack of identity in the individual and in phenomena are distinct aspects that are identical in essence, the reasoning behind this is as follows: Because all visible and audible phenomena[473] are such that they lack identity, from the point of view of their essence, there cannot be the slightest division whatsoever. By way of example, a given phenomenon as a basis for specific features—a vase, say—may not be something that can actually be fixated on as a substantial thing, but under the circumstances (from the point of view of its being merely something imputed), it can be identified as a basis for specific features. Something such as a vase, then, does not ever have an “I” or “self”; this is the lack of identity in an individual. And the vase cannot be found to truly exist in the slightest; this is the lack of identity in a phenomenon. This is because there is, in essence, no distinction to be made between the fact that no identity can be found in this and the fact that no true existence can be found. Therefore, all phenomena lack any identity as an individual and lack any identity as a phenomenon. Nevertheless, from the point of view of distinguishing an “I” or self as the factor to be negated, there is the lack of identity in the individual, while from the point of view of distinguishing true existence as the factor to be negated, there is the lack of identity in phenomena. These are assigned as this vis-à-vis that from the perspective of distinguishing the factors to be negated; so the division is due to there being aspects.

One might wonder, “If the two aspects of lack of identity are in essence inseparable, what is the point in analyzing two aspects?” The reasoning is as follows: The Victorious One[474] spoke of the lack of identity in the individual in order to care for those of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha types in the Hīnayāna approach, and of the lack of identity in phenomena in order to care for those of the bodhisattva type in the Mahāyāna approach. [3.150b] In this regard, it was definitely necessary to teach the lack of identity in the individual for those of the Hīnayāna type, for if this were not taught, they could not become free of saṃsāra. But he taught only the lack of identity in the individual for them because they are not suitable recipients to be
taught the lack of identity in phenomena in addition, and so there would have been no point even if he had taught this. But for those of the Mahāyāna type, he taught the lack of identity in phenomena because of the necessity of their attaining omniscience.

The actual things to be negated that are the objects in the case of these two aspects of lack of identity cannot possibly be objects that can be known. It is impossible for an identity in the individual to exist as something permanent, unitary, and autonomous, and in the case of any visible or audible phenomenon whatsoever, it is likewise impossible for there to be a single phenomenon that can be found to exist by its very nature, or that can be found to truly exist.
Nevertheless, since the mind that is the subjective perceiver is confused, it fixates on the one and the other, which gives us the factors to be negated with respect to the two aspects of lack of identity. Because these are erroneous notions of taking what does not exist to exist, they are done away with. Therefore, since the factors to be negated cannot possibly be objects, there is nothing to be eliminated, and so it is the elimination of such erroneous notions (as what is to be negated in the subjective perceiver) that is explained as “negating identity.” If the factors to be negated could be found to actually be objects, one would be unable to eliminate them, no matter how hard one tried! No one at all can negate anything that actually exists as such, just as no one at all can confirm anything that does not actually exist as such.

Generally speaking, the special attitude that derives from inferential knowledge based on reasoning is the primary kind of valid cognition that ascertains the ultimate level of truth.[475] In this regard, there are many detailed analyses that rely on lines of reasoning. If one summarizes these, however, all of them are definitely and solely proofs based on negation, which negate that what is to be negated is something true; according to the criteria employed by logicians, therefore, any proof based on affirmation is impossible. To give an example, the statement “X is like an illusion because it is interdependently connected” presents the appearance of being an explicit proof of affirmation; but it does not lead one to any certainty concerning what is ultimately the case, and to the extent that anything is affirmed, it is that X is empty of any true existence.[476]
Proofs of negation are of two kinds—due to either a failure to observe something supportive[477] or an observation of something contradictory.[478] The proof of interdependent connection belongs to the latter type, the others to the former.[479]

The key point of all reasoning that investigates what is ultimately so
is investigation that identifies a basis for attributes and then seeks out
that which does not contradict its essential quality and that which contradicts its particular attributes.

while the negation of production in any of four ways negates particular attributes.

The key point to all reasoning that investigates what is ultimately the case is as follows: First one identifies some basis for attributes,[480] whatever it might be under the circumstances, and then undertakes to seek out that which does not contradict it or its essential quality,[481] and to seek out that which contradicts it or its particular attributes.
To give an example, if one explains, “The characteristics, or essential quality, of a vase is that it has a roundish body and a flattened base and is capable of performing the function of containing water,”[482] one then must investigate such issues as the following: “Then it must follow that the mouth of the vase is its roundish body, because of its being the vase.”
Therefore, from among these lines of reasoning, those that are foremost in being capable of bringing one to a definitive conclusion that both objects on the external level and consciousness on the internal level do not truly exist are two—that of freedom from being unitary or manifold[483] negates any finite essence [3.151b] and that of the negation of production in any of four ways[484] negates particular attributes. The many other variations on lines of reasoning that are explained in the Middle Way sources are simply secondary to these.
The root, so to speak, of all of these lines of reasoning is found in the homage to the Middle Way by the lord protector Nāgārjuna:
... revealing that which occurs in interdependent connection, without cessation, without origin, without being denied, without being affirmed, without coming, without going,[485]
without ultimate distinctness, and without ultimate identity, and revealing the thorough subsiding of elaborations to be peace.
In accord with this citation, there are four basic lines of reasoning:
(1) The subjects under discussion—external and internal things—are without cessation in the final analysis or duration in the interim because they are initially unborn.
(2) The subjects under discussion—external and internal things—cannot be found to be separate things because they are not identical.
(3) The subjects under discussion—external and internal things—do not come, because they cannot be found to have gone.
(4) The subjects under discussion—external and internal things—cannot be denied because they cannot be affirmed.
These four models are the basic lines of unsurpassable reasoning.

Concerning the way in which one comes to a definitive conclusion by investigating things with such reasoning, those who follow the Autonomist system of the Middle Way school begin by proving that all substantial things do not truly exist. Following this, they understand that the concepts of fixating on that lack of true existence are factors to be eliminated, and so they come to a decision, and so prove, that the lack of true existence, or emptiness, is itself emptiness. The sublime intelligence that thus dispels both extremes—of existence and nonexistence—is not the consummate view since it still involves concepts. [3.152a]
While Consequentialists negate the multitudes of conceptual elaborations with many variant forms of reasoning, they do not try to prove a freedom from elaboration, since to do so would constitute an incurable poison.[486]
The meaning of the foregoing points has been discussed previously to a small extent.[487]

From among the proponents of the philosophical systems of the Middle Way, the tradition of those who are Middle Way Yogic Practitioners[488] is adorned with many secret key points that are special and extraordinary. As to the way in which they come to a definitive conclusion about their view by studying teachings and contemplating, as the great regent[489] states:
Once they are intelligently aware that there is nothing other than mind,
they then realize that mind is also nonexistent.
When those with intelligence are aware that these two are nonexistent,
they dwell in the basic space of phenomena that is unencumbered with these.[490]
In accord with this citation, they begin by coming to a decision concerning all phenomena—that these cannot be found to exist as anything other than, or apart from, mind alone. On account of that proof, the objective pole of experience is found to lack any independent nature. Having then come to a decision that the subjective pole also lacks any independent nature, they come to a definitive conclusion concerning the basic space of phenomena—empty of both the objective and subjective poles, flawless and utterly lucid by nature, endowed with the seven vajra properties.[491]

What is referred to as “suchness itself” or “the very heart of attaining the state of bliss,”[492] is that which permeates and is present in ordinary beings, in buddhas—in all phenomena—in a state of evenness. This is present in ordinary beings in the manner of what lies at their very heart and in buddhas in the manner of being fully evident, [3.152b] and so is termed “the very heart of buddhahood” because in essence it undergoes no change.[493] Yet it in no way resembles some permanent, unitary, and autonomous identity of an individual since it constitutes a freedom from all limits imposed by elaboration. While there can be no division into a duality of saṃsāra versus nirvāṇa within its very essence, it can be classified into three phases with respect to context.[494] It is freed from being merely the view of emptiness (that of lack of identity in the individual), primordially ensured as what is uniquely and ultimately true. And it is freed from being either manifest or nonmanifest, substantial or nonsubstantial; it is truly unconditioned— what is termed “unconditioned ultimate truth.” Since this ultimacy is said to transcend even interdependent connection, the ultimate is not classified as interdependently connected.

The fact that this mode of being is difficult to fathom is attested to in the commentary to the Highest Continuum:
To summarize, these four kinds of individuals are considered to lack the vision to behold the very heart of attaining the state of suchness”[495] “What are these four kinds?” you ask. They are ordinary mortal beings, śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas who have newly embarked on their spiritual approach. [3.153a] This is as is said:[496]
O transcendent and accomplished conqueror, the very heart of attaining the state of suchness is not within the realm of experience of those who have fallen into the belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates, or those who have overt desire for[497] what is mistaken, or those whose minds stray completely from emptiness.[498]
As the foregoing citation indicates, not only we who remain at the level of ordinary mortal beings, but even śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas who have newly embarked on their spiritual approach (who are beginning practitioners on the path of accumulation[499]) do not have mastery of the view of the true nature of reality that is the very heart of attaining the state of bliss. Given that this fact has been clearly expressed by the Lord of Sages, the Lord Regent,[500] and others, this is not an object to be evaluated by the conventional methods and reasoning of intellectuals, such as some kind of valid cognition that is arrived at on the basis of the power of the thing itself,[501] or some inferential knowledge based on reasoning. This is because this way in which things truly abide is beyond the domain of language and conceptual thought.

This being so, with the exception of buddhas and spiritually exalted bodhisattvas,[502] it is difficult for the minds of others to embrace this mode that lies at the very heart of things, in the true sense of what the term implies. And since this seems contradictory within the framework of language and concept,[503] in the perceptions of half-baked intellectuals who in these times are renowned as supposed “Middle Way proponents”—whose understanding and personal merit are limited and who are lacking in any truly profound intelligence—as profound as this way in which things truly abide may be, to that extent they simply use it as a basis for their unfounded suppositions and denials, thus subverting the four reliances and turning this into a topic of controversy. Therefore, I will not elaborate here on the secret key points of this traditions philosophical system; rather, if one wishes to gain understanding of these points, one should learn them from the scriptural sources of the great spiritual traditions of India and Tibet.

Two masters—Nāgārjuna and Asaṅga—were great spiritual guides who unquestionably dwelled on the level of the spiritually advanced, who adorned this human world, and whose coming was indisputably prophesied by the Victorious One. Although there is no question of any hierarchy of higher or lower between their enlightened intentions, the fact that there may seem to be one is due solely to one's lack of good fortune and to one's highly restricted intelligence.[504]
That being the case, once one has understood the distinct approaches found in the sources of the two masters who codified these mainstream traditions, if one can integrate these through realizing that the enlightened intent of both is, in the final analysis, one and the same—the meaning of the Middle Way—one is freed from the many flaws of misinterpreted suppositions or denials. One becomes endowed with the flawless vision of the view concerning all sūtras and tantras. Understanding these two approaches— the one more short-term, the other more ultimate; the one more obvious and externally oriented, the other more subtle and internally oriented; the one putting an end to conceptual elaboration, the other focusing on the ultimate point of meditation[505]—one comes to realize the unerring intent of buddhahood, free of the conceptual imputations found in the minds of ordinary mortal beings, with one's view of both the sūtras and the tantras being unaffected by any flaw of seeing supposed contradictions therein.

In the mantra approach, the interpretation of unqualified emptiness is that the subjective aspect is distinguished as the skillful factor of bliss,
but that there is no difference in the objective aspect as freedom from elaboration.
For the interpretation of qualified emptiness, even the objective aspect is not merely freedom from elaboration;
rather, it is posited to be endowed with the most sublime of manifestations, comparable to divination with a mirror.
Some say that other than the mere freedom from elaboration, because of the skillful methods involved,
the difference is like that between an ordinary fire and one of sandalwood.

One might wonder, “In which interpretation of the Middle Way is the view of the secret mantra approach to be found?” In this regard, individual masters have advanced many positions that incline to their own personal inclinations. Nevertheless, the explicit message of this approach is entirely in accord with the final cycle of the Buddhas teachings and that is by and large what is taught in the authoritative source texts from the land of spiritually advanced beings.[507] [3.154a] It was only in Tibet that the interpretations of the Middle Way renowned as “unqualified emptiness” and “qualified emptiness” arose as distinct positions.
Those who follow the interpretation of unqualified emptiness posit that the subjective aspect is to be taken as superior[508] due to the skillful influence of supreme bliss. With respect to the objective aspect of emptiness as the freedom from elaboration, they maintain that there is no distinction between the approach of mantra and that of the transcendent perfections.[509]
Those who follow the interpretation of qualified emptiness agree with the foregoing concerning the subjective aspect. With respect to the objective aspect of emptiness, however, they posit that this is not merely a freedom from elaboration, but emptiness endowed with the most sublime of manifestations, transcending even the most subtle subatomic structure yet comparable to the visions that occur through the process of divination with a mirror.[510]
And there are some who say that, while the approaches of mantra and the transcendent perfections are in accord simply concerning the essence of emptiness as a freedom from elaboration, the mantra approach is superior as to the way in which realization takes place, because of the special feature of the skillful means it entails. Speaking generally, the Sakya school and others categorize their view on the basis of both specific phenomena and their true nature; that is, from the point of view of the true nature of phenomena free of elaboration, there is no difference between the approach of mantra and that of the transcendent perfections, but there is a distinction in the mantra approach of the kāyas and timeless awareness as specific phenomena. The former point is the basis for the enlightened intent of the venerable Sakya Paṇḍita,[511] and he had no objection to the latter.[512]

Since origination and cessation are eliminated from that inseparable unity of supreme and unchanging bliss and emptiness as freedom from elaborations, it is profound and lucid. This unity, endowed with four characteristics[513] is the basis for what is characterized as the Middle Way in the mantra approach. There are four special attributes that are associated with it:
(1) the function of the central channel,[514] that is, the path of skillful methods such as that of focusing intently on the avadhūti;[515]
(2) other skillful methods to elicit the experience of emptiness, such as the techniques of instantaneous or gradual dissolution;[516] [3.154b]
(3) the influence exerted by establishing a connection, within the context of the ground of being—the way in which things truly abide—between the ground for refinement and the factors that bring refinement;[517] and
(4) the accomplishment of the consummate kāya of primordial unity that is the specific manifestation.
These four are posited by the vajra of enlightened speech, the sixth bearer of the crown marked with light—the scholar from the north, Jamyang Chökyi Nangwa.[518]

Just as washing a lump of coal will never make it a conch shell,[519] if the true nature of buddhahood were not present as the reality that is the fundamentally unconditioned way that things truly abide, it would be impossible for it to become so through a process of investigation involving scriptural authority and reasoning, or through viewing it as such through a process of conceptual meditation.
On the basis of the three kinds of sublime intelligence,[520] one realizes emptiness in direct experience—not allowing the significance of the utter lucidity of emptiness to remain merely an object of intellectual understanding. At that point timeless awareness, which as a consequence is undeluded concerning the significance of cause and effect, is spontaneously ensured, so that its radiance arises as the unceasing process of interdependent connection. As this does not in any way deviate from the realization, in one’s direct experience, of its fundamentally unconditioned and unborn nature, there is the primordial unity of skillful method and sublime intelligence. This is termed the “transcendent perfection of sublime intelligence” (prajñāpāramitā) or the “supreme seal” (mahāmudrā), which is the consummate meaningful state to be realized according to the sūtras and tantras.

The impact of study and contemplation is that of arousing an uncontrived faith

The excellent speech of the buddhas serves as one's advisor, so that one feels a growing sense of freedom in one's ongoing experience. [3.155a]

that dramatically reorient an ordinary persons mind.

Having studied teachings in the foregoing way, without any prejudice, and having contemplated their meaning precisely through reasoning, one awakens in one's ongoing experience a sublime intelligence born of such study and contemplation. The impact of this is one of arousing faith, uncontrived yet informed and without any sectarian bias, in the general teachings of the victorious ones (both the Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna approaches) and in the special spiritual mentors who uphold these teachings.
Without falling into some extreme of inflexible prejudicial thinking or zealous adherence to one's own personal belief system or dogma, one conducts oneself in a forthright manner, behaving precisely with respect to the process of karmic causality, without confusing moral issues of what to accept or reject.[522] The excellent speech of the victorious ones—that is, all the sūtras and tantras—serves as one's advisor, as one does not let these teachings remain mere words but applies them to one's experience, feeling a growing sense of freedom. This is the impact that getting to the very root of hearing and contemplating teachings has on one.
This being the case, one will not be able to hear and contemplate teachings properly without relying on a deliberate and precise contemplation of such topics as one's hard-won state of opportunities and endowments. Even if one is able to do so, one's experience will not be affected in an ongoing way.
So one should carefully contemplate the four contemplations that reorient the mind, which are methods found in the tradition of pith instructions that dramatically reorient an ordinary individuals mind.[523]

The eight opportunities are provided [3.155b] when one is free of the eight states devoid of such opportunity. Of these eight states, four are states within the human realm that are devoid of opportunity:
(1) that of people in “border regions,” that is, places in which the four branches of the spiritual community are not present;[524]
(2) that of people whose faculties are incomplete, due to mental or physical impairment, deafness, and so forth;[525]
(3) that of those with erroneous opinions, who hold that there is no continuity from previous to future lifetimes, or consequences to one's actions, or who deny the validity of the Three Jewels; and
(4) that of those in worlds in which buddhas have not appeared and the teachings of the victorious ones are not present.
The four nonhuman states devoid of opportunity are (5)-(7) the three lower states of rebirth and (8) that of the long-lived gods. These long-lived gods are explained in Letter to a Friend to be those of both the state devoid of perception and the realm of formlessness;[526] of these, the former are found in one region of the state of the Mahāphala gods (associated with the fourth degree of meditative stability),[527] as though in a hermitage outside a populated area,[528] while the latter are ordinary mortal beings who have been reborn in the realm of formlessness.[529] The Account of the Eight States Devoid of Opportunity explains the long-lived gods to be those gods of the desire realm, who are constantly distracted by activities driven by their desires.[530]
Of the ten endowments, five derive from one's own situation:
To be a human being, to be reborn in a central region, to have all one's faculties intact,
not to have made wrong ethical choices, and to have faith in a spiritual foundation.[531]

“To be reborn in a central region” means to be reborn where the four branches of the spiritual community are active. “To have all one's faculties intact” means that one is not physically or mentally handicapped, and one's limbs, sight, hearing, and so forth, are complete. “Not to have made wrong ethical choices” means that one has not committed, or caused anyone to commit, any of the acts that bring immediate consequences at death.[532] “To have faith in a spiritual foundation” means to have faith in the ethical codes of the sacred dharma, as the foundation that gives rise to all positive qualities, whether mundane or transcendent; here the term “ethical codes” refers to any and all of the Three Repositories.[533] These five factors are called “endowments that derive from one's own situation” because they are circumstances supporting spiritual practice that pertain to one's own personal experience.
The five endowments that derive from others are as follows:
The coming of a buddha, the teaching of the sacred dharma, the establishment of a tradition of teachings, the adherence of followers,
and the kindness shown for the sake of others.[534]
“The coming,” or advent, “of a buddha” refers to one who has truly awakened to buddhahood [3.156a] after a process of spiritual development spanning three incalculably long eons. “The teaching of the sacred dharma” refers to the teachings presented by such a buddha or by followers of that buddha who are arhats. “The establishment of a tradition of teachings” refers to the fact that, from the time a buddha awakens to enlightenment and teaches until that buddha passes into nirvāṇa, the practice of the teachings is unimpaired by way of making the ultimate aspect of the teachings fully evident. “The adherence of followers” of the tradition thus established refers to people being aware that the realization of those teachings has the power to make the sacred dharma evident to ordinary beings, and so following those teachings as they were given in accord with such realization.[535] “The kindness shown for the sake of others” refers, for example, to sponsors and patrons donating monastic robes. These five factors are called “endowments that derive from others” because they are circumstances supporting spiritual practice that pertain to the personal experience of others.

Next, one contemplates the great purpose of this state. To have the eight opportunities and ten endowments is called having a “precious human existence” because it is extremely difficult to obtain and once obtained gives one an enormous advantage, for one is then capable of attaining all the limitless states of higher rebirth and the definitive excellence of enlightenment. In Letter to Students we read the following:
The path that is obtained by human beings with great mental fortitude,
and that serves as a support for conveying beings along the path of those gone to bliss, is not obtained by gods, nāgas, demigods, garuḍas, vidyādharas, kiṃnaras, or mahoragas.[536]
Therefore, one contemplates in the following way: “I have obtained, at least for the present, the noble working basis that is the most special one throughout the three realms.[537] If I do not then use this support, which has such a great purpose and which is the cause for higher states of rebirth and the definitive excellence of enlightenment, I will be more grievously deluded than someone who returns empty-handed from the fabled Isle of Jewels”

To contemplate the difficulty of obtaining this support, consider the difficulty from the point of view of the causes of such a rebirth. In general, to obtain any more fortunate state of rebirth requires some degree of sincere and positive action, such as ethical discipline. [3.156b] In particular, to obtain these freedoms and opportunities in their entirety requires a great many fundamentally positive factors: you must lay the foundation with completely pure ethical discipline, support this with such qualities as generosity, and provide momentum with flawless prayers of aspiration. Consider the fact that, if such factors are necessary, it seems that there are very few cases in which such causes are established, from which one can deduce that, as a consequence, the results—more fortunate states of rebirth in general and these freedoms and opportunities in particular—are difficult to obtain.
As for the difficulty from the point of view of the resultant states of rebirth, generally speaking, the Foundation of Scriptural Transmission states that when beings die and pass from lower or higher states of rebirth, those who go on to a lower state of rebirth are comparable to the motes of dust covering the great earth, while those who go on to higher states are only comparable to the few motes that gather on your fingernail.[538] One considers the fact that any merely higher state, when compared to lower states (which bear no resemblance to it) seems to be just within the realm of possibility, while this special state of freedom, even when compared to higher states (which share many common features with it), is exceedingly rare.
As for one contemplating the difficulty of obtaining this state through the use of analogy, Śāntideva points out:
Similar to the case of a turtle whose neck might enter the hole
of a yoke buffeted on a very turbulent ocean,
the state of a human being is said to be very difficult to obtain.[539]
Alternatively, one gains certainty by referring to any number of other analogies, such as that of a star in the daytime or the udumbara flower.[540]

There are three primary considerations in contemplating death and impermanence: the certainty that one must definitely die (due to the proof of death lying in the fact that one has been born); [3.157a] the uncertainty of when death will occur (due to the proof as proved by the fact that people die unpredictably, both young and old); and the fact that when death occurs, only what is spiritual will be of any benefit (as established through scriptural authority). Each of these involves three secondary considerations.
There are three rationales for the fact that one is certain to die:
(1) the Lord of Death[541] is certainly coming for one and no means whatsoever can prevent that;
(2) one's life span cannot be extended, and each moment day and night there are factors that shorten it;
(3) even while one is still living, death can come suddenly, without there
ever being enough time to carry out all of the plans one has, both secular and spiritual.
There are three rationales for the fact that it is unknown when one will die:
(4) the length of one's life in this human world is unpredictable, unlike that in other worlds, which is more or less fixed;[542]
(5) there are a great many conditions that can cause death (diseases inside one's body, negative forces and the elements in the external world, and so forth), so that in just staying alive, one is pointed toward death with no other guarantee;
(6) one's body is fragile, like a bubble on water, and the slightest injury could end one's life.
There are three rationales for the fact that only what is spiritual will be of any benefit, for none of the following will be of any use at death:
(7) even though one might have hundreds or thousands of family members, friends, attendants, or servants, one cannot take a single one of them with one at death;
(8) even one's cherished body, which has been with one all along, must be left behind, like so much earth or stone;
(9) even though one might have incalculable wealth, one cannot take even a single needle with one.
One recalls death by applying these nine rationales.

Given the certainty that one will also die swiftly, one has no chance of remaining in this life, and after death one does not become nothing but must take rebirth. [3.157b] And given that there are only two possible destinies, and no other, one will be reborn in either a more or less favorable state. This process is one that is subject to the external influences of karma, not something over which one has any control, and so one takes rebirth under the impetus of one's positive or negative karma.
Therefore, one contemplates the suffering of lower states of rebirth, thinking, “What would it be like if I were to be reborn in some lower state?” As Nāgārjuna tells us:
Bring to mind what a day would be like in the realms of the hells,
whether exceedingly hot or cold.
Bring to mind as well the tormented spirits who are tortured by hunger and thirst.
Observe and bring to mind the forms of animal life
who are subject to so many sufferings due to their ignorance.
Avoid the causes of these states and engage in the causes for happier ones.
When one hears of the state of human rebirth in Jambudvīpa, difficult to obtain, one should strenuously put an end to the causes of lower states of rebirth.[543]
There are incalculable forms of suffering, foremost among them those of the hot and cold hells.

Again, according to Nāgārjuna:
If one's own fear is aroused by seeing depictions of the hell realms, hearing of them, recalling them, reading of them, or making one's own depictions,
what can be said about those who are actually experiencing the unbearable consequences of their actions?..,[544] ... Whatever pain one would endure in this life by being pierced violently
with three hundred spears for a day
would not even come close to, and could not compare with, the smallest suffering in the hell realms.[545]
Tormented spirits are also subject to many kinds of suffering, due to hunger and thirst and so forth:
Among tormented spirits there is constant and incurable suffering caused by the distress of their unfulfilled desires.
Understand that they undergo unbearable suffering caused by hunger, thirst, cold, heat, fatigue, and fear.[546]
Animals are subject to such suffering as that of the predation of one species on another:
In animal states of rebirth there are various sufferings, [3.158a] such as being slaughtered, bound, beaten, and so forth.
These beings, who have abandoned the virtue that leads to peace, undergo the utterly unbearable pain of preying on one another.[547]
In the foregoing ways, one recalls death and contemplates the sufferings of falling into lower states of rebirth. Thus, one reorients one's mind away from this lifetime and arouses the attitude that one's real concern is for one's future destiny.

Generally speaking, whether you are an ordinary mortal individual or a spiritually advanced being,[548] all positive experiences that carry with them any pleasant sensation—down to even the slightest pleasure caused by a cool breeze for beings reborn in a hell realm—occur due to positive karma reinforced in the past; it is not in accord with the nature of things that happiness be due to negative karma. And all negative experiences that carry with them any unpleasant sensation—down to even the slightest suffering that could occur in the experience of an arhat[549]—occur due to negative karma one has reinforced in the past; for it is not in accord with the nature of things that suffering be due to positive karma. As the Precious Garland states:
All suffering comes from nonvirtue, and so do all lower states of rebirth.
From virtue come all fortunate states of rebirth and the happiness within all those rebirths.[550]
Karma is marked by four characteristics: (1) the certainty of the consequences of one's actions, (2) the greatly magnified results that come about, (3) the fact that one is never subject to the effects of actions one has not committed, and (4) the fact that the effects of those one has committed never expire on their own.
(1) All the various kinds of happiness and suffering derive from the corresponding positive and negative kinds of karma, without the slightest conflation; neither are these causeless, nor are they due to such dissonant causes as primal matter or a powerful creator.[551] [3.158b] Rather, the general states of happiness and suffering come from the general kinds of virtuous and nonvirtuous actions, while myriad specific states of happiness and suffering come about individually from myriad specific actions of the corresponding kinds, without the slightest conflation. The certainty one gains concerning the predictable and ineluctable process of karmic consequences is referred to as the “authentic view” for Buddhists and is extolled as the foundation for all positive qualities.

(2) A great degree of happiness results from a small degree of virtuous karma, while a great degree of suffering results from a small degree of nonvirtuous karma; and so the kind of magnification from cause to effect that takes place on this inner level is not found in the process of causation in the external world.[552] As is said in Didactic Aphorisms:
Due to a small harmful action being committed, something very destructive[553] occurs in the next world.
This brings about great ruination; it is like poison having been ingested.
Due to a small meritorious action being committed, some great happiness is brought about in the next world.
This brings about things of great purpose;
it is like an abundant harvest of grain ripening.[554]
(3) If one has not reinforced the karma that serves as the cause of either happiness or suffering, one will never experience those pleasant or painful effects. In this regard, the Teacher[555] stated that while those who enjoy the fruits of reinforcing positive karma over incalculably long eons do not necessarily need to amass all the causes of those results, they still must amass them to some degree.[556]
(4) The virtuous and nonvirtuous actions one has committed bring about their corresponding effects, wanted and unwanted, respectively. As is stated in the Foundation of Scriptural Transmission:
The effects of actions do not expire on their own, even after a hundreds eons.
When circumstances come together and the time is ripe, their effects occur for ordinary beings.[557]

In this regard, there are certainly three avenues through which one engages in conduct,[558] whether excellent or ignoble. And although it cannot be stated categorically that all positive and negative actions committed
through these three avenues fall entirely within ten kinds of actions, when summarizing broadly and roughly the major ways in which actions are virtuous or nonvirtuous, the Transcendent and Accomplished Conqueror[559] spoke of ten kinds of negative actions and also spoke of ten kinds of positive actions, for he saw that the key points of rejecting the negative actions and instead accomplishing something truly meaningful were subsumed within these ten.[560] As the Treasury of Abhidbarma states:
To summarize in a broad way,
any and all kinds of virtue and nonvirtue
are spoken of as ten kinds of actions.[561]
And in the Detailed Analysis of Scriptural Transmission:
Guarding one's speech, thoroughly controlling one's mind, and not committing any harmful actions physically— by training oneself well in these three kinds of activity, one gains the path taught by the Seer.[562]
These ten kinds of activity are very well known, so I will not explain them here in detail, having already discussed them earlier.[563]

As to the degrees of gravity involved, the main text of Levels[564] speaks of six factors that affect the way in which actions bear weighty consequences. As for the overt mental state, this is one's motivation, which comes from a strong attitude that involves one of the three emotional poisons or their absence.[565] Familiarity with an action is due to one's committing either a virtuous or a nonvirtuous action many times over, with a familiarity born of having engaged in it over a long time. The essential quality of an act is reflected by the fact that, of the seven kinds of physical and verbal actions, the former kinds are of greater gravity than the latter, while in the case of the three kinds of mental actions, the latter are of greater gravity than the former.[566] The focus of the act refers to beneficial or harmful actions committed toward the Buddha, dharma, saṅgha, or your guru, for example. A unilateral commitment to counterproductive factors refers to the fact that one is unilaterally committed to negative actions, and not positive ones, throughout one's lifetime; while the elimination of counterproductive factors [3.159b] refers to one's rejection of negative influences and involvement in positive actions, free of desire and attachment. As Letter to a Friend states:
Actions performed constantly, with strong feeling, without any remedy,
or in which the primary focus is imbued with positive qualities—
these factors contribute to five major kinds of virtuous and nonvirtuous actions.
Therefore, strive to engage in virtuous activity![567]
In this citation, the number five refers to two kinds of primary focus—a focus endowed with enlightened qualities (such as the Three Jewels) and a focus of someone who has benefited one (that is, one's father and mother).
Actions are powerful due to any of four factors—the focus, the intention, the underlying support, and the actual content of an action.

(1) This is a factor because if one commits even a minor beneficial or harmful action, without any strong intention, toward the Three Jewels, or one's guru, or likewise one's parents, the corresponding merit or ignobleness is nonetheless great. In particular, bodhisattvas are very powerful foci for one's virtuous (or nonvirtuous) actions. If someone were, out of anger, to imprison all beings in the ten directions in a dark dungeon, it would still be an action of incalculably greater harm for that person to stand with his or her back turned to a bodhisattva and say, “I won’t look at that villain!” It would be an act of far greater harm to be furious with and feel malice toward a bodhisattva and say something spiteful than to tear down and burn as many stupas as there are grains of sand in the river Ganges. By the same token, it is also said that they are sublime foci for one to reinforce one's spiritual merit.
(2) The sūtra Mound of Precious Gems[568] states that there would be more merit in someone who never loses sight of the intention to gain omniscience casting a single flower with the motivation of bodhicitta than in all beings in the three-thousandfold universe each erecting a stupa as large as Sumeru and paying honor to these in all ways that honor can be paid, for tens of millions of eons.
In this regard, one should also understand that there are other variables, such as one's intention—whether the goal is more sublime or more common, [3.160a] or the focus is on one's own or others’ benefit—or the degree of intensity or weakness of the action, or the length or shortness of the duration of the action. With regard to negative conduct, moreover, the more powerful actions are those that involve intense attitudes of afflictive mental states and that take place over longer periods of time, and among all of these
factors, anger is an extremely powerful one. Entering the Way of a Bodhi-sattva states:
Whatever excellent conduct has been reinforced for a thousand eons—
generosity, honoring of the sugatas, and so forth— can all be destroyed by a single act of anger.[569]
In this regard, it is said that it is extremely grievous to indulge in anger toward someone upholding pure ethics,[570] and even more so toward a bodhisattva.[571]

(3) A ball of iron, although small, will sink to the bottom, but it will float on the surface if fashioned into a large bowl. By analogy, it is said that harmful actions have more or less gravity depending on whether they are committed in an unskillful or skillful manner. In this respect, it is further said that the gravity is lessened when one has the skill to create virtue by using the remedy to harmful actions previously committed—regretting them, resolving not to commit them again, and not hiding the fact that one has committed them. But it is a grievous thing not to do the foregoing, and instead to arrogantly presume that it is skillful to engage deliberately in such actions without regard for the consequences.
In the case of virtuous actions, as well, there are variables that successively bring about considerable changes in their benefits and advantages— the skillfulness of understanding the key points of such actions, the fact that one is upholding vows, and the fact that one is endowed with a significant degree of meditative absorption.
(4) To share the generosity of spiritual teachings in being generous to beings and to honor buddhas with one's spiritual practice are far superior to acts of material generosity and offering. One can understand the other cases on the basis of this illustration.

The foregoing paths of action bring about (1) results due to complete maturation, (2) results consistent with causes, and (3) governing results:
(1) Each of the ten paths of action has three degrees, depending on the three degrees—great, middling, or small—of the three emotional poisons that are their basis. [3.160b] In this regard, the main text of Levels of Realization states that in the case of each of the ten kinds of actions—killing and so forth—a great degree of emotional poison leads to rebirth in hell states, a middling degree to rebirth in preta states, and a small degree to rebirth in
animal states[572] (the sūtra Ten Levels of Realization reverses these results in the cases of the middling and small degrees).[573]
(2) Even though one is reborn from lower states to a human one, there are consequences that follow one. As is said:
Killing brings a shortening of life,[574]
causing harm leads to many threats,
theft causes a loss of wealth, and
behaving in immoral ways produces many enemies.
Speaking lies leads to censure,
divisive speech deprives one of companions,
abusive language means one will hear unpleasant tilings, and
purposeless talk causes one to hear dishonorable words.
Covetous attitudes mean that the hopes in one's mind are dashed,
malicious intent ensures fear, and
dogmatic belief systems lead to wrongheaded opinions.[575]

(3) These are flaws that occur in the external environment. As is said:
Externally, little is impressive and there are many threats, dust storms, bad odors, and uneven ground, poor soil, environmental upheavals, and poor or failed harvests.[576]
As for the relative power of virtuous actions, using the foregoing discussion as a model, the complete maturation is such that virtuous actions of a small, middling, or greater degree lead to rebirth, respectively, as a human, a god of the realm of desire, or a god in the realm of form or formlessness.[577] The results that are consistent with the cause and the governing results apply in the reverse manner to those for nonvirtuous actions.
As for the distinction between those actions that provide momentum and those that bring completion,[578] virtue is the karma that provides momentum for more favorable states of rebirth, while non virtue is the karma that provides momentum for lower states of rebirth. The karma that brings completion is more unpredictable; those in more favorable states of rebirth can still have defects of major and minor parts of the body, incomplete faculties, ugly complexion, shortness of life, many illnesses, poverty, and so forth, which are accounted for by nonvirtuous karma. There are also animals and pretas who possess great wealth, which is accounted for by virtuous karma. Thus, there are four alternatives: in states in which virtue has provided the momentum, there are both situations in which virtue has brought about completion, and nonvirtue has brought about completion, [3.161a] just as in states in which nonvirtue has provided the momentum, there are both situations in which nonvirtue has brought about completion, and virtue has brought about completion.

Of the two lands of karma—that which is certain to be experienced and that which is not—that which is certain to be experienced is action that has been consciously committed and reinforced, while that which is not certain to be experienced is action that has been consciously committed but not reinforced. As for the distinction between committed and reinforced, “committed” means that which is thought of or, even if not thought of, is carried out through physical and verbal action; “reinforced” refers to actions other than those of the ten kinds and so forth that are committed in dreams, while “not reinforced” refers to actions of the ten kinds that are committed in dreams and so forth.
With respect to that which is certain to be experienced, from the point of view of the time frame in which results are experienced, there are three alternatives. “That which is experienced in one's immediate perception” is the result of actions that is experienced in this lifetime. “That which will be experienced upon rebirth” refers to a result that is experienced in the next lifetime. “That which will be experienced in other contexts” refers to what is experienced in the lifetime after that or later.
One should contemplate all the foregoing processes very thoroughly.

While it is patently easy to understand that the nature of lower states of rebirth is one of suffering, there is also no true happiness in higher states, for in general the nature of saṃsāra in its entirety is one of suffering. As the lord protector Maitreya points out:
Just as there is no pleasant odor in filth, there is no real happiness in the five states of ordinary being;[579]
the sufferings of these states are like that of being in constant contact with fire, weapons, or corrosive salt.[580]
Of these sufferings, eight are primary:
(1) Birth is fraught with suffering, birth entails tendencies toward the perpetuation of ignoble states of existence, birth is a context for further suffering, [3.161b] birth provides a context for afflictive mental states, and birth leads to unwanted separation.[581] Given that this is the very nature of birth, it entails these five attendant kinds of suffering.
(2) There are five sufferings attendant on death: the body degenerates, strength wanes, faculties weaken, the enjoyment of sense objects fades, and life itself is completely undermined.
(3) There are five sufferings attendant on falling ill: the body's constitution changes, pain and mental discomfort increase, there is no power to enjoy pleasant sense objects, what is unwanted must be endured,[582] and one comes close to losing one's life.
(4) One contemplates the five sufferings that are attendant on dying. There is separation from four aspects of the richness of living—family, entourage, material wealth, and one's own body—as well as the actual suffering of dying and the intense experience of unwanted sensations.
(5) There are five aspects to the suffering of encountering what is unappealing: there is the pain and mental distress aroused simply by one's encountering those who are like enemies; there is the further terror of punishment and physical injuries inflicted by them; there is the fear of being slandered; there is the fear of dying in a state of anxiety; and there is the fear of being apprehensive that after death one will fall into a lower state of
rebirth due to having flouted what is spiritual.

(6) One contemplates the five aspects to the suffering of being separated from what is appealing: mental anguish is aroused if one is separated from companions, for one is devastated at losing them; one cries aloud in anguish; physical harm is done to one’s body;[583] one's mind is tormented by the longing brought on by memories of former sense pleasures; and one's experiences of enjoyment no longer feel complete.
(7) There are five topics to contemplate concerning the suffering of striving for what one desires and not finding it; these are similar to those in the preceding case of being separated from what is appealing. In essence, this is the suffering of taking up farming but having your crops fail, or going into business but failing to turn a profit, and so forth. [3.162a] This is the suffering of disappointment that comes from seeking and striving for whatever one hopes for, only to fail to attain it.
The foregoing are definitely experienced by all beings subsumed within the four methods of rebirth but are primarily associated with human beings, so much so that some classify them solely as “the sufferings of the human condition.”
(8) In brief, there are five topics involved in contemplating the fact that the five mind-body aggregates that perpetuate saṃsāra are described as “suffering.” Over and over, one contemplates the following topics: (a) that these constitute a context for the suffering in a situation becoming fully manifest,
(b) that they constitute a context for the suffering that takes place on the basis of that situation having become fully manifest, (c) that they constitute a context for overt suffering, (d) that they constitute a context for the suffering of change, and (e) that their nature is one of subliminal suffering.

To elaborate:
(a) Due to these aggregates having been taken up,[584] the sufferings of the rest of one's life are ushered in.
(b) With the aggregates already in place, they serve as the basis for such attendant sufferings as those of aging and falling ill.
(c) and (d) Since these two kinds of suffering are entailed in the perpetuation of ignoble states of existence, they develop accordingly.
(e) The mere fact that the mind-body aggregates, which perpetuate saṃsāra, are ensured means that they do so with a nature that is one of subliminal suffering, because everything that is subliminally conditioned due to the external influences of karma and afflictive mental states from previous lifetimes constitutes suffering on a subliminal level.
If one does not arouse a genuine sense of disenchantment with saṃsāra, whose nature is that of the mind-body aggregates that perpetuate it, one will not arouse an equally genuine attitude of seeking liberation and will also have no real chance of arousing supreme compassion toward the ordinary beings who wander in saṃsāra. Hence, this contemplation is crucial regardless of which approach one embarks upon, Hīnayāna or Mahāyāna.

Letter to a Friend states that six flaws pertain to all beings who are in saṃsāra: nothing is predictable, one can never know satisfaction, bodies are cast off again and again, the relentless continuity of rebirth asserts itself over and over, circumstances change from high to low and back again, [3.161b] and one is on one's own, without real companionship.[585]
If these points are summarized, there are three considerations: (1) there is nothing in saṃsāra upon which one can depend, (1) no matter how much of its happiness one may enjoy, there is no end point at which one will truly be satisfied, and (3) this process has proceeded relentlessly throughout beginningless time.
(1) This has four implications:
(a) It is inappropriate to depend on having attained a body, for bodies are cast off again and again.
(b) It is inappropriate to depend on circumstances being either beneficial or harmful, for one's father could be reborn as one's child, one's mother as one's spouse, one's enemy as one's friend, and so forth, without any predictability.[586]
(c) It is inappropriate to depend on the achievement of any prosperity, for one only falls from a high place to a low one.
(d) It is inappropriate to depend on companionship, for one will go forth[587] unaccompanied.
(2) As one has moved entirely within the cycle of existence, with no evi-
dent starting or ending point, one might have become a powerful master among gods or humans and enjoyed boundless sense pleasures. Nevertheless, this has been like trying to slake your thirst with salt water or scratch an incurable itch, for one has never known the slightest real satisfaction. Thus, one's compulsive urges only increase more and more.
(3) This refers to the relentless process of continuity, that is, the succession of rebirths with no evident end point.

Other sufferings felt by human beings are discussed in Advice for the Multitude:
All the sufferings of lower states, without exception, seem to be the case for human beings, too.
There is intense pain comparable to that of the hells
and poverty like that of denizens in the world of the lord of death.[588]
In this state,[589] there is also the suffering of animals, for the powerful oppress and tyrannize the powerless.
This is like a flowing river.[590]
And in the Four Hundred Verses we read the following:
For the highly placed there is mental suffering, while for the lowly it is born of the body; each and every day, the two kinds of suffering[591] bring destruction in the world.[592]
Furthermore, the minds of demigods are tormented by their envy of the splendor and wealth of the gods, on the basis of which they fight with the gods, only to experience as well the many sufferings of their bodies being hacked and beaten. [3.163a] It is said that even though they are endowed with intelligence, they are obscured by the consequences of their karma and so are incapable of beholding what is true in those circumstances.
Gods in the realm of desire undergo the sufferings of dying and falling from that state, the suffering of becoming demoralized,[593] and such sufferings as being hacked, beaten, killed, driven away, and so forth.[594] Gods in the two higher realms[595] do not have overt suffering but nonetheless are subject to afflictive mental states and are obscured, and so suffer due to dying and falling from those states, having to take ignoble states of rebirth due to their lacking freedom to remain in their states.
To summarize, one contemplates the fact that, regardless of where one is reborn in any state within the three realms, high or low, the process is one of constantly floundering about in a ocean of the three kinds of suffering— overt suffering, the suffering of change, and subliminal suffering. One thus reorients one's mind away from saṃsāra.

Having thus contemplated the shortcomings of saṃsāra, one sees the whole of conditioned existence as being like a pit of fire. If those whose minds are completely consumed by the wish for liberation—which will cause afflictive mental states and suffering to thoroughly subside—were to train in the path of the three higher trainings,[596] they would indeed gain the liberated state of freedom. But although they would not revert from this state to something like the splendor of higher states of rebirth,[597] it nevertheless constitutes a state in which flaws have only partially been removed and positive qualities only partially attained, and so their own benefit is not complete. For this very reason, the benefit they can bring to others amounts to something quite limited. In the final analysis, they are exhorted by buddhas and see that it is only logical that they must embark on the Mahāyāna approach. Given that the awakening attitude, bodhicitta, is the avenue through which one enters that approach, it is once that has awakened in one's ongoing experience that one is considered a Mahāyāna practitioner. [3.163b] Concerning this point, the Cluster of Stems states:
O child of spiritual heritage! Bodhicitta is like the seed of all the Buddhadharma.[598]
In this regard, regardless of what conditions come together, a grain of barley is not suitable to be the cause of rice or any other plant, being the specific cause of its own seedling, while the water and fertilizer and so forth that the grain absorbs are also causes of the barley seedling.[599] In a similar fashion, from among the causes of the “seedling” of buddhahood, bodhicitta is the specific cause (comparable to the seed grain), while the sublime intelligence that realizes emptiness is the specific cause (comparable to water, fertilizer, and so forth) of the three degrees of enlightenment.[600] It is for these reasons that the Highest Continuum says:
Dedication to the sublime approach is the seed, while sublime intelligence
is the mother that gives birth to the buddhas and the dharma.[601]

Thus, it describes dedication to the sublime spiritual approach as being comparable to one's father's seed, while the sublime intelligence that realizes the lack of identity is comparable to one's mother. To extend the analogy, since it is impossible for a Tibetan father to sire a Chinese or Mongolian child, the father is the cause that defines the child’s ethnicity; but since a Tibetan mother can bear children of various ethnicities, she serves as the common cause.[602]
As Nāgārjuna says in his praise of the transcendent perfection of sublime intelligence:
You upon whom buddhas, pratyekabuddhas,
and śrāvakas definitely rely,
you alone are the path to liberation;
it can certainly be said that “there is no other.”[603]
That is to say, even śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas rely on that intelligence, which is why the perfection of sublime intelligence is referred to as the “mother.”[604] And so, because it is the “mother” of both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna “children,” the distinction between the Hīnayāna and the Mahāyāna is not made on the basis of the sublime intelligence that realizes emptiness, but rather is made on the basis of bodhicitta and its truly magnificent conduct.

Therefore, given that it is necessary to train in the awakening attitude of bodhicitta from the outset, there are two methods of practical instructions concerning this, which are both lineages transmitted through the Noble Lord.[605] [3.164a]
The instructions transmitted by Tumtön Lodrö Drak, who was a student of Sharawa,[606] involve five stages of cause and effect. These entail one pursuing the following train of thought:
“Given that I must attain buddhahood, as the cause of buddhahood, (1) bodhicitta is necessary. As the cause of that, (1) compassion is necessary. As the cause of that, (3) loving-kindness is necessary. As the cause of that, (4) knowledge of what has been done for me and a desire to repay that kindness are necessary. And as the cause of that, (5) knowledge of all beings having been my parents is necessary.
“All beings have been my parents. How very kind they have been! Why shouldn’t they all be free of suffering and instead be happy and joyful? In order to bring them to happiness, I will attain buddhahood. And having attained buddhahood, I will furthermore bring all beings to that state of buddhahood! ”
Alternatively, it is said that one trains one's mind[607] through seven practical instructions concerning cause and effect, which were transmitted by Tsangpa Rinpoché, a student of Jayulwa.[608] If one adopts the point of view of these instructions, they state that buddhahood itself, as that which is to be attained, does not come about without cause or condition. Rather, it comes about from (1) bodhicitta as its cause. This in turn comes about from (2) completely pure altruistic motivation. This comes from (3) supreme compassion. This comes from (4) supreme loving-kindness. This comes from (5) a sense of empathy.[609] This comes from (6) knowledge of what has been done for one and a desire to repay that kindness. And this comes from (7) cultivating the idea of beings as one's mother.

In this regard, the basis for arousing an attitude of concern for the welfare of others lies in establishing an even-minded attitude in oneself that is free of attachment or aversion toward beings. Initially one cultivates this evenmindedness toward those whom one regards as neutral—that is, who have done one neither good nor harm. Then one extends this attitude toward those who are loved ones and friends, then to those who are enemies who harm one, and then to all beings.
With respect to the foregoing, one contemplates as follows: “From the perspective of ordinary beings, they are all alike in wishing to be happy and not wishing to suffer. Thus, it is not reasonable that I should treat certain of them as close to me and try to help them, [3.164b] while holding others at a distance and trying to harm them (or at the very least not trying to help them).” One also thinks, “From my own perspective, given that I have been in saṃsāra throughout beginningless time, there is no being whomsoever who has not been my friend a hundred times over, so to whom should I be attached and to whom should I feel averse?” This is as stated in the intermediate version of Stages of Meditation.[610]

One then develops a sense of empathy toward everyone.[611] That is to say, one thinks of each and every being's having been one's mother, recalls their kindness, and therefore contemplates the necessity of repaying that kindness by ensuring their release from saṃsāra. Since it is held that the means to liberate them from saṃsāra is for one to seek the state of supreme enlightenment as one's goal, one should train one's mind in cultivating its causes— attitudes of loving-kindness, compassion, and altruistic motivation.

Loving-kindness
Of these, the focus for loving-kindness is beings who are lacking in happiness. The forms it takes are the thoughts, “Why shouldn't they find happiness?” “May they find happiness!” and “I will ensure that they find happiness.” The benefits and advantages of this are boundless, as is illustrated by the following passage from the Precious Garland:
Even if one were to give away three hundred vessels of food three times each day, the merits of this could not compare in the slightest to even an instant of loving-kindness.
Gods and human beings will treat one lovingly, they will also protect one,
one will have mental happiness, many other kinds of happiness,
will not be harmed by poisons or weapons,
will realize one's goals effortlessly, and be reborn in the world of purity.
And so even if one does not gain liberation, one gains these eight qualities of loving-kindness.[612]
As for the stages in meditation, initially one should meditate on loved ones and friends, then on those to whom one feels neutral, and then on enemies. One then meditates, step by step, on all beings. [3.165a]
As to the way in which one meditates, just as one would arouse compassion by contemplating over and over the way in which beings are afflicted by suffering, here one contemplates over and over the way in which beings are devoid of happiness, lacking any virtue, whether corruptible or not.[613] Once one has become familiar with this, the wish that they find happiness will occur as a matter of course. Furthermore, one brings to mind all kinds of virtue and mentally confers these on beings.[614]

<d e="2">
Compassion
The focus for compassion is beings who are afflicted by any of the three kinds of suffering. The forms it takes are the thoughts, “Why shouldn’t they be free of those sufferings?” “May they be free of them!” and “I will ensure that they are free of them.” As for the stages in meditation, initially one should meditate on loved ones and friends, then on those to whom one feels neutral, then on enemies, and on all beings in the ten directions. (Such successive meditations on impartiality, loving-kindness, and compassion, distinguishing their respective objects, were set forth by the master Kamalaśīla, following the model found in the sūtras of the abhidharma class;[615] these are exceedingly profound key points. )
As to the way in which one cultivates compassion, it is by contemplating the ways in which these beings (who have been one's mother), having fallen into conditioned states of existence, experience general and specific forms of suffering. As to the measure of having successfully aroused compassion, the first version of Stages of Meditation says the following:
At whatever point compassion is engaged as a matter of course, expressing itself as the wish to rid all beings forever of suffering (as though they were one's unhappy children with whom one feels a sense of empathy), so that one takes on that same quality oneself—at that point this is perfected, and so can be called “supreme compassion.”[616]
From this one can also understand the measure of having successfully aroused loving-kindness.

Altruistic Motivation
Having thus cultivated loving-kindness and compassion, [3.165b] one finally thinks, “Alas! These beings, who are dear to me and with whom I feel empathy, are thus lacking in happiness and tormented by suffering. I will do whatever it takes to ensure that they find happiness and are liberated from suffering.” As for accepting the responsibility to liberate them, one trains one's mind, even if only by giving lip service, so that one never loses sight of the intention that they gain higher states of rebirth in the shorter term, while one's desire is that they be brought solely to supreme enlightenment and not just to some more limited state of mere liberation.[617] This is what constitutes the especially superior states of higher altruistic motivation.
In this regard, spiritually advanced beings of the śrāvaka and pratyeka-buddha approaches do not regress back into saṃsāra, their minds abiding innately in the absence of conceptual elaborations, and are endowed with entirely authentic qualities of enlightenment, so that from our perspective as ordinary mortal individuals, they are indeed truly awe-inspiring. However, by comparison to the way in which buddhas and bodhisattvas eliminate the two kinds of obscuration;[618] to the way in which their timeless awareness unfolds as awareness of the true nature of things just as it is and awareness of things in their multiplicity; to the way in which they are endowed with limitless qualities of enlightenment; to the way in which the force of their innate compassion and the dynamic energy of their spiritual power and might (which are all difficult to realize) are present in them; and to the way in which their enlightened activity ensues to carry out benefit for beings in all places and at all times—by comparison to these inconceivable aspects, the freedom experienced by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas is so very much smaller in scope. By analogy, the difference is greater than that between Sumeru and a mustard seed!
Therefore, one contemplates over and over, “I will attain perfect enlightenment and the sublime state of liberation, for this is by nature such that all processes of elimination and realization have been completely perfected for my own benefit, while enlightened activity for the benefit of others is inexhaustible. Come what may, may I attain buddhahood!” In this way, one reorients one's mind away from the inferior goals of quiescence and naive happiness.

Using one's discerning powers of sublime intelligence, [3.166a] again and again one examines and investigates the significance of the fact that the nature of all phenomena—those of the deeply ingrained afflictive state and those of the totally refined state—is primordially unborn. From this comes the timeless awareness of a spiritually advanced being, and one's mind is reoriented away from the confusion, in its entirety, of how things appear at present to dualistic consciousness. The objects in this case consist of topics discussed previously, such as the two levels of truth, while the subjective perceiver of these consists of this selfsame discerning quality. Its important role in the development of sublime intelligence born of contemplation is spoken of in the Chapter of Kāśyapa:
O Kāśyapa, it is thus. To use an analogy, suppose two trees are rubbed together by the wind, which causes them to burst into flame. Once this has happened, both trees are burned up. In a similar fashion, O Kāśyapa, if one has authentic discernment, this causes the faculty of sublime intelligence in a spiritually advanced being to develop, and once this has developed, that selfsame authentic discernment is “incinerated.”[619]
This passage states that the sublime intelligence of a spiritually advanced being develops from this discernment.

In the intermediate version of Stages of Meditation, moreover, we read the following:
In this way, sublime intelligence is used to thoroughly investigate thus. Whenever, concerning a given thing, an advanced spiritual practitioner[620] does not definitively apprehend the very essence itself of that thing from the ultimate perspective, at that point he or she enters into a nonconceptual state of meditative absorption. He or she also realizes the very nonexistence of the very essence of all phenomena.
When one does not meditate using sublime intelligence to examine precisely the very essence of a thing but rather engages in meditation solely by completely eliminating all conceptual processes, that will never do away with conceptual thought and also will never lead[621] to realization of the very nonexistence of the very essence because the perspective of sublime intelligence is absent.
In this way, if the fire of knowing what is authentic, just as it is, comes from authentic discernment itself, then the wood of conceptual thought will be incinerated, just like the fire brought on by rubbing wooden sticks together.
This is what the transcendent and accomplished conqueror proclaimed.[622]

As for the important role that contemplation plays in meditation, moreover, we may quote from holy masters of the past, who said: [3.166b]
Gathering together in one's mind the teachings one has heard previously, over and over one must contemplate them, evaluate them, and truly understand them. Someone who allows the teachings to be forgotten and trains only in some focusing of the mind is left without any allies. The most excellent kind of great meditator makes the most excellent teacher; a middling “great meditator” makes only a middling teacher. It must be the case that by however much one meditates, by that much one's understanding of the teachings grows greater.
If one thus gains a stable degree of certainty through contemplation, then even if harmful companions should say to one,
“All thinking, whether virtuous or nonvirtuous, just consists of thoughts, so these are all to be eliminated,” one's response would be, “That is not what is said in the teachings and that is not what true spiritual mentors accept.” Then one will not listen to what such a person says.
Failing that, if one has a little faith but no intelligence, one will cry when one looks at someone crying and laugh when one
looks at someone laughing—that is, one will be like water following the easiest course, thinking, “That’s the truth!” regardless of what someone says and being led off to wherever that takes one.[623]
