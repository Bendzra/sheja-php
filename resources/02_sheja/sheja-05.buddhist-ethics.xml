The source of our present and lasting happiness and well-being is the precious teaching of the Buddha. Just to hear its name is rare, how much more so to encounter it. Now that the Buddha's teaching is known in this world and you are a human being whose life is replete with leisure and endowments,[1] do not waste this opportunity, for such a life is a wish-fulfilling jewel. In order to make your life fruitful, as you wisely approach [the teaching,] first search for a qualified spiritual guide and then follow his or her guidance impeccably.

The search for a master comprises three preliminary steps: the first [is reflecting upon the uniqueness of the Buddha's teaching] as described in Interwoven Praises[2]:
[Your doctrine is] the sole path, easy to enter; It grants supremacy and has no flaw.
Propitious in the beginning, middle, and end:
No one has taught a doctrine like yours!
The teaching of the Buddha provides the sole path to liberation. Easily entered, it grants none other than supreme attainment. [The Buddha's doctrine] is flawless [in being the antidote] to attachment and other [emotions]. It is propitious because all stages [of its practice]—first listening, then reflection, and finally making it a living experience—become the seed for the attainment of higher levels of existence and liberation. For these reasons, the Buddha's doctrine represents, in every respect, the source of all happiness and well-being. These features are not found in the doctrines of other teachers, such as that of the seer Kapila,[3] but are exclusive to the teachings of the Buddha. Accordingly, the bodhisattva Shantideva composed this prayer[4]:
May the doctrine, the only cure for suffering And the source of all happiness,
Be supported and honored And endure for long!
</d>

</d>
<d e="2">
The second [step is valuing the precious human life.] The Reunion of Father and Son Scripture states[5]:
Having shunned all of the eight fetters[6] of life
And found the marvelous endowments so rare to obtain Wise ones who have come to have faith in the doctrine of the
Joyful One
Engage in the right spiritual practice.
Only by having faith in and following the Buddha's teaching can we take full advantage of our human lives that are replete with leisure and endowments.

The third step [is considering the need for a spiritual guide]. The Transcendent Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines states[7]:
A bodhisattva, great being, who wishes to attain ultimate, authentic, and perfect awakening, should first approach, work with, and honor spiritual guides.
What kind of spiritual guide should one look for? The Collection of Spontaneous Utterances states[8]:

</d>
<d e="2" root="5">
Since by relying on an inferior, one regresses, On an equal, one stagnates,
And on a superior, one excels,
Keep in touch with a spiritual guide superior to yourself.
</d>
</f>

</d>
<d e="2">
We will not develop any wholesome qualities by working with a spiritual guide who is inferior to ourselves in the areas of ethical, scholarly, and meditative abilities, etc. [On the contrary, the relationship] will prove detrimental in many ways, and we will regress. When the spiritual guide is an equal, of similar abilities to ours, we will stagnate, neither progressing nor regressing. When the spiritual guide has qualities superior to ours, we can excel and attain the desired supreme goal. Therefore, we should always remain close to an individual superior to ourselves, a spiritually advanced master. The same scripture states[9]:
If you study with a master
Far superior to yourself in ethics, Contemplative tranquility, and wisdom, You can even excel him.

There are countless scriptural references to the need for working with a spiritual guide. The Condensed Transcendent Wisdom Scripture states[10]:
Worthy students who respect spiritual teachers Should always remain close to learned masters Because from them the virtues of the wise spring.
The Flower Array Scripture states[11]:
O child of the universal family, all your virtuous qualities issue from your spiritual guide. You can encounter and receive instructions from one only if you have cultivated merit and wisdom for oceans of eons. Otherwise, to meet a spiritual guide may prove more difficult than coming upon the most rare of gems. Therefore, never tire of honoring your spiritual guide.

Given that a student wishes to attain the state of an omniscient buddha, the basic premise is that it is necessary for him or her to work with a spiritual guide. The reason is that the individual does not know how to cultivate merit and wisdom or to clear away obscurations. Examples consistent with this proof are the enlightened ones of the three times. The converse can be illustrated by solitary sages[12] and other examples.

Many similes illustrate [the need for a spiritual guide]. For example, the Biography of Shri Sambhava states[13]:
Spiritual teachers are like guides because they set us on the path of the perfections.
The Biography of the Lay Practitioner Achala states[14]:
Spiritual guides are like escorts because they escort us to the state of omniscience.
The Flower Array states[15]:
Spiritual guides are like ferrymen because they carry us across the river of cyclic life.

There are four types of spiritual guide: ordinary human beings, bodhisattvas, the manifest dimension of a buddha, and the enjoyment dimension of a buddha. These four are suited to the four phases [of our spiritual growth]. At the beginning of our quest, it is impossible for us to come in touch with buddhas or bodhisattvas who have reached the higher stages of awakening. Therefore, we have to work with ordinary human beings as our spiritual guides.
When the obscurations caused by our previous deeds have cleared, we can meet bodhisattvas on higher stages of awakening.[16] As we reach the highest level of the path of accumulation,[17] we can encounter the manifest dimension of a buddha. Then, as we attain the higher stages of awakening, we can come in contact with the enjoyment dimension of a buddha as our spiritual guide.
At the beginning of our quest, when we are still trapped in the dungeon of our emotions and previous deeds, we cannot consider working with higher spiritual guides because we will not see as much as their faces! We first must seek a spiritual guide who is an ordinary human being. When our path has been illuminated by the light of his or her speech, we will come to meet higher spiritual guides. Therefore, the kindest of all is the spiritual guide who is an ordinary person.[18]

Since the [latter] three types of spiritual guide do not directly benefit the beginner, it is not necessary to describe their characteristics here. The spiritual guide who is an ordinary person must possess eight, four, or two specific qualities. The eight are listed in the following verse, which summarizes the treatment of this subject in the Stages of
the Bodhisattva:
He or she is ethical and learned,
Spiritually accomplished, full of compassion and love, Fearless, patient, dauntless,
And eloquent.[19]
The four [qualities] are referred to in the Scripture Ornament[20]: being a great teacher by virtue of prodigious learning; having the capacity to clear away doubts by virtue of higher wisdom; speaking words worthy of taking to heart because this teacher's deeds are those of a virtuous person; having the ability to point out the exact nature of both thoroughly polluted and fully pure phenomena.[21]
The two [qualities of a spiritual guide] are erudition and the commitment [to awaken for the benefit of others]. [Shantideva's] Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life states[22]:
Even at the cost of my life,
I will never forsake my spiritual friend
Who is knowledgeable in the meaning of the Universal Way And who is a supreme follower of the bodhisattva's way of
life.[23]

A monastic preceptor is known by the following qualities: [steadfastness, learning, and helpfulness]. Steadfastness refers to living by ethical discipline; [specifically,] having kept the monastic vows for [at least] ten years. Learning refers to flawless recollection of the monastic ceremonies set forth in the collection of scriptures on discipline. Helpfulness comprises several aspects: caring with benevolence and compassion for students who are sick; keeping company with monks who are upright in that they maintain ethics; being diligent in helping others by giving both instructions and material things; and offering [disciples] timely and pertinent counsel.[25]
In particular, the preceptor [who presides over ordination ceremonies] must possess the four virtues of steadfastness, learning, respectability,[26] and helpfulness. Steadfastness and learning may be considered as a single quality or may be further divided into twenty-one groups of five characteristics each.[27] These characteristics are explained in [Mikyö Dorjé's] Great Commentary on the Summary of Discipline and in the works of the eminent Pema Karpo. Helpfulness is said to be of twelve kinds:
Compassionate and patient, maintaining close ties with upright persons,
Persevering in the two forms of helpful activity, being of the same gender and view [as the candidate],
Able to speak, comprehend, and being of sound mind,
Having a natural human body, and [holding] his usual rank [within the monastic community].

The primary qualifications of the ceremonial master are six: (1) observing monastic vows, (2) being of the same gender as the candidate [for ordination], (3) sharing with the candidate the same view on the discipline,[28] (4) fulfillment of the three basic requisites [knowing how to speak, comprehending what is said, and being of sound mind],(5) having a natural human body [i.e., not being an emanation], and (6) holding his usual rank [i.e., not having been demoted]. In addition to those six qualities, he must be skilled in conducting the ordination procedure.
The interviewer must meet the above six requirements and be proficient in conducting an inquiry to determine potential impediments for a candidate [wishing to receive ordination].
The tutor, in addition to the six requirements, must be able to instill the sense of pure ethics in his students by explaining the prohibitions and duties [of a monk].
The instructor, in addition to the six requirements, must be qualified to teach by virtue of his clear understanding of the three collections of scriptures.[29]

The instructor of the bodhisattva should meet the following ten requirements: (1) self-control, i.e., having tamed the “wild horse” of the mind by the “fine bridle” of training in ethics; (2) mental tranquility, achieved through training in contemplation, using [the tools of] mindfulness and inspection; (3) pacification of deception, achieved through the wisdom of discerning reality and grounded in the tranquility of a pliant mind; (4) eminence, i.e., possessed of greatly superior qualities, being neither inferior nor equal to students; (5) diligence, i.e., a constant delight in helping others; (6) a wealth of transmissions gained from extensive study of the three collections of scriptures; (7) supreme realization of the nature of all phenomena gained through the strength of listening, pondering, and meditating; (8) skillful articulation, i.e., the ability to present the stages of the path in a way that suits the mental aptitude of the disciple; (9) genuine lovingkindness, in having the pure motivation to teach out of compassion, without regard for personal gain or honor; (10) freedom from weariness and discouragement, in never tiring of repeating lessons and showing patience [in the face] of anger.
[Four of these qualifications]—self-control, tranquility, pacification of deception, and realization of the nature of phenomena—are aspects of spiritual accomplishment. Possessing a wealth of transmissions is an aspect of [mastery of] the transmission. Those five, together with eminence, are the six qualities of personal growth. The remaining four are qualities related to caring for others. A teacher who meets these ten requirements is known as an exemplary human being.

The types of tantric or vajra master will be explained below.
The qualifications of the vajra master are discussed at length [in various works]. As a summary of these, the Fifty [Verses on Devotion to] the Master[31] lists fifteen qualifications, six general and nine specific. The six are as follows: (1) steadfastness, by virtue of having an unperturbed body, speech, and mind; (2) self-control, by virtue of meditative training; (3) intelligence or capacity for accurate analysis; (4) patience or restraint from anger (when seeing students' poor conduct); and (5 and 6) honesty and sincerity, i.e., freedom from deceptive ways (hiding one's faults or shortcomings) and artifice (giving a false impression in order to mislead others).
The nine specific qualifications [of the vajra master] are as follows: (1) knowledge of the use of mantras[32] in performing the four charismatic activities,[33] etc.; (2) knowledge of the practices related to tantra,[34] for example, [being able to explain the tantras by means of the] six parameters[35]; (3) loving compassion for others; (4) proficiency in the common treatises[36]; (5, 6, and 7) mastery of the [three sets of] ten fields; (8) proficiency in the drawing of mandalas[37] based on proper performance of familiarization,[38] etc., and mastery of initiation[39] procedures; and (9) knowledge of how to explain the Secret Mantra in the manner appropriate for [disciples] of superior, moderate, and lesser capabilities.
The first set of ten fields of expertise comprises those areas indispensable to the vajra master. The Tantra of Consecration states[40]:
Mandala, contemplation, seal, Stance, mantra, seated position, Recitation, fire offering,
Food offering (torma), and dissolution.[41]

The second set of ten fields of expertise which concern ritual is taught in the Indestructible Tent Tantra and enumerated accordingly in Dombipa's Ten Essential Points[42]:
The victorious ones have specified ten fields of expertise: Protection [wheel], conferral of initiation, food offerings,
recitation, rite of tearing apart the union, [Two] reversals, actualization of the mandala, The threatening rite, and departure request.[43]
The third set of ten fields of expertise which are of ultimate significance are elucidated in the Tantra [of Hevajra] in Five Hundred Thousand [Lines][44] and summarized in the [Means of Accomplishment of the Glorious] Blazing Jewel[45]:
Know these ten fields of expertise:
Vajra, bell, pristine awareness, Deity, mandala, fire offering,
Mantra, colored sands, food offerings, and initiation.
The ten outer fields given in the Indestructible Nucleus' Ornament [Tantra][46] resemble the [first set] of fields of expertise given in the Tantra of Consecration. There is a similar enumeration in the Summation of Essential Points. These are presented from the viewpoint of the yoga tantra system.
The father-son transmission from Mikyö Dorjé asserts that the ten secret [or inner] fields of expertise taught in the Indestructible Nucleus' Ornament[47]—
The rites of the two reversals,
The secret initiation and the initiation of pristine awareness through wisdom,
The ritual of tearing apart the union [of hostile forces], Food offerings, vajra muttering,
The ritual of accomplishing the fierce act, Consecration and actualization of the mandala Are the ten secret fields of expertise.[48]
—as well as those found in the Beholding the Qualities of the Spiritual Master Tantra,[49] the Commentary on the Buddhasamayoga,[50] and the Cluster of Secret Instructions[51] are from the standpoint of the Highest Yoga Tantra.

According to the Ancient Translation School of the Secret Mantra, [a qualified vajra master] owns three genuine treasures: (1) the view that realizes the indivisibility of the [relative and ultimate] truths; (2) the contemplation that has reached the culmination of the phases of creation and completion[52]; and (3) the preservation of general and specific pledges. (The three treasures are also explained as expertise in the systems of Mahayoga, the treasure of the creation phase; Anu, the treasure of the completion phase; and Ati[53], the treasure of the view.) [Further, the vajra master] (4) has received the entire course of profound initiations that empower and transform; (5) does not forsake the secret mantra and intentionally nurtures worthy disciples;
(6) is learned in the tantras and able to elucidate the meaning of the
transmissions; (7) is skilled in composing rituals for the performance of charismatic activity; and (8) has produced the signs of experience derived from the practice of the secret instructions of oral transmissions. In Buddhaguhya's Sequence of the Path [of the Magical Net], such a teacher is called a vajra master who possesses the eight qualities of natural expression.

The vajra master's qualifications mentioned above are all included in the following: The vajra master belongs to a lineage of masters who from Buddha Vajradhara to the present time have transmitted maturing [initiations] and liberating [instructions] and have not violated any of the pledges; preserves vows, pledges, and tantric conduct; has received the secret instructions that have been transmitted from one lineage holder to the next; has realized the teachings of the Buddha and their commentaries, and, in particular, the import of the tantras; and has a compassionate and altruistic mind.
Lay vajra masters are said to be lower [in rank] to novice or monk and nun vajra masters unless they have reached stages of awakening. Accordingly, Vajragarbha's Commentary[54] states:
Unless he has attained the stages of awakening,
A layman is not to be venerated as a [tantric] master, [not even] by a king.
Someone following the monastic life, who is learned and possesses true knowledge,
Is to be honored in his place.
When a layperson who has not reached the stages of awakening
Is revered [as a vajra master],
The respect accorded to the Buddha, to his doctrine, And to the monastic community will wane.
The novice is superior to the layperson [as vajra master] because he or she is a renunciate, but of junior status when compared to the monk or nun, who is the best [choice for vajra master]. The Wheel of Time Fundamental Tantra states[55]:
Among experts in the ten fields, The monk is foremost;
The novice is average,
And the layperson is the least qualified.

A magnificent master is one who is able to evoke adamantine pristine awareness of the state of union, i.e., mahamudra,[56] in the disciple's mind, and is therefore a crucial factor [in the attainment] of supreme accomplishment. The primary characteristics of such a master [are referred to] in the [Wheel of Time] Condensed Tantra[57]:
A magnificent master is one in whose mind and speech the face of the Buddha is present.[58]
As elucidated in the Commentary by the Bodhisattva[59] as the model in the tantric system, a “magnificent master” is a teacher whose speech can instill in the disciple the experiential cultivation of the state of union [pointed out in] the fourth initiation (referred to as the “face” or “entrance” of the Buddha). Such a master, with the state of contemplation[60] present in his or her mind, has the ability to transfer realization in the form of a blessing to the mind of the disciple. Having ascertained [the nature of] mantra, the master has attained the first stage of awakening. Being far superior to any ordinary spiritual teacher, he or she is known as a “magnificent master.”

A teacher whose traits are discordant with the characteristics of the [true] master stands outside of the Buddhist doctrine and cannot be taken as a spiritual teacher. Consequently, even though the teacher may be very famous, active, etc., the discriminating student should be aware [of these shortcomings] and detach himself or herself [from the teacher]. This should be done even if a teacher-student relationship has already been formed. If one has not yet formed such a relationship, one should avoid doing so, right from the beginning. Sakya Pandita states[61]:
Detach yourself from the spiritual teacher
Who does not conform to the Buddha's teaching.
We should learn how to recognize [bad teachers] from the many descriptions given in the scriptures and then shun them. For example, the Condensed Tantra [of the Wheel of Time] states:
Proud, subject to uncontrollable anger, defiant of pledges, guilty of misappropriation, ignorant [of the doctrine],
Willfully deceptive of students, having failed to enter the state of supreme bliss, uninitiated,
A slave to wealth and enjoyments, careless, rude in speech, and obsessed with sexual desire:
Wise students who wish full awakening should shun such a teacher as they would hell.[62]
Because we are living in a [degenerate] age, we very rarely meet a teacher endowed with all of the necessary qualifications. Since we may never meet such a teacher, we should accept a master who has many good qualities and very few weaknesses. [Pundarika's] Ultimate Familiarization[63] states:
In this age of conflict, spiritual masters will exhibit both faults and virtues;
Not one is absolutely irreproachable.
Therefore, examine well even those who excel in virtue Before beginning to study with them.

<d e="2">
A suitable candidate for the bodhisattva's training should have the following qualities: faith in the collections of teachings on the Universal Way and in the spiritual guides of that tradition, loving-kindness and compassion toward others, intelligence [capable of] realizing profound and magnificent [doctrines], and the stamina to engage with courage in a vast range of [bodhisattva] practices (such as the four means of attracting disciples[66] and the six perfections[67]). This individual is not seeking personal peace and happiness but is working with joy in order to liberate all sentient beings. He or she is always energetic and delights in hearing about the profound subject of emptiness. These qualities indicate that the spiritual potential for the Universal Way has awakened. The Ten Qualities Scripture[68] states:
The spiritual potential of the wise bodhisattva Is known by its signs
As fire is indicated by smoke, And water, by herons.
Also, [Aryadeva's] Experientialist Four Hundred states[69]:
The individual who is impartial, intelligent, and persevering, Is referred to as a suitable disciple.
[To explain,] impartiality refers to freedom from bias toward one's own spiritual tradition and a dislike of others' traditions.[70] Intelligence refers to [the capacity to] discriminate between the value of true doctrines and the futility of fallacious ones. Perseverance refers to dedication to the practice of the Universal Way. The disciple who possesses these three qualities will appreciate the excellent virtues of the spiritual guide. The disciple who lacks these qualities will see shortcomings in even the most gifted spiritual guide.

A suitable candidate for the Secret Mantra system of ripening [initiations] and liberative [instructions] must fulfill all the qualities [mentioned in the last section]. Furthermore, he or she is deeply devoted to the spiritual master and knows how to maintain secrecy on the profound view and conduct, is free of reservations concerning the Secret Mantra, has great aptitude for understanding reality, and lives by the pledges while persevering in the tantric practice. The Condensed Tantra of the Wheel of Time, the Indestructible Garland (an explanatory tantra of the Guhyasamaja), and other works discuss these qualifications in some detail.
A tantra of the Ancient Translation School, the Magical Net,[71] describes the qualities of the suitable candidate for the way of Secret Mantra in the following way:
[The disciple] must revere the teacher, be strenuous, be bright [in intelligence],
Honor the pledges, know mantra and seals, And possess the necessary resources.
Reverence to the master permits the disciple to be gradually initiated [into the tantra]. Devotion and constancy ensure that the disciple does not forsake listening to and reflection on [the tantras]. A bright and flawless intelligence enables him or her to examine the view to be realized. [In addition,] the disciple must honor the root and branch pledges [of the Secret Mantra], know the significance of mantras and seals, and not be lacking in the necessary resources [for tantric practice].

An individual whose characteristics are opposite to those of a qualified candidate must be ignored. The Samvara [Tantra] states[72]:
Spiritual masters should reject
Those who have no compassion, are ill-tempered, Arrogant, unrestrained, distracted, Unreasonable, stupid, or lazy,
Have no concern for the lives of others, Or covet others' possessions.
Nagarjuna's Five Stages states[73]:
Do not teach the graded instructions
To those who have contempt for, try to deceive, or lack faith in their spiritual masters;
Are proud of being Mantra practitioners; are arrogant [in that they boast knowledge of the tantras after] having read a few scriptures[74];
Fall short of having confidence [in the tantras], or have received [only] lower initiations.[75]
A person replete with virtues such as faith and perseverance, despite having imperfections, should be accepted as a disciple even though he or she does not meet all of the necessary qualifications. Accordingly, the Secret Tantra of the General Ritual of All Mandalas states[76]:
Rare to find is a disciple who lives by the commitments, Is outstanding in qualities, and has no illness,
Who comes from a good family,
Is inspired with faith, and follows the tantric conduct.
Accept as a disciple someone with the noble traits Of faith in the Three Jewels,
Attraction to the Universal Way, And great merit.
Although ugly or uncultivated,
A disciple who shows earnest interest and perseverance In the Secret Mantra of the joyful ones
Should be encouraged by the wise master to follow that way.

<d e="2">
A teacher and disciple who satisfy the necessary requirements are like [rare] jewels. When they first meet, it is crucial for master and disciple to examine each other [to determine whether they can brave] a spiritual relationship. [Ashvaghosha's] Fifty [Verses on Devotion to] the Master states[77]:
For neither the master nor the disciple To damage the commitments,
They must first examine whether they can brave The teacher and disciple relationship.
Further, the Essence of the Great Seal states[78]:
A qualified spiritual master Should carefully test the student.
Just as a skillful smith will melt the ore To determine the worth of gold,
Or a [yogin] will check [the signs of] a blissful maiden,[79]
The teacher must assess [the worth of] the student. To avoid unfortunate consequences
Both the teacher and the student
Must examine well each other's character.
The consequences are particularly unfortunate when a tantric master initiates disciples indiscriminately without first testing them. An unworthy disciple will be unable to honor pledges. This will lead to the ruin of both master and disciple in this life and the next, and their commitments will deteriorate. The master's own spiritual accomplishment will be remote, and he or she will be beset by obstacles.
Similarly, many detrimental results befall a disciple who fails to determine whether a master is fully qualified and receives initiation from anyone at all. He or she is likely to be deceived by a false guide. Thereafter, the disciple will be unable to keep the words of honor [pledged in the presence of the master], and the very source of accomplishment will be destroyed. Led astray on a false path [by a deceptive master], the disciple cannot take advantage of life's leisure and endowments.

The disciple should willingly carry out all the directives of the spiritual master and practice earnestly [in order to ascertain the validity of] the master's instructions in whatever way is appropriate—study, reflection, or meditation. This is the best form of reverence because a true spiritual guide is delighted by the offering of one's spiritual practice and is not [particularly] pleased by gifts, etc. The Flower Array Scripture states[82]:
Don't ever become weary of seeking a spiritual guide.
Having found one, follow his instructions without neglecting to serve him.
Consider yourself like the earth, not wearied by any burden. Consider yourself a servant, heeding any order.

In addition to the above, many benefits of working with a spiritual guide are mentioned in the discourses and tantras. The Flower Array Scripture,[85] for example, states:
Bodhisattvas who are under the guidance of spiritual guides will not fall into miserable forms of life. Able to discriminate good from evil, they do not engage in what is unwholesome. They shun all sources of distraction and escape from the “city” of cyclic existence. They will not contravene the bodhisattva's training and they stand above all worlds. They will not be easily overcome by emotions and previous actions. Therefore, children of the Universal family, always keep these benefits in mind and follow your spiritual guides!
The salient points of the many scriptural references on this subject are summarized in the words of the all-knowing Drimé Özer (Longchenpa)[86]:
The benefits of devoting yourself to a spiritual master are limitless:
You embark upon the perfect path, discern what is authentic,
Cultivate merit and enhance pristine awareness, clear away obscurations, dispel hindrances,
Attain the stature of a holy person, And swiftly reach the city of freedom.
Furthermore, [the scriptures] mention the following benefits: we come closer to enlightenment; the victorious ones are pleased with us; we never lack spiritual guides; we never fall into miserable forms of life; the negative consequences of our past deeds and emotions will not defeat us; our deeds never contradict the bodhisattvas' conduct; and we always bear this conduct in mind. Our positive qualities thereby steadily increase, and we achieve all temporal and ultimate objectives. Furthermore, by revering a spiritual guide, the results of past deeds [that would lead to] miserable forms of life are met and exhausted in this life as the experiences of only slight mental or physical affliction, or even just in dreams. So vast is its merit that to venerate a spiritual guide far surpasses other forms of virtue such as making offerings to an infinite number of buddhas.

On the other hand, if we relate to the spiritual guide in a wrong way, we may be afflicted by many sicknesses and beset by malevolent influences during this life. In future lives, we may experience countless sufferings in miserable existences. We will not acquire any new qualities, and we will lose the qualities we now have. Because of these destructive consequences, the Vajrapani Initiation Tantra states[87]:
O Lord of Secrets! How should the disciple regard the teacher? You should think of him as you would the Blessed One, the
Buddha.
Similar statements are found in the collection of Universalist scriptures and the scriptures on discipline. Thus, we should never form an overly critical attitude toward the spiritual guide but should devote ourselves to him or her with even greater respect than for the Buddha. The merits of honoring one's spiritual master are inconceivable.
As the Guhyasamaja [Tantra] says[88]:
There is far greater merit in venerating a single pore of the master's body than in worshiping all the buddhas throughout all time and space.
The Biography of Shri Sambhava Scripture states[89]:
By pleasing the spiritual guide, one attains the enlightenment of a buddha.
In summary, limitless virtues, manifest [in this life] and in the next, are acquired by venerating spiritual teachers. Merit and pristine awareness are enhanced to their fullest extent; all hindrances caused by adverse circumstances subside; fame and prosperity increase; and enlightenment is swiftly attained.
Generally, anything we do, wholesome or unwholesome, in relation to significant persons such as a spiritual master, preceptor, teacher, sick person, practitioner of the Buddhist teachings, bodhisattva in his or her final existence, exalted proclaimer, exalted solitary sage, or one's own parents yields extremely powerful results. Vasubandhu's Treasury [of Phenomenology] states[90]:
Helping parents or the sick
Even though they may not be exalted
And honoring spiritual teachers or bodhisattvas in their final existence
Are said to yield inconceivable merits.

It is imperative that we eschew spiritual teachers, instructors, preceptors, students, and companions who engage in unwholesome activities out of worldly concerns since they are not true spiritual friends. We should particularly avoid persons who give the impression of integrity but [in fact] create obstacles to our own attainment of liberation. Similarly, we should forsake those who have bad characters and cynical outlooks; those who are strongly prejudiced, or who consider as best only their own views and doctrines; those who praise themselves and disparage others; those who covertly belittle and thereby reject other spiritual systems; and those who discredit the spiritual guides and friends who are shouldering the burden of other beings' welfare. If we associate with these kinds of people, devoting ourselves to or befriending them, we will become polluted by their faults and our characters will gradually worsen. The scriptures on discipline[91] state:
Just as kusha grass wrapped around rotting fish Will soon begin to smell the same,
A person who associates with bad friends, in time, Will certainly come to resemble them.
Therefore, we should always be careful not to associate with bad friends in any circumstances, as stated in the Great Mindfulness Scripture[92]:
The main obstacle to [the cultivation of] any wholesome quality is an unvirtuous friend. Hence, don't associate or converse with such a person or even allow his or her shadow to fall on yourself.

As soon as a disciple has met a true master who embodies the genuine doctrine and begins to listen to, reflect on, and make a living experience of the instructions, he or she may be beset by demonic forces that block the way. The Condensed [Transcendent Wisdom Scripture][93] states:
The Buddha's doctrine is a rare gem, but perils lurk close by: Disciples of limited capacity who are beginners in the way And have not yet discovered this gem's [worth]
Are provoked by demonic forces who enjoy making obstacles.
The scriptures speak of four general demonic forces (the emotions, etc.[94]). The secret instructions [of masters] refer to eighteen specific demonic forces belonging to three classes (outer, inner, and secret, each comprised of six). These sources also describe at length the causes that can provoke the demonic forces; their forms, their influence, the various signs indicating their presence; and the common and extraordinary means to drive them out.
In the context of our relationship with a teacher, we should recognize the following [mental states as evidence of] demonic forces that will obstruct our path to freedom: an overly critical attitude toward our spiritual guide; lacking the desire to apply ourselves to study and reflection; nurturing the causes of anger, such as creating discord and passing time in idle talk; excessive concern with food and drink, residence, furniture, business, etc.; apathy due to drowsiness, dullness, and laziness; and being overpowered by infatuation and other emotions. As soon as we recognize these negative forces, we must skillfully overcome them by wearing the armor of these antidotes:
faith in and respect for our spiritual master and companions; enthusiasm for study, reflection, and meditation; unwavering confidence in the teaching; and freedom from distractions and unrealistic ideas.

The awakening of the three kinds of faith is the prerequisite for acquiring any wholesome quality and the single most crucial factor when first embarking on the spiritual path under the guidance of a spiritual teacher. The Precious Palm Scripture states[95]:
First, awaken faith which is like a mother:
Faith will dispel your doubts, carry you across the river [of cyclic life],
And direct you to the city of sublime happiness.
The essence of faith is a clear mind focused upon the conduct of forsaking the unwholesome and undertaking virtue. The [scriptures on] phenomenology elucidate the [three] types of faith:
What is faith? Faith is conviction in the law of causality, the [four] truths, and the Three Jewels. It is longing; it is a clear state of mind.
Thus, [the three kinds of faith are] lucid faith, trusting faith, and longing faith. Lucid faith depends upon the Jewels as its object. It is a clear mind that appreciates the spiritual master and the Three Jewels. Trusting faith refers to belief in action as cause, and its results. Longing faith is the aspiration to attain unsurpassable awakening, which directs us to train on the path with perseverance. [Nagarjuna's Jewel Garland] states[96]:
He who does not forsake the Buddha's teachings out of willfulness,
Hatred, fear, or confusion, Is called a man of faith.
He is the best candidate for liberation.
To not reject the teachings for reasons of attachment, aversion, or confusion indicates that faith has awakened.
The benefits of faith are infinite: the attitude of a supreme being arises, the eight fetters of life[97] are transcended, etc. When we have faith, the transcendent ones will appear before us and give spiritual teachings. The Precious Palm Scripture states[98]:
The attitude of a great person is formed
When one has faith in the Victorious One and in his doctrine, In the way of life of the bodhisattvas,
And in unsurpassable awakening.
The Bodhisattva Section Scripture says[99]:
When the buddhas, the blessed ones, have acknowledged a bodhisattva who has constant faith as a worthy recipient for their teachings, they will appear before him and teach him the authentic path of the bodhisattvas.
In summary, faith forms the basis for all positive qualities. Therefore, we should nurture the causes and conditions for its awakening and growth and forsake those that weaken it. Once we have awakened faith, we should make every effort to strengthen it.[100]

The scriptures describe at length the procedure for creating the setting. The White Lotus of the True Doctrine [Scripture][102] states:
In a clean and pleasant environment, Wearing fine, tidy, and good-looking robes, The teacher should take his place
On an attractive and slightly raised seat Draped with various kinds of elegant cloth.
and
In the midst of a gathering of attentive disciples, Without concern for material gain or prestige,
He teaches enthusiastically, motivated by loving-kindness.

According to the procedure described in the Questions of Sagaramati Scripture, the teacher should keep five thoughts in mind[103]:
Regarding himself as a physician, The teaching as medicine,
The listeners as patients,
The Transcendent One as the supreme being, And wishing that the doctrine last long.
The teacher then recites the charm[104] that prevents the class of malevolent gods from approaching within a radius of one hundred leagues.

When teaching, the spiritual master does not lie down, slouch or stretch the legs, etc., but behaves as did the Shakya King when turning the doctrinal wheel. He or she avoids verbosity, repetitiveness, speaking in a poor timbre of voice or in a pitch that is high or low, but speaks clearly and distinctly, with an abundance of the melodious qualities [of speech]. While teaching, the master relinquishes any feelings of attachment or aversion and remains absorbed [in the contemplation of emptiness] or in deity meditation, etc., depending on the occasion. Then, with the aspiration to benefit all sentient beings and to guide them to the state of happiness and well-being, the master invokes a rain of teachings to descend on the disciples.

Then as a patient heeds the physician's advice, Respectfully listen to the doctrine.

[A learned presentation comprises three features:] (1) grammatically correct language, (2) coherent delivery (which implies that the teaching is relevant to the subject, moderate in length, and logical throughout), and (3) a melodious voice that pleases the audience. On this subject, the Scripture Ornament states[108]:
The teaching of the Buddha is pure in three ways[109]: Eloquent in voice and language;
Informative, analytic,
Dispelling doubts, and reiterated;
[Concise] for those who understand brief instructions, And elaborate for those who need lengthy ones.
The manner [in which it is proclaimed] Is free of eight faults:
Taught with laziness or unclear speech, Inappropriate, uncertain,
Unable to resolve doubts
Or to confirm the absence [of doubt], Taught with weariness, or incomplete.[110]
These are regarded as faults in delivery. A buddha's teaching is unsurpassable Because it is devoid of such faults.
Teachings free of these eight faults of delivery are pure in the three ways. Alternatively, the Principles of Elucidation states[111]:
[A teacher should] incorporate twenty qualities[112] into any discourse in order to eliminate the eleven faults of expression.

Ideally, the teacher would have the compassionate wish to guide all sentient beings to great awakening. For the instruction to be effective, the teacher must, at the very least, show compassion by teaching out of a desire to help others without concern for material gain and be knowledgeable in the subject to be taught. If the teacher is lacking in altruistic concern and instead is seeking material reward, etc., he or she incurs the moral offense of selling the Buddha's teaching.

Three kinds of patience enable a teacher to spiritually nurture disciples: acceptance of hardship or fatigue when teaching, responsiveness to disciples' questions, and tolerance toward and the capacity to meet the challenges of others.
A discourse given by a teacher who embodies the above qualities will prove interesting and appealing to the listeners, and it will be useful. The Scripture Ornament says[113]:
The bodhisattva who is eloquent in speech
By virtue of a good intellect, an indefatigable mind, concern for others,
Pleasant delivery, and knowledge of proper teaching methods,
With the brilliance of his teachings, shines as the sun of humanity.[114]

The Synthesis of Phenomenology states that a spiritual discourse should include six elements: the subject matter to be known, its import, the approach to the knowledge [of the subject], finalized knowledge, its result, and its experience.[115] From another point of view, [the same text gives] fourteen elements, such as the “grouping of themes.”[116] Some treatises state that a teaching should indicate its purpose and include a summary [of the subject matter] and the literal meaning [of the words of the text]. Other treatises state that a discourse should incorporate two aspects, the general meaning and the details.
A certain master of the Chim clan[117] asserts that a discourse should present the following [three elements]: an introduction that reveals the meaning, an explanation of the [main body of the text], and ascertainment with regard to both.
The introduction consists of a synopsis of the [subject treated in the] text and contains background information concerning the sources, purpose of the composition, and its subject matter. This prelude will allow the student to appreciate the meaning of the text.
After the student has gained familiarity with the basic character of the text through the overall view provided by the synopsis, the explanation [of the main body of the text] is given with clarifications to dispel uncertainty. Then, through analysis[118] of the explicit and implicit meanings, the student is provided with a good comprehension of the verbal part [of the text].
The ascertainment [is necessary] because although the student may have understood the explanations, he or she may still not be able to respond to others' challenges. Therefore, [the teacher] presents objections based on [possible] misinterpretations of what he or she has taught by stating, for example, that a particular point is contradictory, redundant, or lacks a due connection. He or she then responds to these possible objections, thereby dispelling misunderstandings.
Using logic and scriptural references, the teacher eliminates every possibility that [the opponent's] objection is founded. In these ways, the student will ascertain the message of the text.

The prevalent method of teaching [among learned Tibetan masters] is the one described in the Principles of Elucidation. First, the purpose [of the teaching] is stated so that the student has the incentive to listen to and remember what has been taught. Therefore, at the beginning of the discourse, the teacher should outline the benefits of listening to the doctrine (as the general purpose) and the relationship between the special purpose and the specific subject matter to be taught.
Second, two kinds of summary of the contents are given: (1) The
general overview (beginning with the statement, “This is the overview of the text”) presents the contents in sections. If necessary, [as a support to the summary,] scriptural references and reasoning may be drawn from other sources. Thus, the text is summarized in a way that is accessible and easily remembered. (2) The overview of each topic presents the text as a whole from beginning to end. Major sections are distinguished, their subdivisions classified in a consistent manner, and the divisions and summaries of the supplementary sections explained distinctly.
This style of presentation ensures that the general overview is useful and the specific topics of the text easily understood. These two [qualities] (utility and accessibility counted as one) along with proper words, fluency, conciseness, uniformity, and memorability constitute the six qualities of an effective discourse. In short, a skilled teacher knows how [to deliver] a lecture that is easily understood by and pleasing to both parties.

Third is the analysis of the words. In Sanskrit, the meaning of words is explained in terms of agent, action, and object; in the Tibetan language, in terms of three criteria: what it denotes, the denoting agent, and how it denotes. [To begin the analysis of a text,] its meaning must be discerned through an examination of its words or terms. To do that, the teacher must use his or her expertise in the general descriptions of names, terms, and letters given in phenomenology treatises and in the specialized treatises on grammar and definitions. Once the teacher has provided a detailed and unambiguous explanation of terms, he or she should explain each part of the contents of the text and their meaning without addition, omission, or error.
Fourth is an elucidation of the two kinds of relationship within any text (or discourse)—that between words and that between ideas. The teacher must give clarifications (as in “the former and latter words relate in this way”) when words seem unrelated, when their relationship is ambiguous, or when their relationship is clear but contextually obscure. For the relationship between ideas, [the teacher] begins the explanation of the sequence [of words and ideas] by saying, [for example,] “That brief presentation can be elaborated upon in this way...” or [otherwise,] by clarifying [specific details] such as related or incompatible [subjects], what is to be forsaken, the remedy, cause and result, etc.
Fifth is the response to objections. Concerning the difficult points of the text (or discourse), the student may raise questions or objections, such as, “Are not such and such contradictory?” or, “How can this be?” The teacher should then resolve such qualms and ascertain the meaning of the text with arguments consistent with logic and scriptural references.

For the brightest and most capable students, the teacher may explain deep and far-reaching subjects, using precise language and a coherent presentation. For students of limited intelligence and lesser capability, the teacher must present comprehensible subjects in a way pleasant to listen to and in easily retained and accessible language. Once the students have developed their analytical powers to some degree and are able to grasp the relationship between words and their meanings, the teacher may delve into the subtle details of the subject and delineate connections and contradictions.
The teacher should encourage dispirited persons who feel unable to listen to and make a living experience of the teaching, such as obtuse students, the elderly, those who have only a short time to live, or those who are able to study and meditate but feel they have no spare time to do so. The teacher may urge them to reflect upon the life stories of the exalted Shudapanthaka[119] and others or upon sayings such as[120]:
Develop your mind, even though you may die tomorrow. You may not become a sage in this life,
But, like wealth left in someone's care, You can retrieve your learning in the next.
In order to spiritually inspire those who are attached to worldly affairs, or distracted and excited by sense pleasures, the teacher provides illustrations of impermanence and explains the shortcomings of sensual indulgence and the dreadfulness of miserable forms of life. To those subject to drowsiness and apathy, etc., the teacher relates remarkable events [to motivate them] and explains the negative consequences of such states of mind.

The [Medium Length Transcendent Wisdom] Discourse states:
Listen with attention, listen closely, and bear in mind [what you hear]! I will teach you.
These words [of the Buddha] indicate the way we should listen [to spiritual instructions] by first eliminating the three defects comparable to those of a jug. To “listen with attention” means to eliminate the defect of being like a jug turned upside down. If we do not perk up our ears when the words of the doctrine are being spoken and instead become self-absorbed due to lack of interest, or because we are distracted by something else, or affected by dullness or drowsiness, it is as if juice were being poured onto an overturned jug.
To “listen closely” means to eliminate the defect of being like a dirty jug. If we listen to the teaching with a mind tainted by emotions, what we have heard will not be useful to us or others, like juice poured into a dirty jug. Therefore, we must eliminate ideas influenced by emotions such as pride or skepticism.
To “bear in mind what you hear” means to eliminate the defect of being like a leaky jug. If we are dispirited when receiving teachings, we will make no effort [to retain] the words [and their] meaning and our listening will be wasted, like juice poured into a leaky jug. Therefore, we must strive to eliminate feelings of inadequacy and listen [carefully].

Accordingly, the Principles of Elucidation[121] lists six improper ways of listening, all of which are included within the [previously mentioned] three defects like those of a jug.
The [six] improper ways of receiving teaching
Are to listen with pride, skepticism,[122]
Lacking interest, distracted outwardly,
With apathy,[123]
Or with lassitude.
“Etc.” in the root verses above refers to additional guidelines given in the same text on how to listen to the teaching: we should listen to the doctrine while using sixteen antidotes to counteract thirteen particular faults[124] and relinquishing six defects: the defect concerning one's [physical and mental] actions, of lack of interest, of irreverence, of [inappropriate] intention, of incompatibility, and of apprehension. (The last two have five aspects each.[125])
When listening to a teaching, we should do so keeping in mind the metaphors found in the Flower Array Scripture, such as the following: regarding ourselves as ill, the teaching as the cure for the disease, and the spiritual master as the physician; or ourselves as passengers, the teaching as a ferry, and the master as the ferryman; or ourselves as inexperienced [travelers], the teaching as the conveyance, and the master as the driver.[126]

At the conclusion of the discourse, the teacher should perform three noble activities. First is the request that the buddhas excuse any errors he or she has made [in the teaching]. This is accomplished by reciting appropriate words such as the following[127]:
In the presence of the buddhas I openly acknowledge
Any mistakes I may have made
Under the influence of unwholesome states of mind.
The second is the dedication, directing the virtue [of teaching] to the goal of awakening by reciting prayers of dedication, such as the following one [from the Buddha's discourses][128]:
By this merit, may I attain omniscience,
[And upon defeating the enemy of unwholesomeness, May I rescue from the ocean of existence all beings
Swept by the turbulent waves of aging, sickness, and death].
or these words of Asanga:
Through the limitless merit I have created
By expounding the precious doctrine of the Universal Way, May all beings become perfectly receptive
To this true and precious teaching.
The third is to seal the teaching with the state of nonconceptualization.
The Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life states[129]:
Generosity that is empty of gift, recipient, and benefactor Is called the transcendent perfection.
Accordingly, [the teaching activity] should be sealed with [contemplation on] the nonconceptual wisdom that is free of the limited concepts [of agent, act, and object].

As students, we have three tasks: First, we show our appreciation by giving remuneration; remembering [the master's] kindness, we make prostrations and offerings, such as a mandala[130] of thanksgiving.
Second, we dedicate the merits [of listening to the teaching] to the goal of awakening by reciting Asanga's prayer (above), substituting the words “listening to” for “expounding.”
Third, we maintain mindful awareness of the words and meaning of the teaching, as advised in Sönam Tsemo's Gateway to the Doctrine[131]:
Mindful of the teaching, go to a solitary place. Without distraction or apathy, reflect continuously on whatever instruction you have received! Read it! Write it! Question your spiritual master on all points about which you have doubts! Make the teaching a living experience and then please your master by showing your appreciation.

The manifold virtues of study of and reflection on the teachings are taught in the Garland of the Former Lives of the Buddha and other sources such as the Analysis of Discipline Scripture, which states:
Persons who have listened and reflected extensively earn five benefits: they become learned in the subject of the aggregates, learned in the subject of the experiential elements, learned in the subject of the experiential media, learned in the subject of interdependent origination, and acquire the skill to present these subjects as teachers in their own rights.
The sutras and tantras all proclaim the merits of listening to the doctrine to be inconceivable. Accordingly, the Principles of Elucidation[132] states:
The Blessed One declared that five merits are acquired by listening to the doctrine: by listening, you become learned, and you acquire mastery [of the doctrine]; thereby, your doubts are quelled and your philosophical views are rectified; and by virtue of discriminative awareness, you will gain understanding of the words and the profound meaning [of the teaching].
Among the myriad virtues attributed to teaching the doctrine, the Inspiring Universal Responsibility Scripture gives a list of twenty.[133] All of those stem from the following three: teaching is the best way to honor the buddhas; it is the highest gift one can make to others; and by teaching, the teacher's merit increases and he or she gains supernatural knowledge.
The benefits accrued from upholding the doctrine that are mentioned in several [sources] are summarized in the [Scripture] Revealing the [Inconceivable] Secrets of the Transcendent One[134]:
Even if for millions of eons The buddhas were to describe
The merits of preserving the sacred teachings [They] could not possibly encompass them all.
The particular merits of expounding the Universal Way or listening to it are described in many scriptures in the following way. In the context of the basis for spiritual life, the merits outshine those of teaching and listening to the doctrine of the Individual Way. In the context of the experiential cultivation of the path, by virtue of these merits, each and every obscuration is overcome. In the context of the fruition, the merits [culminate in] the attainment of complete buddhahood.

[The merits] accrued from spiritual practice done in order to gain realization far surpass even those [mentioned above]. Simply taking seven steps in the direction of a place of spiritual practice while aware of the selfless nature of persons and phenomena is said to yield inconceivable merits. To be concerned only with hearing the teaching without making a living experience of it is utterly meaningless. Therefore, [the Buddha in his] discourses spoke of twenty shortcomings of taking delight only in listening to the doctrine. Nevertheless, to engage in ethical and contemplative disciplines without [sufficient] study is like a blind person embarking on a journey. Thus, a supremely qualified practitioner is one who both is learned and has made a living experience of the teaching. Accordingly, the Scripture Ornament states[135]:
The meditation of the yogi[136] is not fruitless.
The teaching of the joyful ones is never without value.
If reality could be perceived simply through learning, then meditation would be without purpose.
If meditation could be cultivated without study, teaching would be senseless.
The benefits [that result] from integrating learning with living experience are unfathomable, as stated by the exalted Nagarjuna:
Wisdom is enhanced by study
And reflection. When both are present, Meditation will also develop accordingly.
With meditation, unsurpassable awakening is attained.

Followers of the ancient tradition of our teacher, the unsurpassable King of the Shakyas, should first train in the foundation for all good qualities, the three forms of precious morality established by the Buddha himself. These disciplines contain the essence of the practice of the Buddha's teaching. The Indestructible Peak Tantra states[1]:
When tantric adepts are renunciates, They thereby hold all three sets of vows
Whose nature is the ethics of personal liberation, Of the bodhisattva, and of the awareness holder.
Further[2]:
To live by the three [sets of] vows Is said to be the first cleansing.[3]
These three ethical systems are known as the disciplines of the proclaimers (śrāvaka), the bodhisattvas, and the transcendent ones; or as the vows of personal liberation, of the bodhisattva, and of the awareness holder (vidyādhara). Accordingly, Atisha, the sole lord, has said:
The first discipline is to train in the footsteps of the saints (arhat); the middle discipline, to train in the footsteps of the bodhisattvas of the past; and the Secret Mantra discipline, to train in the footsteps of the buddhas.

The basis for the definition of the vows of personal liberation of the proclaimers consists in ethics motivated by concern for one's own peace alone. This concern is not based simply on a desire to be protected from anxiety or a wish to excel, but is an intention to emerge from all aspects of cyclic existence.[4]

</d>
<d e="2">
The vows of personal liberation are defined as the intention (as well as concomitant mental states) to forsake both injury to others and the basis [of injury].
[Karma Trinlepa's] Chariot of Karma[5] clarifies the above in stating that “injury” refers to the seven unwholesome deeds of body and speech.[6] “Basis,” which generally carries five different meanings,[7] here means motive, and refers to the three unwholesome states of mind[8] that form the impulse [to injure others]. “Both” (in the root verses) indicates that the vows include both the forsaking of injury and its basis.
In brief, all of the seven vows[9] of personal liberation are fulfilled in the forsaking of the ten unvirtuous actions.[10] “As well as concomitant mental factors” signifies that while the intention is the primary factor, its correlated mental factors are also part of the vows.
A different explanation states that “injury to others” refers to the seven unwholesome deeds of body and speech, and “basis,” to related or similar deeds.[11] Thus, the vows of personal liberation can be concisely defined as the ethics of forsaking unwholesome deeds of body and speech only. Accordingly, [Purnavardhana's] Commentary on the Treasury of Phenomenology states[12]:
As they discipline body and speech, they are known as vows of personal liberation.
This last interpretation is shared by all experts on the treatises [dealing with this subject]. Therefore, it seems reasonable to regard the former view as reflecting, primarily, the [vows of] personal liberation of the Universal Way and the latter as defining the nature of the [vows of] personal liberation of the proclaimers.

A sketch of the principal assertions concerning the essence of the vows of personal liberation will be provided first, and then these assertions will be expanded upon.
According to the Analysts (vaibhāṣika),[13] the vows have form, either perceptible or imperceptible,[14] and are connected to the individual by the “rope” of acquisition.[15] The Traditionalists (sautrāntika) hold a different view, stating that [the vows amount to] a complete transformation of the continuum of mind. The Idealists (cittamātrin) consider [the vows] to be both the seed and the continuity of the intention to forsake what is unwholesome. For the Centrist (mādhyamika) proponents of intrinsic emptiness (Tib. rang stong pa), [the vows] consist in the intention (and concomitant mental factors) to renounce [unwholesome deeds]. Stated concisely, the Traditionalists and the higher schools agree that the vows have the nature of consciousness and that they form with an attitude of disengagement [from cyclic existence] serving as their substantial condition, and with the essential elements[16] [for assuming the vows], etc., serving as their cooperative conditions.
[Since the above summary of the main views] is difficult to understand, it will now be explained to some extent. [According to the Analysts,] in the very first moment that the vows of personal liberation are assumed, they have the essence both of perceptible and imperceptible form. [The vows have the essence of perceptible form in that the aspirant, in order to assume them,] relies on the perceptible form of others (the ordaining preceptor, the ceremonial master, etc.[17]). From the second moment onward, as long as the vows have not been violated, they remain with the person [only] as the essence of an imperceptible form. The same criterion applies to the vows regarding the seven virtuous actions that have form (not to murder, etc.): in their first moment, they possess both perceptible and imperceptible forms. Then, from the second moment onward, they exist only as an imperceptible form. Therefore, in consideration of the first moment in which they are assumed, [Analysts] say that [the vows have] both [perceptible and imperceptible] forms.

[Traditionalists] assert that the essence of the vows is simply a transformation from one frame of mind into a new one, for example, the change in the attitude of someone who comes to regard himself as a [Buddhist] lay practitioner, a novice, [or a monk] as a result of undergoing the ceremony in which the respective vows are assumed.
[The Idealists, or] “Proponents of the Aspect of Consciousness” (vijñānavādin), as a consequence of their belief in the existence of a fundamental consciousness, assert that physical actions such as those related to the vows [of personal liberation] are of the nature of the mind stream. The Idealists thus maintain [that the essence of the vows is] the continuum of the intention to forsake [unwholesome deeds] and the seed of the propensity [for that intention], which coexists with the fundamental consciousness. This is because (they say), if you were to consider the essence of the vows as just an intention, when the person who has assumed them falls under the sway of distraction, unconsciousness, or similar states, their continuity would be broken. On the other hand, if you were to consider the essence of the vows as a propensity alone, they would not be lost even when violated.
Centrist proponents of intrinsic emptiness, who do not accept the existence of a fundamental consciousness, assert [that the essence of the vows is] the intention (together with its concomitant mental factors) to forsake [unwholesome deeds]. However, Chandrakirti[18] in his Analysis of the Five Aggregates,[19] a treatise on the Central Way, considers [the vows] to be imperceptible form, and Lord Drigungpa[20] and Taktsang the Translator[21] stressed the same view with clever arguments.
In brief, most scholars are of the opinion that the vows at the desire realm level (defined as the ethics of abandoning unwholesome conduct, imbued with an attitude of renunciation) have form.

[The discipline of] personal liberation is known as prātimokṣa [in Sanskrit] since it effects the individual's (prāti) liberation (mokṣa) from cyclic existence.[22] It is also referred to as “morality” (śīla) as it gives cool relief from the distressing heat of the emotions and uplifts the nature of body, speech, and mind; “virtue” because it is praised by the wise; “endeavor” since its nature is that of engagement; “vow” by virtue of serving as a dam that blocks moral corruption, and because it restrains body and speech.

<d e="2">
Three categories of discipline are distinguished according to the level [of existence] where each is found: the vows of personal liberation within the level of the desire realm; those of meditative absorption within the level of the form realm; and the uncontaminated vows within the levels of the exalted ones,[23] the last transcending the three realms of existence.
The first consists in the ethical conduct of forsaking unwholesome conduct, which is followed by Buddhists living in the desire realm. The second is the ethics of gods of the form realm, acquired through contemplation. The third is the ethics of supramundane beings, which is derived from uncontaminated wisdom.[24]
According to the Analysts, since the three [ethics] are substantially incompatible, they cannot coexist in a single mental continuum. Followers of the Universal Way, however, assert that the three ethics can coexist without contradiction. For example, the vows of personal liberation in the mind of an exalted bodhisattva encompass all three ethics: the forsaking of unwholesome conduct, the ethics pertaining to the actual meditative absorption,[25] and the [uncontaminated] ethics that are of the nature of the exalted path.

The vows of personal liberation are of seven categories when distinguished according to the person: (1) the [vows of the] monk (bhikṣu),[26] (2) the nun (bhikṣūnī), (3) the male novice (śrāmaṇera),[27] (4) the female novice (śrāmaṇerikā), (5) the layman practitioner (upasaka),[28] (6) the laywoman practitioner (upasīka), and (7) the postulant nun (śikṣāmanā).
Another system separates the vows of the purificatory fast (upavāsa)[29] from those of the lay practitioner and thereby lists eight categories of vows. These eight categories may be condensed into four types that differ in nature or substance: from among the renunciate vows, those of the monk and the nun form one type, and the vows of [the postulant nun and] the male and female novice form a second type; from among the lay vows, those of the male and female lay practitioner form a third type, and the purificatory fast [vows][30] form a fourth type. Only seven [of the eight categories] meet the necessary requirements for the discipline of personal liberation. There are two different views [concerning which vows constitute the seven]: one excludes the precepts of the purificatory fast [since they are assumed just for one day]; the other, those of the vows of the postulant nun since this discipline does not last for a lifetime, nor does it last for just one day.[31]

In the original procedure for conferring monastic ordination, the aspirant became a monk without any complex ritual. The present-day procedure confers ordination with a considerable amount of ritual. Analysts have recorded ten ways persons became instantaneously ordained as monks and nuns in the original way[32]:
(1) Spontaneously; for example, at the moment the Buddha and solitary sages gained knowledge of the final extinction of the emotions, thereby achieving awakening, they became monks.
(2) By realizing pristine awareness; for example, when the excellent group of five[33] achieved the path of seeing, they became monks.
(3) By being called [by the Buddha], “Come hither, monks!” For example, at the moment [the Buddha called upon] Shariputra[34] and others to come before him, they became monks.
(4) By accepting the teacher; for example, at the moment Mahakashyapa[35] accepted the Buddha as his teacher, he become a monk.
(5) By taking refuge; for example, at the moment the sixty followers of Bhadrasena accepted the triple refuge, they became monks.
(6) By accepting the eight severe precepts[36]; for example, at the moment when Mahaprajapati[37] and others (five hundred women of the Shakya clan) promised to maintain the eight precepts difficult to observe, they became nuns.
(7) By pleasing the Buddha with a [correct] answer; for example, at the moment the Buddha rejoiced after Sudatta answered a particular question, Sudatta became a monk.
(8) By messenger; for example, at the moment Dharmadinna,[38] whose parents prevented her [from becoming a nun], received the ordained community's message of approval brought by the messenger, the nun Utpala, she became a nun.
(9) By an assembly of [at least] ten masters of the discipline in the central region; or
(10) By an assembly of [at least] five masters of the discipline in a remote region, through a four-part formal procedure including proposal[39] that conferred instantaneously the status of monk.

[This ordination] was conferred by an exalted preceptor upon aspirants of pure mind, that is, disciples whose three impediments (of intentional actions, emotions, and fruition[40]) were minimal and whose intelligence, continuum, and faculties were ripened.[41] Once the present-day procedure [of ordination] was introduced, the former method was discontinued.[42] The present method, a four-part procedure, has been [the only one] in use from the time of the passing of the Buddha and his circle [of close disciples] until now. It must be performed by an assembly of ten [monks] in a central region or five in a remote region.
The distinction between a central region and a remote region may be made in terms of geography, in which case, roughly speaking, central India is considered to be the central region,[43] and the regions exterior to be remote regions. In spiritual terms, a central region is an area where the Buddha's teachings as transmission and as spiritual accomplishment[44] are found, and the remote regions are those in which these are not found.

Only men and women of three continents[45] are suitable candidates for any of the eight vows of personal liberation. Accordingly, Gunaprabha's [Fundamental] Summary of Discipline[46] says:
Non-humans and inhabitants of the northern [continent] of Unpleasant Sound are not eligible candidates for the vows.
Eunuchs and hermaphrodites are also not eligible to assume the vows. The scriptures on discipline, however, mention that the naga Kumaraka observed the purificatory fast on the eighth day of the [lunar] month. Furthermore, the Stories of Buddha's Former Lives recounts details of four [animals], such as an “elder” partridge, who observed the purificatory fast.[47] Traditionalists take these accounts literally and thus believe that animals and other beings can assume [the precepts
of] the purificatory fast.

While assuming the vows of personal liberation, the candidate must not make any of the following five stipulations with regard to region, time, situation, persons, and minor rules:
(1) To intend to safeguard the vows provided one is living in a region that has supportive conditions, but not in others;
(2) To intend to safeguard the vows for at least a month or a year, but not longer, thinking that one would not be able to do so;
(3) To intend to maintain the vows in all situations, except in case of war;
(4) To intend to abstain from murder, unless the other is one's enemy;
(5) To intend to keep the major rules, but not the minor ones.
An aspirant who attends the ceremony for monastic ordination with the wish to become a monk (or likewise, a novice) but makes any of these five stipulations will not actually assume the vows, but will at least have participated in something good.
Furthermore, the candidate must be free of the obstacles that would prevent assuming the vows, the obstacles to abiding by them, and obstacles to their meaningfulness, plus obstacles concerning physical appearance, explained, respectively, as follows:
(1) Being a neuter person or one who has committed [any of] the crimes of immediate retribution or other [serious offenses], etc.[48];
(2) Not having the approval of one's [country's] ruler, or of one's parents or guardians, etc.[49];
(3) Not being able to drive away crows [meaning to be less than eight years old], or being incapacitated by [serious] sickness or affliction, etc.[50];
(4) Having blond hair or deformed ears, etc.[51]
These stipulations and obstacles, however, are not considered detrimental factors in assuming the precepts of the lay practitioner or those of the purificatory fast.

The Treasury of Phenomenology[52] states:
Except for the person who has not gone for refuge, Anyone may assume [the purificatory fast] vows.
Thus expressed, an aspirant who has not gone for refuge in the Three Jewels[53] cannot receive the precepts of the purificatory fast or, for that matter, any of the vows of personal liberation.
Analysts assert that any of the eight classes of personal liberation vows must be conferred by a monk. However, Traditionalists say that the precepts of the purificatory fast may be taken from anyone who is observing the purificatory fast, either a lay practitioner or a renunciate. Accordingly, the Brahmana Vyasa Scripture[54] states:
...in the presence of one who has knowledge of the ceremony, whether it be a monk, a brahman, a householder, or a novice.
Also, the Analysis of Discipline Scripture[55] mentions that the layman Anathapindika[56] transmitted the precepts of the purificatory fast to a large crowd of people.
In any case, the various perspectives agree that the aspirant must assume the eight precepts of the purificatory fast before dawn in the presence of a practitioner holding the same precepts and preserve them until sunrise of the next day, a period of one full day.
When assuming these precepts for the first time, the aspirant may promise the teacher that he or she will also maintain the precepts on the [days of the] full moon, the new moon, and the eighth day of every [lunar] month. Despite that [promise], each time that aspirant intends to practice the purificatory fast, he or she must assume the precepts anew.
According to the Analysts, making a single promise [to maintain these eight precepts on the various days of the month] allows one to retake the precepts [on the next occasion] even after having eaten.[57] According to the Traditionalists, [this promise] authorizes one to retake the precepts by oneself in front of a representation [of the Three Jewels].
The main part of the ceremony [for the transmission of the precepts of the purificatory fast] involves repeating the words of the preceptor three times while sitting lower than him or her.

The three levels of vows—those of the lay practitioner, the novice, and the monk—are conferred in ceremonies that fulfill the requisites for their respective level. [As to the order,] higher grades of discipline cannot be given unless the candidate has received the lower ones.
The following description of the procedure for the conferral of vows is made in terms of an aspirant who is assuming all three types of discipline. (An independent ceremony must be performed in the case of someone who wishes to follow only the precepts of the lay practitioner or only the novice precepts.)
The vows of a lay practitioner may constitute a “partial discipline” (consisting of one, two, three, or four precepts) or a “perfect discipline”
(comprising five precepts as the basis of training). Only the perfect discipline of holding five precepts may be considered as the actual lay practitioner discipline that constitutes two [i.e., male and female] of the eight categories of personal liberation vows.
For the first level, a monk qualified to be the ordaining preceptor for a renunciate asks [the aspirant] questions concerning obstacles to determine whether or not he is suitable to be admitted into the order.[58] Then, as the main part [of the ceremony of the first level],[59] the aspirant accepts the commitments of refuge and the lay practitioner's precepts. As the conclusion, the aspirant promises to follow the training. [The ceremony] for those individuals who are assuming only a partial [lay] discipline (and are not going to become renunciates) is modified to omit the questions concerning obstacles.

To become a novice (the second level), the aspirant participates in the preparatory phase of the ceremony for the interim renunciate.[60] The ceremonial master asks the aspirant questions[61] to determine whether he has any obstacles that could prevent him from being ordained. If the aspirant is free of obstacles, the ceremonial master addresses the members of the monastic community with the request to admit him into the order. Once permission is granted, the aspirant himself entreats the ordaining preceptor to ordain him as a novice.[62] During the course of this preparatory phase of the ceremony, three transformations take place: the aspirant changes his outward appearance, name, and attitude.
For the main part [of the ceremony], the ordaining preceptor entrusts the aspirant to the ceremonial master. With the certainty that the aspirant is free from the four kinds of obstacles that would make him ineligible for ordination and possesses all five favorable conditions, the ceremonial master guides the aspirant, beginning with the refuge [vows], in assuming the novice vows.
At the conclusion of the ceremony, a monk [who is neither the ordaining preceptor nor the ceremonial master] measures the [length of the] shadow[63] and announces the time [of day, month, season, and year] that the novice ordination was received. The teacher states the ten rules of the novice and makes [sure the aspirant] confirms his commitment to maintain them.

The five favorable conditions [for the novice ordination] concern environment, mind continuum, outward appearance, attitude, and ceremony, and are explained, respectively, as follows: (1) [The ceremony takes place] in a land where the Three Jewels are honored and where there are monks qualified to ordain a novice. (2) The aspirant has not already received the ordination, has no residue of old vows obstructing him,[64] and has assumed the lower levels [of discipline].
(3) The aspirant forsakes the attire of a layperson and takes on the threefold aspect of the renunciate: to be shaven, to wear the robes, and to use the begging bowl and the other monastic accessories. (4) The aspirant's attitude is one of renunciation, which permeates his aspiration to become a novice (the underlying causal motive), his awareness of having become [a novice] (the motive of the moment[65]), the freedom from the five unfavorable conditions,[66] and the presence of all three excellent conditions.[67] (5) The refuge ceremony is performed first, following which the aspirant repeats three times the phrases formalizing the novice ordination.

The ordination of a monk[68] (the third level) requires ten essential elements: the Buddha, the doctrine, the monastic community, the preceptor, the teachers, the aspiration to become a monk, the monastic necessities, purity, the proposal, and the ceremony.
The essential element of the Buddha refers to a consecrated image of the Buddha placed [on the shrine].
The essential element of the doctrine refers to the doctrine as spiritual accomplishment, [represented by] the officiating monks' zeal in following the discipline; and the doctrine as transmission, [represented by] the ordination ceremony itself.
The essential element of the monastic community refers to three requirements: The first is a quorum of four [monks] who form the officiating group (excluding the ordaining preceptor). The second requirement is that the monks have the necessary virtues [which means that they must be free of the following defects]: standing rather than sitting; deserving punishment or other disciplinary measures; not attending personally the ceremony but giving their assent to it; not being true monks; responsible for violating the vows; guilty of a crime of immediate retribution; adhering to bad opinions such as that drinking alcohol and other such offenses are not unvirtuous; having been demoted or delegated to menial tasks; being of unsound mind (subject to insanity); not living within the same monastic boundary, but in another; being the opposite sex (a nun); and following another [religion]. The third requirement is that the monks do not behave in two contrary ways: (1) not attending the ordination but [instead simply] giving their assent to it, reporting their purity from downfalls, etc.; or (2) leaving [without permission].
The essential element of the ordaining preceptor is fulfilled by a monk well-qualified in terms of steadfastness and learning, who, moreover, has no lapse of discipline[69] that has been seen, heard of, or suspected by the aspirant.

The essential element of the teachers refers to the ceremonial master who is skilled at performing ceremonies in the midst of the monastic community and the interviewer who is capable of covertly investigating whether the aspirant has obstacles [to ordination] and then informing the inner [circle of the ordaining monks] of the result of his inquiry.[70] To fulfill properly his role, the interviewer must be free of the four biases of intimacy, fear, dislike, and inability to recognize the aspirant's impediments. Intimacy with the aspirant might tempt the interviewer to conceal the aspirant's possible obstacles; fear of him could make him reticent to report them; antagonism could lead him to falsely claim that the aspirant is unfit; and incapacity to determine whether an aspirant is qualified or not might allow the aspirant's unfitness to go unreported.
The essential element of sincere aspiration to become a monk refers to the wish to assume the monk's vows with a spirit of renuncia-
tion. [For this aspiration to be fulfilled, the candidate must] be at least twenty years of age, know how to express himself, understand the meaning of words, and be in a sound state of mind.[71] [In addition, he must] not harbor thoughts incompatible with the ordination[72] or make any of the five stipulations, or have already taken these vows.
The essential element of the monastic necessities consists in a complete set of five articles: the three robes of proper measure (either the [robes] already sewn or material suitable [for making them], no [piece being] longer or wider than a cubit); a permissible begging bowl of the prescribed dimensions; a cloth mat and a water strainer.
The essential element of purity refers to the absence of the four kinds of obstacles, and so forth.
The essential element of proposal refers to the request made three times by the aspirant to the ordaining community.
The essential element of the ceremony is a four-part formal procedure including proposal that is conducted in its entirety, without error or confusion [regarding the structure].

The ceremony is arranged in three parts: the preparation, the main ceremony, and the conclusion.
The preparation serves the purpose of assembling the first nine essential elements. The main ceremony begins with the proposal, followed by the monastic community's formal procedure of full ordination. The conclusion consists in the announcement of the time the ordination was conferred in order to determine who is to be shown reverence [based on seniority].[73] Following this, [the ceremonial master] gives [the new monk] eleven instructions on points of discipline as aids to safeguarding the vows and developing the training related to them. Nine of these relate to the focus of training, [the vows] received; the [last] two points relate to the person engaged in the training.[74]
The ceremonies that confer the lay practitioner vows or the novice vows on a woman are essentially the same as those for a man, except for the aspirant being referred to as “the woman known as...,” instead of “the man known as...,” and the additional questions posed to the woman. The precepts of the postulant nun may be assumed at the age of eighteen in the case of one who has not been married and at the age of ten in the case of a woman who has been married. This ordination is conferred by a group of twelve nuns in a central region, or six in a remote region, through a two-part ceremony including proposal.[75] After [two years], at the age of twenty (in the former case) and twelve (in latter case), the postulant becomes eligible to receive full ordination. This ordination is conferred in the following manner: The preceptress and the members of the nun's community, in the number previously specified, present the aspirant nun with the three robes, plus an undershirt and an upper robe [to absorb] perspiration, etc.— the attire [of a renunciate]. With the completion of the questions concerning obstacles, the vow for strict observance of celibacy is given.[76] Then the full ordination is bestowed in the presence of [the original group of nuns] augmented by a group of ordaining monks [ten in a central region and five in a remote region]. At the conclusion of the ceremony, the preceptor instructs [the new nun on the twelve] points of discipline, which include the eight defeating offenses, the eight severe precepts, and other rules.[77] However, it should be mentioned that the traditions for the ordinations of the postulant and fully ordained nun were never introduced in Tibet.

Ethical conduct is maintained by five methods: by relying on other individuals [as the external condition], through purity of mind [as the internal condition], by recognizing incompatible factors, through engagement in training, and by relying on the conditions for living comfortably.
First, ethical conduct is maintained by relying on the instructions of learned scholars and following the example of venerable [elder] monks. In particular, as soon a monk or nun has received full monastic ordination, he or she must begin studying under a tutor. (This is briefly explained below.)
Second, purity of mind or intention refers to zeal and conscientiousness in observing precepts and prohibitions, vigilance and mindfulness in examining the state of one's own mind, embarrassment in response to others' [judgment], and shame arising from one's own [conscience].
Third, recognition of incompatible factors means [knowing] the causes for losing the vows,[78] the conditions for damaging the vows,[79] factors [that help] to maintain the vows,[80] and the causes that hinder the mind's clarity.[81] In short, in order to know what the incompatible factors are, one should study, reflect upon, and follow the guidelines given in the scriptures on discipline.
Fourth, engagement in training refers to the observance of the three bases [of confession, rainy season retreat, and lifting of the restrictions]. Fifth, relying on the conditions for living comfortably entails shunning the thirty-six downfalls concerning robes, the twenty-two concerning food, the three concerning monastic articles, and the ten con-
cerning monastic sites and monks' quarters.[82]
The main causes for violating the vows are ignorance [of the rules], irreverence [for the discipline], negligence, and strong emotions. Therefore, as remedies to these, one applies these five methods of maintaining [ethical conduct] and strives to protect one's discipline as one would one's eyes.

The eight branches of the one-day purificatory fast consist of the four basic [precepts] to renounce murder, theft, sexual intercourse, and untruth, and [the four precepts] to abstain from drinking alcohol; dancing, etc., and the wearing of necklaces, etc.; using luxurious or high beds [and seats]; and eating after noon.
“Dancing, etc.” refers to singing, dancing, and [playing] musical instruments. “Necklaces, etc.” refers to the wearing of necklaces, perfumes, jewelry, and cosmetics. “Perfumes” means to perfume one's clothes, etc., in order that they have an agreeable fragrance. “Luxurious” refers to a bed made from precious materials such as jewels, and “high” to a bed being one cubit high or more; [this last rule,] however, does not apply [to the seat being used] when explaining the doctrine.
The four basic precepts are branches of ethical conduct; abstinence from drinking alcohol is a branch of conscientiousness, and the last three are branches of disciplined conduct. In this context, “disciplined conduct” means to renounce one's previous immoral ways as a lay person to engage in the conduct of the purificatory fast. The disciplined conduct of the lay practitioner and of the renunciate should also be understood in the same manner.
To these eight branches, the practice taught by Lord Atisha adds two [precepts]: eating vegetarian food[83] and drinking water [after the noon meal] as a reminder [that one is not supposed to eat afterwards]. Moreover, the purificatory fast allows the lay practitioner to purify and renew his or her vows, while for one who has not assumed layperson's vows, it simply serves as a purificatory fast. Renunciates need not be expressly concerned with the one-day purificatory fast.
The person who observes a life-long purificatory fast is known as a “venerable (gomi) lay practitioner.”[84] Concerning this, Vasubandhu states:
The “venerable lay practitioner” discipline is derived from the oral instructions transmitted by the Sthavira,[85] but it does not seem to have been taught by the Joyful One.
References to this [discipline], however, are found in the scriptures of the Universal Way. For example, Cluster of Jewels states that Prince Mind of Great Compassion took the eight precepts of the purificatory fast for life. Therefore, in the above words, Vasubandhu must have meant that the scriptures on discipline do not explicitly mention a life-long purificatory fast.

There are five types of lay practitioner. The first is known as the lay practitioner committed to the Three Jewels. Once he or she has taken refuge, this lay practitioner must follow the six special and five general precepts related to refuge alone, as they are explained by Lord Atisha.[86]
The first three special precepts concern prohibitions: having gone for refuge in the Buddha, a Buddhist must not venerate worldly deities; having gone for refuge in the doctrine of the Buddha, a Buddhist must refrain from injuring others; having gone for refuge in the Buddhist community, a Buddhist must not form close ties with religious extremists.
The other three special precepts concern obligations: the practitioner should regard as if it were the actual Three Jewels [and treat respectfully] any representation [of the Buddha], even just so much as a fragment of a votive image[87]; any symbol of his words, even a single letter; or any symbol of the Buddhist community, even someone wearing as much as a patch of yellow cloth.
The five general precepts are not to renounce the Three Jewels, even for the sake of one's life or country; to put one's trust exclusively in the [Three] Jewels, without seeking worldly means, however great the necessity or importance; to make offerings regularly to the Three Jewels on the prescribed occasions, with a constant appreciation of their qualities; to go for refuge with an awareness of the benefits [of doing so], and to encourage others to do the same; and to prostrate before the buddhas and depictions of them wherever one happens to be. These precepts are the preconditions not only for the vows of a lay practitioner but also for the purificatory fast and the novice and monk
disciplines.
In addition to these, the actual ethical conduct of the lay practitioner includes the four basic precepts [to abstain from murder, theft, adultery, and untruth], plus abstinence from intoxicating drinks, this last vow facilitating the preservation of the former ones.
Depending on the number [of precepts] one promises to follow, there are four types [of lay practitioners]: a lay practitioner who observes one precept alone (to abstain from murder); one who observes some precepts (to abstain also from stealing); one who observes most of the precepts (to abstain also from untruth); and the perfect lay practitioner who follows all five precepts, including forsaking adultery and drinking alcohol.

According to Analysts, when the aspirant receives any of these four precepts, he or she simply vows to be a lay practitioner and subsequently observes one, two, or however many he or she intended to follow.
For Traditionalists, however, this is not the case; they assert that during the ceremony to become a lay practitioner, the aspirant must assume the specific precept or precepts he or she wishes, and observe them thereafter. If, after having assumed all five precepts, the practitioner does not observe them all, his or her ethical conduct will be disrupted.
Traditionalists assert that there is yet another lay practitioner, the celibate lay practitioner, who renounces all forms of sexual intercourse. As implied in these words from the scriptures on discipline[88]:
Practicing the teachings even while wearing jewelry....
Further, the disciplines of the celibate layperson and the venerable practitioner of the purificatory fast [mentioned above][89] have been explicitly taught in the Display of Miracles Scripture. In both cases, since sexual intercourse has been renounced, the practitioner is no longer a householder, but as the [monastic] lifestyle has not been adopted, he or she is not considered a renunciate.
Concerning the lay practitioner who has entered the Secret Mantra, the Questions of Subahu Tantra states that he or she must follow all the rules set out in the scriptures on discipline [for the renunciates], with the exception of a few rules prescribed by the Buddha [for monks], such as taking on the attire of a monk, participation in formal monastic ceremonies, and not eating after noon.

The novice vows summarized under ten overt violations of the novice's ethical conduct are taught mainly for the sake of those aspirants who would become disheartened on hearing of many rules [and thus be reluctant to become novices]. Nine of these are the violations prohibited by the eight precepts of the purificatory fast. The extra one is derived from the transgression of the precept prohibiting dancing and wearing necklaces, that for a novice is split into two. The tenth is a rule not to accept gold and silver.
Transgressions of the four basic precepts, although the same as those of the monk, would be only “violations similar to a defeat” for a novice. The other six, failure to abstain from alcohol, etc., are minor infractions to be confessed. These novice rules may be subdivided into thirty-three:
(1-4) The four basic vows (not to murder, etc.);
(5-7) Three related to the rule not to murder: not to kill animals, not to use grass that has insects, and not to use water that contains insects;
(8-19) Twelve related to lying: to abstain from making groundless accusation or accusation for a trivial reason, causing a schism in the monastic community, taking sides, causing a layperson to lose faith, consciously lying, falsely accusing another monk of favoritism, censuring the caretaker of the monastic community, accusing another monk of teaching to get a little food, defaming [a monk] by accusing him of having committed a partially defeating offense, rejecting the discipline out of disdain for it, and covering the [vegetables with] rice when wanting more [vegetables];
(20) One to abstain from drinking alcohol;
(21-23) Three to abstain from dancing, [singing, and music];
(24-26) Three to abstain from wearing necklaces, [cosmetics, and perfumes];
(27-28) Two to abstain from the use of a luxurious bed or a high bed;
(29) One to abstain from eating after noon;
(30) One not to accept gold and silver;
(31-33) Three to safeguard oneself from the three types of deteriorations: [adopting the attire of a layperson, giving up the monastic attire, and despising the preceptor]. There are other ways of enumerating the novice rules.[90]

Except for the permissible transgressions to the rules, any offense that would be a downfall for the monk is also an infraction for the novice,[91] though a minor one. Such an infraction can be remedied by privately reaffirming one's intention to refrain from the act in the future. No public confession is required.

Accordingly, in his Luminous Commentary on the Three Hundred Stanzas on the Novitiate,[92] Shakyaprabha explains in detail how [the novice] should maintain all of the monks' rules as part of a concordant ethical conduct. However, the transgressions of thirteen rules for monks are not even infractions for the novice by virtue of dispensation. In addition (to explain “etc.” in the root verses), six other transgressions are permissible according to Tibetan masters of the discipline. These nineteen permissible transgressions of the monks' rules are as follows[93]: (1) Keeping extra cloth, (2) being separate from one's robes, (3) keeping an extra begging bowl, (4) tilling the soil, (5) Handling precious objects, (6) lighting a fire, (7) resuming eating, (8) climbing or (9) cutting trees, (10) Eating what has not been ritually offered and accepted, (11) urinating or defecating on the grass, (12) Partaking of food that has been stored, and (13) destroying seeds.
The six are: (1) retaining [cloth] for more than a month, (2) storing [any of the three kinds of food], (3) being without [one's robes] while in seclusion, (4) [Going to the village] without informing [a senior monk], (5) withdrawing assent, and (6) sleeping in the same room as the unordained.

Once the aspirant has been ordained as a postulant nun, in addition to the ten precepts of the female novice, she must observe the [six basic and six additional] rules of that [ordination] for two years. Vishakhadeva states[94]:
These six basic rules
Have been prescribed for the postulant nun:
She should not travel alone, Swim across a river,
Touch a man,
Sit together with him,
Conceal downfalls [of other postulants],
Or arrange a union [between a male and a female].
Further:
Do not commit these offenses:
Handling gold, Shaving the pubic hair, Tilling the soil,
Cutting grass and other plants,
Eating what has not been ritually given and accepted, And eating food that has been stored.
These are the six additional rules.
Moreover, it is explained that, with the exception of seven transgressions[95] that are admissible, the postulant nun should preserve the entire ethical code of a nun.

As soon as an aspirant has taken the vows of a novice or monk, he should study under a well-qualified tutor and follow correctly the rules until he has acquired the two qualities relating to steadfastness and learning. Steadfastness refers to having preserved full ordination for ten years without interruption, and learning, to erudition possessing the five characteristics.[96]
If the monk or novice is living [in a monastery] with the preceptor who has ordained him, that preceptor will automatically be his tutor, and he does not need to perform the ceremony of accepting him as tutor. If he is not living with his ordaining preceptor, he should search for a monk who is qualified to be a tutor and perform the ceremony of accepting him as such.[97] Then, as the sun rises on the second day, he becomes his tutor.[98]
A tutor is allowed to be the instructor for many monks; however, he cannot accept more than one novice [into his care]. Since it is not permissible [for a monk] to stay with a novice for more than three nights, [a novice] should not stay with the tutor but should reside nearby.
Concerning the way of studying under the tutor, it is said[99]:
Once he has accepted a tutor, the monk should request permission from his teacher for whatever he wishes to do.
Accordingly, with the exceptions of permitted times or activities (such as prostrating before a nearby stupa, defecating and urinating, or being absent for one day), the monk should not simply act on his own, but should ask his teacher for permission.[100]
The teacher must offer good counsel and give teaching [to the student] in the proper way. Disregard of the reciprocal obligations[101] on the part of the teacher and the monk under his care nullify their tutor and tutored status.

The class of defeating offenses consists of four acts: (1) Sexual intercourse refers to the experience of orgasm arising from the contact made when the penis penetrates any of the three [orifices]—the mouth, anus, or vagina—of a living being, be it male, female, neuter, or animal, or of a corpse with at least half the body.
(2) Theft refers to personally stealing, or inducing someone else to steal, another person's possessions of significant value. The measure of significant value in India equals the value of four hundred cowrie shells, or one quarter karshapana.[103] To steal an object equal in worth to that [would be the defeating offense]. In Tibet, an object is considered of significant value when it is worth one bushel of barley when there is no famine, or one-half bushel of barley in times of famine. Thus, what has significant value must be determined in the context of each individual country.
(3) Murder is to kill, or to induce another to kill, a human being or a foetus in the earliest [or later] stages of development in the womb[104] with a weapon, poison, mantra, or in other ways. [As for inducing another to kill,] the Treasury of Phenomenology states[105]:
In war and similar circumstances, those who share the same purpose
Bear [the same responsibility] as the one who carries out the action.
(4) Telling lies about one's level of spiritual attainment[106] (saying one has qualities superior to human attributes) is to falsely claim that one has attained high or superior qualities not easily accomplished by a human being. Falsely claiming to be enlightened, to have clairvoyance, to have experienced signs of spiritual accomplishment, to have seen a deity, and other such examples would fall into this category. Vishakhadeva[107] clarifies the meaning of the words “superior to human attributes” (Tib. mi'i chos bla ma):
According to this doctrine, the five types of impediments [to the three trainings]
Are known as human attributes [mi'i chos]
And their cessation is asserted as the superior quality [bla ma].[108]
The five impediments [to the three trainings]—longing for objects of desire, ill-will, sleep and drowsiness, excitement and remorse, and reservations [concerning the doctrine]—are the natural tendencies or attributes of ordinary persons.[109] The cessation of those tendencies is “superior” since as a result of their ending, the mental level of higher realms is attained.

A monk who has incurred any of these four offenses and has concealed the fact for even a single moment[110] entirely destroys his ordination. They are therefore known as root downfalls. No remedy can repair these violations and thus they are known as the four “defeats” or the class of defeating offenses.
Various details pertain to the downfalls discussed above and below: the circumstances [that determined the prescription of the rules], the negative effects [of incurring a downfall], the result, the attitude, the deed [transgression], its fulfillment, exceptions,[111] cases in which there is no downfall [even though one has transgressed the rule], the advice regarding them, etc. These details will not be elaborated upon in this work. Bright persons can study these details by referring to the works on this subject by the second buddha in this age of conflict, Butön [Rinchen Drup],[112] and the Great Commentary on Discipline by the Eighth [Karmapa, Mikyö Dorjé].[113] Beginners should refer to the Commentary on the Three Vows by the great translator Dharmashri,[114] or the Three Vows by the venerable Pema Karpo,[115] or that of the master Wönkarma.[116]

<d e="2">
What should be noted here is that the presence or absence of four complementary aspects—basis, attitude, act, and consummation — determines whether or not a downfall is an actual defeat. In the case of sexual intercourse, for example, the basis [for the act] refers to any one of the three unimpaired orifices[117] and a healthy and functional male organ.[118] The attitude is lust devoid of any fear or shame. The act refers to [even] the slightest penetration. The consummation refers to the experience of orgasm. The defeating offense itself is incurred when all four aspects are present. The offense is a serious infraction[119] within the [category of] defeats if any one of the aspects is missing. In other words, defeating offenses may be major or minor depending on the number of complementary aspects accompanying the act.
The number of aspects must also be considered in cases of partial defeats and other offenses. If one aspect is missing in a partial defeat, the act is referred to as a serious violation within the [category of] partial defeats. For all other downfalls, if one aspect is not present, the act is a minor infraction.
Simply to have intended to pursue the desire [to commit an offense that would be a defeat] is a minor infraction to be restrained from in the future; in addition to the intention, to pursue the act short of consummation is a downfall of plotting. In the case of insanity, no downfall is incurred. The same applies to other kinds of downfalls. While many details are described [in other texts], those are the main points.

Thirteen offenses constitute the class of partial defeats of the monastic community:
(1) Ejaculation means to emit semen through [contact with] a part of one's body such as the fingers, or a part of another person's body, with the exception of the three [orifices] of mouth, anus, or vagina.
(2)Touching or holding is to touch the bare skin of a woman[120] motivated by sexual desire.
(3) Speaking of sexual intercourse is to use lascivious language with a woman, with words that suggest sexual intercourse, etc., motivated by lust.[121]
(4) Extolling reverence means, motivated by sexual desire, to suggest to a woman in glorified terms that sexual intercourse would be a good way to revere oneself.
(5) Matchmaking means to cause a previously uninvolved man and woman to engage in sexual intercourse by carrying or having another carry a message between them three times.[122] [Vishakadeva's Stanzas on the Discipline] states[123]:
The sword of the partial defeat Will cut off the head
Of that monk who has united a man and a woman Or induced another to do so.
(6) Constructing a hut means to build on an improper site,[124] and for oneself, a house that exceeds the prescribed size. The [prescribed] hut must be large enough to stretch the arms when standing; to extend or draw in the arms and legs when sleeping; to take three strides in each direction when moving around, and to easily assume the cross-legged posture. It must not, however, exceed the [prescribed] size of eighteen cubits[125] in length and ten and a half cubits in width.
(7) Constructing a large dwelling means to construct on an improper site, and with improper materials,[126] a large house for four monks or more.
(8) Groundless accusation means to defame a fellow monk without any of the three [grounds for accusation] of having seen, heard about, or having suspected that he has incurred a defeating offense.[127]

(9) Accusation for a trivial reason means to falsely accuse a fellow monk of having committed a defeating offense, justifying this on the basis of a trivial event.[128]
(10) Causing a schism means to persist in causing a division in the order, not desisting even though other monks have admonished one three times.[129]
(11) Taking sides refers to supporting a fellow monk who is trying to create a schism in the order, not desisting although admonished three times.
(12) Causing a layperson to lose faith means to defame the fellow monks who have expelled one [from the boundaries of the monastery] because one's depraved conduct[130] has subverted a lay devotee's faith in the order, and not desisting even though admonished three times.
(13) Defiance means not to accept the allegation made by fellow monks when one has incurred a downfall, and persistently refusing to acknowledge [and amend] it in spite of the [triple] admonishments of the monastic community.
These thirteen are called “the class of partial defeats of the monastic community,” “of the monastic community” since amendment depends on the community and “partial” [or with remainder] because some trace of the vows' purity remains.[131]
The Summary [of Discipline][132] mentions two undetermined offenses that may occur when a monk lures a woman
...into a secluded, sheltered place.
A secluded place refers to a situation where there are no other conscientious friends[133] and that is a sheltered place providing concealment.
(1) If this is a convenient place for sexual intercourse, a monk might commit one of three [types of offenses]—a defeat, a partial defeat, or a downfall [requiring confession alone]. (2) If it is not suitable for sexual intercourse, he might commit one of two [types of offenses]—a partial defeat or a downfall [requiring confession alone].[134] These offenses are “undetermined” in the sense that it is uncertain which offense will occur or what will be the outcome.

(1) Keeping extra cloth means to keep for more than ten days an unconsecrated piece of cloth that is owned by oneself, measures one cubit or more, and is not intended for one's robes.
(2) Being without is to be separated from the three robes for more than a day.[135]
(3) Retaining [cloth] for a month is to keep a piece of cloth in order to make one of the three robes that one is lacking, which is between one cubit long and the size sufficient to cover the three areas,[136] and which remains unconsecrated for more than one month. (The three areas refer to the waist and the two areas around the knees.)
The first downfall of keeping unconsecrated cloth for more than ten days occurs at sunrise on the eleventh day. The same downfall is accrued by vitiation if one receives a second piece of cloth subsequent to the first, even though one has [kept] the second piece less than ten days. Further, if one obtains a stitched monastic robe after first acquiring a piece of cloth [as described in] the downfall of “retaining for a month,” at sunrise on the eleventh day one incurs the downfall of “keeping [extra cloth] for ten days.” Downfalls by vitiation occur in relation not only to cloth but also to the begging bowl and food.
Concerning the second downfall, to determine whether or not a monk has incurred the downfall of being without robes, different factors such as boundary, dispensation, and consecration[137] must be taken into consideration. One should refer to other books [for more information] on this point.
(4) Having one's robes washed is to ask a nun who is not a relative to wash one's robes. Here, “relative” includes one's kin up to seven times removed on either one's mother's or father's side.

(5) Accepting cloth is to accept cloth sufficient to cover the three areas, when one already has the three robes, from a nun who is not a relative.
(6) Requesting is to request cloth as just described from a layperson who is not a relative.
(7) Requesting more than the permissible means to request more cloth than the measure [required for] one set of the upper and lower robes, when one lacks the three monastic robes, from a layperson who is not a relative.
(8) Requesting finer means to request from a layperson who is not a relative [robe material of] a fine quality, more valuable than that which the layperson had intended to offer.
(9) Requesting finer quality than two donors have prepared to offer differs [from the previous downfall] only in that it concerns [robe material] offered by male or female donors separately, [rather than] a common offering from a household.
(10) Insistence means to accept a robe after one has insistently asked for it more than three times, and [when undelivered] has made oneself obvious more than three times to the caretaker of the community who has been given [by a patron] precious items [such as gold or silver] to purchase the cloth.[138]

(1) A silk mat is to make[139] for oneself a mat out of a valuable material such as silk of at least the measure that covers the three areas.
(2) A black wool mat is to make a mat out of only black [sheep's] wool measuring as above.
(3) A mixture with more than half black wool is to make a mat [of white and black wool] containing more than half black wool.
(4) Six years is to make a new mat while the old one has not been used for [the prescribed period of] six years.
(5) A handspan is to use a new mat that has not been sewn with a patch from the old one the length of the Joyful One's handspan.[140]
(6) Carrying wool on the road is to walk more than an earshot[141] within a single day while carrying a great load such as wool, motivated by acquisitiveness.
(7) Having wool washed is to have a nun who is not a relative wash, spin, or dye wool.
(8) Handling what is precious is to handle or induce [another person] to handle gold or other precious substances [that are one's property but] unconsecrated[142] and to consider these as one's own, motivated by acquisitiveness.
(9) Usury is to lend gold or other commodities to make a profit or gain interest to a layperson who is not a relative, motivated by acquisitiveness.
(10) Trading means to buy and sell [to a layman] other nonprecious items such as grain in order to make a profit. In the last two rules, the actual downfall is accrued only if a profit is realized.

Two downfalls concern the begging bowl:
(1) Keeping a begging bowl is to keep an unconsecrated begging bowl for more than ten days.
(2) Requesting an extra begging bowl is to ask for and obtain a begging bowl from a layperson who is not a relative, when one already has an appropriate begging bowl.
Two downfalls concern weavers:
(3) Engaging a weaver is to have a weaver who is not a relative make cloth for one's robes without payment or remuneration.
(4) Improving the weave means to engage a weaver to make finer and more valuable cloth for one's robes without the consent of the patron who has already agreed to give one a particular quality of robe and has already paid for that.
(5) Taking back gifts is to take back an article [such as a robe, begging bowl, etc.] one has given to a fellow monk.
(6) Using rainy season retreat offerings means to use the offerings donated by a patron [to be distributed at the conclusion of the retreat] before the retreat ends.
(7) To be separated from the robes while in seclusion means to be apart from one's robes for more than seven days when one is living in seclusion.
(8) Keeping the large rain cloak for too long is to request and to keep the large rain cloak for more than one month before entering the rainy season retreat or for more than half a month after the conclusion [of that retreat].
(9) To redirect dedicated offerings is to take possession of any article that [a donor] has already intended to donate to the monastic community or another monk.
(10) Storing is to keep any of the three foods and medicines[143] beyond the prescribed time.
These are referred to as the “thirty downfalls that require forfeiture” because one day before the formal confession of the downfall, the article that is the basis for downfall must be relinquished[144] along with any other requisite articles one has acquired subsequently. Requisite articles acquired subsequently must also be relinquished because a downfall with respect to the latter articles is accrued by vitiation by the former.

(1) Lying means to consciously tell a lie of a type that would not be classified as a defeat, partial defeat, serious violation, or minor infraction.[145]
(2) Criticizing means to speak of the faults of a fellow monk such as his being from a bad family lineage or not having all his faculties intact.
(3) Slandering is to calumniate [two or more] fellow monks with the intention to cause discord among them.
(4) Reviving quarrels is to rekindle a dispute among monks that had already been settled.
(5) Teaching a woman is to teach more than five or six words of the doctrine [from scriptures or commentaries] to a laywoman in private.
(6) Reciting the scriptures means to chant verses from the scriptures out of vanity and in a variety of melodies, with someone who is not a monk.
(7) Revealing lapses in discipline is to divulge to [a layperson and others] who are not fully ordained that a fellow monk has committed a defeating or partially defeating offense, when one has not been appointed to bring forth the allegation [in the appropriate ceremony].
(8) Telling the truth about one's level of spiritual attainment is to declare that one has developed superhuman powers to someone who is not a monk, without a specific necessity.
(9) Accusing a steward of favoritism means to falsely accuse of favoritism a monk steward because one is jealous that he has given a worthy monk an article that was the common property of the community.
(10) Reviling is to scorn [the monastic discipline] by [saying to a fellow monk, for instance]: “What is the use of these minor rules of discipline?”

(3) Taking excess is to receive more than three [small] begging bowls [of food] at the home of a layperson who is not a relative.[149]
(4) Resuming eating is to resume eating an offered and accepted meal after thinking and saying, “I have finished,” unless the leftover food has been made permissible [through a ritual].[150] Standing up after having started, which means to stand up before the end of the meal [and then to eat the leftovers later], is also comprised by this downfall.[151]
(5) Giving food to a monk who has finished eating means to invite a monk who has finished eating to partake of food, saying that the food is “leftover” [i.e., made permissible through a ritual] when in fact it is not. In this case, the downfall is accrued by the monk who gives the food.
(6) Gathering to eat is to partake of a meal with [three or more] fellow monks within the same boundary but in a place other than [the communal dining hall], when this action is due to disharmony.
(7) Eating at inappropriate times means to partake in the afternoon of foods that are permissible only from dawn to noon.

(1) Preventing alms is to stop [directly or indirectly] a patron from giving food to be eaten before noon to a fellow monk, due to enmity.
(2) Lighting a fire is to make a fire unless one has consecrated the occasion or one is ill. In addition, to touch fire embers is a minor infraction, to place firewood on a fire is an actual downfall, and to put hair, etc., [onto a fire] is a minor infraction. To consecrate the occasion,[156] the monk [simply] recollects that the Buddha gave permission to light a fire to perform religious duties in the interest of the community as a whole, such as [the preparation of colors for] the painting of statues of deities. The scriptures on discipline speak of eleven types of consecration:
Consecration of robes, begging bowl, precious articles, Downfalls,[157] confession, rainy season retreat,
Lifting of restrictions, medicine, kitchen, Donations, and occasions.
(3) Withdrawing assent is to have given one's assent to a formal procedure of the monastic community so that no disagreement would arise, and subsequently [after the completion of the formal procedure] to withdraw it.[158]
(4) Sleeping extra nights with the non-ordained means to sleep more than two nights in the same room with someone who is not fully ordained.[159]

(5) Not giving up erroneous views is to not abandon the erroneous views of disbelieving [the discipline] taught by the Buddha,[160] even after one has been admonished by the members of the community.
(6) Befriending an expelled monk is to share [spiritual instructions and material things[161]] with a monk who has been expelled from the monastery.
(7) Befriending an expelled novice is as in the former with the difference that this concerns a novice instead of a monk.
(8) Wearing undyed clothing is to wear, uncovered, clothing measuring a cubit or more that has not been dyed with one of the three prescribed colors.[162]
(9) Handling treasures or other precious articles that may cause pride is to touch with vanity treasures that do not belong to oneself. This includes pearls and other precious gems, items that are considered precious such as conch and drum and other musical instruments, as well as weapons. The downfall is accrued by the simple act of handling treasures even if one does not have the intention to possess them. Wearing ornaments and perfumes, singing, or playing musical instruments in a proud frame of mind are also comprised by this downfall.
(10) Bathing frequently is to bathe[163] more than once a fortnight, unless one is ill or during the three months of the hot season.

(3) Tickling is to tickle a fellow monk with the intention of provoking a reaction.
(4) Playing in water is to sport in water frivolously.
(5) Sleeping in the same place as a woman is to sleep one night in the same room with a woman [without the presence of a conscientious companion].
(6) Frightening is to frighten a fellow monk in various ways out of scorn.
(7) Hiding is to hide any of the articles of a fellow monk, such as his robes or begging bowl, out of scorn.
(8) Using without permission means to use without his consent a robe [or other monastic article] that one has passed on [for good] to a fellow monk or the robe of a monk with whom one does not share things.
(9) Defaming is to intentionally accuse a monk of having committed a partially defeating offense without having seen, heard, or had reason to suspect [that this is the case].
(10) Accompanying a woman on the road is to walk with a woman farther than one earshot along a road. As in the case of sleeping in the same room as a woman, a downfall is not accrued if a conscientious companion is present.

(7) Leaving without informing means to leave one's place during a formal procedure of the community (such as a confession) without informing [or giving one's assent to] one's fellow monks.
(8) Disrespect means to disrespectfully refuse to perform a religious duty for which one has been appointed by the monastic community, without politely giving a reason for refusal.
(9) Drinking alcohol is to take any kind of intoxicant leading to negligent behavior that could cause others to lose faith [in the doctrine or the order].[164]
(10) Going to town at the inappropriate time is to visit the home of a layperson who is not a relative and stay from the afternoon of one day until dawn of the following day [without informing any member of the ordained community].

(1) Wandering into the village means to go to the village and to not return before the mealtime of the community.[165]
(2) Visiting the royal apartment in the night means to spend the night in the royal palace [knowing] that the queens are present.
(3) Showing disdain means purposefully to disparage the rules of discipline as they are being recited in the Personal Liberation Discourse during confession.
(4) Accepting a needlecase is to have a layperson who is not a relative make for oneself a needlecase of fine materials.
(5) Making a seat with legs is to make a seat [for the monastic community] with legs higher than a cubit.
(6) Covering the mat with cotton is to intentionally cover the seats [of the monastic community] with cotton.[166]
(7) Exceeding the size for the mat is to use a mat that exceeds the prescribed length or width.
(8-10) Exceeding the size for the flannel [to relieve] skin rash, exceeding the size for the large rain cloak, and exceeding the size for the robes are self-explanatory.
This class of “downfalls that require confession alone” are called “downfalls” (Tib. ltung byed, lit. “leading to downfalls”) since these offenses may lead to [rebirth in] lower realms and “[that require confession] alone” ('ba' zhig pa) because purification of these downfalls does not require forfeiture, but only confession.

(1) Accepting a nun's alms means to request from a nun who is not a relative the food she has begged for herself [wherever one has met her,] in the village, [near a village, or on the road].
(2) Accepting food served without regard to seniority means to accept food at a meal offered by a householder to three or more monks, without correcting the nun in charge of serving, by saying, “Please serve the food first to the elder monks,” when, disregarding the order of seniority, she distributes the food first to the younger monks.
(3) Transgressing the rule not to beg at a household is explained in this way: When a patron has become destitute of food and wealth, a rule [not to beg from him] should be instituted [by the monastic community] through formal procedure. Once instituted, monks should not beg for more than, say, a few vegetables from that person. If one begs [for more], this downfall has been committed. Subsequently, [when the patron is no longer destitute,] lifting of this rule is to be done through a ceremony.
(4) Eating without checking the safety of the forest means to eat in a secluded and precarious place away from the monastery without having verified its safety, when one has been appointed to do so by the monastic community.[167]
These are called “offenses to be individually confessed” because at the time of purifying the downfall, the monk must confess each of them while showing regret.

Three rules concern proper behavior:
(1) Do not defecate or urinate while standing; (2) do not throw feces or urine into water or onto grass;
(3) Don't spit or clean the nose, vomit [or discharge mucus] into water, unless ill.
One rule concerns moving:
(1) Don't climb trees taller than a man, unless in danger.
If one transgresses any of these rules, one commits an infraction. Conforming to the proper conduct is all that is required to correct the wrongdoing; thus, they are called minor infractions.
To enhance the laity's appreciation [of the monastic community], when going to the home of a layperson, a monk should keep these rules in mind; his robes should be dignified, and his conduct peaceful and disciplined. Having taken his place, he should sit in a contemplative posture and partake politely of the food and drink. Then, maintaining mindfulness, he should speak of the doctrine in a way appropriate to the occasion.
Thus, the disciplinary code of a monk is made up of a total of two hundred and fifty-three rules that prohibit the five classes of downfalls. These downfalls fall into two categories: naturally unwholesome and unwholesome because of prescription. “Naturally unwholesome” refers to murder and similar acts that would be negative if committed by anyone (laypersons or renunciates). “Unwholesome because of prescription” refers to eating after noon, etc.—[acts] that would not be negative for laypersons but are prohibited for renunciates. Any transgression of the above-mentioned rules is a downfall because by transgressing it, one may be reborn in the lower realms.

Purification-renewal to develop mental quiescence [embraces all stages of practice on the path to liberation]. To accomplish such “renewal,” a monk should be of pure morality and have a contented mind with few desires, the exalted potential for freedom from attachment. He must first learn and reflect upon the collections of scripture, thereby establishing the conditions for entering the path. Then, having built a meditation hut and appointed a helper,[177] he engages in the practice to develop mental quiescence,[178] applying the nine methods of setting the mind.[179] [Once that stage is attained,] the monk cultivates the discriminating awareness of insight[180] by exercising the four mindfulnesses[181] and other meditations, [gradually] traversing the five paths[182] by means of the thirty-seven factors of awakening,[183] to attain the four kinds of result.[184]

The One Hundred Formal Procedures[185] states:
Confession to foster harmony[186] consists of five types:
(1) confession on the fourteenth [day of the lunar month],
(2) confession on the fifteenth,
(3) confession to increase prosperity,
(4) confession to eliminate misfortune,
(5) confession to unify the community.
The great translator Dharmashri[187] states that the first of the five confessions is performed on the following dates:
On the fourteenth day of the waning moon, Of the eleventh, first, third, fifth, seventh,
And ninth months of the Mongolian calendar.[188]
Concerning the second, confession on the fifteenth day of the month:
Know [that confession should be performed]
On the fifteenth day of both the waxing and waning moon; Whatever else is stated is erroneous.
To explain, Tsonapa, Jadul,[189] and others consider the beginning of the calendar year to be the first day of the waning moon of the first month of winter (equivalent to the tenth month of the Mongolian calendar) [October-November]. Therefore, they assert that the first confession of the year is held one and a half months later (in the waning moon of the eleventh month of the Mongolian calendar), on the fourteenth of the month of the constellation Pushya.
Butön and others consider the sixteenth of the ninth month of the Mongolian calendar [September-October, as the beginning of the calendar year] and the earlier Tibetan masters such as Chim,[190] the sixteenth of the eighth month [August-September]; the sixth Shamar[191] agrees with Butön. However calculated, “the confessions to be performed on specific days” are to be done on the six fourteenth days, and the eighteen fifteenth days [of the lunar calendar—the days of the full and new moon].

The setting for the confession should be within a boundary defined [with signs in the four directions], the large or small,[192] in a natural place such as a cave, a man-made construction such as a house, or a natural phenomenon such as the shade of a tree. The participants of the confession may be any of the five types of renunciate.
The preparation for the ceremony of confession[193] begins with the monks [examining whether or not they have incurred any downfalls since the last confession; if so,] they confess, promise to restrain from such acts in the future, and “consecrate” the downfalls [in front of a worthy monk].[194]
The monastic community is summoned by [the sound of striking] a gandi wood of the right dimensions.[195] [Once the monks are gathered,] the three-part customary rite [of making prostrations, recitation of the Buddha's discourses, and dedication of merits] is performed, and the scripture that praises ethical conduct[196] is recited if it is not possible to propound the doctrine.
[Next are three indispensable preparations:] (1) To purify their minds, the monks [recollect their downfalls in the midst of the assembly and thus are consecrated through a proposal by the ceremonial master]; (2) agreement [on the place for confession or on the boundary is reached through a twofold procedure including proposal];
and (3) for the sake of the community's harmony and so that for those monks unable to attend the ceremony due to sickness and so forth confession may still take place, the elder praises the Personal Liberation Scripture,[197] [announces the date for the confession ceremony, and gives advice, while the disciplinarian reports the assent to the ceremony given by those unable to attend.]
During the main part [of the ceremony of confession], an elder recites the Personal Liberation Scripture. The ceremony is concluded by the dedication [of merit] and [prayers of] aspiration.

<d e="2">
If there are no more than three fully ordained monks in that place, each performs the consecration [of the downfalls] in turn, one in front of the others. If one is alone, one confesses verbally and mentally. At the very least, one should recite the three and a half lines of verse[198] that was the original confession formula [spoken by] the Buddha.
The elder who recites [the Personal Liberation Scripture] must be duly qualified. A monk who has been a full member of the order in good standing for more than twenty years is called a regent-like elder. One who has been a full member of the order in good standing for twenty years is a lion-like elder. [Both of these] should be well-versed in the scriptures on discipline and self-reliant [in matters of discipline]. The child-like elder is one who has not learned the scriptures on discipline even though sixteen years have elapsed since he entered the order. The elder who resembles the karandava corn[199] is one who has transgressed ethical conduct. Of these four, the former two fulfill [the requirements].
The third, [confession to increase prosperity,] is performed on auspicious occasions such as consecration [of a temple, etc.], or at the occurrence of inauspicious circumstances such as floods, droughts, infestations of rats, parrots, or locusts, or the advent of a tyrannical ruler.
The fourth, [confession to eliminate misfortune,] is performed in order to dispel adversity such as hail, robbers, thieves, sickness, or an epidemic, or to ensure that these do not recur.
The fifth, [confession to unify the community,] is performed in order to reconcile dissensions in the order.
The latter three types of confession (to increase prosperity, etc.) are not performed on fixed dates and therefore the reason for their performance must be stated at the beginning of the ceremony (as the proposal). Except for this point, the procedure is the same as the one for confession held on fixed dates.

The rainy season retreat[200] lasts for three months and is performed during an earlier or later period. The earlier retreat begins on the first day of the waning moon of the last of [the three] summer months (the month of the constellation Alpha Aquiloe[201] [June-July]) with the monks making the promise [to remain in] retreat for three months. The later begins on the first day of the waning moon of the first month of autumn (the month of the constellation Alpha Pegasi,[202] [JulyAugust]). However, Butön and his followers have said that it is best to make the pledge of the earlier rainy season retreat on the sixteenth day of the month of the constellation Antares,[203] [May-June]. The sixth Shamar makes the same assertion.
In order to create the conditions for a harmonious retreat, [the monastic community] should do extended[204] preparations to ensure that quarrelsome monks are excluded from the rainy season retreat and that monks who are well-versed in the [three] collections of the scriptures will participate. The temple should be cleaned and [damage repaired] as part of these preparations. The immediate preparations are [done one day before the beginning, on the fifteenth]. A ceremony of confession is first performed, following which [one monk or several] are appointed to distribute [in order of seniority anointed] wooden sticks [to reckon the number of participants][205] and to assign rooms and beds.
On the morning of the sixteenth, under [the prescribed] roofed dwelling, the monks begin the actual retreat with the promise to follow its rules, made by repeating three times the appropriate formula in the presence of [an experienced] monk. From that point forward, the participants are not allowed to remain outside of the boundary of the retreat from one day to the dawn of the following one without having received permission. [For the duration of the retreat,] the monks are required to exert themselves in listening [to the doctrine], reflecting [on it], and meditating[206] until the retreat concludes with the lifting of restrictions.

This section has three parts: (1) timely lifting of restrictions, (2) untimely lifting of restrictions, and (3) unexpected or sudden lifting of restrictions in the case of special necessity.
The timely [lifting of restrictions] is performed on the full moon when the three months of the rainy season retreat have passed. The extended preparations [to be started seven days before this ceremony] are to decorate the temple, to inform the [householders living in the] nearby villages, and to give the concluding discourses on the doctrine throughout the night of the fourteenth, [the evening of the lifting of restrictions]. The immediate preparations take place on the day of the fifteenth: [these include] mutual requests by the monks for pardon [for any faults that occurred during the retreat], followed by reconciliation through a proposal made by the monk appointed [to lift the restrictions]. The main part [of the ceremony] is performed [by each monk kneeling in turn in front of the appointed monk] while holding quitch grass[207] and reciting the appropriate words three times. With this threefold recitation, the restrictions concerning downfalls are lifted. Once done, the appointed monk then lifts the restrictions concerning articles, in order that the donations made by the laity during the rainy season retreat may be distributed [among the members of the order]. As the conclusion, on the day of the sixteenth, the monks travel around the district in order to eliminate excessive attachment that may have developed toward the place [of retreat].

</d>
<d e="2">
The untimely lifting of restrictions is performed [either on the fifteenth or thirtieth of the lunar calendar] when, through the force of circumstances, [it is necessary to end the retreat] before the three months of the rainy season have passed.
The unexpected lifting of restrictions is performed collectively [with each monk standing before another] [on any day] when the entire monastic community must suddenly disperse, as in the outbreak of war. The same procedure must also be followed when a monk must leave the retreat permanently due to particular circumstances.
If there are no more than four monks, the proposal and the lifting of restrictions may be performed without appointing a monk to preside over the ceremony. If there are no more than three or even just two monks, a permission rite for lifting restrictions [is sufficient]. If there is none other than oneself, one repeats just the main part [of the appropriate formula] three times.
This ceremony to mark the end of the retreat is called “lifting the restrictions” because during the retreat, four [activities] that are potential causes of agitation in the community—allegations of downfalls, punitive measures, distribution of the offerings, and spending one night outside of the boundaries—had been prohibited. With this ceremony, the restrictions [on these activities] are lifted.

Robes and medicine are the two conditions for a monk to live comfortably. On the occasion of the making and distribution of new robes, the kathina practice[208] is performed. This practice extends over a period of relaxation of rules.[209]
On the day following the lifting of restrictions at the conclusion of the earlier or later rainy season retreat, the new robes made from cloth that has been donated [by the laity] during the retreat to the monastic community as a whole are entrusted to [a monk] who has been appointed through a formal procedure of the monastic community [to protect them].[210]
From that day, the sixteenth day of the month, for up to five months [the period of relaxation of the rules for monks who have participated in the retreat], the robes remain in the care of the [appointed] monk who has received them according to the ceremony of “laying out the robes.” The appointed monk must not carry the robes outside the boundaries, or leave them in an unclean building or unsheltered place. From time to time, he must air them, dust them off, and so on. The kathina practice is said to have ten advantages[211]: the monks who participate in it[212] do not incur the three downfalls of “keeping,” “being without [the monastic robes],” and “retaining [cloth],” etc. This [aspect of the monastic discipline] was not practiced in Tibet since
the relaxation of the rules was prohibited by royal decree.[213]

Clothing for the monastic way of life is of three types: (1) prescribed, (2) accessory, and (3) extra garments.
The prescribed garments are not to be made from cloth that has been wrongfully procured. The cloth should be neither too poor nor too fine: robes may be made from any of seven appropriate materials[214] such as wool, but not made from unsuitable materials such as camel or goat hair, and must not be shaggy or have fringe. The cloth is not to be colored by any of the eight valuable dyes that are inappropriate for monks' use, but colored instead in one of the three appropriate dyes. [Vishakadeva's Stanzas on the Discipline] states[215]:
Red cochineal, poppy,
Bengal madder,
Red sanders, indigo, vermilion,
Red lead [minium] and saffron
Are the eight valuable dyes.
While,[216]
The appropriate [colors for] dyes
Are blue, red-ocher, and orange.[217]
Moreover, as a general rule, the cloth [for making robes] must have been cut into pieces. As is said:
One must not keep cloth that has not been cut.
After having been cut, [the cloth for] any of the thirteen garments is sewn according to the prescribed size. [The thirteen garments are the following:] the patched robe, the upper robe, the skirt, the underskirt, the night underskirt, the sweat cloth, the night sweat cloth, the towel, the gauze for wounds, the flannel for skin rash, the sheet to collect hair when shaving, the mat, and the rain cloak.
The patched robe may be one of three dimensions, large, small, and medium. The prescribed size for the large patched robe is three cubits in width and five in length. It may be made with twenty-one, twentythree, or twenty-five patches [in the length], and four and a half [sections in the width].
The size for the small patched robe is a half cubit less [than the large one] in each dimension. It may be made with nine, eleven, or thirteen patches [in the length] arranged with two and a half sections [in the width].
The medium patched robe's size is in between the sizes of the large and the small patched robe. It may be made with fifteen, seventeen, or nineteen patches [in the length], arranged with three and a half [sections in the width].

The upper robe must have seven lengthwise patches and two and a half widthwise sections, but may be any one of the three dimensions prescribed for the patched robe.
The skirt[218] has five lengthwise patches and one and a half widthwise sections. Its dimensions are two cubits in width and five in length, or at the very least, large enough to cover the three areas.[219] If this does not suffice due to the body being stout, one square cubit of cloth may be added on. Generally, the term cubit refers to any of three measures—a cubit [measured in relation to] a particle, a cubit [measured in relation to] the hand, or a cubit [measured on] the body; what is meant in this context is the cubit [measured on one's own] body. This is stated in the Summary of Discipline[220]:
The measure of a cubit is two-sevenths of the body's height.
The underskirt and night underskirt are the same size as the skirt and are worn under it, during the day and at night, respectively.
The sweat cloth and the night sweat cloth used to absorb perspiration are the same size as the upper robe and are worn under it, during the day and at night, respectively.
The towel measures one cubit in length and width; the gauze for wounds equals the size of the upper robe; and the sheet to collect hair when shaving measures three cubits in length and one and a half in width. The flannel to relieve skin rash measures six cubits long and three cubits wide; the mat measures three cubits long and two cubits plus six finger-widths wide, and has one and a half widthwise sections.
The rain cloak for the rainy season is nine cubits in length and three cubits and eight finger-widths in width.

Accessory garments refers to any pieces of cloth the monk considers valuable that have not been stitched on the model of any of the above thirteen robes, and that are of various types measuring a [square] cubit or more, for example, a piece of silk, brocade, or felt. Included in this category are also [the unstitched material for] hat or belt, etc., that the monk considers part of his robes.
Extra articles refers to clothes sewn on the model of any of the thirteen requisites (the patched robe, for instance) or additional garments, such as a second belt.
Minor articles belonging to the category of prescribed garments are items like a [first] hat, shoes, and a belt; minor articles belonging to the categories of accessory and extra are items [like pieces of cloth], the use of which should be predetermined and the size less than a square cubit. All these articles must be consecrated by their respective rituals.[221]
These are the garments worn by renunciates on a regular basis. The patched robe, however, is worn exclusively by full-fledged monks or nuns on specific occasions such as when prostrating before sacred images, going for alms, listening to or expounding the doctrine, or assembling for a monastic ceremony. The upper robe and the skirt, however, are worn as general daytime apparel. These garments are not intended to increase the monk's pride or other negative emotions, but to remind him of his discipline. When they have become old and can no longer be repaired, they should be [cut into tiny pieces,] mixed with earth, and used to seal the crevices of reliquaries, or for similar purposes.

Leather may be used in special circumstances. In central India, monks and nuns were given permission by the Buddha to wear leather shoes only when necessary in order not to spoil the monks' quarters; and to sit on, but not sleep on, a leather seat in a place other than the monastery, such as the house of a layman, provided there is no other seat.
In the remote regions, the use of leather shoes and beds is allowed for monks and nuns so that they may protect themselves against cold. However, some stipulations do apply: it is not appropriate to wear studded boots that make noise or fancy ones such as those with many colors or adorned with gold and silver ornaments. The Buddha also permitted the wearing of high boots and hats in regions [like Tibet] where the lakes freeze.[222]

The foods and medicines that allow a monk to live comfortably are of four types. The first, foods that must be consumed before noon, refers to the five foods and five beverages, etc., that alleviate hunger and thirst and are permissible between dawn and noon, but not after. The five foods are dough-balls, cooked rice, meat, light mash [of flour and ground herbs], and pastry. The five beverages are those made from roots, stalks, leaves, flowers, and fruits.[223]
The second, beverages permissible within a day, refers to drinks to alleviate thirst, which once consecrated[224] must then be consumed within the same twenty-four hour period. If some is kept after that time, the fault of storing is incurred. This category includes drinks made from apples, grapes, and dates,[225] etc., as well as the whey from cheese or yogurt, sour gruel[226] (the liquid from cooking rice, millet, wheat, and so on, to which no yeast is added and which is allowed to steep), milk, and tea. These drinks possess the five attributes of containing suitable water,[227] being strained, very thin, very clear, and mudcolored.
The third, foods taken as medicines that can be kept for seven days, refers to food items used to alleviate both thirst and illnesses of phlegm, bile, and wind, which once consecrated [as medicines] may be used within seven days. These include raw sugar cane, sesame oil, honey, ghee, sugar [from raw sugar cane or honey], powdered sugar from raw sugar cane, and the fat of fish, pig, bear, and rabbit.[228]
The fourth, medicines that may be kept for life, refers to real medicines[229] that cure illnesses [caused by the imbalance] of the three humors, which once consecrated may be kept as long as one lives.[230]
In order not to incur the infractions of “cooking [in a natural] boundary” or that of “a day elapsing,”[231] monks should designate and consecrate a kitchen on the four occasions.[232]
Moreover, monks and nuns are required to regard and partake of foods or medicines in a way that accords with the rules set forth in the scriptures [on discipline].

(2) Forty-seven two-part formal procedures composed of a proposal and the procedure itself, such as [requesting] the assent of the community [to the performance of a ceremony] in a [particular] place, followed by the actual procedure.
(3) Thirty four-part formal procedures composed of a proposal and the actual formal procedure recited three times, such as the monk's ordination that involves a request and the ordination formula repeated three times [making a total of four component parts].[233]

There are four causes of loss of the ordination of personal liberation: (1) giving up the ordination following sincere reflection [by explaining that one is doing so] to someone capable of understanding one's words, (2) death, (3) holding wayward views that deny the law of causality, etc., and (4) becoming a hermaphrodite or changing sex three times. The expression, “etc.” [in the root verse] refers to this fourth condition.
Moreover, the ordination is invalid if the person [is aware or] becomes aware later on that he has assumed the monk vows before the age of twenty, even counting the months in the womb.[234]

<d e="2">
There are two different viewpoints concerning the criteria for losing the ordination. Kashmiri Analysts[235] maintain that even if a monk has incurred a root downfall with concealment, he has not lost his ordination because they consider it illogical that a violation in one area constitutes an exhaustive loss of [all] vows. In this case, the individual is still ordained although he has broken his discipline, just as a man can be rich and yet have debts. Drigung Kyopa,[236] the sixth Shamarpa, and others agree with this view.
Traditionalists and the early Tibetan masters maintained that if an individual commits a single root downfall, [the whole ordination] is violated since the defeating offenses are downfalls that destroy the [very] root [of the ordination[237]]. Therefore, that person is no longer a monk or nun, and is like the palm tree [which dies by] cutting off just the top branches.
The assertion that the violation of a single vow cannot destroy the ordination stems from the [Analysts'] view that the essence of the vows has form, which implies that each of the basic precepts (as well as the other precepts) must have a separate form.
On the other hand, if the vows are held to be consciousness, since a separate substance does not exist [for each vow], if one vow is broken, it is logical that all are lost.

Although the downfall of a defeating offense may have occurred, there are circumstances when this does not constitute an infraction of the rule per se. As examples, a monk may be unable to maintain [a rule] when he does not have control over the functions of his body and mind, such as dreaming of having sexual intercourse; a newly ordained monk [may break a rule] because he is not fully aware of what the rules are; or a monk might commit murder in a state of insanity.

A layperson who has committed a root downfall must take the precepts again in order to amend the transgression. If a branch downfall (the drinking of beer and so on) has occurred, confession of the offense must be made to someone who has maintained the precepts purely.
If a novice or a monk [or nun] has incurred a root downfall and has concealed the fact, no possibility for amendment exists. The downfall cannot be repaired in this life, and the novice or monk must be expelled from the order. If a root downfall has occurred but has not been concealed even for a moment, the novice or monk undergoes penances to amend the offense. For the rest of his or her life, he or she is relegated to five menial tasks and is not granted the five privileges within the monastic community.[238] If a monk incurs a defeating offense but does not conceal it, it is said he may return the vows and take the ordination again.
A partially defeating offense that has not been concealed must be confessed before one's fellow monks. The main part of the purification is effected by appeasing services, followed by a ceremony to allow the monk to assume his original status.[239]
A monk who has concealed a partial defeat for more than a day is demoted to a lower status for the number of days he has concealed the offense. This is in order to purify the fault of concealment. To purify the partial defeat itself, the monk must perform appeasing service for the monastic community for six days; if the offender is a nun, a half month. Finally, the monk or nun is reinstated to his or her original status with a ceremony including proposal [and censoring]. [At the conclusion of the ceremony], the monk or nun is instilled with the confidence to resume the original position.

In this context, “to demote” means to degrade in rank; “appeasing service” means to serve the monastic community by performing menial tasks, such as cleaning, sweeping, and so on, and to sit at the end of the row of monks.
The legal procedures in case of disagreement over formal procedures[240] (Kośāmbī) and the amendment of downfalls through subjugation (Pāṇḍulohitaka) are both extensions of the points just discussed, since the first allegations originated with the two cases [concerning the dispute in the city of Koshambi and the bad behavior of the Pandulohitaka monks].[241]
In the case of a downfall that requires forfeiture, the monk must first forfeit the article that has caused the offense to occur and then must undergo one day of punitive measures. Finally, the downfall is confessed in the presence of a monk who is not stained by a similar offense. A downfall that does not require forfeiture, a downfall to be individually confessed, or a “minor infraction that requires confession” can all be purified by confession alone [in front of a single monk]. A “minor infraction to be refrained from” [one that has not been expressed physically or verbally] is amended by reaffirming one's intention to refrain from it.
For the novice, a “minor infraction that requires confession” is confessed to another monk by specifying [the rule one has transgressed]; a “minor infraction to be refrained from” is amended by reaffirming one's intention to refrain from it.

The means of subjugation are imposed when a monk is unwilling to amend his transgressions to the rules because he has a bad character or for other reasons. “Subjugation” (Tib. nan tur) means to repress or humble that monk. There are thirteen [ways to subjugate an undisciplined monk], classified in the following way: censoring, surveillance, banishment, ostracism, seven [grounds for] expulsion from the monastery, suspension from confession, and suspension from the lifting of restrictions. When the seven [grounds for] expulsion are counted as one, the ways of subjugation number seven.
“Censoring” means that a monk who [has committed a downfall but negates the allegation made by the monastic community, and instead of confessing] argues back, is given a warning such as, “Stop acting this way; if you persist, you will be expelled from the monastery.”[242]
“Surveillance” means that a monk, even one who is self-reliant [in matters of discipline], who has not restored a partial defeat and continually commits it is compelled to take up residence with a teacher [and study the discipline with him].[243]
“Banishment” means that a monk who has caused a layperson to lose faith is required to leave the monastery.[244]
“Ostracism” means social boycott of [i.e. avoiding friendly relations with] a monk who has shown contempt toward a layperson.[245]
“Expulsion” is the penalty applied in these seven cases: when a monk declines to acknowledge the offenses he has committed, when he refuses to confess the offenses he has committed, when he does not give up wrong views [concerning the discipline], when he creates the circumstances for quarrels, when he becomes intimate with or lives with a nun, and when he continues to argue although a point [of doctrine] has been settled.[246]

<d e="2">
“Suspension” from communal confession and from the lifting of the restrictions is imposed when a monk cannot be disciplined by means of suspension from [correcting] advice.[247]
“Turning down the begging bowl” is also a way to subjugate undisciplined behavior. However, because this is a penalty against a layperson,[248] it is not counted here.
After an offender has been subjugated in these ways and has made his apology, qualified monks perform the ceremony to accept his apology and to reinstate him.
In the case of uncertainty [as to what offense has been committed], as, for example, when the monk has sat [beside a woman] in a secluded and sheltered place, [that monk] is made to investigate the nature [of the offense].[249]
The following bases for monastic discipline are extensions of the points just discussed:
(1) The basis related to the individual, which involves determining whether or not a downfall can be amended, by analyzing the person who has incurred the fault of concealment and the extent of the concealment (complemented by basis, intent, act, and consummation[250]), etc.;
(2) The basis of degrading a monk in twenty-six ways,[251] such as imposing the penances [for transgression without concealment], demotion, appeasing services, and so on;
(3) The basis of the suspension from confession or basis related to the training concerned with the ways of stating allegations of downfalls seen, heard, or suspected.[252]

There are four reasons for which a monk who harbors resentment against someone may provoke [the four types of] disputes:
(1) [Mistaken ascertainment of the nature of things]. This leads to a dispute in order to argue; for example, arguing about the permanence or impermanence of the composite.
(2) [Rejecting advice]. This leads to a dispute in order to avoid disciplinary measures; for example, arguing with the monks imposing suspension from advice, confession, or the lifting of restrictions, and contesting the disciplinary measures themselves.
(3) [Having incurred a downfall]. This leads to a dispute [to exculpate oneself] from a downfall, such as a dispute with the monk who brings forth the allegation of a downfall by refuting the substance of the allegation.
(4) Not giving one's assent to a ceremony of the community (such as confession) due to involvement in any of the above three [forms of] dispute. This leads to a dispute related to monastic duties.[253]

<d e="2">
These disputes may come naturally to an end when, for instance, the monk who has caused the disputes dies or his attitude changes.[254] Otherwise, the monastic community may pursue the following seven ways of settling disputes:
(1) For the first [of the above four disputes], the eight types of evidence[255] are used [to reach consensus].
The second dispute is quelled in three ways:
(2) The [same] eight types of evidence are used when there is ground for bringing forth an allegation of a downfall;
(3) The order gives a verdict of purity in consideration of [the monk's clear] recollection through a four-part formal procedure, including proposal,[256] when there is no [ground for bringing forth an allegation];
(4) Or the order gives a verdict [of purity] based on nonderangement to an insane monk[257] through a four-part formal procedure when there is no ground [for bringing forth an allegation].
The third dispute is quelled in three ways:
(5) The monk who does not recognize the [nature of his] downfall is made to analyze the nature of the offense he has incurred[258];
(6) The monk voluntarily acknowledges the allegation[259] once he has recognized the nature of his downfall;
(7) The way comparable to spreading straw[260] is used to bring harmony to the monastic community.
All of these seven ways contribute to the settlement of the fourth type of dispute [since involvement in the first three disputes would prevent a monk from giving his assent to the formal procedure]. The dispute comes to a final conclusion when [the quarreling monk] gives assent for the formal procedures to take place.

Nowadays, it is rare to find any of the teachings on discipline practiced as they were taught [by the Buddha]. However, it would be good and fitting if at the very least the monastic sites and monks' quarters were to accord with the style described in the scriptures on discipline, since this style was taught by the Buddha himself. Accordingly, monasteries should be built on [legally] undisputed land in a place where there are no dangerous animals or other living beings. The land should not be desolate, not have large salt and soda deposits, be overgrown with thorny plants, and so on.
The prescribed monastery has a main temple of five stories. Within the innermost shrine room stands [an image of] Shakyamuni, the master of the doctrine, with [depictions of] events of his previous lives on the side walls.[261] In the assembly hall, where the one hundred and one formal procedures will take place, are paintings of the great elders.[262] Vajra-bearing yaksha[263] are drawn on the wall at the sides of the door and the design of the five-part wheel of cyclic existence[264] with the [two] verses that encapsulate the truth of the path[265] inscribed on the wall of the portico. A lion-throne for doctrinal discourses stands inside the courtyard, which is encircled by an iron fence.[266] Furthermore, within the monastery, the ten facilities (treasury, dining room, and so on[267]) should be included. The monks' rooms are spacious enough to permit the four basic activities [of standing, sleeping, walking, and sitting]. Two types of reliquary and two kinds of standard adorn the grounds.[268] The caretakers for the maintenance of the buildings are appointed in accordance with [procedures described in] the texts [on monastic discipline].

Those who have entered the monastic discipline should live comfortably. This implies living in such a way as to renounce the two extreme lifestyles of indulgence and austerity. Indulgence in intense desire for sense pleasures would deplete one's store of merit. On the other hand, austerity would lead to a state of fatigue and dispiritedness, making one unfit for study and meditation.
At the same time, if [wealth] such as clothing worth ten million karshapana, or foods of a hundred flavors, or houses of five-hundred stories should come one's way without any effort, one may enjoy these without attachment. However, striving excessively for such wealth will hinder study and meditation. Therefore, one should be content while wearing clothes that are discarded rags, subsisting on alms, and dwelling at the base of a tree, etc. Thus, a monk should maintain the perfect conduct of the twelve ascetic practices. As it is said [in the scriptures on discipline]:
Subsisting on alms, eating in a single sitting, not taking food after rising from one's seat;
Wearing the three monastic robes, clothes of rough [sheep's] wool, discarded rags;
Dwelling in isolated places, at the foot of a tree, roofless abodes,
In charnel grounds, remaining [day and night] in the sitting posture, and [sleeping] wherever one happens to be.[269]
All food and clothing of a monk, whether fine or poor, must not have been obtained by any of the five wrong means of livelihood.[270]

As recorded in the Scripture on the Subtle Matters of Discipline, the Buddha gave the following essential formulation of the monastic discipline [in Kushinagari] as he was about to enter into perfect peace: Any action not specified [by the Buddha] as permissible or prohibited needs to be evaluated with reasoning and then performed or renounced accordingly. [Evaluation is done in this way:] if an action accords with those permitted by the Buddha and is verified to be appropriate, it should be performed without any reservations. For instance, Buddha prescribed the lifting of restrictions ceremony for novices; from this, [one can infer] that novices may also participate in the confession ceremony.
An action that resembles those prohibited [by the Buddha] and is verified to be inappropriate must always be renounced. For example, because a silk mat was prohibited, it is therefore inappropriate to make a mat from a material equal or finer in quality than silk.

Once a person has assumed and is maintaining the three levels of discipline [layperson, novice, and monk or nun] discussed above, in what way do these three coexist? Do these exist each with a different or with an identical essence, or does the former level change into the next?
According to the Analysts who believe [the levels of discipline] to be form, each level exists simultaneously and is substantially different in the mind of a monk who has received them sequentially. They substantiate this view by stating that within the continuum of that monk, each level of discipline exists with a substantially different form because he has received the three disciplines through their respective procedures and he has not lost them through any cause.
According to the Centrists and others who believe the levels of discipline to be consciousness, the levels neither exist simultaneously nor with different natures in the mind of the monk who has received them sequentially. They substantiate this view by saying that if this were the case, three substantially different attitudes of renunciation would exist simultaneously in the sphere of a single primary mind, which is illogical. Moreover, they assert that the levels of discipline are not substantially identical since in a single continuum these three are mutually exclusive. This being the case, [it follows that] in the continuum of a monk, the former levels of discipline transform into the latter ones, becoming increasingly advanced in terms of the essence [of the ethical training], etc. When a layperson receives the vows of novice and then those of a monk, at those times, the former disciplines become the essence of the latter ones. This is comparable to the path of accumulation transforming into the path of preparation, and that path into the path of seeing. Therefore, although a full-fledged monk has received and not damaged the novice ordination, it is illogical to assert that he still has the novice vows. This is because in the continuum of a monk, the three disciplines are neither substantially different forms nor substantially different in the nature of consciousness; neither do the two disciplines [that of a novice and that of a monk] exist simultaneously and with an identical nature [in the mind of a monk].

The exclusive and extensive procedure for the conferral of Universalists' vows of personal liberation was never introduced into Tibet.
However, [one can still receive such ordination without that procedure] as is indicated in the Three Hundred Stanzas [on the Novitiate][271]:
Engendering the glorious intention to reach full awakening is the bestowal of power.
[and in its commentary,] Luminous[272]:
[The intention to reach] full awakening is glorious because it is the seed [that develops into] the enlightened deeds of a Dharma sovereign. Power is bestowed[273] in order to attain that [state].
Accordingly, the proclaimers' personal liberation vows themselves, received with an altruistic intention, form the basis of the characteristics of the Universalists' vows of personal liberation. If at the time of receiving the Individualists' vows, one's objective is to attain full awakening for the benefit of others, the vows become Universalists' vows. This is the case even if this was not one's objective at that time, but one develops the resolve to awaken afterwards.

(2) Special ceremonies, which include the ceremonies of the past by which Maitreya, Manjushri, and others conferred full ordination on many persons, and the ceremonies of the present day, such as the procedure for taking the precepts of purificationrenewal[274] as discussed in the Amoghapasha [Scripture].[275]

The ethical conduct related to any kind of personal liberation vows received in the course of a common ceremony must be maintained just as it is by the proclaimers unless there is a special necessity for not doing so. This is very important because an unnecessary transgression of the rules of this dual ordination is reckoned as a downfall in the context of the commitments of the Indestructible Way (vajrayāna). However, when there is a special purpose—to benefit others, for instance—it is permissible to commit the seven verbal and physical unvirtuous actions that are normally prohibited. Accordingly, the Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life states[276]:
The Compassionate One, in his broad vision, Gave permission even for what is prohibited.
For someone performing the purification-renewal of the Universal Way, having taken by himself or herself the precepts in accordance with the special ceremony, the [vows] to be maintained are identical to those of the common purificatory fast.

Most of the masters of discipline maintain that a monk cannot retake his vows if he has assumed Universalists' vows in the course of a ceremony undifferentiated from that of the proclaimers and he has committed a defeating offense with concealment. This view is good because it is conducive to strict maintenance [of discipline].
However, Lord Trinlepa[277] and others have stated that a root downfall may be repaired by confession accompanied by regret and by retaking the vows, regardless of whether the downfall was concealed or not. This is possible because these vows have been taken with the altruistic mind of awakening. Moreover, these masters taught that a secondary downfall may be purified by amending it with sincere confession sustained by the four forces.[278]
With regard to the amendment of downfalls, it must be said that if one has strong regret, embarrassment, and shame, all transgressions can be purified. When these [dispositions] are missing, however, downfalls cannot be purified simply by undergoing penances. In consideration of this, it is said [in the Commentary on the Summary of Discipline] that a person who has great shame or someone who is a master of the three collections of scriptures may purify all offenses simply by confessing them [in front of a fellow monk, without undergoing disciplinary measures].

The point of all the scriptures on discipline is thus summarized in the verses of the original confession[279]:
Commit no evil,
Engage in excellent virtue, Fully tame your mind:

Violation of the ethical conduct to which one has committed oneself bears very serious [consequences] and hinders the development of one's spiritual qualities. Proclamation of the Doctrine Scripture states[280]:
Whoever damages or destroys his ethics will have no affinity for a spiritual life for up to ten million lifetimes. He forsakes all happiness and experiences great misery.
The scriptures on discipline list the negative consequences of violating ethical conduct, including the following:
You will never hear the true teaching
And quickly forget what you have learned.
Thus, you will not realize the stages and paths [of awakening].
Even a minor offense can lead to a major consequence. Thus, it is necessary to follow also the minor rules. Accordingly, the scriptures on discipline state:
Whoever lightly regards the doctrine of the compassionate teacher
And transgresses as much as a minor dictate Will be oppressed by misery,
Just as in cutting down the bamboo thicket One also destroys the mango grove.
Although a subject may have disobeyed his king's laws at various times,
He may still escape punishment,
But if one disregards the advice of the Sage,
One will be born as an animal such as the naga Elapatra.[281]
In brief, it is stated in the scriptures that a monk or nun who has transgressed the rules by committing a defeat, partial defeat, serious violation, downfall [involving forfeiture or confession alone], offense that must be confessed individually, or minor infraction, will be reborn in one of the hells from the Hot Hell up to the Reviving Hell, respectively.
On the other hand, a pure ethical conduct serves as the basis and as a condition for the development of all knowledge and spiritual accomplishment [that is the fruition] of all Buddhist paths. Nagarjuna's Letter to a Friend states[282]:
Ethical conduct was proclaimed to be the foundation of all virtue,
Just as the earth is the foundation of the animate and inanimate.
The Proclamation of the Doctrine Scripture lists the many benefits of ethics, for example[283]:
One who maintains ethical conduct is praised by all.

Vishakhadeva stated[284]:
Ethical conduct yields magnificent fruit:
Highest praise, abundance of wealth,
Birth in the celestial residences of the gods,
The state of contemplation, and emergence from cyclic existence.
The Valuable for Monks Scripture states:
He who believes in ethics Creates boundless merit Even during a single day
And eventually attains the goal of full awakening.
Now that the doctrine is in decline, to preserve a single aspect of ethics for even a day has far greater merit than was accrued through maintaining ethical conduct, pure in all aspects, for incalculable years during the initial propagation of the doctrine. Accordingly, the King of Contemplations Scripture states[285]:
Exceptional is the merit of venerating with faith Billions and trillions of buddhas
For millions of eons equal in number to the grains of sand of the Ganges
With offerings of food, drinks, parasols, banners, and rows of lamps.
Nonetheless, far greater is the merit accrued
By observing a single aspect of ethics for just one day
In this age when the sacred teachings [on discipline] are coming to an end
And the [other] doctrines of the Transcendent One are vanishing.
Therefore, those who wish to attain liberation should endeavor to maintain pure ethical conduct.

[Asanga explains] this subject in five points: The first point concerns the monastic necessities that serve as conditions for a monk to live comfortably. [The Buddha] specified that all monastic necessities must be acquired licitly, without resorting to devious means, and unpolluted by transgressions of the rules [regarding their use]. The monk should use these in a manner that does not succumb to either of the two extremes of indulgence and austerity. The necessities include four types of foods (called “medicines”) to be consumed, respectively, before noon, within a day, within seven days, and until one is cured of an illness; the four types of garments (prescribed, accessory, extra, and minor); other prescribed and indispensable monastic articles (begging bowl, water strainer, etc.); living quarters, including the monastery buildings, individual cells, dwellings at the foot of a tree, seats, bed, bedding, etc.
The second point concerns the measures used to discipline a monk whose behavior goes against the Buddha's teaching. This includes dismissal from the order of a monk who has committed a defeating offense that cannot be purified; other disciplinary measures to prevent a monk from perpetuating his misconduct; and amendment of downfalls by testimony, reminders, and the ways to settle disputes. The third point involves dispelling despair through these fifteen means: [recognizing] the five types of despair, [adopting] the fivelimbed conscientiousness, and thinking in five ways that help dispel
despair.[290]

The fourth point consists in subduing strong emotional entanglement by observing the five-limbed method to maintain ethical conduct:
(1) Maintaining [the rules concerning] the conditions for living comfortably (the prescribed food, robes, articles, living quarters);
(2) Studying with a teacher, that is, obeying the instructions of the tutor, or of the elders, who are masters of the three collections of the scriptures;
(3) Recognition of factors incompatible with ethical conduct, which is to know the means to eliminate the conditions leading to five classes of transgressions of the rules, regardless of whether they are serious or light;
(4) Meticulous observance of ethical conduct, which means to attend regularly the confession, the rainy season retreat, and the lifting of restrictions; and
(5) Excellent attitude and application. Excellence of attitude refers to virtues such as faith, compassion, intelligence, mindfulness, alertness, shame, embarrassment, and conscientiousness.[291] These eight attitudes serve as preconditions for an excellent application of ethical conduct, in which one develops the following six foundations of the training:
(1) the discipline that is indispensable in the beginning, which means having an excellent attitude;
(2) diligent practice of the four means to prevent the occurrence of transgressions of the rules[292];
(3) elimination of the five factors incompatible with the training[293];
(4) reliance on the five conducive ones[294];
(5) familiarity with the five topics to be known[295]; and
(6) familiarity with the five factors that foster peace.[296]
In addition, to maintain ethical conduct, a renunciate must possess the five qualities of a monk who is faithful to his discipline[297] and the five strengths.[298]
Concerning the way to cultivate ethical conduct excellent in both attitude and application, the scriptures state:
Whether you are an elder, a monk or nun of some years standing, or newly ordained, you should always consider yourself a renunciate and should always consider the Buddha, the Blessed One who is your guide, as your protector. [With such considerations,] set as your goal perfect peace, observe the bases of training in discipline just as they were prescribed, and work toward the realization of ultimate truth.

The fifth point[299] concerns the abandonment of latent emotions.[300] To accomplish this, the monk engages in the purification-renewal to develop mental quiescence, which consists in the practice of [the various stages of] meditation. He first asks a master experienced in meditation [for instructions]. The master makes sure that the beginner is free of four obstacles and examines well his four conditions.[301] [Once accepted,] the monk then applies himself to the five points: maintaining and creating the conditions for contemplation,[302] perfect seclusion,[303] intense concentration,[304] removing impediments,[305] and the cultivation of mental contemplation.[306]
With discriminative meditations, such as the discernment of the aspects of grossness and peacefulness,[307] the practitioner becomes free from the desires related to the worldly paths,[308] and strives in the mental quiescence in which the compositional factors of the body and the three times are analyzed. These discriminative meditations and meditation on the thirty-seven aspects of awakening (including the four forms of mindfulness[309]) lead the practitioner through the eight stages (beginning with the one called “full positive sight”[310]), and the paths of accumulation, preparation, seeing, and meditation.[311]
To expand, there are [four] mental contemplations associated with quiescence,[312] [differentiated with regard to] the nine methods of stabilizing the mind; and four mental contemplations associated with insight, [distinguished according to] four analyses[313]—full analysis of phenomena, etc. Through reliance on these two [types] of singlepointed concentration, one attains the four [types] of mental contemplation, beginning with ever-present distress.[314] At that point, one begins [meditation on] the noble truths: one engages in the mental contemplation of knowledge of their characteristics (individual analysis of the sixteen attributes [of the truths], such as impermanence).[315] [This contemplation,] integrated with study and reflection, effects the traversing of the path of accumulation. Beyond that path, the aspect of meditation that unifies the four truths leads to the stage of appreciation.[316] The mental contemplation based on appreciation[317] effects the traversing of the path of preparation [in its stages,] warmth, peak, receptivity, up to highest quality.[318]

Subsequent to the stage of highest quality, as soon as one focuses on the truth which one previously examined, non-conceptual definitive pristine awareness or direct pristine awareness arises. The impediments that are removed through seeing [this awareness] are thereby eliminated, and one attains the path of seeing, the mental contemplation of thorough isolation.[319]
With the mental contemplation of analysis[320] and mental contemplation of withdrawal or joy,[321] one removes the impediments to be forsaken on the path of meditation and one traverses all the stages of that path of meditation.[322] When the mental contemplation of the final training (adamantine contemplation[323]) arises, one attains arhatship, the complete liberation of mind. At the moment of entering the [contemplation that is the] fruit of the final training, all contamination is exhausted. The three results (stream-enterer, etc.[324]) are likewise attained in the different stages of elimination of the emotions that are removed on the path of meditation.

The fourth point concerns [being the incentive for others to enter into a life of peace and happiness]. By preserving pure ethical conduct, those who have become monks and nuns live comfortably, endowed with ten personal benefits. Furthermore, they become the source for abundant happiness and benefit of gods and humans and the cause for the continuance of the doctrine. Thus, their example becomes an incentive for others to enter into the same life of peace and happiness.

To enter the path to enlightenment, the Universal Way, one must first generate an altruistic resolve to awaken and assume its commitments. The formation of this “awakening mind” depends on the following causes: signs of an awakened affinity for the Universal Way, faith in the unfailing sources of refuge [the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha], loving concern for others, and the courage to endure great hardships [for their sake]. The Stages of the Bodhisattva states[1]:
What are the four causes [of the mind of awakening]? The most perfect affinity[2] is the first cause of the spirit of a bodhisattva. The support of the buddhas, bodhisattvas, and spiritual guides is the second cause of the spirit of a bodhisattva. Compassion for others is the third cause of the spirit of a bodhisattva. Fearlessness in facing the lengthy, diverse, intense, and constant misery of existence and the hardships [endured for the sake of others] is the fourth cause of the spirit of a bodhisattva.

The specific factors that contribute to the formation of the relative awakening mind in its two aspects[3] are stated in [Maitreya's] Scripture Ornament[4]:
Awakening mind is generated through the [five] strengths
Of the friend, cause, root [of virtue], learning, and familiarization with the wholesome.
It is said to be unstable when revealed by others (the strength of the friend)
And stable when born from the latter [four] strengths.
In other words, an awakening mind is formed in dependence upon [one or more of] these five factors: the strength of [i.e., indication by] a spiritual guide (the friend)[5]; the strength of awakened affinity (the cause)[6]; the strength of a nurtured root of virtue (the result)[7]; the strength of study of the scriptures of the Universal Way (the path)[8]; and [the strength of] increased familiarization with what one has learned.[9] An awakening mind formed as a result of the first factor is unstable because it relies upon a friend. One formed as a result of [one of] the latter four factors is stable since it will not be easily damaged in adverse circumstances. The relative awakening mind is formed principally due to [the first factor], the strength of others' [indications].[10]

Two aspects of awakening mind are distinguished on the basis of its principal characteristics: (1) the commitments of the aspiration to awaken, and (2) the commitments of venturing [on the path to awakening].
The first is defined as the ethics of a bodhisattva on the training [stage] of the Universal Way, accompanied by the wish to attain complete awakening for the sake of others. The second is defined as the ethics of a bodhisattva on the training [stage] of the Universal Way, accompanied by the intention to engage in a vast range of virtuous activity that leads to the goal of awakening. Aspiring mind is exemplified by the awakening mind in the continuum of a bodhisattva on [the path of] accumulation or preparation. Venturing mind is exemplified by the awakening mind that exists as the nature of the post-equipoise state of an exalted bodhisattva.[12]
In drawing distinctions between the aspiring and venturing aspects of awakening mind, Damstrasena[13] and other masters explain that the former pertains to the worldly paths,[14] and the latter to the supramundane paths. Abhayakara,[15] Smritijnana,[16] and other scholars maintain that aspiration [corresponds to the awakening minds illustrated by] the first three similes listed below[17] and venturing [corresponds to those indicated by] the other nineteen [similes].
Moreover, Sagaramegha[18] and other masters believe that a mind of awakening formed without relying on a ceremony is an aspiring mind, and one formed during a ceremony is a venturing mind. Lord Atisha[19] and other masters of the magnificent deeds lineage explain that aspiration is the promise to attain the goal of awakening, and venturing is the promise to [create] the causes [leading to this goal]. In addition, some scholars believe that until it has become irreversible, an awakening mind is one of aspiration; once it is irreversible,[20] it is venturing mind.

Shantideva and the masters of the profound view lineage assert that an aspiring awakening mind is simply the formation of the wish to awaken born out of compassion for sentient beings and other positive factors. This may or may not be formalized in a ceremony. The wish to awaken is likened to the desire to set out on a journey. A venturing awakening mind begins with the full acceptance of the mind of aspiration and its commitments and is likened to the actual journey. Simply put, aspiration is the resolve to awaken, and venturing is the acceptance of the commitments of such a resolve. The noble Sakya patriarchs[21] assert that the aspiring and venturing minds are characterized by three aspects each:
Aspiration, forming the aspiration, and safeguarding the aspiration from degeneration; venturing, forming the venturing [mind], and safeguarding the venturing mind from degeneration.[22]
These masters maintain that aspiration and venturing minds in themselves do not constitute commitments. Commitments are assumed only when these minds are permeated with an indispensable element: the intention to give up what is directly or indirectly incompatible [with their training].

Two kinds of awakening mind are distinguished according to the ways it is formed: approximate and subtle. An approximate awakening mind arises from an indication [by a spiritual guide], and a subtle one is attained through [the realization of] the fundamental nature of things. Accordingly, Shantipa's Four Hundred and Fifty Lines Commentary states[23]:
A mind of awakening is conceived through indications as long as one has [only] an intellectual understanding of emptiness, but has not yet realized it directly. However, once [emptiness] has been realized, the mind of awakening should be understood to be ultimate [awakening mind].[24]

The awakening mind formed on each respective stage Is said to be a mind of appreciation,
Extraordinary intention, maturation,
And likewise, freedom from all impediments.
During the paths of accumulation and preparation, the awakening mind is formed by appreciation[26]; on the seven impure stages, by an extraordinarily [pure] intention[27]; and on the three pure stages, by maturation.[28] At the stage of a buddha, the awakening mind is one of freedom from all impediments [emotional and those preventing omniscience].[29]

Twenty-two aspects of awakening mind are distinguished with respect to [the levels of realization of] the individual or the stages of the path. These are illustrated by the similes of earth, gold, moon, etc. Each simile represents an awakening mind accompanied by a particular quality. [Maitreya's] Ornament of Realizations states[30]:
Earth, gold, moon, fire, Treasure, jewel mine, ocean,
Diamond, mountain, medicine, spiritual friend, Wish-fulfilling gem, sun, song,[31]
King, storehouse, highway, Conveyance, spring,
Echo, river, and cloud:
These are the twenty-two similes [for awakening mind].
The qualities that accompany the twenty-two aspects of awakening mind[32] are the following: earnest desire, intention, determination, application, generosity, ethics, patience, effort, meditation, wisdom, skillful means, strength, aspiration, pristine awareness,[33] clairvoyance, merit and pristine awareness, factors conducive to awakening,[34] mental quiescence and insight, memory and eloquence, feast of the teachings, sole path, and the awakened dimension of reality.[35]
[As for their correlation with] the stages of the path, the first three aspects of awakening mind, earnest desire, etc., are found on the three levels of the path of accumulation.[36] The awakening mind accompanied by application is present on the path of preparation. The ten aspects accompanied by the ten perfections, from generosity to pristine awareness,[37] are found on the ten bodhisattva stages[38] included in the paths of meditation and seeing. The next five, from the awakening mind accompanied by clairvoyance to the one accompanied by memory and eloquence, are found on the superior path that encompasses the three pure stages.[39] The last three, beginning with the one accompanied by the feast of the teachings, are present, respectively, during the initial, actual, and final parts of the tenth stage, known as complete enlightenment, the stage of a saint of the Universal Way.[40]
Earnest desire, which constitutes the foundation for all positive qualities, is likened to earth. To use a syllogism whose pattern is applicable to the other awakening minds, the subject, awakening mind accompanied by the earnest desire to work toward awakening, is comparable to earth in that it forms a foundation for the development of all good qualities.[41]

The two ceremonies [to form an awakening mind] exclusive [to the Universal Way] are known as the two traditions of the “pioneers” [Nagarjuna and Asanga[44]]. The later Indian and Tibetan followers of these masters have preserved these as two distinct traditions.
The first ceremony was mystically transmitted by Manjughosha[45] to Nagarjuna, who taught it to his spiritual heir, [Aryadeva[46]]. Subsequently, it was received by the bodhisattva Shantideva,[47] who took it as his regular practice. Lord Punyashri[48] introduced this ceremony [to Tibet], where it became adopted by the Sakya patriarchs.[49] The procedure of this rite accords with Nagarjuna's Ceremony for the Formation of the Awakening Mind, Jetari's Ceremony for the Acceptance of the Sacred Commitments, and rites based on Shantideva's Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life and Compendium of Trainings.

The second ceremony was mystically transmitted by the bodhisattva Maitreya[50] to Asanga, who taught it to his brother, Vasubandhu.[51] Subsequently, it come down to the master Chandragomin,[52] who took it as his regular practice. Lord Atisha[53] introduced this ceremony [to Tibet], where it was adopted by the Kadampa[54] and the Dakpo Kagyu[55] schools. Its procedure accords with the rites based on Asanga's Stages of the Bodhisattva and Chandragomin's Twenty Verses on the Bodhisattva's Commitments.
Many Tibetan scholars believe Nagarjuna to be the founder of Centrism (mādhyamika) and Asanga to be the founder of Idealism (cittamātra). They therefore refer to those two ceremonies as the Centrist and Idealist traditions for the formation of awakening mind. They regard them as fundamentally different, claiming the one or the other to be the best. However, Lord Daö Shönnu (Gampopa)[56] does not refer [to these traditions] as Centrist and Idealist, and, for that matter, the master Abhayakara[57] does not consider there to be any difference between them. The omniscient Pema Karpo and others hold the same opinion and refute the [former] view using scriptures and reasoning. The illustrious Tsuklak Trengwa[58] and other scholars also agree with Gampopa.
Another ceremony for the formation of awakening mind, which resembles the Centrists' one, originated with the instructions of the greatly accomplished masters Virupa and Naropa.[59] This was handed down to the Sakya masters and now constitutes the procedure for the formation of awakening mind found in the preliminaries of the empowerments of their lineage. Although it stands in its own right, it is not considered to be different from the two ancient traditions of the pioneers.

According to the tradition of the profound view lineage, a suitable candidate for accepting the commitments of awakening mind is any being who has the capacity to articulate and to understand what is said, as well as the willingness to assume the commitments. One can refer to scriptures [for examples]. The Flower Ornament Scripture states that three thousand ocean-dwelling nagas were inspired by Manjushri to form [awakening] minds. The Fortunate Eon Scripture relates the following event[60]:
The victor Upakantha, as a mayor [in a past life],
Resolved to achieve supreme awakening
When he made a promise not to kill for one day
In the presence of the Transcendent Punyaprabha.
Furthermore, the Questions of Ratnachuda Scripture describes how twenty thousand gods and men made the resolve to attain awakening. The incomparable Gampopa, however, states that in order to form the awakening mind of aspiration, one must possess an affinity for the Universal Way, have awakened that affinity, and have sought refuge in the Three Jewels. Moreover, he asserts that in order to receive the commitments of a venturing mind, in addition to these [two requisites], an aspirant must have assumed one of the seven classes[61] of personal liberation vows (other than the purificatory fast precepts) and possess an aspiring awakening mind.

The qualifications of the master [in the presence of whom] one accepts the commitments of awakening mind have been described in the first chapter of this book in accordance with Shantideva's Compendium of Trainings and Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life. A person who cannot find [a qualified master] may accept the commitments before [an image or other] sacred representation [of the Buddha]. If even that is not available, one may visualize the buddhas and bodhisattvas in the sky before one and make the commitments by oneself in their presence.
The ceremony for assuming the commitments [is outlined in this way]: If the commitments are being made in the presence of a master, the disciple [offers] an imagined universe[62] and requests [the bestowal of the commitments]. The preliminary part consists in the purification of one's mind through performance of the seven-branch service[63] and, in particular, taking refuge in the Three Jewels.
</d>
</f>
<f>
<d e="1">
dngos gzhi smon 'jug gi sems bskyed sdom pa chab gcig tu len/ </d>
<d e="2">
The main body of the ceremony consists in accepting the commitments of the aspiring and venturing minds at the same time [by repeating three times Shantideva's formula:
All the enlightened ones of the past
Have formed awakening minds
And engaged themselves progressively
In the bodhisattvas' training.
In the same way, for the sake of all that lives,
I now form an awakening mind
And will apply myself in stages
To the training of the bodhisattvas.][64]

As the conclusion, the disciple cultivates joy [over having generated an awakening mind by reciting these prayers of Shantideva:
Today my life is fruitful:
Having attained a good human life,
I have been born into the family of the enlightened
And now I have become a buddha's child.
Henceforth, whatever happens,
I shall act in accordance with this line
In order not to sully this noble and faultless family.]
and exhorts others to rejoice [by reciting this verse:
Today, in the presence of all the protectors,
I invite all beings to be my guest
At this feast of temporary and ultimate happiness.
May gods, demigods, and all rejoice.]
In this way, one encourages oneself and others, and then recites [prayers not to forget] the precepts of awakening mind. [The ceremony is completed by] an offering to the master as a token of appreciation.

It is certainly possible to form at least the essence of an awakening mind by performing the ceremony to assume the commitments by oneself. However, scholars believe that for that mind to be bound by the commitments, the strength of the [spiritual] friend, the strength of the cause, and the other contributory factors [mentioned above] must be present.

Fourteen root downfalls of the commitments of training are explained in [Shantideva's] Compendium of Trainings in accordance with the Akashagarbha Scripture. Five of them apply mainly to kings, one applies exclusively to ministers, and eight apply to beginners. The five [downfalls] that apply mainly to kings who are bodhisattvas-intraining are the following[65]:
(1) To steal [or have someone steal] property that has been offered to representations of [the Buddha's] body, speech, and mind,[66] or to the monastic community;
(2) To reject [or cause someone to reject] the teachings of the Universal or Individual ways [by saying that they are not the words of the Buddha or that they are not the means to attain liberation];
(3) To harm someone who wears the attributes of a monk, regardless of whether he maintains the vows purely or is an immoral monk[67];
(4) To commit any of the five evil deeds of direct retribution, i.e., matricide, patricide, murder of a saint, causing a schism in the monastic community, or out of malice, causing a buddha to bleed; and
(5) To profess nihilistic views claiming that actions do not bring results and that there are no future lives, and engaging in unvirtuous types of behavior [or encouraging others to do so].

The eight root downfalls [that apply mainly to] beginner bodhisattvas are as follows[71]:
(1) To teach the profound subject of emptiness to those who are of limited intellect or to those who are untrained [in the Universal Way], causing them to be intimidated [by the Universalists' doctrine] and thereby to lose faith in it.[72]
(2) To cause someone to give up the intention to become fully enlightened and to enter the way of the proclaimers or solitary sages when that individual is already following the Universal Way, by declaring that he or she is not able to practice the six perfections and other aspects [of the Universal Way].
(3) To advise someone with an affinity for the Individual Way to abandon that path and then cause him or her to enter the Universal Way[73] without special necessity to do so.
(4) To believe and to cause another to believe, without any special necessity, that by following the Individual Way, one cannot conquer the emotions.[74]
(5) To praise oneself when one is not worthy and to belittle others when they do not deserve it, for the sake of wealth and honor.[75]
(6) To [falsely] claim, for the sake of wealth and honor, to have attained [direct] realization of profound [emptiness] by saying that one has understood profound truth and to incite others to meditate to achieve the same goal.[76]
(7) To cause a king or other person in a position of power to inflict a fine on a Buddhist monk by slandering him. If as a result the monk steals property of the Three Jewels in order to bribe oneself [the instigator] and one accepts it, one incurs this downfall. If one gives the property to the king, both [instigator and king] incur this downfall.
(8) To cause a good monk to abandon mental quiescence or other forms of spiritual practice by imposing unfair punishment on him, or to deprive a contemplative monk[77] of his life necessities and to give these directly or indirectly to a monk who merely recites scriptures. If the recipient is an accomplice to one's act, he or she also incurs this downfall.
These are the fourteen downfalls that apply to acute practitioners, five for kings, one exclusive to ministers, and eight for beginners.

Having entered the Universal Way, an obtuse practitioner must, at the very least, maintain the aspiration [to awaken]. Accordingly, the Advice to the King Scripture states that all precepts are fulfilled in this alone. To abandon one's [aspiration] is a very serious root downfall for any bodhisattva, whether acute, average, or obtuse. The Condensed Transcendent Wisdom Scripture states[79]:
Though [a bodhisattva] may have tread the path of the ten virtues[80] for ten million eons,
If his goal shifts to becoming a solitary sage or a saint, His ethics deteriorate and his commitments are lost.
Such a setback is far more serious than the defeating offense [of a monk].

The Compendium of Trainings lists eighty secondary infractions. Of these, twenty-four stem from disinterest in others' happiness and indifference to their suffering. The two basic infractions in this category are (1) failing to relieve the physical suffering or sorrow of others when able to do so, and (2) failing to provide physical comfort or happiness.
These two basic infractions are divided into four to distinguish the physical and mental aspects of suffering or happiness:
(1) failure to relieve the physical suffering of others when able to do so,
(2) failure to relieve their sorrow,
(3) failure to provide them with physical comfort, and
(4) failure to instill them with happiness.
These are further divided to draw a distinction between the present and future:
(1) failure to relieve in the present others' physical suffering or
(2) sorrow,
(3) failure to provide them in the present with physical comfort or
(4) happiness,
(5) failure to work so that others will be free in the future of physical suffering and
(6) sorrow, and
(7) failure to work so that in the future they will have comfort and
(8) happiness.
These eight are further divided to distinguish [failures to act] in three ways to relieve others' sufferings and provide them with happiness:
(1) failure to make an effort in order to relieve in the present others' physical suffering or (2) sorrow, or (3) in order to provide them in the present with physical comfort, and (4) happiness, etc., up to (8) to provide for their future happiness;
(9) failure to seek out the causes and conditions that would relieve in the present others' physical suffering, etc., up to (16) so that in the future they will have happiness; and
(17) failure to apply the remedial means to relieve in the present others' physical suffering, etc., up to (24) so that in the future they will have happiness.
Sixteen infractions stem from neglecting to accomplish [greater goals]. The two basic infractions (for these sixteen) are (1) failing to work even in the slightest to relieve great physical suffering, and (2) failing to work even in the slightest to relieve intense sorrow.

These two are divided to distinguish between present and future lives:
(1) failure to work even in the slightest to relieve in this life great physical suffering or (2) intense sorrow, and
(3) failure to work even in the slightest to remove [what would be the cause] in future lives of great physical suffering or (4) intense sorrow.
These are further divided to draw a distinction between oneself and others:
(1) failure to work even in the slightest to relieve one's own great physical suffering in this life or
(2) others' great physical suffering,
(3) failure to work even in the slightest to relieve one's own intense sorrow in this life or
(4) others' intense sorrow,
(5) failure to work even in the slightest to remove [what would be the cause] in future lives of great physical suffering for oneself or
(6) for others, and
(7) failure to work even in the slightest to remove [what would be the cause] in future lives of intense sorrow for oneself or
(8) for others.
The remaining eight infractions are derived from the two infractions of (1) failing to sacrifice [lesser goals] in order to accomplish the greater [goals] of providing solace or (2) affording physical comfort.
These two are divided as above into eight infractions by making the distinctions between [present and future] lives and oneself and others. For each of these forty infractions, the failing may be incidental or continuous; that further distinction yields a total of eighty infractions.

<d e="2">
The illustrious master Tsuklak Trengwa explains the six specific causes of loss of the commitments [of the mind of awakening]:
The causes for the irreparable loss of awakening mind's commitments
Are to give up seeking refuge [in the Three Jewels], to renounce the aspiration [for enlightenment],
To return one's commitments, to adopt wayward views,
To turn toward [the path of] the proclaimers and solitary sages, And to abandon [love for] any being.
Root downfalls damage and destroy [the commitments]; The various minor transgressions weaken them.
Lord Trinlepa explains that if any of the root downfalls (described in the Akashagarbha Scripture) is committed, some aspects of one's training in the venturing mind will be damaged. However, provided that one has not given up the resolve to awaken for the sake of all beings, the awakening mind of aspiration is not lost. As long as one maintains that aspiration, one's commitments are never damaged beyond restoration.[81]

If the commitments of awakening mind have deteriorated because the aspiring mind has been relinquished, they can be restored by assuming them again in a ceremony. The Akashagarbha Scripture states that any root downfall may be amended by invoking the bodhisattva Akashagarbha and acknowledging the infraction in his presence when he appears in one's dream.[82] Likewise, [Shantideva's] Compendium of Trainings states[83]:
Openly confess to the bodhisattva Akashagarbha
[When he appears] in your dreams.
Minor offenses that contradict the precepts of awakening mind should be acknowledged during each of the six periods (three daytime periods and three nighttime). As taught in A Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life, acknowledgment may be made by reciting the Three-Part Scripture[84] and by strengthening the awakening mind.
The master Krishna[85] taught [a different method for the restoration of commitments] for each of three kinds of practitioners. Superior practitioners [restore their commitments] through understanding the unborn nature of all that exists. Average practitioners do so by invoking the deities of the awareness mantra, [a favored deity, or Akashagarbha, and by confessing in front of them]. Inferior practitioners, because they conceive the downfall as something real, [must restore their commitments] by regretting [the downfall] and openly acknowledging it to another person.[86]

<d e="2">
Generally, if one does not amend the downfall by the end of a threehour period following its occurrence, confession is “overdue,” and it becomes an actual downfall. If the time limit for acknowledgment has not passed, the commitments are restored simply by the conscientious [performance] of the means for renewal described above. If the time limit for acknowledgment has passed (for example, if the downfall is left without confession for a number of days), the downfall can be purified by confessing it with the help of the four forces and accepting the commitments again.
The four forces are the following: the force of reliance, which is to take refuge [by repeating the refuge formula called] Prayer to the Chief Victorious One[87] or any other one; the force of repudiation, which is to specify the downfall, regretting it intensely; the force of remedial action, which is to employ the six kinds of remedies,[88] such as recitation of recollection mantras (dhāraṇī) and other mantras, principally the one-hundred-syllable mantra of the transcendent ones; and the force of renewal, which is to promise not to repeat [the misdeed].

Most of the points of training discussed so far prescribe what actions should be avoided. Of the points of training that prescribe what should be practiced, a few will be given below; a full presentation of them is provided in scriptures on this subject. One should promise to practice these only to the extent one feels capable of and only for as long as one feels able to, be it a day, a month, a year, this life, or until awakening. The Compendium of Trainings states[89]:
Assume commitments according to your ability [to honor them]. To do otherwise would be to deceive all the buddhas, the bodhisattvas, and the whole world, including the gods.

According to the tradition of the magnificent deeds lineage, a suitable candidate for the commitments of awakening mind must definitely hold one of the seven classes of personal liberation vows. Anyone with obstacles to receiving personal liberation vows would not be able to assume these commitments.
The spiritual master in the presence of whom the commitments are assumed must fulfill the qualifications described in the first chapter, which are encompassed by the following four qualities: ideally, learned in the [three] collections of scriptures, but at least well-versed in the ritual procedure for the bestowal of the commitments; capable of communicating clearly with the aspirant; possessed of undegenerated commitments; loving toward students and capable of nurturing [their spiritual development]. Such a teacher is definitely necessary [for assuming the commitments] and should be searched for unless one's life or chastity would be at risk. If one fails in one's search, the commitments may be made before a representation of the Three Jewels, as stated in Stages of the Bodhisattva[90]:
If it does not entail peril to one's life or chastity, an aspirant should search for a spiritual friend within one league and an earshot.[91] If none is found, the aspirant may accept the commitments alone or before a representation of the Three Jewels.[92]
However, the elder Bodhibhadra[93] and others have stated that the presence of a master is indispensable when renewing commitments that have deteriorated.
The works of Asanga and those of the masters who immediately follow him in the lineage do not clearly set out a ritual for assuming the commitments of the mind of aspiration. The actual ceremony, considered to be a pith instruction transmitted by Maitreya, was later introduced by Lord Atisha.[94]
In this tradition, the commitments of the aspiring mind and venturing mind are assumed in two separate ceremonies. Both procedures comprise [three stages]: (1) [prior to the ceremony itself] the aspirant becoming a “definite candidate” [for the commitments]; (2) the preliminary, central, and conclusive parts of the ceremony; and (3) a description of the nature of awakening mind [its causes, etc.].

<d e="2">
The aspirant becomes a definite candidate [by contemplating pertinent advice which transforms his or her attitude so that] he or she gives up adherence to the two extremes [of attachment to cyclic existence and complacency in the peace of liberation], and then develops an earnest interest in generating an awakening mind.
The preliminary part of the ceremony for the commitments of aspiring mind is composed of [the offering of a mandala and] the request [for the bestowal of the commitments] made to the special referent, the master; taking refuge in the special support [the Three Jewels]; and the application of special means, which is the cultivation of merit [by performing the sevenfold service].
The central part of the ceremony consists in assuming the commitments. This is accomplished through one's own strength (an awakened spiritual affinity), the strength of others (discerning the marvelous qualities of complete awakening by [listening to] the master's words), and the strength of application (that gives rise to the [three] attitudes of disengagement from cyclic existence, disenchantment with perfect peace, and earnest interest in awakening mind.)
The ceremony is concluded by rejoicing, receiving instruction in training, and offering the teacher a token of appreciation.[95]

</d>
<d e="2">
A practitioner who has formed the aspiration to awaken through such ritual should study the scriptures concerning the bodhisattva's training. Later, when the practitioner has developed faith [in the teachings] and the capacity for putting them into practice, he or she may assume the commitments of the venturing mind.
The ceremony for assuming the commitments of venturing mind has three parts: the preliminary, the central part, and the conclusion. The preliminary part of the ceremony consists of a request, the teacher's examination of the candidate's motivation, an entreaty for immediate bestowal [of the commitments], inquiry concerning [possible] obstacles for the candidate, acquainting the candidate with the nature of the training, and inquiry about his or her interest [in the training].[96]
The central part of the ceremony consists in assuming the commitments with a threefold repetition of the promise [to follow the training]. The ceremony is concluded with a supplication [that the aspirant's promise] be acknowledged [by the buddhas and bodhisattvas], an explanation of the merits [of the venturing mind], advice to maintain secrecy, instructions on points of training, and offerings of appreciation.[97]
For the third stage, the description of the nature of awakening mind, the master explains in detail to the beginner bodhisattva the causes, essence, aspects, and benefits of the aspiring mind; and those same details of the venturing mind at the end of their respective ceremonies. In both traditions, [that of the profound view and this one,] the end of the third recitation of the formula for assuming the commit-
ments marks the point at which the commitments were accepted.

The four root downfalls, comparable [in gravity] to the defeating offenses of a monk, are enumerated in [Chandragomin's] Twenty Verses on the Bodhisattva's Commitments[98] as a summary of the discussion of the subject in the Stages of the Bodhisattva[99]:
To praise oneself and belittle others [who are endowed with wholesome qualities] out of desire for wealth and honor;
To be miserly with one's personal wealth, i.e., not to give spiritual instructions to those who yearn for them or material aid to the needy, the pitiful, the poor, or the destitute;
Not to forgive someone though he has apologized and, in anger, to strike the person with one's hands, sticks, or in other ways;
To disparage and reject the Universal Way as it is presented in the scriptures that expound the bodhisattva's [training], and to delight in and give false teachings while pretending that they are true Buddhism.
The three conditions necessary for these four deeds to be root downfalls are to have assumed the commitments, to be in a normal state of mind, and to be emotionally involved in the act. Depending on the degree of [emotional] involvement, the downfalls may be serious, moderate, or slight. When there is a considerable degree of emotional involvement and all three of these conditions are met, the downfall is comparable to a defeating offense within the proclaimers' system (i.e., for a monk) [since the commitments are destroyed]. If the involvement is moderate, the downfall is comparable to a partially defeating offense; if slight, to a monk's minor downfall. [In the last two cases, downfalls do not destroy the commitments].
To perpetuate the act, feel no shame or embarrassment about it, be pleased with it, and regard it as a good deed [constitutes] great emotional involvement. The involvement is moderate or slight depending on the presence of many or few of such factors.[100] Further distinctions of involvement are made based on the lapse of time before shame arises, how long it lasts, how quickly [one turns away from the infraction], etc.

(2) To embrace the proclaimers' way after forsaking the Universal Way[127];
(3) To study non-Buddhist treatises[128] after forsaking the Universal Way; and
(4) To prefer the Individual Way or non-Buddhist literature although attaching oneself to the Universal Way.[129]
Four contradictions concern the highest [spiritual pursuits]:
(1) Not to take interest in the distinctive features of the Universal Way[130];
(2) Not to seek the true teachings due to pride or laziness, and so forth[131];
(3) To praise oneself and belittle others[132]; and

<d e="2">
The Stages of the Bodhisattva states that the two causes[148] of loss [of the commitments] are to incur a root downfall with great emotional involvement or to allow one's aspiration for enlightenment to deteriorate. In these cases, a complete breach of the commitments is incurred. [To restore it], one must first acknowledge one's failing and promise not to repeat it and then reassume the commitments in a ceremony. However, the venerable Longchenpa said that this may not be done more than three times.
Downfalls incurred with either moderate or slight emotional involvement [do not constitute loss of the commitments and] are not [actually] defeats but are similar to them.[149] In the case of moderate involvement, one must acknowledge the downfall with a promise to refrain [from it in the future] made in the presence of three or more vow holders[150]; in the case of slight involvement, in the presence of a single vow holder. Any of the forty-two minor infractions incurred with emotional involvement should be acknowledged in the presence of a vow holder if circumstances allow. Non-emotional minor infractions are purified by acknowledgment [of the failing] in the imagined presence of the
buddhas and bodhisattvas, with one's own mind as witness.[151]
The general causes of loss of the commitments have been elucidated above and should be well understood. Although the returning of vows is permitted in the personal liberation system, to return the commitments of the awakening mind would have extremely serious consequences and is therefore absolutely prohibited.
Dying, being reborn, forgetting [one's previous existence], and so on, do not damage one's commitments. The Stages of the Bodhisattva states[152]:
In going from one life to another, a bodhisattva may forget his commitments. He may assume them again many times in the presence of spiritual guides, as a result of which he may recollect his [former] commitments. However, this would not be a case of taking them anew.

<d e="2">
For the training common to both traditions, first is the training in the awakening mind of aspiration which consists in the observance of five precepts:
(1) Not to reject or consider insignificant any being, be it an enemy or a mere insect (the basic precept);
(2) To ponder the benefits of awakening mind by recalling and reciting passages from the scriptures and their commentaries, as did the great Lord Atisha, who was renowned for his sudden exclamations such as “[Awakening mind] saves us from miserable existences!” (the precept of the favorable condition for preserving aspiring mind);
(3) To strive at the cultivation of merit in conjunction with pristine awareness by engaging in the ten virtuous activities,[153] the six perfections, etc. (the precept of the cause that strengthens the awakening mind);
(4) To refine awakening mind by reaffirming one's commitments daily in each of the six [three-hour] periods, cultivating love and compassion, and practicing an oral instruction to develop awakening mind using a technique that is the basis of mind training—exchanging one's own happiness for others' suffering (the precept of the skillful means to develop awakening mind); and
(5) To shun the four black deeds and undertake the four white ones (as the means to give up what weakens the awakening mind or causes one to forget it, and to engage in the opposite).

</d>
<d e="2">
These four black deeds are explained in the Questions of Kashyapa Scripture[154];
(1) To deceive one's master or other persons worthy of veneration by lying or in other ways;
(2) To feel regret for what is not regrettable (regrettable actions are those that constitute downfalls or unwholesome deeds);
(3) To speak offensive words in anger to someone who has formed an awakening mind; and
(4) To be cunning and deceitful toward someone, whether in substantial or minor ways.
Regardless of whether the offended person is aware or not, or is displeased or not, these four deeds constitute downfalls and are therefore called black. If [one fails to amend any of these acts] before three hours have elapsed, the commitments are lost. Therefore, one must acknowledge one's wrongdoing, and reaffirm the commitments immediately.
As antidotes to the four black deeds, these four white actions should be undertaken:
(1) Not to consciously tell a lie, even to save one's life;
(2) To encourage others to engage in virtuous pursuits and, in particular, to follow the Universal Way,
(3) To see every bodhisattva as the Buddha, and to proclaim his or her virtues; and
(4) To maintain a noble [and altruistic] attitude toward others.

The first makes our minds calm, the second ripens our minds' qualities, and the third brings all sentient beings to full spiritual maturity.[157]

The prescription for what to avoid is essentially the ethics of restraining from what is unwholesome. Included in this prescription are the ordinary vows one has taken [as part of] the eight classes of personal liberation, as well as the commitments exclusive to the Universal Way to avoid the root downfalls and secondary infractions explained above in the context of the two traditions of the pioneers [Nagarjuna and Asanga]. Also included is the advice to shun what is incompatible with the commitments of awakening mind as set out in the scriptures of the Universal Way and referred to as “demonic”:
(1) The ten unvirtuous deeds;
(2) The eight worldly concerns[158];
(3) The eight opposites of the eightfold noble path[159] (wrong view, wrong thought, etc.);
(4) The five forms of wrong livelihood (flattery, hinting, seeking reward for favor, pretentious behavior, and hypocrisy);
(5) The five unsuitable environments (of butchers, liquor sellers, prostitutes, politicians, and those of evil occupations[160]);
(6) The four causes that undermine virtue (not dedicating merits, inappropriate dedication, regretting one's good deeds, and anger); and
(7) The mixing of contradictory views, cherishing bad friends, professing unwholesome views, and so forth.

A practitioner should engage in what brings great happiness in future lives though it may entail suffering in the present one, for example, withstanding difficulties in seeking the Buddha's teaching and making large offerings to worthy objects; what brings both immediate and permanent happiness, such as observing pure morality; and deeds that do not constitute downfalls, as well as deeds that seem to be downfalls but in fact are not.
Four distinctions apply to deeds categorized as downfalls: In observing the ethics of restraint, to kill someone motivated by hatred [for example] would constitute a downfall (Tib. ltung ba); to kill with an altruistic purpose might seem to be a downfall but actually is not (ltung ba'i gzugs brnyan); to refrain from killing out of compassion for the object does not constitute a downfall (ltung med); and not to kill although it would help another might seem not to be a downfall but actually is (ltung med gzugs brnyan).
In observing the ethics aimed at acquiring good qualities, not to give because of miserliness [for example] would be a downfall; to refrain from giving because one has an altruistic purpose in not giving resembles a downfall but is not one; to give with pure intention does not constitute a downfall; and to give in order to harm others might seem not to be a downfall but in fact is.
In observing the ethics of working for the benefit of all beings, not to nurse the sick [for example] would be a downfall; not to nurse the sick in order to accomplish a higher goal resembles a downfall but in fact is not; to lovingly nurse the sick does not constitute a downfall; to renounce a higher goal such as one's own meditation or study to nurse a sick person when there already is a nurse attending to his needs might seem not to be a downfall but actually is one.

Twenty Verses on the Bodhisattva's Commitments states[161]:
When one's action springs from compassionate concern, love, Or a virtuous intention, no fault is incurred.
When a person acts from three motives—compassionate concern, love, or virtuous intention—and without any self-interest but solely to help another, no downfall is incurred in doing any of the actions in [the above scheme of] four distinctions unless it entails losing the commitments of awakening mind. In fact, acting in these ways is said to be part of one's training [in awakening mind].[162]

The six perfections are described generally in terms of their number, order, characteristics, semantic meaning, divisions, and groups. First, the perfections number exactly six in view of the goals of higher states and liberation to which they lead: the first three, generosity, ethics, and patience, lead to rebirth in higher states of existence, while the latter three lead to liberation. A different explanation states that by practicing the first three one accomplishes the benefit of others, and the last three, one's own purpose.
The six perfections are presented in a set order, from generosity to wisdom, to reflect their gradual development, as ethics develops from generosity, patience from ethics, and so on. According to another explanation, the order represents degrees of excellence, the lesser presented first and the greater later (ethics being superior to generosity, etc.) or in the sequence of coarse to subtle. In any case, those easier to cultivate are presented first.
The perfections possess four characteristics: they weaken miserliness and other emotions incompatible [with generosity, and so forth]; they are accompanied by pristine awareness which is free of the concepts of act, agent, and object; their function is to fulfill the needs of others; and their result is the maturation of students' minds in accordance with the three spiritual ways.[164]
They are called perfections [“transcendent virtues”] because they transcend all the virtues of worldly beings, proclaimers, and solitary sages, and lead to the perfect state.
Each perfection may be divided into six branches, the generosity of generosity, the generosity of ethics, etc., to make thirty-six branches, which may be further subdivided into one hundred or one thousand.[165]
The perfections may be grouped according to the two cultivations of merit and pristine awareness: generosity and ethics are the means to cultivate merit; discriminative wisdom, the means to cultivate pristine awareness; and the other three, the means to cultivate both merit and pristine awareness. They may also be grouped according to the three types of training: the first three (generosity, ethics, and patience) belong to the training in higher ethics; the fifth (meditation), to the training in meditation; and the sixth (discriminative wisdom), to the training in wisdom; effort accompanies all three trainings.[166]

<d e="2">
An explanation of four aspects of each perfection—definition, etymology, classifications, and purpose—will not be provided at this point. However, the essential points will be covered.
Generosity is threefold, that of material aid, the Buddhist teachings, and protection. The generosity of material goods includes the “gift” of one's various possessions, “great gift” [of spouse or children], or “highest gift” [of the parts of one's body]. For generosity to be authentic, it must be unpolluted by the four stains of improper intention, gift, recipient, or manner of giving.[167]
The generosity of the teachings is to teach the Universal or Individual ways according to the intellectual ability of aspirants.
The generosity of protection means to save from temporary fear those threatened by rulers, tigers, lions, fire, flood, disease, weapons, etc., and from lasting fear those [who have fallen into lower forms of life or are bound to cyclic existence]. (An alternative system distinguishes the following three forms of generosity: continuous generosity, impartial generosity, and generosity that fulfills the wishes of others.[168])
Ethics is threefold: ethics of restraint from what is unwholesome, ethics aimed at acquiring good qualities, and ethics of working for the benefit of all beings. These three have been explained above.
Patience is threefold: patience in withstanding harmful persons, accepting hardships, and determining reality.
Patience in withstanding harm done by others means not to retaliate for the harm done to one's person or interests. This patience is developed through meditation according to the nine methods[169] taught in Shantideva's Guide to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life or by cultivating the five thoughts described in Asanga's Stages of the Bodhisattva.[170]
Patience in accepting hardships consists in enduring difficulties, such as fatigue, hunger, and thirst, that one may encounter in the quest for the teachings.[171]
Patience in determining reality means not to be discouraged or intimidated by profound subjects such as emptiness.

<d e="2">
Effort is threefold: armor-like effort, effort applied to the task, and insatiable effort.[172] Armor-like effort means to [wear the armor of] endeavor in what is wholesome throughout every single session of practice, with the intention of never relinquishing it until awakening is attained.
Effort applied to the task means never to be indifferent to the three areas [of training]: to overcome one's emotions, to accomplish what is wholesome, and to work for the benefit of all sentient beings. The second of these, effort in accomplishing what is wholesome, is fivefold: ever-active effort, devoted effort, effort unshaken by emotions, effort not deflected by circumstances, and effort without pride.[173] Insatiable effort means never considering one's virtuous endeavor
to be sufficient.
Meditation is of three kinds: meditation through which one rests in a state of ease in the present life, meditation aimed at acquiring good qualities, and meditation of working for the welfare of others.[174] Meditation through which one rests in a state of ease in the present life refers to the meditative concentration that produces both the ap-
proximate and subtle aspects of perfect physical and mental ease.[175] Meditation aimed at acquiring good qualities has common and
exclusive aspects. The common aspect refers to the powers of totalities, masteries, liberations, and so forth[176]; and the exclusive, to the powers that are special qualities of the bodhisattvas only.[177]
The meditation of working for the welfare of others refers to the meditative concentration through which one uplifts others spiritually by demonstrating miracles, using supernatural knowledge, etc.

Wisdom [or discriminative wisdom] is of three types: worldly, lower supramundane, and higher supramundane wisdom, each being progressively superior.
Worldly wisdom refers to learning [derived from study of] the common sciences.[178]
Lower supramundane wisdom refers to the understanding of the four truths [derived from learning, pondering, and meditating on] the tenets of the proclaimers and solitary sages.
Higher supramundane wisdom refers to the understanding of the two types of selflessness [derived from listening, pondering, and meditating upon] the tenets of the Universal Way.
An alternative system distinguishes the following three types of wisdom: the wisdom that arises from listening, from pondering, and from meditating.
The wisdom that arises from listening refers to knowledge of many scriptures and reasonings and comprehension of their meanings.
The wisdom that arises from pondering refers to the elimination of misconceptions about the objects of knowledge gained from a discriminative understanding of the four philosophical systems,[179] the relative and ultimate truths, the definitive message [of the scriptures] and the interpretable one, and other subjects.
The wisdom that arises from meditation refers to the realization of the abiding nature [of reality] which results from meditating on those subjects.

One's practice of the six perfections must incorporate six noble components:
(1) A noble foundation, which is to have formed the resolve to awaken;
(2) A noble deed, which is generosity and the other perfections practiced impartially in all their different aspects;
(3) A noble referent, which is to engage in the six perfections for the benefit of all other beings;
(4) A noble means, in which the six perfections are permeated with wisdom free of the concepts of act, agent, and object;
(5) A noble dedication, which is to dedicate the merit thus acquired to the attainment of unsurpassable awakening;
(6) A noble purity, which is to engage in the six perfections as direct remedies to the two types of impediments (emotional impediments and impediments to omniscience).
Of particular importance is the perfection of wisdom. Practice of the first five perfections without non-conceptual wisdom constitutes only worldly good deeds. On this point, the Condensed Transcendent Wisdom Scripture states[180]:
How will a hundred billion blind people Find the road, let alone enter a city?
Lacking wisdom, the other five perfections are blind,
And without the guide of wisdom, enlightenment cannot be attained.
These perfections become “supramundane perfections” when such wisdom accompanies them.[181]

Once a practitioner has come to spiritual maturity by following the ethics aimed at acquiring good qualities, he or she should engage in the ethics of working for the benefit of all beings. These ethics include the four means of attracting disciples: generous acts, pleasant speech, suitable teachings, and appropriate behavior:
(1) In order to attract new disciples, the master acts generously by offering gifts that will please them.
(2) Once disciples are attracted, the master uses pleasant speech to draw them closer while giving them teachings on the Buddhist doctrine. In this way, the master instills in them enthusiasm for and appreciation of the teachings, as well as earnest interest in putting them into practice.
(3) The master guides disciples in practicing the teachings suitable to their capabilities. Children must be nourished first with liquid and then [as they grow] with solid foods. Similarly, disciples of different intellectual capacities cannot be spiritually nourished by one instruction alone.
(4) The master behaves in accordance with the teachings in order to be a leading [example] for disciples in their virtuous endeavors and in [their pursuit of] the Buddha's teachings.
The words “other ways” [in the above root verse] indicate that one should also earnestly put into practice the twelve ways [of helping others that are included in the four means of attraction], which are opposite to the twelve contradictions to working for the welfare of others previously mentioned.

Awakening mind should be safeguarded by relying on mindfulness, discriminating alertness, and conscientiousness. Mindfulness means never to forget awakening mind and always to maintain its precepts. Discriminating alertness is to recognize whether or not an infraction [of the precepts] has occurred. Conscientiousness means to be strict in one's observance of proper behavior and avoidance of wrongful acts. In particular, once one has formed a precious mind of awakening and is engaged in its training, one should strive to preserve, refine, and enhance both this mind and its training. To preserve awakening mind so that it does not deteriorate means to abide in the essence of the aspiring and venturing minds and abide by the precepts conducive to its preservation. To refine awakening mind means to abide by the precepts whereby one shuns all wrong actions and avoids nonconducive conditions. To enhance the virtue [of awakening mind] means to exchange one's own happiness for others' suffering and to
abide by the precepts conducive to virtue's enhancement.
To preserve the training means to scrupulously avoid what is prohibited and practice what is advised. To refine the training is to forsake inappropriate actions of body, speech, and mind—purposeless jumping, running, and moving about; excessive, harsh, or divisive words; harboring desire for material gain or fame, and attachment to sleep and mental inertia—and to cultivate peaceful, relaxed, pleasant, and considerate behavior; gentle and moderate speech; and a mind of faith and detachment. To enhance the training is to develop three aspects of the training: pristine awareness, discriminative awareness, and the dedication [of merit].

Furthermore, both awakening mind and its training should be diligently preserved through techniques of mental development, such as making the forty-one [prayers] to cultivate awakening mind as taught in the Pure Domain chapter of the Flower Ornament Scripture.[182] As well, the following four practices should be undertaken since all aspects of the commitments of the awakening mind are encompassed by them: To give others [one's body, wealth, and virtues, which are] the three bases for generosity, to safeguard awakening mind, to refine it, and to enhance it. Accordingly, the Compendium of Trainings states[183]:
To give away to others one's body and belongings And all virtues throughout time,
And to guard one's awakening mind, To refine it, and enhance it.
It is important to understand that a beginner will be primarily concerned with safeguarding [the awakening mind]; a bodhisattva whose practice is based on appreciation,[184] with refining it; those who are on the seven impure levels,[185] with giving [all they have to others]; and those on the three pure levels, with expanding [the awakening mind].

The formation of a relative awakening mind serves as the general condition for the arising of an ultimate awakening mind. The specific factors that determine the formation of the ultimate mind are stated by the incomparable Gampopa in the following words[186]:
It arises from the distinguished factors of scriptures, practice, and realization.
Ultimate awakening mind may arise as a result of learning and pondering the scriptural teachings or realizing it as spiritual accomplishment, or both of these together. It may also arise from a realization awakened in the depths of one's heart through the blessing of a marvelous connection between oneself and a qualified teacher. In all cases, however, the actual cause of ultimate awakening mind is the generation of an immense wave of altruistic deeds.

The essence of ultimate awakening mind is pristine awareness, the direct realization of the non-conceptual nature of reality. Accordingly, the incomparable physician of Dakpo states[187]:
What is ultimate awakening mind? It is emptiness endowed with the essence of compassion, clear, unwavering, and free from fabrications of any objectifiable attributes.
Such pristine awareness is an awakening mind existing as the nature of the meditative equipoise of exalted bodhisattvas dwelling on the various stages of awakening. It also exists as the nature of indivisible equipoise and post-equipoise at the buddha's stage.

Lord of the Teachings Jikten Sumgön and his followers believe that ultimate awakening mind can be formed in a ritual and substantiate their assertion with quotations from discourses and tantras.[188] The ultimate awakening mind taught in the tantras can arise in a ceremony; therefore (they say) the one taught in the discourses can be formed in a ritual, just as the vows of personal liberation [can be assumed in a tantric as well as a non-tantric ceremony]. To prove that the Secret Mantra system speaks of the formation of the ultimate awakening mind, they say that in the context of the tantras, the “creative imagination of a vajra standing on a moon,”[189] though it is not called so, is well known to be referring to the formation of the ultimate awakening mind.
The following objection may be raised to their position: One cannot speak of the formation of the ultimate awakening mind in relation to the “creative imagination of a vajra standing on a moon” because this creative imagination, being a technique to train on the path using the aspect [of the resultant buddhahood], does not produce the actual ultimate mind of awakening, but only a facsimile of it.
To this objection, they reply that [if one cannot speak of formation of ultimate awakening mind just because it is not the actual awakening mind that is formed but only a facsimile,] similarly one could not speak of the formation of the commitments of the venturing awakening mind or the generation of other vows as well. However, this is not the case. For example, though the vows of personal liberation are ordinary when initially assumed, they later become genuine when they become imbued with renunciation. Likewise, the commitments of awakening mind initially exist simply as aspects of a virtuous mind. Later, when the bodhisattva actually enters the path of accumulation, the totality of mind and mental states becomes of one nature with the commitments, and, as a result, the genuine aspiring and venturing minds are formed. In the same way, [the ultimate awakening mind of] the non-conceptual pristine awareness [of reality] is initially cognized through a powerful ritual. Later, when the roots of virtue ripen, the continuity of such cognition evolves into a direct realization [of reality, which is ultimate awakening mind].
On the basis of such reasonings, Jikten Sumgön and his followers adopted the system [of performing a ritual for formation of ultimate awakening mind].

Sakya Pandita, however, presents a different perspective on this argument[190]:
Ultimate awakening mind arises through the power of meditation, not by a ritual. If it were possible [by ritual], ultimate awakening mind would be formed simply by indications, and to call that [ultimate] is not logical.[191] Although it is possible that the Buddha [as cited in the Hundred Rites of Renunciation and Fulfillment[192]] declared “You should form the ultimate awakening mind!” this refers simply to a promise, not to a rite [for the formation of the ultimate awakening mind].
The followers of the outstanding Ngari Panchen also assert that the ultimate awakening mind cannot arise in a ritual.[193]
These two perspectives do not contradict each other. The former view [that of Jikten Sumgön] asserts that the ritual produces a facsimile [of ultimate awakening mind], while the latter [that of Sakya Pandita], that a ritual cannot produce a genuine [ultimate awakening mind]. However, it would be unreasonable to say that the adherents [of Sakya Pandita's view] categorically deny the possibility of ultimate awakening mind arising in a ritual. In fact, the reasons and proofs that validate the statement, “the pristine awareness of the fourth empowerment arises depending just on words,” [which these followers are bound to accept] are similar to those that would validate the statement, “ultimate awakening mind arises in a ritual.”

What is the actual nature of ultimate awakening mind? In the Secret Mantra system, it is considered to be non-dual pristine awareness. The assertions of different masters seem to indicate many levels of subtlety. However, from the perspective of the Way of the Perfections, ultimate awakening mind is awakening mind possessed of three ultimate aspects: absolute dedication, subsequent achievement, and realization,[194] as stated in [Maitreya's] Scripture Ornament[195]:
Because the perfect buddhas have been well honored,
And merit and awareness have been thoroughly cultivated, Because non-conceptual pristine awareness has arisen,
It is said to be ultimate.
Scholars [of the Universal Way] consider ultimate awakening mind to be the pristine awareness of the direct realization of the selflessness of phenomena, which is naturally present on the first stage of awakening. This pristine awareness arises as a result of honoring the perfect buddhas (the principal condition) while on the path of accumulation; and of cultivating merit and pristine awareness over an incalculable eon (the cause) while on the path of preparation.[196]

The scriptures state that deterioration of the training in awakening mind leads to unlimited negative consequences. These are summarized in the following four consequences (the first three are general consequences of downfalls; the fourth, specific consequences of a root downfall):
(1) One becomes an object of everyone's scorn because one has broken a promise and thereby deceived the teacher, the Buddha, sentient beings for whose benefit one was working, and oneself, the perpetrator.
(2) Like a king losing his kingdom, one loses one's purpose in life, and consequently all sorts of misfortunes, both immediate and in the long run, befall one.
(3) In the future one will fall into miserable forms of life, from which escape is difficult.
(4) All the virtues one had amassed by forming an awakening mind are nullified; the Three Jewels and the deities [who favor the Buddhist teachings] are deceived, and as a result, one is reborn in one of the great hells. Even though one may have felt some shame or embarrassment, acknowledged one's mistake, and reaffirmed one's commitments, if one has engaged in a downfall, the attainment of the stage of a bodhisattva is greatly delayed.
Similarly, Shantideva says[197]:
Those who have the power of awakening mind
But have committed a downfall
Stay revolving in cyclic existence,
And are greatly delayed in reaching the [bodhisattva's] stages.
Therefore, from the very beginning, a bodhisattva should make every effort to prevent transgressions to the training.

To safeguard the training in awakening mind brings unlimited benefits, which are summarized in the following ten (eight merits are accrued from safeguarding the mind of aspiration; two, from the venturing mind). The eight are illustrated in the following words of the incomparable Gampopa[198]:
Preserving the aspiration to awaken brings eight benefits: one enters the Universal Way; one becomes a candidate for the training of a bodhisattva; all evil deeds are uprooted; the seed of unsurpassable awakening is planted; infinite merits are amassed; all buddhas are pleased; all beings are served; and full enlightenment is swiftly reached.
In addition to those, two special merits are accrued from safeguarding the venturing mind:
(1) From the time an awakening mind has first been formed, the flow of merit never ceases, [even when] asleep or careless, thus fulfilling one's own purpose.
(2) The interest of others is accomplished in various ways, by alleviating their misery, working for their well being, etc.
Moreover, each of the six perfections is said to yield its own boundless merits. In short, from now until the attainment of enlightenment, all of one's noble qualities will spring from the precious mind of awakening. Thus, awakening mind is the source of all happiness and well being, now and in the future.

The phases of this path are summarized in Maitreya's Scripture Ornament[199]:
To awaken spiritual affinity, show interest in the teachings,
Engender awakening mind,
Practice generosity and the other perfections,
Bring others to spiritual maturity,[200]
Enter a faultless state,[201] Create buddha fields,[202]
Attain non-abiding perfect peace,[203]
And demonstrate the path to supreme awakening.[204]
An awakened affinity for the Universal Way, which forms the basis for all good fortune, is indicated by the qualities of compassion, respect, patience, and delight in the practice of virtue. One who possesses such qualities will show an undivided interest in the teachings and form a connection by seeking refuge [in the Three Jewels], which means to enter the Buddhist path. To engender a supreme awakening mind marks one's entrance to the Universal Way.
Once one has entered the Universal Way, the practice of the six perfections (generosity, etc.) brings one to spiritual maturity. Striving to the best of one's ability, both in the state of equipoise and postequipoise, at the four means to attract disciples brings others to spiritual maturity.
As a natural consequence of these efforts, one's focus never shifts from spiritual development. Faith, renunciation, meditation, and other forms of virtue are never tired of; enthusiasm increases as naturally as a swan alights on a lotus pond. These signs indicate the start of the journey on the lesser path of accumulation.[205]
Effort is then directed toward the attainment of exalted qualities, such as the abilities [to enter] faultless meditative absorption and to create a buddha field.[206] Gaining some measure of a clear impression of the [sixteen] attributes of the four truths[207] is to achieve the path of accumulation.
The strength of meditation [on the four truths] conjoined with the strength of the cultivation of all aspects of merit produces the realization of the phantom-like nature of the five aggregates.[208] Gradually a clear understanding of phenomenal selflessness is achieved; this is the path of preparation.

The first sight of the essential meaning of the two kinds of selflessness marks one's entrance onto the path of seeing. Further cultivation of special meditative concentrations focused on the [two selflessnesses] previously understood characterizes the path of meditation. Finally, the apex of knowledge and freedom is reached on the path of no more learning.
The correlation between these paths and the bodhisattva's stages of awakening is as follows. On the path of seeing, the bodhisattva attains the pristine awareness of that path and the first stage of awakening simultaneously. On the path of meditation, he or she traverses all stages up to and including the ninth. On the path of no more learning,[209] the bodhisattva enters the oceanic tenth stage (called Cloud of the Teachings).
In summary, the basis for all five paths and ten stages is awakening mind. By relying on ultimate awakening mind, the bodhisattva traverses the five paths using discriminative awareness applied to the meditation on emptiness as the primary cause and the skillful means of great compassion as the contributing condition. By relying on relative awakening mind, the bodhisattva attains the ten stages[210] using the skillful means of compassion as the primary cause and wisdom of emptiness as the contributing condition. To attain the stage of buddhahood is to have reached the end of all paths and attained the dimension of reality and the end of all stages and the form dimensions [of a buddha].[211]
The result of fulfilling all the paths and stages is supreme awakening, which is limited neither to cyclic existence due to great wisdom nor to perfect peace due to great compassion. In supreme awakening, all the qualities of the stage of full enlightenment are spontaneously present, and the marvelous activity of revealing the path to all beings in response to their needs continues until the end of time.

Masters of the later translation schools state that there are two ways of entering the Secret Mantra Way: those with a weak connection to Mantra are led to this way gradually; those whose connection is strong are led to it straightaway.
The former method is explicitly taught in the Hevajra Tantra and is an implicit guideline in other tantras as well. Initially [the aspirant] is introduced gradually to [different levels of] conduct. Accordingly, the Two-Part Hevajra Tantra states[3]:
First, bestow the purificatory fast [precepts]. Then, [teach] the ten areas of training.[4]
Then [the aspirant] is introduced gradually to [different levels of] philosophical views. The same tantra states[5]:
To disciples [grounded in that training], teach [the philosophy] Of the Analysts, and then [in progressive stages],
That of the Traditionalists, the Experientialists, And that of the Central Way.[6]
After learning the views, the disciple enters the levels of the different classes of tantra. The same tantra states[7]:
Once all levels of mantra are known,[8] Teach [the tantra of] Hevajra.
This gradual entry into the classes of tantras has a parallel within the Ancient Translation Kilaya Wrathful Anger Tantra:
First, confer [the vows of] personal liberation And explain the doctrine of the proclaimers; Then, grant the great vow of the bodhisattva And present the teachings of the Central Way.
Finally, bestow the initiation of the fruition Universal Way[9] And teach this fruition tantra.
According to the latter method, disciples who have assumed the ethics of refuge and awakening mind exclusive to the Universal Way can be led [straightaway into the Secret Mantra] by conferring upon them the initiation and the mantric vows.

In the ethical system of the Secret Mantra, the object [of practice] is to bind conceptual grasping to subject and object[10] and the propensity for movement.[11] The binding agent is blissful pristine awareness, which [the practitioner] is committed to “hold” (experience). The essence of mantric vows is the resolve (with its concomitant mental factors) to train in the method [to hold pristine awareness], and the [blessing of] pristine awareness, itself actualized through an initiation.
Although within the four classes of tantras the methods for actualizing pristine awareness differ in profundity, there is no differentiation in the pristine awareness to be experienced. Therefore, despite differences in complexity, the aim of all initiations is said to be [the experience of] blissful pristine awareness.
In short, the ethical system of the Secret Mantra has as its object the binding of body, speech, and mind, and their subtle propensities. Its binding agent is [blissful pristine awareness]. Its vows consist in the resolve (and its seed) to experience [pristine awareness] using special skill in means and wisdom. These vows are assumed anew through an initiation.
In the phrase “the vows of an awareness holder,” the term “awareness” refers to the pristine awareness of great, unchanging, and supreme bliss, free from dualistic patterns of thought. One becomes a “holder” of pristine awareness, which is the ground of being that has existed from the very beginning, by virtue of again becoming aware of (reawakening) it.[12] The method to reawaken pristine awareness is [to receive] the blessing of the form of the deity or the blessing of pristine awareness itself: this is what is meant by the term “vows.” This method is the specialty of the Secret Mantra.
Moreover, profound bliss is actualized on the basis of the [seminal essence or] element of awakening mind and its stabilization. In the context of the Secret Mantra vows, awakening mind thereby assumes a meaning additional to that held in common with the Way of the Perfections, as stated in [the Hevajra Tantra][13]:
The formation of the relative awakening mind Embodies the ultimate awakening mind.
And in the same tantra[14]:
The relative jasmine-flower-like [seminal essence[15]] Is the embodiment of bliss, the ultimate.[16]
For this reason, it should also be understood that the vow of the Secret Mantra is superior [to the others].

Although there are many ways to enumerate the distinctions of mantric vows, here we will briefly note the three types of mantric vows of the “actual tantra,”[17] the subject matter of tantra. These three types are the vow of causal tantra, the vow of the tantra of skillful means, and the vow of the resultant tantra, and are defined as follows:
The vow of causal tantra is to bind the nature of all phenomena, form, sound, etc., within the state of innate pristine awareness.
The vow of the tantra of skillful means is to bind all subtle and gross forms of thinking that objectify dualistic appearances within the meditations of the phases of creation and completion.
The vow of the resultant tantra is to bind all phenomena arising in one's subjective experience within the essence of the dimensions of awakening and pristine awareness.
The first of these three is a nominal vow; the second two, actual vows.

<d e="2">
Mantric vows are distinguished according to the four classes of tantra that teach [the actual tantra]—the vows of the Action, Conduct, Yoga, and Highest Yoga Tantra.[18]
Action Tantra vows [are defined as] the commitment to experience (hold) blissful pristine awareness which binds conceptual grasping to subject and object and the propensity for movement [through the technique] of using the pleasure [of smiling at a consort] as the spiritual path.
Conduct Tantra vows [are defined as] the identical commitment except that the technique uses the pleasure of gazing [at a consort] as the spiritual path.
Yoga Tantra vows [are defined as] the identical commitment except that the technique uses the pleasure of embracing [a consort] as the spiritual path.
Highest Tantra vows [are defined as] the identical commitment except that the technique uses the pleasure of union [with a consort] as the spiritual path.[19]
These four different techniques serve as antidotes for four subtle and gross forms of conceptual grasping to subject and object to be forsaken in the common spiritual way[20] and four subtle and gross propensities for movement[21] to be forsaken in the exceptional Secret Mantra. Thus, the awareness-holder vows of the four classes of tantra, which are commitments to experience non-dual intrinsic awareness or blissful pristine awareness, are differentiated according to the techniques [used to fulfill their commitments].

Three kinds of mantric vows are distinguished according to the initiatory rituals in which they are assumed: the vows assumed during the preparatory phase; upon entry [into the mandala]; and during the main part [of an initiation]. These are explained as follows:
(1) The Secret Mantra's own version of personal liberation vows and commitments of awakening mind are assumed during the regular confession[22] [performed during the preparatory part of an initiation[23]]. The actual mantra vows are assumed when the three places[24] [of the disciple] are consecrated [as the three vajras]. At this point, these vows [and even the personal liberation and awakening mind vows] arise as the essence of mantric vows.
(2) Vows are assumed at the time of the outer entry [into the mandala],[25] when the [master] has inquired about [the disciples'] interest[26] and they have responded, and [the symbols of] moon and vajra have been introduced.[27] Vows are also assumed when pledges are made at the inner entry,[28] pristine awareness descends,[29] and the deities [of the mandala] are revealed.[30] These together are called the vows of divine fortune.
(3) Vows assumed in the main part of an initiation include vows of the three lower tantras received during their respective initiations; vows related to the creation phase received during the vase initiation[31] of any Highest [Yoga tantra]; and the vows related to the completion phase received in the course of the higher initiations.[32] For the second, vows related to the creation phase, there are common and exclusive ones. The vows of the vase initiation common to both Highest Yoga Tantra and Yoga Tantra are assumed with the verbal promise to keep the pledges of the five buddha families made during the preliminary ritual. The vows of the vase initiation exclusive to the Highest [Yoga] Tantra are made with the promise not to disrespect the [vajra] master, etc., at the appended [initiation] given through symbols of auspiciousness.[33]
The vows of the creation phase differ from those of the completion phase in that the former pertains to an experience of blissful pristine awareness that is not actualized, while the latter [pertains to an experience of blissful pristine] awareness that is actualized. Also, the techniques [in the initiatory procedure] employed for assuming the two kinds of vows are different: for the former, pristine awareness is induced indirectly; for the latter, directly.[34]

Mantric vows are assumed in two ways: (1) by making a verbal promise, and (2) through the initiatory procedure [which involves meditation on the content of the initiation]:
(1) At the completion of the triple recitation for assuming vows done during the preparatory part of an initiation or at the entry [into the mandala], vows have definitely been received. However, the pledges one has promised to honor are not empowered to be preserved until the actual initiation takes place. This is similar to the way that [renunciate vows] become vows to be safeguarded when the monk or novice ordination is performed, despite the fact that during the interim renunciate [phase of the ordination][35] the promise [to abide by the] renunciate vows is made.
How then are mantric vows assumed with a verbal promise? By promising “I will keep these vows and pledges” when assuming the actual mantra vows in the main part of the initiation.
(2) The initiatory procedure [i.e., through meditation on the content of the initiation] is the way the principal mantric vows are assumed. The main mantric vows of each class of tantra are fully assumed once the vajra-master initiation for that class of tantra has been received. In Action Tantra, the vajra-master initiation will come at the completion of the water and diadem initiations; in Conduct Tantra, at the end of the five (water, etc.[36]) initiations; in Yoga Tantra, at the conclusion of the irreversible initiation[37]; and in the Highest Yoga Tantra, at the completion of the four initiations.[38] In short, the vows of mantra are assumed in their entirety at the conclusion of the initiatory rituals of the particular tantra.

An objection may be raised here: “Do the Action and Conduct [tantras] have vajra-master initiations?” Each class of tantra specifies the tasks to be performed by a vajra master, such as conferring initiations, expounding [the tantras], performing consecrations, etc. To perform these tasks, an aspirant must receive the vajra-master initiation; therefore, it is logical that all four classes of tantras must have their own vajra-master initiation. This can also be proven by scriptural references. [For example], the Vajrapani Initiation Tantra [a Conduct tantra] states[39]:
Placing the vajra in the right hand And the wheel in the left,
Say to the disciple,
“You have now become a vajra master.”
The General Tantra [an Action tantra] also states[40]:
To acquire the rank of vajra master,
The first [initiation] must be well celebrated.
This citation means that the initiations of water and diadem must be conferred on the disciple prior to placing him or her in the rank of a vajra master [through the relative initiation].
Another objection may be raised: “Is it not true that the Essence of Pristine Awareness considers the vajra-master initiation a Yoga Tantra specialty?” The Pristine Awareness does state this in reference to the [exclusive] irreversible wheel initiation[41] [of the Yoga Tantra]; therefore, its statement does not negate [that Action and Conduct tantras have vajra-master initiations].

The process of assuming the vows of Secret Mantra begins when the body, speech, and mind of the disciple have been consecrated as the three vajras[42] [in the preparatory ritual] and is completed only at the end of the conclusive initiation given through symbols of the particular class of tantra.
The seeds of the mantic vows are planted with the consecration of the disciple's body, speech, and mind as the three vajras. The vows are formed with the triple repetition to take the vows of the five buddha families. They are blessed by the descent of pristine awareness [upon the outer and inner entry into the mandala, respectively]. They are augmented during the central part of the initiation when the conferral of the initiations of the five buddha families and the conduct[43] initiations consecrates the disciples' five aggregates as the five buddhas (Akshobhya, etc.),[44] and their reality [veiled] by impurities [is consecrated] as Vajrasattva, the sixth buddha. The vows are greatly augmented in the vase initiation when the impurity of adherence to ordinary appearances is cleansed in [the experience of] the world and its inhabitants manifesting as the display of the deities and their supporting mandala. The vows reach their apex in the course of the three higher initiations,[45] which are the supreme ones, when the impurity of considering the deity as real is also cleansed and all aspects of cyclic existence and perfect peace are released into great pristine awareness, the union of bliss and emptiness. This is the point at which the mantric vows of the Highest Yoga Tantra have formed completely and have been fully assumed.
With the conferral of the main initiation of one of the four classes of tantra, disciples also receive the vajra-master initiation that invests them with the authority to give initiations, teach [the tantras], perform consecrations, etc. In the conclusive [initiation] given through the symbols [of auspiciousness], disciples make a succinctly formulated promise three times to maintain the pledges to which a vajra master is bound after these pledges have been extensively illustrated [by the initiating master]. At the end of this triple promise, the mantra vows are fully assumed, and from this point forward, disciples become susceptible to the root downfalls of the specific class of tantra. For this reason, it is said that the vows are fully assumed at the conclusion of the initiation and not before.

Earlier scholars designated the mantric vows of the lower classes of tantra as incomplete (those of Action and Conduct tantras) or partially complete (those of Yoga Tantra); and mantric vows of the Highest Yoga Tantra, as complete, according to the extent to which the mantric vows are assumed. In short, all vows and pledges are encompassed by two pledges: the ultimate pledge of skill in means, profound bliss, and the relative pledge of wisdom, emptiness comprehensive of all [aspects].[46] All too are embraced by the single vow of EVAM, the union of skill in means and wisdom. Accordingly, the Two-Part Hevajra Tantra states[47]:
The vow of all the buddhas Existing in the aspect of EVAM Is the great bliss of EVAM
To be realized through initiation.[48]
Since the vow of EVAM pertains to both ground and fruition stages, the Buddha himself called it the great pledge. The Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra[49] states:
It is the vow or pledge
Taught by One Beyond Worldly Conduct.
And Manjushri's Magical Net[50]:
Our Teacher, guide of beings, Realized this one great pledge.
The same is explained in detail in Samvarodaya and other tantras.

Suitable aspirants for assuming mantric vows are principally human beings, who embody six elements.[51] No discrimination is made on the basis of social status, past actions, etc. Accordingly, the Sacred Primordial Buddha's Tantra states[52]:
A bamboo weaver or other untouchable
Or even one guilty of one of five deeds of immediate retribution
Will become awakened in this very life By following the conduct of mantra.
[The same tantra] also recounts the story of nagas being initiated in the land of Oddiyana.[53] A number of tantras state that since gods, demigods, and other beings are included among the suitable aspirants for tantra, all beings who have faith and interest should be accepted as disciples. However, it is inappropriate to initiate into the Secret Mantra weak-willed individuals who are incapable of safeguarding the common vows, such as the purificatory fast and other personal liberation vows, or the awakening mind of aspiration and other bodhisattva commitments. Nevertheless, in order that the seed of their liberation be planted, aspirants who demonstrate earnest interest, though unfit in other respects, should be led [into the mandala of the deity]. Accordingly, the Indestructible Peak[54] states:
Those who do not assume vows, Are untameable, and lack faith,
Are eligible only for entry into [the mandala]. [Initiation] is not to be conferred on them.
In addition, the same tantra states[55]:
As soon as [the mandala] is seen, The vows become pure.

A person who has received in its entirety an initiation into a great mandala [of the Highest Yoga Tantra] has thereby received all of the vows and pledges of the Way of Indestructible Reality. Even to have simply entered [into the mandala] means that during the forming of the vows, the nominal mantric vows are assumed by verbal promise. Thereafter, a practitioner who engages in the experiential cultivation of the Secret Mantra while safeguarding the vows and pledges just as promised will swiftly gain spiritual attainments. On the contrary, one who forsakes these vows will incur very serious negative consequences in spite of making [great] effort on the path. Therefore, the pledges should be safeguarded like life itself. The Samvarodaya Tantra[56] states:
Should you desire supreme attainment, Though you may risk your life
Or be on the point of dying, Always safeguard the pledges.
Of the pledges to be honored, the first to be concerned with are the pledges that are common to all classes of tantras and form their foundations: the “four great root pledges.” These prescribe correct view of the conventional, refuge in the Three Jewels, the awakening mind, and initiation into the mandala. The sixty-verse Guide to Mantra[57] states:
Know that for tantra
The basic pledges are four:
To have a correct view of the conventional, Not to forsake the Three Jewels,
To safeguard the awakening mind, And not to reject the true initiation.[58]
The Manjushri Fundamental Tantra states:
Following a detailed explanation of the four pledges, [the master proclaims:] O heir of the victorious ones! The pledges for entering the marvelous domain of my Mantra [system] are all included in two groups: the foundation and branches. What is the foundation? The foundation is [the pledge] not to reject the initiation [and the other three pledges]. [These form a foundation] because without a correct view, one is not a renunciate; without taking refuge, one is not a Buddhist; without an awakening mind, one is not a bodhisattva; and without initiation, one cannot be called a mantrin.
These four root pledges are indispensable requirements for entering any stage of the path of the four classes of tantra. Thus, they are considered to be pledges common to all classes.

Scholars provide various presentations of the Action Tantra pledges, some of which have been clearly enumerated within the Action Tantra, and some not. Butön's General Presentation of the Classes of Tantra states:
Lord Atisha's Summary of Pledges[59] speaks of thirty root downfalls for the Action Tantra. It must be examined whether or not these are the same as those listed in the Susiddhi Tantra beginning with “Wise ones should not be angry [with the mantra, the deity, or the tantric master].”[60]
The Wheel of Time Tantra states that each of the four classes of tantra has a set of fourteen root downfalls. Butön identifies the set of [the Action Tantra's] downfalls as the [fourteen] taught in the Secret General Tantra.[61]
Ngorchen[62] and other masters consider the first three pledges[63] given in the [Secret] General Tantra as general [Action Tantra] pledges; they classify the rest with their subdivisions into thirteen [as Action Tantra pledges] received through initiation.
The omniscient Pema Karpo is of the opinion that [Action Tantra] practitioners must observe thirty pledges and avoid sixteen root downfalls. The thirty pledges consist of the twelve prescriptions for what to practice and eighteen prescriptions for restraint given in the Susiddhi Tantra [to be explained below]. The sixteen root downfalls consist of the four transgressions (of the basic pledges given in the Manjushri Fundamental Tantra) and the downfall of offending the master, the five deeds of immediate retribution, the five deeds nearly as serious,[64] and harming the Three Jewels[65] as set out in the Questions of Subahu Tantra.
Different ways of enumerating, differentiating, and grouping the Action Tantra pledges are found in other works such as Bodong Panchen's General Presentation of Tantras[66] and Jampa Lingpa's Great Mantra Discipline.[67] All scholars, however, agree that the principal [Action Tantra vows] are those taught in the General Tantra.
Action Tantra pledges are discussed under three headings: (1) the general pledges, (2) the pledges of the Action Tantra families, and (3) restoration of the pledges.

Fourteen pledges of the Action Tantra are given in the Secret General Tantra[68]:
(1) To have faith in the common and exceptional Three Jewels[69];
(2) To have impartial and non-judgmental faith in secret mantras, awareness mantras, and recollection mantras[70];
(3) To have an especially earnest interest in the Universal Way, and to adopt its principles;
(4) To be devoted to the four kinds of companions who form the supreme field [of merit]—the master,[71] those who have entered the Action Tantra, those who abide by its pledges, and the followers of the Buddhist teachings;
(5) Not to be angry with one's favored deity if wrathful rites are not effective, or with deities the worship of whom is shared with other practitioners[72] if they do not perform the desired task;
(6) Not to neglect offerings on the appropriate occasions, such as the days of the full and new moon, the eighth of the lunar month, etc.;
(7) Not to venerate the scriptures of other traditions, such as those of extremist teachers, etc.[73];
(8) To offer food, drink, etc., to others without any partiality, [even] unexpected guests;
(9) To be always benevolent toward all creatures;
(10) To augment one's acquisition of merit[74];
(11) To exert oneself at reciting the mantra according to the guidelines given in the Questions of Subahu Tantra[75];
(12) To strive to safeguard the pledges of one's own [buddha] family, as well as those of other families[76];
(13) Not to teach mantras or seals[77] to those who have not assumed pledges or those who have allowed them to deteriorate;
(14) To conceal and protect the tantras and mantras, while striving to achieve spiritual accomplishment through study, reflection, and meditation on them.

Make offerings (4) to the deities on special occasions, and (5) to guests without partiality;
(6) Acquire merit; (7) strive at correct recitation of mantra;

(10) Guard the tantras and work in order to realize their meaning; (11) remain peaceful in body, speech, and mind[78];
(12) Wash and keep yourself clean[79]: these twelve [pledges] prescribe what to practice.
(1) Do not become angry with the deity or (2) worship other traditions;
(3) Do not practice [tantras] you are not authorized to or (4) invent your own Secret Mantra [practice][80];
(5) Do not perform evil rites[81] or (6) direct tantric activities to the wrong end[82];

(9) Do not be unrestrained[85] or (10) eat food that is not permitted[86];
(11) Do not forsake loving-kindness[87] or (12) speak before the [tantric recitation] is completed[88];

A practitioner is required to follow all the points of conduct specifically prescribed for each of the three Worldly and three Supramundane Families,[94] which form the foundation of the general pledges [of the Action Tantra]. In addition to these, one must observe the pledges of one's own family taught in the corresponding tantras and commentaries. [Ratnakarashanti's] Jewel Lamp Commentary on Yamantaka, the Black Enemy states that these pledges are to be preserved also by those who have been initiated into the Yoga and Highest Yoga tantras, not only by Action and Conduct tantra practitioners.

A practitioner should first of all understand what the pledges are. With that knowledge, one should then safeguard them in order not to be polluted by major downfalls and minor transgressions. Should transgressions occur, the pledges must be restored immediately. The means of purifying transgressions taught in the General Tantra include the recitation of the heart mantra of the deity of one's [buddha] family[95] one hundred thousand times; reciting one hundred thousand times the recollection mantra called “Unconquerable Vajra That Blazes Like Fire”[96]; or the performance of the same number of appeasing fire offerings.[97] “Etc.” [in the root verses] refers to the restoration [of pledges] by repeated entry into the mandala.[98]
Transgressions incurred in the daytime must be purified [by acknowledging them] within the same night, and those incurred at night, [before dawn] of the following day. Accordingly, the Susiddhi states[99]:
Careless failings in the day
Should be acknowledged that same night; And failings at night, the next dawn.

In the Conduct Tantra, there are fourteen distinct pledges that apply to all tantras in this class. These are enumerated in the Vairochanaabhisambodhi Tantra[100] as follows: [1-10] To refrain from the ten unvirtuous deeds (three of body, four of speech, and three of mind) and instead to continuously practice the ten virtues; and [11-14] to avoid the four root [downfalls] of forsaking the sacred teachings,[101] giving up the awakening mind, being miserly [by refusing to give] spiritual instruction or material aid, and inflicting harm on others. These fourteen all pertain to actions that should be avoided.
Specific pledges apply to each of the families of the Conduct Tantra and are taught in the different tantras of these families. The points of conduct prescribed in these pledges must be observed; if one fails to do so, the pledges must be restored. The means of restoration of the pledges explained for the Action Tantra also apply to these pledges of the Conduct Tantra, as they do for pledges of Yoga Tantra, which will be explained below.
Venerable Pema Karpo presents a distinct classification of the Conduct Tantra pledges. Three pledges pertain to the training: (1) the vow of the “mind of entering” [assumed] in order to enter the great pledge;
(2) the vow of the “abiding mind” once one has entered the great pledge; and (3) the vow of the “mind of involvement,” bringing others to the great pledge once one has mastered it.[102] The fourteen pledges mentioned above are considered to be the fourteen root downfalls for practitioners who are renunciates. The four root downfalls plus sexual misconduct, murder, theft, untruth, and wayward views are considered pledges applying to lay practitioners.
What is the difference between the shunning of the ten unvirtuous deeds in this context and the shunning of them by the proclaimers, solitary sages, worldly people, and non-Buddhists? The difference is significant, because proclaimers and solitary sages do not possess [the special] skillful means and wisdom [taught in the Conduct Tantra].[103] Worldly people and non-Buddhists observe [a wholesome conduct] induced by their grasping to the [self as] real. On the other hand, practitioners who have formed awakening minds and are possessed of skill in means and wisdom are able to freely engage in wholesome forms of conduct with the understanding of the sameness of all things, without [this conduct] being induced by such grasping.

I have taken refuge in the Three Jewels,
The Buddha, his teachings, and the community...
With these words, the vows are proclaimed. Aspirants are then examined for their suitability to receive [initiation]. Those found suitable enter the mandala and recite
Just as the protectors throughout the three times...
up to
...and set all beings in the state of perfect peace.[104]
With the triple repetition of these phrases, the fourteen defeating transgressions are forsworn, and the fourteen branch [pledges] that are injunctions are fully assumed. The mantric vows are thereby taken according to ritual, which is the way the pledges are first assumed. These pledges taken in this way, the fourteen injunctions, are all condensed into the following pledges of the five families[105]:
(1) To take refuge in the Three Jewels comprises the three pledges of the [transcendent] family of Vairochana;
(2) To commit oneself to the vajra seal, the bell seal, and the [vajra] master are the three pledges of the vajra family [of Akshobhya][106];
(3) To be generous with spiritual teachings, material things, protection, and love are the four pledges of the jewel family [of Ratnasambhava];
(4) To maintain the outer (Action and Conduct) tantras; the secret (Yoga) tantra; and the three spiritual ways [of the proclaimers, solitary sages, and bodhisattvas] are the three pledges of the lotus family [of Amitabha];
(5) To make offerings is the single pledge of the action family [of Amoghasiddhi].

The correspondence of the pledges with these particular families can be explained as follows: Vairochana represents the family of the enlightened body of the transcendent ones. This physical dimension is the foundation for acquiring all good qualities of which taking refuge in the Three Jewels constitutes the root.
Akshobhya represents the family of enlightened mind, which is indivisible emptiness and compassion. One commits oneself to these two aspects, which are symbolized by the vajra and bell, and to the vajra master who reveals their meaning.
Ratnasambhava represents the family of enlightened quality, which, like a wish-fulfilling jewel, provides the source of all that is desirable. Likewise, the four kinds of generosity fulfill the hopes and desires [of all beings].
Amitabha represents the family of enlightened speech from which originate the eighty-four thousand aspects of the teachings. These eighty-four thousand aspects are all included in the three spiritual ways: the outer way [of proclaimers and solitary sages], the inner way [of bodhisattvas], and secret way [of mantric practitioners].
Amoghasiddhi represents the family of marvelous activity, the essence of which is to venerate the buddhas and to work for the benefit of all beings. Both of these tasks are accomplished by making offerings as much as possible.

In the interest of brevity, the pledges taught in the Summation of Essential Points,[111] the Glorious Paramadya, and other fundamental tantras of this class will not be discussed at length here and should be learned from other sources. However, we shall supplement the root verses with a few explanatory words. The Summation of Essential Points gives the following set of pledges related to the five classes of deities:
(1) The pledge of the transcendent family [of Vairochana] is to cultivate the two aspects of awakening mind and then earnestly work to augment them. Thus, the pledge of the transcendent family is to be intensely compassionate by strengthening one's mind of awakening, being affectionate, and uplifting others, etc., without succumbing to the discouragement felt by proclaimers who reject objects of desire, viewing them as sources of pain.
(2) The pledge of the vajra family [of Akshobhya] is to perform rites while feigning wrath in order to awaken malicious and untameable beings;
(3) The pledge of the lotus family [of Amitabha] is to do whatever is of benefit to others, manifesting as the great seal of the deity's body, and the other [seals[112]], from within the understanding of emptiness, the ultimate [truth];
(4) The pledge of the jewel family [of Ratnasambhava] is to give away daily whatever material things, many or few, that others desire;
(5) The pledge of the action family [of Amoghasiddhi] is naturally fulfilled in the altruistic nature of the activities [of the above four pledges].
The Glorious Paramadya Tantra enumerates ten pledges to shun the following ten root downfalls:
(1) To forsake the aspiring mind;
(2) To forsake the venturing mind;
(3) To reject the contemplation of moon and vajra,[113] [the symbols] of the formation of the two kinds [of awakening mind differentiated with respect to] the two truths;
(4) To deprecate and reject the Buddhist scriptures;
(5) To forsake the practice of the teachings;
(6) To ignorantly criticize the teachings;
(7) To mortify with asceticism one's body and mind which have been blessed by meditations upon the four seals;
(8) To renounce vajra and bell,[114] yoga, and pledges;
(9) To forsake the four seals and remain [caught in] ordinary [appearances and grasping];
(10) To abandon the vajra master.
The Indestructible Source[115] mentions an additional (the eleventh) downfall: to divulge the secrets [of tantra] to the spiritually immature.

<d e="2">
The explanatory Indestructible Peak Tantra's presentation of the vows that are proclaimed and assumed [in the course of an initiation] seems to be the framework for the vows common to both the [Yoga and] Highest [Yoga tantras]. According to that tantra, there are three categories of vows: the pledges of the five families, the general pledges, and the concise form of the pledges that are proclaimed.
The pledges of the five families are the injunctions explained above [from this same tantra].
The general pledges comprise both root and branch pledges (these will be simply introduced here as they will be discussed in order below). The root pledges are to avoid the fourteen defeating offenses for a bodhisattva found in the Akashagarbha Scripture.[116] The branch pledges consist in observing the three forms of ethics: of restraint from unwholesome deeds; the ethics aimed at acquiring good qualities; and the ethics of working for others' welfare.
To explain these three forms of ethics, the first is to observe, at the very least, what is indispensable: the four root precepts of a lay person plus the vow not to drink alcohol, which are given in the proclamation of vows beginning with the words: “Do not take the life of other creatures...,”[117] etc.; and the vow to renounce all unwholesome deeds unless done to benefit others. The second form of ethics is to devote oneself to true masters, honor true practitioners of yoga (indicated by the “etc.” [in the root verses]), and engage in the ten virtuous deeds of the Universal Way (identical in nature to the six perfections). The third form is to give up the four attitudes that are incompatible with the Universal Way: aspiring to the lesser ways, neglecting to work for the benefit of others, renouncing cyclic existence, or being attached to the state of perfect peace.

The pledges assumed in the proclamation of the concise form of vows are the following:
(1) Not to disrespect gods, demigods, yakshas,[118] etc.;
(2) Not to step over the symbols of the vajra, etc.;
(3) Not to step over the master's seat, or over the weapons, ritual implements, or the insignias of deities.
Further, since the vows of the lower [systems] are included in the higher, the vows in common with the Way of the Perfections and with the Action and Conduct tantras are also to be preserved [as part of this last category of vows].
Venerable Pema Karpo classifies Yoga Tantra vows into the three groups[119] of root pledges, branch pledges, and pledges concerning application:
(1) The root pledges are the fourteen injunctions related to the five buddha families and the fourteen pledges that prohibit downfalls that are counteractive to the injunctions.
(2) The branch pledges are [the four root precepts, etc.,] mentioned [in the Indestructible Peak Tantra] beginning with the words: “Do not take the lives of other creatures.”
(3) The pledges of the five deities [found in the fundamental tantras] are the pledges that apply to the practice.
Enumerations of the downfalls and pledges of the Yoga Tantra are extremely numerous, and therefore it is not possible to encompass them here. The vows to maintain all the precepts (the fourteen injunctions, the fourteen prohibitions, etc.) are said to be assumed with a verbal promise, while the vows not to commit the [four] root downfalls and other infractions are assumed through the initiatory procedure involving contemplation [on the content of the initiation]. The means of restoration of these pledges and vows are those mentioned above, as well as those given in the Essence Ornament of the General Procedure for All Secrets explained below.

In our discussion of the vows of the Highest [Yoga Tantra], the first part concerns conduct. Conduct (Tib. brtul zhugs) is defined as the transforming (brtul) of ordinary activity and thoughts and the entering (zhugs) into the mode of Vajrasattva's body, speech, and mind. Each of the tantras presents its own special system [to effect this transformation].
The Glorious Guhyasamaja states that the conduct of the creation phase is to rely on the five nectars [in order to fulfill] the pledges of the three vajras: human flesh, the [pledge of] vajra body; excrement and urine, the [pledge of] vajra speech; and semen and blood, the [pledge of] vajra mind; or, alternatively, to rely on the five nectars as the pledges related to the five families. In the completion phase, the conduct is to train in the techniques aimed at dissolving the five aggregates [symbolized by] the five nectars[120] into the state of clear light. Four pledges to be interpreted are presented in the fourth chapter of [the Guhyasamaja] Tantra with the words:
Any being who ends life, Who delights in lying, Covets the wealth of others,
Or constantly engages in sexual union. [121]
A yogin or yogini who has reached the creation phase will actually resort to these [forms of conduct] when these would benefit others. For a meditator abiding in the completion phase, these are enacted in the following ways:
(1) To end life means to block the energy winds[122];
(2) To lie means to impart the teachings while understanding the levels of interdependent arising [of phenomena];
(3) To steal means to actualize the buddha's pristine awareness by relying on a consort;
(4) To indulge in sex means to experience the very nature of reality.
The beginner should maintain these pledges or forms of conduct by aspiring [to be able to engage in them in the future] and by creating the conditions to actually enact them.

Most of the earlier masters state that the phrase “twenty-two modes of pure conduct” found in the Chakrasamvara tantras is a reference to the conduct [common to all Highest Yoga tantras] of avoiding the fourteen root downfalls and the eight serious branch downfalls (which are explained below). The exceptional conduct taught in these tantras comprises the following:
(1) Worship on the tenth day of the lunar month;
(2) Hand offering[123];
(3) Worship through the definitive meaning of the four vajras[124];
(4) Practice of the four seals[125];
(5) Ritual feast of heroes and yoginis;
(6) Symbolic behavior[126];
(7) The eight exceptional pledges [concerning conduct with an awareness-woman].
The first, worship or offering made on the tenth day of the lunar month, includes making offerings of young virgins or women who bear the signs [of being yoginis[127]], the outer offerings, the major or minor food offering (torma) rituals, etc. The last, [eight pledges concerning conduct with an awareness-woman], are pledges to abandon the following downfalls:
To fail to remember the conduct of the left; to unite [with the tantric consort] out of desire alone;
To discriminate [between oneself and others]; to lose interest [in tantra];
To fail to rely on a tantric consort; to leave the tantric consort;
To let one's tantric activity deteriorate; to feel revulsion toward pledge substances.
These are explained as follows. (1) To fail to remember the conduct of the left[128] daily in the four periods of the day and night and to fail to apply it during the special occasions of ritual feasts, hand offerings, etc., constitutes this downfall.

(2) To unite with a tantric consort simply out of desire for a woman and to experience [bliss] dispersing [with the emission of the seminal essence] constitutes this downfall. One should unite with a consort to [enhance] experiential understanding, to receive or confer an initiation, [to use the seminal essence for preparing] the elixir [of long life], or as the pledge substance, and other similar purposes.
(3) To discriminate between self and others by failing to remember throughout the four periods of day and night to foster a non-conceptual mind while resting in the state of sameness within the empty nature of all phenomena constitutes this downfall.
(4) To lose respect for this path due to becoming attracted to other spiritual pursuits or to have reservations born from a fault-finding attitude so that one's enthusiasm for the practice of tantra does not increase constitutes this downfall.
(5) To fail to rely on a tantric consort when one has the ability to control the seminal essence[129] and to sustain the blissful state cognizing emptiness constitutes this downfall.
(6) To leave the tantric consort or action seal before one has stabilized and mastered the blissful pristine awareness or before one has achieved the results of the tantric activities and other experiential means constitutes this downfall.
(7) To let one's tantric activity deteriorate, i.e., to allow emission of seminal essence, unless done for the sake of conferring the secret initiation or other special purposes, constitutes this downfall. Therefore, when training in the descent and reversal of the jasmine-flower[-like] seminal essence by means of [union with] a consort, a practitioner should not emit the seminal essence, but should hold it firmly at the crown of the head.
(8) To feel revulsion toward and to refuse [the pledge substances] and to fail to nourish oneself with the olibanum [blood], camphor [seminal fluid], fragrant water [urine], etc., from the vagina of an awareness-woman constitutes this downfall.
These are known as the eight aspects of conduct for practice with an awareness-woman because they are required to be the main focus of the practice for adepts who have reached the stage of taking recourse to the experiential means of the three emissaries: the mantraborn, the field-born, and the innate.[130]

The Wheel of Time Tantra prescribes the twenty-five modes of conduct of Vajrasattva. The first five are to refrain from the four root offenses and from drinking alcohol, as specified in the words: “Forsake harm, untruth...,” etc.[138]:
(1) Not to harm means to abstain from inflicting injury on any being, from [killing] an insect to murder of a human or a human fetus, and to give up the motives for inflicting injury;
(2) Not to lie means not to speak any untrue words, from lies in jest to false claims to spiritual attainments;
(3) Not to engage in adultery means to abstain from sexual relations with an inappropriate partner, such as another's spouse, whether or not one has taken the vow of celibacy;
(4) Not to engage in theft means not to steal even the husk of a sesame seed, not to mention another's valuable possessions;
(5) Not to drink alcohol means to renounce all kinds intoxicants as they attract obstacles [to one's practice]. However, drinking alcohol for the sake of observing the pledges or as means to gain experiential understanding is not prohibited.
Transgressions of these five points of training for the lay practitioner are called the five extreme ill deeds as they are definitely unwholesome and serve as conditions for the worsening of one's nature.[139]
The remaining twenty modes of conduct are imparted to those disciples who wish to follow them and who are able to renounce [the five extreme ill deeds].

[The remaining twenty modes of conduct consist in] refraining from five ill deeds related [to the extreme ones], five murders, five kinds of enmity, and five desires. The five related ill deeds, [so-called because] they waste one's time and destroy one's virtues, are the following:
(1) Gambling, which means to play dice;
(2) Eating impure food, which refers to eating the meat [of an animal] that has been killed for consumption or profit, or similar foods. This is an ill deed in that it involves ways of livelihood incompatible with the [Buddhist] teachings;
(3) Reading perverse subjects, such as stories of war, robbers, and rulers;
(4) Performing sacrifices for ancestors, which refers to the Vedic custom of worshiping ancestors and similar customs, or making sacrifices of cattle thinking that by doing so one [will be born in] a higher form of life;
(5) Following barbaric religious practices, i.e., following the practices of extremists' religions [such as eating the meat of animals that one has killed oneself].
The five murders, which are here listed separately from “not to harm...” (above) to refute [the belief] that these qualify as [legitimate] spiritual conduct,[140] are the following:
(1) To kill any animal (such as a cow);
(2) To murder a child;
(3) To murder a man;
(4) To murder a woman;
(5) To destroy a reliquary (which includes the killing of a monk or destroying statues and images of the Three Jewels).

The five types of enmity are to bear malice toward the following persons:
(1) Friends who help one in worldly or spiritual matters;
(2) Persons worthy of respect in those two fields, such as leaders, elders, etc.;
(3) The Buddha, who is the teacher of gods and humans;
(4) The Buddhist community;
(5) Masters who are worthy of one's trust.
The five desires refers to attachment to visual form, [sounds, smells, tastes,] and physical sensations. These five desires are completing factors for intentional actions, which lead one into further existences. These last groups of five [as they appear in the Wheel of Time] are expressed as prohibitions (Do not kill..., etc.) and are therefore points of conduct that prescribe restraint. Together, these twenty-five serve
as the foundation of all other pledges and vows.
These twenty-five modes of conduct must definitely be assumed prior to receiving initiation [into the Wheel of Time tantra]. This is not necessarily the case with the other forms of conduct mentioned above. However, they have been placed in this beginning section [on the tantric vows] for convenience, and because, for most initiations, in order just to enter the mandala, one must assume one or another of these forms of conduct, even if one does not attend the main part of the rite.

In some tantric systems, the term “vow” is used to denote the moral prescription for what to practice, and “pledge,” the moral prescription for restraint. Others reverse the definitions, and yet others consider them to be synonymous. Although these different ways of defining “vow” and “pledge” are not contradictory, for convenience in this discussion, the terms are used according to the first definitions. The etymology of the [Tibetan] word sdom pa (vow), sambara [in Sanskrit], is “to bind.” [In this context,] “vow” means to bind ordinary body, speech, and mind, as well as their propensities, to the es-
sence of the four vajras[141] by special means and wisdom.
The general and specific vows of the five families common to [the Yoga and Highest Yoga] classes of tantras have been explained above. Now we shall discuss the pledges of the six buddha families taught in the Glorious Wheel of Time Tantra. These have both provisional and definitive meanings.
First, the provisional meanings will be given. For the five-pronged vajra family of Akshobhya, the pledges are explained as follows. The vajra (enlightened mind), emptiness; the bell (enlightened speech), great compassion; and the seal (enlightened body), the deity's form, are the “secrets”[142] of [ordinary] body, speech, and mind. From the beginning of time, these three have been the very essence of Akshobhya (Immovable), never other than the enlightened body, speech, and mind of all the transcendent ones: this is the pledge of the ground. The three pledges to “hold” [vajra, bell, and seal] means to recognize, in accordance with one's level of experiential understanding, that body, speech, and mind are the three vajras and to maintain this recognition in one's meditation. These [three pledges] are linked to the substantial cause [for the actualization of enlightened body, speech, and mind]. The vajra master serves as the main contributory condition [in actualizing these]; therefore, the pledge never to be transgressed is to devote oneself to him or her in all the ways appropriate to the relationship. The pledge to “hold” the master means to see him or her as one's chief, that is, to rely on the master while shattering one's pride. As symbols [of these pledges], a tantric adept carries a vajra and bell (endowed with the proper characteristics), performs symbolic hand gestures, wears the five symbolic bone ornaments,[143] etc.

<d e="2">
For the jewel family of Ratnasambhava (Source of Jewels), the pledge is to train in the ten kinds of generosity[144]:
To give jewels, iron, copper, oxen, horses, Elephants, young maidens, land,
One's spouse, and one's own flesh Are the ten kinds of gifts.
Beginners should give what they are able, and aspire to be able to give [in the future] what they are reluctant to give now.
For the wheel family of Vairochana (Illuminator), the pledges are to eat the five meats and five nectars,[145] etc., and other foods appropriate for yogins:
Since they enhance camphor,[146] Always consume meat
And especially alcohol.
For the sword family of Amoghasiddhi (Unfailing Accomplishment), the pledge is to acquire merit by making all kinds of offerings to the supreme ones, such as flowers, etc., to the buddhas and bodhisattvas.[147] For the lotus family of Amitabha (Measureless Light), the pledge is
to abide in pure conduct. In relation to the first seven [Wheel of Time] initiations,[148] this means to refrain from adultery. In the higher initiations, pure conduct refers to the “vow of no emission,” which consists in the non-emission of seminal essence even when engaging in sexual intercourse with [an ordinary] woman.
For the single-pronged vajra family of Vajrasattva (Adamantine Being),[149] the pledge is to preserve the awakening mind, the union of non-objectifying compassion and emptiness[150] which is the pristine awareness that cognizes the ultimate.
Next are presented the definitive meanings. The Akshobhya family pledge of the vajra of enlightened mind is to train in order that one's mind be made the immutable bliss. The pledge of the bell of enlightened speech is to train in order that one's speech be made the invincible sound of speech.[151] The pledge of the seal of enlightened body is to train in order to make one's body an empty image.[152] The pledge of the master is the same [as described above], although practitioners [at the level of the completion phase,] due to their superior experience and realization, feel a stronger devotion for the vajra master.
For the family of Ratnasambhava, the pledge is to bind the ten winds[153] within the central channel.

For the family of Vairochana, the pledge is to prevent emission of [seminal essence] which is the pure essence of the five aggregates and of the five sense organs.
For the family of Amoghasiddhi, the pledge is to ignite, by warmth or passion, the fire of inner heat[154] so that the [body's] seminal essence melts [and descends], and to reverse its flow and thereby saturate the aggregates, elements, sense organs, and their objects with bliss. For the family of Amitabha, the pledge is to transform the bliss arising from the melting of the seminal essence into the immutable
bliss, relying on the great seal of the empty image.[155]
For the Vajrasattva family, the pledge is to cultivate the indivisibility of immutable bliss[156] and emptiness endowed with the supreme aspects.[157]
A practitioner on the creation phase trains in [the methods relating to] the provisional meanings of these pledges; and the completion phase practitioner, the definitive meanings.
In general, all aspects of the Secret Mantra paths are intended to be included in the three cultivations [of merit, ethics, and pristine awareness]. The jewel family pledge of generosity and the action (sword) family pledge to make offerings serves to cultivate merit. The pledge of the wheel family serves as the cause for the cultivation of ethics and the lotus family pledge serves as the actual cultivation of ethics. The five-pronged vajra and single-pronged vajra [family pledges] serve to cultivate pristine awareness. All mantric vows and pledges are thereby encompassed by these three cultivations.
The sequence [in which the pledges of the six families have been set out] corresponds to the course of experiential understanding, and therefore one should engage in the practice of them in exactly that order. The procedure is as follows:
Having entered this tantra [of the Wheel of Time], for the seal pledge [of the Akshobhya family], one dissolves conceptual grasping to the ordinary appearance of the body [into emptiness] and assumes the deity's form. For the bell pledge, one dissolves grasping to the ordinary manifestation of speech [into emptiness] and assumes the [deity's] mantra. For the vajra pledge, one dissolves ordinary thoughts [into emptiness], and whatever thoughts arise, dwells in that very nature [of emptiness]. These [three] are known as pledges that pertain to consciousness because they [involve the imaginative] conceptual process.

Then, having been introduced in the course of the initiation to [the ordinary] body, speech, and mind as the three vajras [body, speech, and mind] of a buddha, and having carried this [identification] into the meditation, one [trains in order to fulfill the definitive meanings of Akshobhya's] three pledges pertaining to pristine awareness. [For the pledge of the seal,] one actualizes the body as the real emptyform[158]; [for the bell's pledge,] the speech as the real self-reverberating sound (nāḍa) of indestructible speech; and [for the vajra's pledge,] the mind as the real profound bliss.
The most important contributory condition for preserving both [the pledges pertaining to consciousness and those pertaining to pristine awareness] is the vajra master, who is the principal medium through which the marvelous activity of all the buddhas shines. Therefore, one must devote oneself to a vajra master because through such a relationship ignorance is directly overcome. Devotion to the master is the aorta of all the paths of Secret Mantra, and therefore one should never waver from or feel above it: this is known as the Akshobhya (Immovable) pledge.
The pledge of Akshobhya applied to one's meditation is the remedy for ignorance, the root of cyclic existence. However, to overcome craving, which is the force that propels one into new lives, one trains in non-attachment by giving away the ten external objects of desire[159] [thus fulfilling the pledge of Ratnasambhava]. To use the mind of non-attachment in one's meditation, the body must be made fit for the practice of generosity: one observes the ten pledges that prescribe nourishing oneself with the ten foods.[160] Since these pledges serve as the condition for the achievement of an unpolluted physical aggregate of form, and for the “illumination” of objects by means of the five specially endowed supernatural knowledges,[161] they are known as pledges of Vairochana (Illuminator).

<d e="2">
Then, on the basis of non-attachment and physical pliancy, one works toward the realization of the master as the embodiment of all the transcendent ones using the yoga of the inseparability of one's body, speech, and mind [with those of the vajra master]. This realization requires the three cultivations [of merit, ethics, and pristine awareness].
[To fulfill the pledge of the sword family,] one acquires merit by making offerings. Since merit serves as the condition for the attainment of the form dimension [of awakening] on the basis of which a buddha swiftly accomplishes the benefit of all beings, this is known as the pledge of the swift and supreme horse[-like] family of Amoghasiddhi (Unfailing Accomplishment).
[To fulfill the pledge of the lotus family,] one cultivates ethics by holding and not emitting [the seminal essence]. As this is the condition for the attainment of a buddha's boundless luminosity, it is known as the pledge of Amitabha (Measureless Light).
[To fulfill the pledge of the vajra family,] a practitioner enhances pristine awareness by cultivating awakening mind. Since the awakening mind is a single-pointed absorption on emptiness and compassion, it is known as the [single-pronged vajra family] pledge of Vajrasattva (Adamantine Being).
The presentation of the sequence and explanation [of the pledges] given here is exclusively in terms of the definitive meaning and differs from that of the condensed tantras which are mainly given in terms of the provisional meaning.

The exceptional pledges of the six families, with both evident and hidden meanings, are set forth [as follows] in the Sacred Primordial Buddha's Tantra.
In terms of the evident or provisional meaning, the pledge of the [Akshobhya] vajra family is to take the lives [while liberating the minds]
of evil beings who are not tameable in peaceful ways by setting oneself in the immovable (akṣobhya) concentration and separating [them from their guardians]. Evil beings include persons who throughout their lives commit serious acts such as the five deeds of immediate retribution and persons who qualify as one of ten recipients.[162]
In the hidden or definitive meaning, to take life means to direct the vital energies that normally flow in the right (rasanā) and left (lalanā) channels into the central one (avadhūti). The immobility of these vital energies in the central channel ultimately stabilizes the winds and mind in the crown of the head, which causes the seminal essence to ascend. This occurs in reality on the twelfth stage of awakening.[163] As a similitude, the beginner trains in holding the seminal essence in the upper [focal point of energy].
In terms of the provisional meaning, the pledge of the [Amoghasiddhi] sword family is to speak untruth in order to turn away from false doctrines those who have fallen onto erroneous paths and who, even if told the truth, would not believe it.
In the definitive meaning, to speak untruth is to proclaim the enlightened speech which encompasses all [languages] and exists in the nature of an invincible and innate sound at the heart.[164] The enlightened speech teaches the unreality and non-abiding nature of all phenomena and in this sense does not speak of the truth of dualistic and limited phenomena, but speaks of their untruth. The innate sound is heard in reality on the fifth and sixth stages of awakening. As a similitude, the beginner, as the means to hear the invincible and innate sound, cultivates [the yoga of] “withdrawal.”[165]
In terms of the provisional meaning, the pledge of the [Ratnasambhava] jewel family is to steal the possessions of others who crave wealth and are fettered by greed in order to save them from taking rebirth as starving spirits. Once stolen, for the sake of acquiring merit, the goods should be donated to others.

</d>
<d e="2">
In the definitive meaning, to steal others' possessions means to steal the jewel-like immutable bliss from Vajrasattva. The place from where the immutable bliss is taken is the throat, where bliss and empty form are made inseparable. The immutable bliss is actually achieved on the eighth level. As a similitude, the beginner trains in the means for its achievement.
In terms of the provisional meaning, the pledge of the [Amitabha] lotus family is to abduct the women of others who crave and are attached to women in order to save them from rebirth as animals.
In the definitive meaning, to abduct the women of others means to actualize the great seal of empty form. The great seal of empty form is attained in reality on the ninth and tenth levels. As a similitude, the beginner trains in the means for its achievement.
In terms of the provisional meaning, the pledge of the [Vairochana] wheel family is to eat meat and drink alcohol in order to shatter arrogance about one's social status and personal pride.[166] To eat meat refers to eating the five meats (known as lamps), and [includes] the five nectars.
In the definitive meaning, to eat meat and drink alcohol means to reverse and stabilize at the navel the pure essence of feces, urine, and semen. In this stabilization, alcohol symbolizes innate pristine awareness; the five meats symbolize the five sense organs; the five nectars, the five buddhas[167]; and their “excellent objects,” the five transmuted sense objects. The stabilization of the pure essence of feces, etc., occurs in reality on the fourth stage of awakening. As a similitude, the beginner trains in the branches of withdrawal and contemplation.[168] In terms of the provisional meaning, the pledge of the [Vajrasattva] curved knife family is to give away one's own body, the greatest act of generosity, and to never disrespect women, so that one's practice
with an action seal will yield attainments.

<d e="2">
In the definitive meaning, to give is to stabilize the seminal essence at the genitals' focal point of energy. The stabilization is effected by keeping the vow of celibacy, i.e., non-emission of the seminal essence which is the cause of immutable bliss,[169] while churning in the lotus of space (vagina of the consort). The seminal essence is stabilized in reality at the genitals on the first stage of awakening. As a similitude, the beginner trains in stabilizing the adamantine bodhichitta[170] at the same place by exercising control over [winds],[171] and in giving away one's body along with one's children, spouse, etc.
The pledges of the six families taught here with an interpretable double sense, hidden and evident, are applicable to individual practitioners depending on their levels of capacity, that is, depending on whether one is an accomplished yogin [yogini] or one who has not yet gained powers. (An “accomplished yogin” has attained the five supernatural knowledges and other feats by practicing the branch of contemplation.[172]) Accordingly, [the tantras] say that unaccomplished yogins who lack supernatural knowledge should not attempt the wrathful rite of liberating, etc., but may perform pacifying, enriching, domineering, or summoning [rites]. Therefore, these pledges are to be maintained in accordance with levels of spiritual attainment: accomplished practitioners should actually engage [in the hidden meaning of the pledges]; beginners observe it imaginatively.
[With regard to the three cultivations mentioned above, the Vajrasattva pledge of] giving one's body, etc., is said to be aimed at acquiring merit; not disrespecting women, at the cultivation of ethics; and [the Vairochana pledge] of eating the five nectars, etc., at the cultivation of pristine awareness.

The second victorious one, Karmapa Rangjung Dorjé, in his Ocean of Pledges, presents the following exceptional vows that apply to the [Highest Yoga] tantras:
These are the exceptional Highest [Yoga Tantra] vows:
For the vajra family, the excellent pledge is to take the lives Of winds, concepts, and ten recipients;
For the jewel family, to steal
Wealth, women, and the Universal Way
And to accomplish the benefit of self and others;
For the lotus family, the excellent pledge
Is to rely on female consorts
And the action, teachings, pledge, and great seals;
In the action family, to speak untruth
Is to proclaim perfect peace to be
The unreality of oneself and others;
In the wheel family, the pledge is to enjoy
The five meats, alcohol, and [sense] objects.
To safeguard [these vows] in their outer, inner, and secret levels Is the highest conduct.

The Sanskrit samaya (Tib. dam tshig) (pledge) has ten meanings:
Samaya means sameness, stipulation, Demonstrated conclusion, excellence, Rule, repetition, detailed presentation, Sign, occasion, and language.
In the context of mantric pledges, samaya should be taken to mean a stipulation or a rule accepted with one's word of honor that is not to be transgressed, etc. If practitioners transgress pledges and do not restore them, the transgressions become the root cause for their fall into the hell of Unceasing Torture or another hell; thus, they are called root downfalls. The fourteen root downfalls are explained as follows:
(1) To disrespect one's vajra master means to upset a spiritual master, or to abuse or be contemptuous of him or her in any way, physically, verbally, or mentally, such as striking, criticizing, slandering, or harboring wrong views about him or her. The object of the offense is a spiritual master, of which there six kinds:
Those who bestow pledges, teach the tantric meditation, Expound [the tantras], reveal secret instructions,
Confer initiation, or perform [charismatic] activities Are said to be the six kinds of masters.
Of these [six], the principal ones [in the context of this downfall] are the masters who have initiated one [into the tantra], expounded the tantras, or revealed secret instructions. Of particular significance is the “glorious spiritual master” who points out the pristine awareness of transcendent reality.
For the downfall to be complete, six factors must be present:
(1) The master being an authentic one;
(2) Knowing that the offense will displease [him or her];
(3) Offending the master directly with actions or words;
(4) Done not for others' sake or similar purposes;
(5) Done for selfish motives;
(6) Having no interest in purifying the offense.
If the offended master has conferred initiation, taught the tantra, and revealed secret instructions, the downfall is serious; if the master has performed two of these, or only one, the downfall is correspondingly less serious. These and other distinctions are drawn.

(2) To transgress the Buddha's teachings, in its general sense, means to transgress what was taught by the Victorious One. To disrespect and reject the teachings, even when due to lack of understanding of them, qualifies as this downfall. To reject the teachings of the Universal Way constitutes a defeat; to be averse to other teachings of the Buddha that do not appeal to one is a serious violation; to reify or depreciate minor [aspects of the teachings] constitutes a minor failing.
The particular sense of this downfall is to defy one's vajra master's advice to give up unwholesome ways, such as the ten unvirtuous deeds, and to do such deeds in secret. For [this sense of] the downfall to be complete, six factors must be present:
(1) The master being an authentic one;
(2) Knowing that the offense will displease the master;
(3) Committing the offense physically or verbally without the master knowing;
(4-6) And the last three factors of the first downfall.

(3) To be angry at one's spiritual siblings means, out of anger, to speak of any fault of a spiritual sibling, or to strike or otherwise inflict any sort of injury on him or her, physically, verbally, or mentally, regardless of whether the recipient of the harm is senior or junior in the training.
The term “spiritual siblings” generally includes all Buddhists. Closer [in terms of spiritual bond] are persons who have formed an awakening mind in the Universal Way. Of particular significance are vajra brothers and sisters who have entered the Secret Mantra and assumed its vows; and above all, those vajra siblings with whom one has received in their entirety the four initiations from the same master.
For the downfall to be complete, six factors must be present:
(1) The object of the offense being an actual spiritual sibling[173];
(2) Knowing that one's anger will displease the sibling;
(3) Expressing the anger with actions or words;
(4-6) And the last three factors of the first downfall.
Spiritual siblings are categorized in other ways. Jnanapada [for example] enumerates five types[174]; the Wheel of Time, seven,[175] in which are included all sentient beings as “distant siblings.” However categorized, downfalls that are incurred in relation to the latter types (the closest) are progressively more serious.

(4) To abandon love means to make the resolve never to help a particular being, whatever the circumstances, and thereby give up the intention to lead him or her to awakening. One's love for someone may be abandoned in the following four ways [listed] in order of the speed of restoration:
(1) Love abandoned [briefly], like the time it takes for a drawing on water [to disappear];
(1) For longer, like the time for a drawing on sand [to disappear];
(2) For even longer, like the time for a crack in the ground to be sealed by rain;
(3) [Forever,] like a shattered stone or fruit that has fallen to the ground and can never be repaired.[176]
Some mention only the latter two ways of abandoning love as the basis of this downfall. The essential point [in qualifying as a downfall] is that the love is not subsequently restored.
For the downfall to be complete, three factors must be present:
(1) The object being any sentient being;
(2) The intention never to help him or her;
(3) Having no interest in purifying the offense.
(5) To lose the jasmine-flower-like awakening mind means to emit the seminal essence, the support [for bliss]. Pundarika's Great Commentary [on the Wheel of Time Tantra] explains the nature of the downfall in these terms:
The fifth root downfall is incurred when, lacking an understanding of immanent reality, one engages in union [with a consort] for the sake of using the ensuing bliss as a means to work toward awakening, but in doing so [overcome by desire or out of disregard for tantric vows] loses the seminal essence.
All spiritual accomplishments are rooted in the relative and ultimate awakening minds.[177] From these, the two dimensions of a buddha are realized. The seed of the attainment of the form dimension of awakening is the relative awakening mind, which is the jasmine-flowerlike awakening mind (bodhicitta) itself. Therefore, to lose this awakening mind constitutes a downfall.
For the downfall to be complete, three factors must be present:
(1) To be one who has not yet realized immutable bliss-reality by means of great wisdom;
(2) To lose the seminal essence and experience a transitory bliss, [while engaging in union] as a means to attain awakening;
(3) To lose the seminal essence other than for the special purposes of using it as the substance for the secret initiation, or as means to [experience] bliss during the conferral of the wisdom initiation to others, or to make nectar pills.[178]

(6) To disrespect spiritual teachings, in its general sense, means to disparage [one's own or] other religions out of desire for personal gain. To disparage the scriptures of the Universal Way is a serious violation; the Individual Way, a minor offense; and non-Buddhist religions, a minimal offense. However, [the tantras] state that if one shows disrespect toward non-Buddhist traditions with the intention of spiritually inspiring their adherents [to follow the Buddhist path], one not only does not incur this downfall, but actually acquires merit.
The particular sense of this downfall is in the context of Buddhist
tenets. The Way of the Perfections and the Secret Mantra are causally related to one another in that the first is the cause and the second the result. In the first of the three cycles of teachings, [the Buddha] taught [on the subject of] the realization of personal selflessness and the unreality of generic images of apprehended objects. In the second, he taught [on the subject of] the realization of the ineffable, inconceivable, and indescribable empty nature of all phenomena. In the third, he taught [on the subject of] the realization of the clear-light nature of mind as a way of teaching [ultimate reality] and on the realization of the self-experienced intrinsic awareness as the essence of meditation practice. The four tantras [teach these realizations] in a similar way, up to the last [the Highest Yoga Tantra] that teaches [the ultimate truth] as the identical flavor of EVAM, the union of bliss and emptiness. Ultimately, all teach but one reality. A downfall is incurred when one disparages the profound transcendent wisdom [as taught in the Way of the Perfections] which forms the very heart of the definitive meaning in Mantra, holding it to be inferior to the transcendent wisdom [taught in the Mantra Way].
For the downfall to be complete, three factors must be present:
(1) To disparage the transcendent wisdom that is the definitive meaning of Mantra by believing it to be inferior to the transcendent wisdom [taught] in the Secret Mantra and to actually say so;
(2) To believe that such disparaging words are well-founded;
(3) To act not for the sake of uplifting those who adhere only to the Way of the Perfections.

(7) To disclose secrets to immature persons means to reveal the secrets of profound bliss to someone attracted exclusively to the proclaimers' way or similar ways who has not been ripened by initiation and who would become apprehensive or disdainful of such secrets.
For the downfall to be complete, four factors must be present:
(1) The person having an affinity for the proclaimers' or the solitary sages' ways being spiritually immature and becoming frightened or disdainful upon hearing the secrets;
(2) To disclose the secrets of profound bliss to that person; (3-4) And the last two factors of the first downfall.
Regarding this downfall, Darika[179] states that to disclose the secrets of profound bliss creates obstacles to gaining supreme attainment; and to disclose the general secrets of Mantra, obstacles to gaining common attainments.[180]
There are four types of spiritually immature persons (impeded in one of four ways) to whom secrets should not be revealed. [Beginning with the most] immature, these are as follows:
(1) Persons concerned with the affairs of this world only, who hold virulent wayward views toward the teachings and are immature in that they lack the cause [for Secret Mantra practice];
(2) Spiritual extremists who believe in the [reality of a] self;
(3) Proclaimers who are weary of cyclic existence;
(4) Solitary sages who do not have the incentive to help others (these last three lack the conditions for Secret Mantra practice).
Higher [teachings] should be kept increasingly more secret the more immature the person.

(8) To abuse one's own aggregates, in its general sense, means to despise one's own body. The aggregates, elements, and experiential media of oneself or of others should not be despised because they are the form dimension of awakening although veiled by impurities.
In its particular sense, this downfall means to believe the body to be the principal source [of suffering] and engage in forms of selfmortification, such as injuring it with weapons, burning it with fire, or otherwise abusing it through fasting and other austerities. Abuse of the body constitutes a downfall because in receiving the vase initiation,[181] one has been introduced to the aggregates, etc., as the nature of various buddhas. Once introduced in this way, one can increase the [experience of] bliss by offering the aggregates the delight of sensory pleasures, and with bliss as the support, actualize the pristine awareness of reality.
For the downfall to be complete, four factors must be present:
(1) To know the body and the other aggregates to be of the nature of various [buddhas];
(2) To consciously abuse them;
(3-4) And the last two factors of the first downfall.
Many classes of tantras prescribe the purificatory fasting practice; would this practice not be a downfall? In [the context of] tantra, the purpose of fasting is not to abuse the body but to purify it in order to please a deity, or to supplement inner cleansing. Therefore, this practice of fasting not only is not a downfall, but greatly aids [the practitioner's spiritual growth].

(9) To disbelieve what is pure in nature,[182] in its general sense, means to misconceive relative truth (while to misconceive ultimate truth would constitute the eleventh root downfall), which is the interdependent arising of all phenomena, being mere appearance without intrinsic reality, like [the reflection of] the moon on water. For example, to contend that statements such as “sentient beings [can] become buddhas” or “buddhas, although without concepts, are replete with knowledge” are self-contradictory [is to incur this downfall].
In its particular sense, this downfall means to fail to appreciate or to harbor doubts about emptiness [as described in statements such as] “the overall meaning of reality is emptiness,” etc., or to pursue similar mental fabrications.
For the downfall to be complete, four factors must be present:
(1) The pure nature of emptiness being the object [of one's doubts];
(2) Having the underlying attitude of non-appreciation with the ensuing mental fabrications;
(3-4) And the last two factors of the first downfall.
(10) To have love for the wicked, in its general sense, means to show affection for evil beings, such as demons, religious extremists, or arrogant challengers [of the teachings], who are untameable by lovingkindness.
In its particular sense, this downfall means to hypocritically feign love for another person and thereby deceive him or her. The downfall is mainly concerned with feigning love for a tantric consort. For [this sense of] the downfall to be complete, four factors must be present:
(1) The object being another sentient being, and particularly a tantric consort;
(2) Feigning love with gentle words while feeling aversion toward him or her;
(3-4) And the last two factors of the first downfall.
The general sense of this downfall is failure to annihilate [and liberate the minds of] evil beings by implementing wrathful rites (as prescribed above in the exceptional Akshobhya pledge). Here, however, the downfall has been specified [as feigning love for a tantric consort] because it must pertain to what is incompatible with the third initiation [the pristine-awareness-through-wisdom initiation, i.e., a consort].

(11) To apply discursive concepts to transcendent reality, in its general sense, means to reify or depreciate that which is beyond designations and to draw sophistic conclusions about existence, non-existence, both, or neither, not understanding that the entirety of all phenomena is simply reality as it is and reality itself is the nature of all phenomena. In its particular sense, this downfall means to conceptualize or have doubts about immutable bliss, the nature of the body, speech, and mind of the buddhas, which transcends all mundane examples, is nameless, etc.; and about emptiness inclusive of all the appearing forms of “she” who bestows the bliss.[183]
For the downfall to be complete, four factors must be present:
(1) The object being everlasting and immutable bliss;
(2) Conceiving reality to be different from immutable bliss;
(3-4) And the last two factors of the first downfall.
(12) To cause believers to lose faith, in its general sense, means to destroy someone's faith [in the Buddhist teachings]. To turn a faithful practitioner away from the Secret Mantra constitutes a defeat; to turn from their respective paths faithful followers of the [Buddha's] discourses or the proclaimers' way is a serious violation; and to turn the faithful away temporarily [from these spiritual pursuits] is a minor offense.
In its particular sense, this downfall means to disrespect and, out of jealousy, [attempt to] destroy the faith of a person of purity who inwardly dwells in the pristine awareness of reality but whose outward conduct is unorthodox.
For the downfall to be complete, four factors must be present:
(1) The object being a pure person [i.e., yogin];
(2) To speak words out of jealousy to undermine the person's faith;
(3-4) And the last two factors of the first downfall.

(13) To fail to accept the pledge substances means to have doubts about and to refuse the pledge substances during any tantric activity due to feeling that one must adhere to monastic forms of conduct, etc., [or considering these substances to be impure]. “Pledge substances” refers to the outer and inner five meats, five nectars, etc.,[184] and “tantric activities” refers to ritual feasts, celebrations of heroes and heroines,[185] and other tantric gatherings.
For the downfall to be complete, four factors must be present:
(1) The occasion being a tantric activity;
(2) Refusing to partake of the pledge substances; (3-4) And the last two factors of the first downfall.
(14) To disrespect a woman means to speak disparagingly to a woman out of disrespect.[186]
For the downfall to be complete, four factors must be present:
(1) The object being a woman;
(2) To say disparaging words to her out of disrespect;
(3-4) And the last two factors of the first downfall.
The general sense of each root downfall given here accords with the Highest Yoga Tantra's well-known standard explanations on the subject. The particular sense is as it appears in the Wheel of Time Tantra. The Indestructible Nucleus' Ornament Tantra,[187] the Red Yamari Tantra, and the Black Yamari Tantra[188] also list fourteen root downfalls, while the Indestructible Tent Tantra gives only thirteen.[189]
Manjushriyashas divides each of the fourteen root downfalls according to six aspects—object, intention, action, occasion, fault, and frequency—to a total of eighty-four, and further subdividing these according to [degrees of] seriousness—heavy, medium, and light—to yield two hundred and fifty-two aspects of the awareness-holder's ethics.[190]

Eight secondary downfalls are related to the fourteen root downfalls:
(1) To rely on an awareness-woman who has no pledges (either because she has not been initiated or has violated them), who cannot keep secret [the practice], lacks faith in oneself, and does not possess the necessary qualifications.[191] This downfall applies principally to the lay tantric practitioner.
(2) To quarrel at times of tantric activities; for example, to argue over seating order, food, or drink during a ritual feast. This includes to argue in the course of mandala rituals, fire rituals, consecrations, etc.
(3) To accept the outer and inner nectars of the pledges[192] from a shameful consort or one who has not been specified in the tantras [i.e., an ordinary consort who is not fully qualified].
(4) To fail to reveal tantric instructions to sincere disciples who request them, either because they are poor or due to one's unwillingness to share one's knowledge.
(5) To fail to answer questions on the teachings directly but to respond with playful banter, or to explain the discourses, for instance, in response to a request for [teaching on] the Secret Mantra.
(6) To stay more than one week in the home of a proclaimer[193] who has contempt for the Universal Way.
(7) To boast of being a tantric practitioner when one is ignorant of the outer, inner, and alternative levels of the Secret Mantra[194] and of the yoga of union [of wisdom and means], and knows only outer rites and procedures of the creation phase.
(8) To disclose secrets in disregard of the stipulation to give personal instructions[195] only to jewel-like disciples, collective instructions to the sandalwood-like and the other [three types of disciples],[196] and teaching on the common principles [of the Universal Way] to disciples unsuited [to tantra].

The Indestructible Nucleus' Ornament Tantra enumerates six secondary downfalls: the first, second, fifth, sixth, and eighth as above, plus to show secret [articles].[197] Various other [secondary downfalls] are found here and there in the tantras, and therefore it is difficult to make a definitive enumeration of all of them. Indian masters have also presented these downfalls in various ways. The source for the above list is [Rangjung Dorjé's] Ocean of Pledges, itself based on Manjushriyashas's works.[198] The Great Lord of Jonang [Taranatha],[199] in his work known as Elimination of Errors, explains eight [secondary downfalls] in accordance with Garbhapada's work[200]:
(1) To enjoy practice with a consort Who has no pledges;
(2) To quarrel at a ritual feast;
(3) To expound other teachings
To disciples with faith [in the tantras];
(4) To stay more than seven days in the home Of someone proud to be a proclaimer;
(5) To disclose secrets to unqualified disciples Who are not sufficiently prepared;
(6) To teach the physical seal[201]
To disciples who lack the necessary skill in the seals;
(7) To perform mandala rituals [such as an initiation] Without first completing proper service, etc.;
(8) To transgress the precepts of the Individual and Universal ways
Without having a special [altruistic] purpose.
Some scholars say that the secondary downfalls number nine, the ninth being to use symbolic behavior[202] without a specific purpose.

The first fifteen of the twenty-eight subtle infractions are downfalls in the performance of charismatic activity. These are explained by the master Shura[203] as follows:
(1) To reject the deity on which the flower [tossed into the mandala] has fallen and to favor another[204];
(2) To let a day and a night pass [without engaging] in the creation and completion [phases] of one's deity[205];
(3) To be attracted to [and worship] non-Buddhist deities[206];
(4) to view the [mandala, the deity, and other forms of the] creation phase as real;
(5) To confer [full] initiation on disciples when one has not been fully initiated oneself;
(6) To teach profound subjects for the sake of worldly gains;
(7) To deprecate [and fail to follow] the ethics of lower spiritual pursuits [and minor pledges];
(8) to give a contrived image of oneself [as spiritually accomplished] for the sake of gain;
(9) To engage in [appeasing] charismatic activities, [etc.,] without having gained the necessary power;
(10) to pass the time [meant for practice] in meaningless distractions;
(11) To fail to take care of others though able to;
(12) to be attracted to [and to follow] lesser forms of spiritual conduct [that of the proclaimers and so forth];
(13) To desire material goods[207];
(14) to fail to discipline those who violate their pledges; and
(15) To engage prematurely in tantric activity[208]: these are the fifteen.

The seven branch subtle infractions are to fail to do the following:
(1) Devote oneself to an authentic master[209];
(2) Examine whether a disciple has the qualifications [to enter the Mantra];
(3) Cause no harm to others while accomplishing one's desires[210];
(4) Refrain from making personal use of the property of the Three Jewels[211] [or of the master or vajra siblings];
(5) engage in what benefits others;
(6) Seal one's [merit] by dedication[212]; and (7) be skillful in the transference [of consciousness[213]].

The six mistakes are these:
(1) To have doubts about [the view and conduct of] the Secret Mantra;
(2) To teach the three ways[214] simultaneously, rather than [according to the] levels [of the disciples];
(3) To act as a tantric master without [expertise] in the ten fields[215];
(4) To lack skill in the ways to investigate demonic forces;
(5) To fail to examine [whether one has transgressed the root and secondary] pledges;
And (6) to fail to acknowledge minor infractions.

All these add up to twenty-eight subtle infractions. The Red and Black Yamari tantras list four other secondary downfalls:
(1) Do not wander [into the village] begging [out of desire];
(2) Do not abandon the tantric meditation;
(3) Do not discontinue the recitation of secret mantras; and
(4) Do not fail to rely on the pledge's [substances], etc.[216]

Various ways of classifying the pledges are presented in the tantras, for example, the different pledges for each of the four initiations taught in most of the mandalas related to the fundamental and explanatory Chakrasamvara [tantras]. In particular, the instructions on the Path and its Fruition[217] present different pledges for each of the four initiations.
For the vase initiation,
(1) the pledge of equipoise is [to cultivate] the creation phase;
(2) the pledge of post[-equipoise] conduct is to practice the three realities[218];
(3) the pledge of sustenance is [to eat] the pills made with the five meats and five nectars;
(4) the pledges to be safeguarded are the twenty-two root and secondary mantric vows[219];
(5) the pledge not to be separated from is to hold vajra and bell.
For the secret initiation,
(1) the pledge of equipoise is to engage in the control of the breath and channels[220];
(2) the pledge of post[-equipoise] conduct is [to rest in] selfexisting pristine awareness[221];
(3) the pledge of sustenance is [to nourish oneself with] emptiness and clarity;
(4) the pledge to be safeguarded is [to shun] all that hampers self-existing [wisdom] and [its] wind;
(5) the pledge not to be separated from is [to work with] either gentle or forceful breath [control].
For the pristine-awareness-through-wisdom initiation,
(1) the pledge of equipoise is to meditate on the mandala[222];
(2) the pledge of post[-equipoise] conduct is [to rest in] the innate [pristine awareness of bliss][223];
(3) the pledge of sustenance is [to nourish oneself with] bliss;
(4) the pledge to be safeguarded is not to allow the six losses of seminal essence[224];
(5) the pledge not to be separated from is [to rely on] an actual or imaginary consort.
For the fourth initiation,
(1) the pledge of equipoise concerns the “three [vajra] waves”[225];
(2) the pledge of post[-equipoise] conduct is [to rest in the] utterly pure reality;
(3) the pledge of sustenance is [to nourish oneself with] the blissemptiness of great bliss;
(4) the vow to be safeguarded is [to overcome] the two impediments,[226] in particular those that hamper the attainment of omniscience;
(5) the pledge never to be separated from is [to rely on] an actual padmini [lotus-like consort] or an imaginary consort.[227]

These pledges are honored in four ways: first by assuming them correctly; by recollecting them again and again; by having [at least] a single [meditative] experience; and by having a special respect for the vajra master. It is said that failure to fulfill the first means losing the pledges that would draw one out of the suffering of cyclic existence. Failure to fulfill the latter three ways means loss of pledges resulting in a delay in one's spiritual progress.
“Etc.” [in the root verse] refers to pledges taught in other tantras, for example, the Samputa Tantra's pledges of the enlightened body, speech, and mind:
The pledge of vajra body
Is not to despise, even if unaware [of reality], The body of a male or female
Which is born from many actions. The pledge of vajra mind
Is not to torment others in any way Or to demean one's mind
With a net of discursive thoughts. The pledge of vajra speech
Is to speak gently
And not utter harsh words Out of sheer jealousy.[228]
To elaborate, the pledge of the vajra body is never to disrespect the body of any being, male or female, of the six classes because each possesses the nature of the body of enlightenment. The pledge of the vajra mind is not to cause distress to oneself or another by instigating feelings of guilt, etc., because all sentient beings possess the nature of enlightened mind. The pledge of the vajra speech is never to speak harsh words but always gentle ones that please and do not upset others, because all beings have the nature of enlightened speech. These pledges are taught with consistency in many tantras such as the Indestructible Nucleus' Ornament Tantra.[229]

The Chakrasamvara Fundamental Tantra presents eight special pledges:
(1) Not to allow the movement of bodhichitta (loss of the seminal essence). Bodhichitta is the seed of desire-realm [bliss] gained from relying on an action seal; the seed of form-realm [bliss], from relying on an imaginary seal; and the seed of the fruit which is the enlightenment of the great seal.[230] Thus, not to lose the seminal essence serves as the cause for all powerful attainments.
(2) To cultivate [or safeguard] the pledge,[231] which means to cause the sixteen [aspects of] bliss to gradually arise at the throat, heart, navel, and genital focal points of energy by using the passion of the wisdom-woman.
(3) Not to unite with the emissary of another buddha family after having discarded the consort of one's own buddha family if one's purpose is that of gaining only outer attainments.[232]
(4) To attain the undivided state at the end of the full moon,[233] which means to fulfill the pledges related to the four seminal essences of the four focal points of energy by resting in the state of the indivisibility of emptiness and innate bliss.
(5) To shun the waning phase of the moon,[234] which means not to lose [the seminal essence] that has the nature of the sixteen joys through the bliss of emission.
(6) To churn [or follow] the female conduct[235] (the conduct of the transcendent Samantabhadri[236]), which means always to accomplish with joy the many ways to benefit others.
(7) To maintain chastity at the face of the vajra,[237] which is to always maintain the ethics of not emitting [the seminal essence].
(8) To draw [the seminal essences] up the central channel[238] which means to draw up and to stabilize at the crown focal point of energy the seminal essences that have flowed down to the tip of the secret place by reversing them and experiencing the joys in the ascending order.
[Vajrapani's] Eulogy-Commentary on the Chakrasamvara Tantra[239] explains these eight pledges in detail and states the benefit of safeguarding them in these words:
A practitioner who at all times cultivates the eight [special] pledges will swiftly gain the attainment of the great seal.
In addition to these, there are many classifications of the different minor pledges presented in the tantras. However, the principal ones are included in those explained above.

(2) The vows of the secret initiation are comprised by the “pledge of sustenance”: to partake of the five meats and the five nectars.
(3) The vows of the pristine-awareness-through-wisdom initiation are comprised by the “pledge of conduct”: the special pledges, to liberate [evil] beings, etc.
(4) The vows of the fourth initiation are comprised by the “pledge not to be apart from”: to wear the attire of Heruka and to rely on a wisdom-woman.

(3) the pledges of equipoise, such as the four pledges to be interpreted[243]; and the pledges of post-equipoise, such as the twenty-five modes of conduct [taught in the Wheel of Time Tantra], the fourteen [modes of conduct taught] in the Indestructible Tent Tantra, and other post-equipoise pledges.[244]

The Indestructible Tent Tantra prescribes six modes of conduct to be performed by a practitioner who has achieved a stable state of contemplation and has attained the pristine awareness of experiential warmth[245]:
Do not perform symbolic hand gestures.
Do not build reliquaries [or cast votive images].
Do not bow to the [representations of the] exalted three vajras [i.e., body, speech, and mind of the buddhas].
Do not draw mandalas, or do other outer rituals. Do not do these even in your dreams.
Honor your tantric master, [his lineage,] and [spiritual] siblings, But do not pay homage to other teachers.

A practitioner who has attained a deep level of realization and has perfected pristine awareness has transcended all the creations of dualistic thought, concepts of vows and transgressions, codes of behavior prescribing what to do and what not to do, proper and improper conduct, and so on. For this adept, all pledges are inherently observed in the “pledge of the great observance.”

The root downfalls qualify as actual tantric defeats when seven factors are present:
(1) The offense being motivated by a negative emotion;
(2) Recognition of the object [basis of the infraction];
(3) Having pursued the wrongdoing with physical action or words;
(4) Having engaged in the main part of the particular downfall; this is referred to as “separated” [since the action must be separated from its antidote by a period of three hours to be considered completed].
(5) To be pleased and to have no regret;
(6) To be in a non-deranged state of mind [when committing the downfall];
(7) To let one, or [at the most] three, years pass while the master is still alive without acknowledging the downfall.
When six factors are present, but the deadline for acknowledgment has not passed, the offense is called a downfall and is equivalent in seriousness to a partial defeat in the monastic code. To have engaged in the very cause of the downfall but without having allowed the deadline for acknowledgment to pass and with one of the other factors missing is equivalent to a serious transgression in the monastic code. To have engaged in the very cause of the downfall but without the deadline having passed and with more than one of the other factors missing is equivalent to a downfall [that requires forfeiture or confession alone] in the monastic code. To have pursued the wrongdoing with physical action or words in the absence of all the other factors is equivalent to a minor infraction in the monastic code. One also incurs minor infractions when one transgresses the pledges due to not recollecting them.[246]

The eight secondary downfalls are classified as serious transgressions, downfalls, or minor infractions depending on [the presence of many or few of] the seven completing factors.
The Essence Ornament of the General Procedure for All Secrets[247] states that in certain cases transgressions of the pledges may seem to be downfalls but in fact are not: when done for a greater purpose, such as seeing that others would benefit; when observing a pledge would cause an obstacle [for one's life]; when one has received permission to do so [from a master or favored deity]; or when unable [to keep the pledges] because of illness, etc.
A different explanation, which is essentially the same as the explanation given above, specifies the following five factors (person, object, attitude, enactment, and conclusion) that complete a downfall:
(1) the person, a holder of [previously] unviolated pledges;
(2) the object, one's vajra master, for example, and recognition of the object;
(3) the attitude, feeling no shame in transgressing the pledge, not trying to avoid the downfall, and afterwards being pleased and having no regret about it;
(4) the enactment, to engage in the actual transgression;
(5) the conclusion, the consummation of that act.
The factors that lead to transgressions are stated in the Dakinisamvara Tantra[248] :
Six factors lead to the violation of pledges:
Ignorance [of the pledges], heedlessness, Overwhelming emotions, irreverence, Forgetfulness, and weak mindfulness.
Practitioners who strive to overcome these factors will naturally honor their pledges.
In general, all the pledges of Secret Mantra are very strict and require extreme caution. In particular, it is imperative not to disrespect one's vajra master. To do so, even while honoring all other pledges, is like cutting the root of a tree.

It is imperative that pledges be restored if a downfall has been incurred. The general means of restoration are as follows: [In the Wheel of Time tantra,] one who has received only [the first] seven initiations[249] must recite thirty-six thousand mantras for each deity of the mandala and then retake the seven initiations with the intention never to transgress the pledges again. One who has received the uncommon vase and secret initiations must retake the initiation after having applied the means of restoration indicated by the vajra master. The Essence Ornament of the General Procedure for All Secrets[250] lists twenty-five means of restoring the pledges:

Of the special means of restoring pledges, all of the higher and lower tantras emphasize the fire ritual for purifying wrong deeds, in particular, the fire ritual of Vajradaka[252]; the meditation and the recitation of the mantra of one's favored deity; and actual ritual feasts or similar celebrations of heroes, [heroines,][253] etc. Since these are all outstanding means of restoration, they should be engaged in with increasing energy and for a greater number of times depending on whether the transgression is a deterioration, a violation, or a rupture. To elaborate, transgressions become increasingly serious the longer the delay before taking remedial measures. [The different types of] transgressions are designated as follows: (1) infractions not amended within a period; (2) contraventions; (3) deteriorations; (4) violations; and (5) ruptures. An infraction not amended within a period is a transgression that has not been remedied within three hours (one of the six periods of day and night). A contravention is a transgression that has not been remedied within the same day. A deterioration is a transgression that has not been remedied within a month. A violation is a transgression that has not been remedied within a year. A rupture is a transgression that has not been remedied within two, or three, years. If, within three years of the occurrence of a transgression, one acknowledges it sincerely and perseveres in applying [the means of purification], one can rise above it. However, after more than three years have elapsed, the transgression becomes irreparable and the perpetrator will certainly be reborn in hell. Hence, one must strive to prevent downfalls occurring in the first place, arresting them with the remedies of mindfulness and discriminative alertness. If a downfall does occur, regardless of its seriousness, it can be purified if one
acknowledges it before three hours have elapsed.

The principal means to remedy transgressions acknowledged within a period of three hours are the meditation and the recitation of the mantras of Vajrasattva and Samayavajra,[254] practices which are both easy and very effective. To receive an initiation or to perform by oneself the ritual of entering into the outer and inner mandalas are the most effective means of restoration since they are related to that very purpose [purification]. Therefore, tantras repeatedly state that nothing is more worthwhile than to exert oneself at these practices at all times. The first step is to first verbally acknowledge the downfall before a gathering [of practitioners] or a [sacred] representation; the second, to perform self-initiation or retake the initiation; and finally, to apply the methods to purify wrong deeds. This is the procedure followed
by all great vajra holders.

[According to the Wheel of Time Tantra,] those who have received all of the special higher initiations[255] cannot purify transgressions of the pledges by simply using the common means employed to purify negative deeds in general. Pledges must be renewed in the following ways: meditation on the creation phase whereby merit is cultivated; the stages of self-blessing (such as the subtle [yoga and the yoga] of the seminal essence)[256] whereby ethics is cultivated; enhancement of the blissful pristine awareness [ensuing] from the melting [of the seminal essence]; and constant equipoise in the view free of the concepts of the three spheres—agent, act, and recipient [whereby pristine awareness is cultivated]. In other words, the pledges assumed in the course of the vase initiation [and those assumed in the secret initiation or those in the initiations of lower tantras] can be restored by the means indicated by the spiritual master, but [the pledges of the higher initiations of the Highest Yoga Tantra] must be restored by [realization of] the perfect purity of one's own mind.

The long tradition of the Ancient Translations enumerates nine spiritual ways.[257] The vows most widely known and common to the three higher ways [Mahayoga, Anuyoga, and Atiyoga] are of three types, the general, particular, and exceptional pledges. These are taught in the Yoga of General Cleansing, the Union of Joyful Ones, Peaceful Tantra, and other tantras.
The etymological definition of pledge (Tib. dam tshig) is “an oath that is firm and hard to transgress.” Thus, as has been explained above [in the new tantras], pledge refers to an oath that must be preserved just as it has been made and not transgressed or allowed to deteriorate. Pledge also means “strict” in consideration of [the strict consequences of] observance or its transgression. The Condensed Heruka Tantra[258] states:
It is said that by not transgressing it, one becomes a supreme (dam) being;
By transgressing it, one will burn (tshig) [in hell].

The general pledges are the limits to be observed in the personal liberation precepts, awakening mind commitments, and the pledges of the three outer tantras.
The particular pledges are the root pledges of body, speech, mind, and awakening mind, and
The secondary pledges of the five to practice, five not to renounce,
Five to accept, five to recognize, and five to integrate.

General pledges common [to the three systems] refers to the limits to be observed as prescribed by the personal liberation precepts, the
awakening mind commitments, and the pledges of the three outer classes of tantra [Action, Conduct, and Yoga tantras]. The particular pledges are the root pledges related to the body, speech, mind, and awakening mind of a buddha, and the five sets of five secondary pledges—the five to practice, the five not to renounce, the five to accept, the five to recognize, and the five to integrate. The exceptional pledges are twenty pledges that must be honored especially during familiarization and attainment practices.[259]
[The general pledges have been explained above.] Of the particular pledges, the root pledge of the body of a buddha is to guard one's relationships with the vajra master and spiritual siblings. There are six masters to be honored, as stated in Lilavajra's Shimmering Light on the Pledges[260]:
Masters who are teachers of all, who lead [one to the teachings], initiate, and [bestow] pledges,
Restore infractions, open one's mind, Or transmit secret instructions.[261]
In what way each should be honored is illustrated by corresponding examples[262]:
Regard them more highly than these:
The king of your country, your uncle, father, or mother, Your own eyes, or your heart.
In particular, as stated in the Union of Joyful Ones, Peaceful Tantra, one should regard the three masters who initiate, explain the tantra, and transmit secret instructions more highly than, or at least equal to, the Buddha, or as a fourth Jewel. Without hypocrisy, one should honor masters by doing, through actions, words, and thoughts, whatever pleases them and by following their every directive.

Moreover, [as stated in Lilavajra's Shimmering Light,[263]] one must maintain spiritual bonds with the four [types of] siblings:
(1) [All sentient beings,] one's general siblings;
(2) [All Buddhists,] distant siblings;
(3) [All Buddhists who follow the same conduct and view,] close siblings;
(4) [Mantra practitioners with whom one shares the same tantric master, initiation, etc.,] intimate siblings.
One should honor spiritual siblings while showing loving concern for them, and must never forsake them, particularly the latter three who have entered the authentic path, and even more so, intimate siblings, knowing that these relationships are increasingly significant in that order.
The root pledge of the speech of a buddha is to recite the three kinds of incantation, to practice the four seals, and to make offerings, as stated in the Shimmering Light[264]:
To recite the root, generation, and action mantras,
And apply the four [seals]: the seal of the pledge, action seal, seal of the teachings,
And the two awakened dimensions [as the] great seal.
In applying oneself to the three kinds of incantation[265] and the four seals, the best effort would be a practice that never ceases, like the current of a river [done without distraction in the day and night meditation sessions]; a moderate effort, a practice carried out [uninterruptedly in the four or six periods] of the day of the new moon [and other special days]; and a minimal effort, a practice of not neglecting the monthly or annual performance of [ritual feast and] food offerings (torma) on [special] days.

The root pledge of the mind of a buddha is not to proclaim the ten secrets to those without pledges or those who have violated them, or to ordinary people.
The ten secrets are enumerated in the Shimmering Light[266]:
Profound view, outrageous conduct,
The deity's name and mantra, and signs of accomplishment:
These are the four general secrets.
And:
Engage in tantric practice while keeping [four] transitional secrets:
The place [of gathering], the time, one's companions, and the ritual articles.
These are the four general and four transitional secrets. The remaining two are innermost secrets: The secrets worthy to be kept are the exceptional mantric conduct and the substances of the pledges,[267] and what is unfit to be seen or heard, such as the bad behavior of one's spiritual siblings. Entrusted secrets concern instructions, etc., that the vajra master or spiritual siblings have sealed as secret by command.
The root pledge of awakening mind consists in the pledge of the view, the realization of the abiding nature of [reality], the indivisibility of the [two] superior truths[268] which transcends the [mind's] experiential domain. To fulfill this pledge, one must train in the aspiring and venturing aspects of awakening mind. To train in the mind of aspiration is to focus on the result, which is actualized without abandoning or attaining anything. To train in the venturing mind is to actualize the result by bringing all one's experiences onto the path as pure vision. [This is possible] since all experiences of one's body, speech, and mind, and their domains, which are expressions of the pristine awareness present within oneself, never transcend the seals of the deity's body, speech, and mind.

<d e="2">
Of the secondary particular pledges, the five pledges prescribing what to practice have both provisional and hidden meanings. To fulfill the provisional meanings, one engages in sexual union, release, theft, speaking untruth, and speaking outrageously, provided these are done without selfish motives, but as skillful means, and to benefit others. The hidden meanings of these pledges are as follows:
(1) Release means to sever the life of dualistic thoughts with selfexperienced pristine awareness;
(2) Theft is to steal the seminal essence (bliss) from the queen (consort)[269];
(3) Union is to achieve immutable bliss through the bliss experienced in melting [the seminal essence] while uniting [with a consort];
(4) Speaking untruth is to say that living beings are [already] liberated from the apparent yet non-existent cycle of existence;
(5) Speaking outrageously is to speak without inhibitions from an inexpressible state of spiritual accomplishment.
To fulfill the provisional meanings of the five pledges that prescribe what not to renounce, one does not renounce the five poisons of negativity [emotions] just as they are[270] as proclaimers [who regard them as enemies] do, but engages in them with skill in means. This is because these five poisons serve as a direct path to liberation and because their nature is primordially that of the five pristine awarenesses. To fulfill the hidden meanings, one does not renounce the five per-
fect poisons:
(1) The stupidity that does not differentiate between what to practice and what to refrain from and that is impartial in its view since all things are perfect in the state of sameness;
(2) The attachment that is the affection developed from nonobjectifying great compassion for living beings who lack realization of the view;
(3) The hatred that subdues misconceptions with self-experienced pristine awareness;
(4) The pride that does not descend from the heights of the view that realizes the sameness [of phenomena];
(5) The jealousy that does not accommodate dualistic views or conduct in the vast expanse of sameness.
One must not renounce these five, [but should accept them] with the skillful means to experientially cultivate the state of inner realization.

To fulfill the provisional meanings of the five pledges that prescribe what to accept, one accepts the five nectars [of the pledge's substances]:
(1) the great fragrant solids [feces],
(2) fragrant water [urine],
(3) blood,
(4) flesh,
(5) vajra dew [semen].
These five must not be rejected but instead should be accepted [without concepts of clean or dirty] because they are the nature of reality itself, and by virtue of their very essence and potency and through consecration, these are special substances used to gain attainments.
To fulfill the hidden meanings, one binds and does not lose the pure essences of the five aggregates.
To fulfill the five pledges that prescribe what to recognize, one must recognize the following (since all phenomena exist primordially as enlightenment):
(1) the five aggregates as the five male transcendent ones;
(2) the five elemental properties as the five female transcendent ones;
(3) the five sense organs and their five consciousnesses as the male bodhisattvas;
(4) the five sense objects as the female bodhisattvas;
(5) the colors [associated with] the five families as the five pristine awarenesses.
All conceptual representations of these five sets of five phenomena should be recognized as the mandala of pristine awareness and its dimensions[271] with the wisdom that cuts through misapprehension [of the nature of these phenomena].
To fulfill the five pledges that prescribe what to integrate, one must, having gained an experiential understanding of the five pledges that prescribe what to recognize, persevere in the means to correctly effect the integration of this understanding within one's mind.

[The pledges prescribing] what to recognize are pledges of the view. Once those are realized, one observes [the pledges prescribing] what to integrate, which are pledges of meditation. The three [groups of pledges prescribing] what to practice, what not to renounce, and what to accept, in the context of their provisional meanings, are mainly pledges of conduct. Therefore, in a state of equipoise, these pledges should be observed according to their hidden (definitive) meanings. [The three groups of] pledges [according to their provisional meanings] are to be safeguarded or practiced respecting their order of progression and evaluating their [individual] applicability according to circumstances. [Here, “circumstances” refers to] time (for example, whether or not one has reached certainty through realization of the view) and place (whether one is living in solitude or attending social gatherings).

The Vajrasattva's Magical Net,[276] the source scripture for the eighteen great classes of Mahayoga tantra, presents five root [pledges]:
(1) Not to forsake the unsurpassable;
(2) To honor the master with devotion;
(3) Not to interrupt [the practice of] the three [kinds of] mantra and the four seals;
(4) To be kind to spiritual siblings;
(5) And not to divulge the ten secrets.[277]
To elaborate, the first [pledge], not to forsake the unsurpassable, means to maintain one's body, speech, and mind within the bounds of the deity's seals of body, speech, and mind by realizing the superior truth: ultimate and relative awakening minds as the inseparability of appearance and emptiness. The remaining four are as described above.
The ten secondary pledges [taught in the same tantra] are the five pledges that prescribe what not to renounce (the five poisons) and the five that prescribe what to accept (the five pledge substances).
The Subtle and Extensive Pledges[278] and other texts give detailed classifications of three hundred and sixty pledges. First, the five root [pledges] are each divided into two by differentiating them in terms of skill in means and wisdom. Added to these are the one hundred and fifty pledges which result from a subdivision into thirty of each of the five root pledges. To these are added two hundred further pledges derived from subdividing each of the ten secondary pledges into twenty. Thus, it is impossible to enumerate all pledges because each can be elaborated upon indefinitely to provide a pledge to counteract every discursive thought. The Secret Nucleus states[279]:
Pledges are equal in number to all the discursive thoughts to be calmed
Of all beings within the three existences
And throughout the ten directions of the six worlds of beings.[280]

Rongzom Pandita[281] states that the awakening mind commitments are superior to the [personal] liberation vows of the proclaimers by virtue of possessing seven great qualities, such as a vast scope. In turn, the higher pledges [of Mahayoga] are superior to the commitments of the Universal Way and the pledges of the lower tantras due to sevenfold greatness. In his Precious Jewel Commentary,[282] Rongzom elucidates [the seven exceptional qualities of Mahayoga pledges]:
Since [the pledges] bear the seal of Samantabhadra, good qualities are spontaneously accomplished without effort. Powers and blessings are especially exalted since the great gods, principal ones in the world, and their retinues of mamos and sky-farers[283] come to regard one as a sacred being, worthy of worship. The compassion of all buddhas and bodhisattvas, who regard one as their child and close vajra sibling, brings swift blessings. One's domain is exalted since it is concordant with the experiential domain[284] of the Transcendent One. One enjoys freedom from all fear and anxiety since all phenomena exist in the buddha field of Samantabhadra.[285] All pledges prescribed in terms of hinted or definitive meanings are gathered in the natural expression of spontaneous accomplishment. Even if transgressed, there are means to restore them. By virtue of these seven and other limitless qualities, these [pledges] are exceptional.[286]

The sixty-sixth chapter of the General Scripture That Gathers All Intentions[287] presents nine sets of general pledges of Anuyoga:
(1) Four pledges crucial to all important [Anuyoga] scriptures. These are four pledges to purify completely one's body, speech, mind, and perceptual range.
(2) Twenty-eight pledges in common with the other tantras. The root pledges are the three pledges of vajra body, speech, and mind. The secondary pledges are the five pledges prescribing what to practice, the five to renounce, the five to accept, the five to recognize, and the five to integrate, as explained above.
(3) Four superior pledges. These pledges concern the perfect realization of the abiding nature of reality:
(1) The pledge to perfectly realize that all pledges, in their ultimate nature, are free of transgression or deterioration, and are therefore without limits to be observed;
(2) The pledge to perfectly realize that the expressions of all vows and pledges transcend the forms of dualistic clinging and are therefore all-pervasive simplicity;
(3) The pledge to perfectly realize that all vows and pledges are encompassed by the single expanse of the mind's nature;
(4) The pledge to perfectly realize that all vows and pledges are naturally pure and spontaneously fulfilled in the state that does not stray from the inconceivable realm of reality.

(4) Twenty-three pledges prescribing conduct. The sixty-fourth chapter [of the General Scripture That Gathers All Intentions] illustrates this set of pledges through analogies, such as the fox, the centaur, and the thoroughbred. These pledges and the meanings of their analogies are explained by the Great Nub Sangyé Yeshé[288] and others as follows:
(1) [The pledge to be] like the fox who, when caught in a trap, will escape with its paw torn off, without regard for its life. This pledge prescribes the conduct (Tib. brtul zhug), which is the means to overcome (brtul) all unfavorable conditions and enter (zhug) into the power of the pledges, whereby the yogin [or yogini] guards the pledges, even at the cost of life itself.
(2) The pledge to be like the centaur who is aware of everything as he, with unfettered speed, circles the globe in an instant. This pledge prescribes the unfettered conduct whereby the yogin applies discriminative wisdom to the general and individual characteristics of all that is knowable.
(3) The pledge to be like the thoroughbred who takes each step with great impressiveness. This pledge prescribes the conduct whereby the yogin overcomes idleness and perseveres in dance, symbolic gestures, and yantra yoga,[289] with a disciplined body.
(4) The pledge to be like the intoxicated elephant who destroys every enemy he meets without discrimination. This pledge prescribes the conduct whereby the yogin destroys the four enemies of view and action[290] with the knowledge that cyclic existence and perfect peace are indivisible.
(5) The pledge to be like the fearless tiger whose aggressive instincts are fierce, brave, and terrifying. This pledge prescribes the conduct whereby the yogin, possessed of the powerful conduct of fearless contemplation that realizes the abiding nature of reality, performs the rites of liberation fiercely, bravely, and aggressively for the ten recipients,[291] as was done for the liberation of Rudra and the transfer of his consciousness.
(6) The pledge to be like the great garuda who soars effortlessly through the sky, seeing all phenomena without especially looking. This pledge prescribes the conduct whereby the yogin, with the proper view, realizes the indivisibility of the expanse of phenomena and pristine awareness and, out of that realization, acts freely and effortlessly.

<d e="2">
(7) The pledge to be like the bear who terrorizes and overpowers whatever it focuses upon without hesitation. This pledge prescribes the conduct of yoga whereby the yogin, with certainty in the view and conduct, performs without hesitation the rites of annihilation.
(8) The pledge to be like gold at the bottom of the ocean which never changes. This pledge prescribes the conduct whereby the yogin is of a firm and unchanging mind, able to maintain secrecy of the profound truth while cultivating it experientially.
(9) The pledge to be like the dumb mute who makes no distinction between what to accept and what to reject. This pledge prescribes the conduct whereby the yogin perfects the wisdom that realizes selflessness through the equipoise which makes no distinction between cyclic existence and perfect peace.
(10) The pledge to be like the unmoving Mount Meru. This pledge prescribes the conduct of skillful means whereby the yogin relies on the remedies of unchanging faith in and respect for teachers and spiritual friends and contemplation unmoved by torpor or excitement.
(11) The pledge to be like the vast and open sky which accommodates everything without acceptance or rejection. This pledge prescribes the conduct whereby the yogin acts hospitably and open-mindedly toward sibling yogins, and with the view and conduct of the great identity, accommodates all spiritual ways and everything within cyclic existence and perfect peace.
(12) The pledge to be like a thunderbolt which shatters whatever it strikes. This pledge prescribes the conduct whereby the yogin unimpededly destroys all enemies and hindrances through the fierce kind of contemplation.
(13) The pledge to be like Vajrapani who vanquishes all those who profess wayward views. This pledge prescribes the conduct whereby the yogin confidently performs meditation on wrathful [deities] and conquers all obstacles.
(14) The pledge to be like the raven who looks out for both predator and prey simultaneously. This pledge prescribes the conduct of skillful means whereby the yogin always strives to observe simultaneously both conduct and restraint [according to] the outer and inner pledges.

(15) The pledge to be like the elephant who plunges into water unconcerned about whether he is soaked. This pledge prescribes the conduct whereby the yogin, possessed of certainty in the view and action of the great identity, acts without the duality of renunciation and acceptance; or, alternatively, performs the conduct of four charismatic activities without discriminating among those to be affected [by these activities].
(16) The pledge to be like the friendless lion who lives without companions. This pledge prescribes the conduct whereby the yogin renounces bad companions who are detrimental to the view and meditation, and protects view and meditation while dwelling in solitude.
(17) The pledge to be like the pair of ducks who happily keep company with each other without ever parting. This pledge prescribes the conduct whereby the yogin keeps company with skillful means without ever parting from it, thereby setting others in the happiness of liberation out of compassion and loving-kindness.
(18) The pledge to be like the magician who creates illusions. This pledge prescribes the conduct whereby the yogin meditates and teaches while knowing the aggregates, elements, and experiential media to be the apparitional mandala of the victorious ones, and creates illusion through skill in means.
(19) The pledge to be like the pig who eats everything regardless of whether it is clean or filthy. This pledge prescribes the conduct whereby the yogin, in a state of equanimity, uses the five pledge substances without discrimination.
(20) The pledge to be like the jackal who loves wanton killing. This pledge prescribes the conduct of skillful means whereby the yogin, with a compassionate attitude cultivated in view and action and by means of inner realization, liberates those who hold wayward views and transfers their consciousnesses to an uncorrupted [realm], thus bringing to perfection the two cultivations [of merit and pristine awareness].
(21) The pledge to be like lightning which swiftly illuminates everything in a flash. This pledge prescribes the conduct whereby the yogin perseveres so that his own and others' aims are swiftly fulfilled through experiential cultivation of the path.

(22) The pledge to be like the vulture whose discipline is to shun killing. This pledge prescribes what appears as outrageous conduct in that it does not conform to the [disciplines of] other spiritual ways, but is in fact conduct whereby the yogin, acting in accordance with the great identity, observes pledges and purifies transgressions.
(23) The pledge to be like the conscientious king who rules over his kingdom and protects his subjects, [cherishing them] more than himself. This pledge prescribes the conduct whereby the yogin, who perseveres in the means to experience and realize the indivisibility of the expanse [of reality] and pristine awareness as profound bliss, rules over the “kingdom” of conducts, protects living beings by realizing all phenomena as self-arisen, and purifies transgressions in their own ground.
It is said that these conducts, of benefit to oneself, others, and oneself and others together, should be practiced all at once by adepts of superior intelligence.

(5) Twenty pledges concerning attainment. These are taught [in the General Scripture That Gathers All Intentions] beginning with the following words: “Do not destroy the throne of the king of wild animals” (Do not inflict harm on your master's body or disrespect his or her words), etc. Their meaning is essentially the same as the twenty exceptional pledges mentioned above.
(6) Four pledges concerning the continuity of the path of conduct. The symbols of a vajra, armor, dagger, mystic staff, etc., illustrate the following pledges:
(1) To forsake sleep that cuts off the life of contemplation;
(2) To forsake alcohol;
(3) To communicate with the symbolic language of Secret Mantra;
(4) To vanquish idleness.
(7) Five pledges to renounce the five evils, which are the five demonic forces that interrupt the continuity of the conduct of yoga:
(1) To renounce discursive thinking;
(2) To renounce laziness;
(3) To renounce entertainment;
(4) To renounce harsh language;
(5) To renounce wrath.
(8) Four pledges to conquer the four enemies. These pledges are as follows:
(1) To conquer the enemy of the creation of an artificial view, meditation, or conduct;
(2) To conquer the enemy of the immorality of being unorthodox in conduct while having an inferior view;
(3) To conquer the enemy of transgressing root and secondary pledges;
(4) To conquer the enemy who steals the results [of spiritual practice] with complacency and idleness.
(9) One pledge of the view. This pledge is to realize that the world is the utterly pure realm Superior[292]; sense pleasures, the utterly pure offerings; one's entourage, the utterly pure mandala of deities; and one's own emotions, utterly pure and profound pristine awareness.
All these pledges are encompassed by two: the pledge of reality for one of instantaneous [realization], in which there are no limits to observe; and the pledge of compassion for one who proceeds gradually, with limits to be observed. Accordingly, the General Scripture That Gathers All Intentions states[293]:
That for which there is nothing to observe Is the highest pledge of reality.
And[294]:
This pledge is most wonderful Since it exceeds all,
But all those of weak aspiration Should observe the different limits.

The twofold pledge of “cutting through” (Tib. khregs chod),[297] posited in relation to the essence of primordial purity (Tib. ka dag), is the pledge to liberate oneself from grasping to the reality of ongoing phenomena by realizing that, as illustrated by the eight similes of illusion,[298] everything that manifests as the environment and inhabitants is primordially non-existent; and to liberate projected appearances in the state of reality by cultivating unsupported, utterly natural intrinsic awareness not entangled in the tension of grasping at [the concept of] an observer.
The twofold pledge of “direct leap” (Tib. thod rgal), posited in relation to the natural expression of spontaneous accomplishment (Tib. lhun grub), is the pledge to disengage oneself from an outer spiritual quest, confident in the realization that buddhahood is to be actualized within oneself through continuous experiential cultivation of the four visionary appearances of spontaneous accomplishment,[299] which are the manifestation of the [inner] radiance of the five[-colored] light; and to arrive in the kingdom of the primordial exhaustion of [phenomena into] reality through the confident realization that all occurrences and manifestations—thoughts, events, feelings, circumstances, and ongoing appearances—are solely natural pristine awareness.

The rupture of a pledge, which is caused by letting the [maximum] deadline [for confession] pass, and the other types of transgressions have been described above.[300] In addition, the General Scripture That Gathers All Intentions explains five types of transgressions:
(1) Major or total deterioration that occurs [when one commits a transgression] with strong emotional involvement and in relation to a crucial object, commits it continuously, or lets the deadline [of three years without restoration] pass, whereby it becomes a rupture;
(2-3) [Downfalls] due transgressions of root and secondary [pledges];
(4) Violation by association, which is the minor infraction incurred by befriending someone who has transgressed his or her pledges;
(5) Indirect violation, the minor infraction incurred by appearing to agree with someone who is transgressing his or her pledges.
It is extremely important that all of the pledges that have been discussed, once assumed, are honored and not allowed to deteriorate. If it happens that a pledge is transgressed, it is essential to perform immediately the confession rituals methodically, as they appear in the tantras, transmissions, and secret instructions. Not to acknowledge a transgression brings all sorts of misfortune in this life, and in the next life one is reborn in the great Vajra Hell of Unceasing Torture, not to escape from it so long as the sky exists. The Secret Moon Essence states:
Buddhas and bodhisattvas Do not bestow blessings
On one who has violated vows and pledges; Even if he were to offer
Incense, flowers, or other things, They would not accept them.
Killed by enemies, poison, or disease, He will be reborn in hell.
And Indrabhuti's Jnanasiddhi[301] says:
He who does not keep the pledges Experiences the misery
Of body, mind, and virtues degenerating, Dies in no time,
And thereafter comes upon the sufferings Of hell for one billion years.
Taking another rebirth,
He will became an untouchable, a wretch, A deaf person, or a mute.
The many tantras of both the Ancient and New traditions unanimously agree that these, and others, are the consequences of violating the pledges.

When is it possible to restore a vow that has been transgressed? All the tantras and transmissions state that if a monk has incurred a defeat with concealment, the [transgressed] vow, like a broken clay pot, cannot be repaired. An awakening mind commitment that has been transgressed is like a cracked gold or silver vase which can still be soldered by a blacksmith. A violated vow or pledge in this Secret Mantra system is likened to a dented golden vessel, which can be straightened out by the practitioner's own strength.

The General Scripture That Gathers All Intentions lists five methods for restoring pledges:
(1) To renew the pledges through action in the case of a serious transgression is to perform one hundred and thirty thousand times, or more, according to the seriousness, the fire offerings or recitation of the mantra [of one's deity].
(2) To renew the pledge through precious substances is to offer, without any sense of loss, one of the [five] gems[302] appropriate to the family whose pledge one has transgressed to a master who is of the caste (untouchable, menial, or another caste) that corresponds to the buddha family whose pledge one has transgressed, while regarding the master as the embodiment of the five buddha families.
(3) To renew the pledge with earnest desire means to confess one's failing with intense regret and shame in a state of clear and longing faith.
(4) To renew the pledge in a state of contemplation means to confess one's failing with the four forces,[303] and while doing so, to imagine that one's negativity and impediments are purified by light rays radiating from the three places of the receptacle [object of refuge].[304] In this technique, one imagines all negativity is consumed by the fire of contemplation, all darkness is dispelled by light emanating from awakening mind, [impediments] are washed away by great waves of altruistic deeds, and so forth.
(5) To renew the pledge by [understanding] transcendent reality means that “through great discriminative wisdom, all [karmic] imprints are understood to be without intrinsic reality,” as is stated in All-Gathering [Awareness].[305] Thus, the perfect means to purify negativity is to cultivate discriminative wisdom that does not objectify the three spheres.
A special means consists in applying the threefold renewal taught in the quintessential instruction of the Great Cleansing Yoga called Emptying the Depths of Hell.[306] Externally, this involves confession and restoration through ritual feast; internally, the basis of one's body [i.e., the aggregates]; and on the secret level, the state of pure presence (Skt. bodhicitta). It is said that to perform this [practice] on the fifteenth, thirtieth, and eighth [days of the lunar month] will purify all pledges that one has transgressed. Therefore, it is a method most worthy of committing oneself to.

The master Subhagavajra[307] enumerates five procedures to be followed:
An individual possessed of great fortune
Forms an awakening mind, assumes its commitments, And receives initiation in the presence of a holy master;
He then observes [the pledges]; learns the nature [of tantra]; Purifies his mind; and engages in purificatory conduct: These, in essence, are the five procedures.
The first of the five is the initiatory procedure, which effects the maturation [of one's mind]. The initiation, gateway to the Secret Mantra, is received when two causes and four conditions are fulfilled. These are the two causes:
(1) The concomitant cause, to be an individual possessing the six elements[308] of the adamantine body that is flawless and has channels, seminal essences, and energy winds, and to have awakened the affinity for the mind of awakening, the causal continuity (tantra) that is without beginning or end;
(2) The contributory cause, fulfilled by the master's correct performance of the construction of the mandala and the actualization and worship [ritual], after having engaged in purification through the familiarization practice, etc.
These are the four conditions:
(1) The causal condition of being a worthy candidate for initiation (who belongs to one of the five classes of disciples such as lotus-like[309]);
(2) The principal condition of there being a qualified master to confer the initiation, who has expertise in the ten outer and inner essential fields [of the tantras[310]], and who has mastered contemplation;
(3) The objective condition of the impeccable coordination of substances, mantra, seals, and contemplation [in the initiatory ritual];
(4) The immediate condition of the maturation [of the disciple's mind stream], effected by the initial stages of vase initiation, etc., and by the progressive conferral of the later initiations.

The second [of the five procedures to be followed] is the procedure of observing the pledges received in the course of an initiation in order to protect the maturation of one's mind. The “life force” of the initiation refers to the individual pledges taught in the Action, Conduct, and Yoga tantras, and especially the modes of conduct, vows, root pledges, and secondary pledges, [the pledges concerning] sustenance, and [the pledges] to be safeguarded as taught in Highest [Tantra] with provisional, definitive, and covert intentions. These should be guarded like one's life and according to one's level of spiritual accomplishment.
The third is the procedure of learning the nature of tantra by listening to the master's teachings. To learn the nature of tantra means to gain knowledge of the actual tantra (the subject matter of tantra) by studying the teachings of the tantras (as they are expressed in words) with a spiritual master who applies the four styles[311] [of tantric explanation]; and to develop discriminating wisdom free of confusion that experientially cultivates that knowledge.
The fourth is the procedure of purifying one's mind, which leads to the attainment of awakening. The purification of the mind and its habitual tendencies is effected in the following way: for a practitioner of the Secret Mantra, the principal aim of all the tantric activities is to nurture the seed or potential for awakening. This seed serves as the primary cause for attaining perfect awakening, the realization of one's objective, and the foundation for the accomplishment of others' objectives. The two liberating phases [of the tantric path] that uproot the three impediments[312] connected with the propensities of the four states[313] serve as contributory conditions. In order to transform everything into the path of awakening, the view to be realized is taken as the foundation.

In the three lower tantras, one endeavors in deity yogas called “with signs” and “without signs” or the signless yoga of reality.[314] In the Highest [Yoga Tantra], one meditates on the stages of creating the supporting [mandala] through the three contemplations,[315] the four branches of familiarization and attainment practice,[316] or the six branches of the visualization,[317] etc. At the end of these practices, one accomplishes the charismatic work of a tantric master, such as recitation and meditation, making food offerings (torma), consecration and fire rituals, etc. Subsequent [to the creation phase], one cultivates the completion stage, reaching perfection in the supported [mandala, i.e., the deities,] through the practice on the side of the appearance [of the deity's form[318]], on the side of emptiness,[319] and the union of these two[320]; or the practice of self-consecration,[321] the mandala circle,[322] and profound indestructible yoga.[323]
The fifth is the procedure of virtuous conduct, which is to engage in the means to perfect the purification of mind. The conduct related to skill in means consists of the “all-shaking avadhuti” conduct intended for a beginner; the “ever-perfect” conduct intended for an advanced practitioner; and the conduct “victorious in all quarters”[324] intended for an accomplished practitioner. Alternatively, the conduct is presented as “using desire”[325] and “training and enjoying desires” associated with the complex, unelaborated, or utterly simple conducts.[326] [To engage in these forms of conduct] enhances [the realization of] the two phases, and one consequently progresses through the four [stages of spiritual development] of the individual.[327]

On the three [stages, small, middling, and great,] of the path of accumulation, one gains the common attainments[328] and an enhanced vividness [of the visualization of the coarse and subtle aspects of the mandala]. Following that, on the “stage of warmth” of the path of preparation, one consolidates the pristine awareness of bliss and emptiness [resulting] from the wind and mind dissolving into the central channel. On the “peak” [stage of the path of preparation], one experiences an uninterrupted vision of the circle of deities of the mandala and attains the [deity's] dimension [that manifests vividly] in the absence of conceptualizations.[329] On the stage of “receptivity,” of the same path, one's manifest eighty natural conceptualizations[330] [temporarily] cease. Enhancing pristine awareness, which has the power to link up to the path of seeing, one reaches the “highest quality” [stage of the path of preparation]. Following this, one practices wandering in the great outer power places,[331] and with respect to the inner [power places], one dissolves channels, winds, and seminal essences into the central channel, reaching the provisional result of the twelve stages. As a result of the proximate cause [of the elaborate, non-elaborate, and simple conduct], one attains the ultimate result of the stage of buddha, the union that requires no more learning,[332] the state of Vajradhara endowed with the sevenfold features of [male and female deity] facing each other,[333] the great lordliness over the inconceivable mystery, the highest and eternal state.
These phases of the path that begin with the three systems of ethics are presented in the form of a synopsis in order to be easily understood. They are discussed in detail in latter parts of this treatise [The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge].

An individual who has assumed the personal liberation vows of the Individual Way is a “holder of one set of vows,” since he or she holds only those vows but not the vows of the higher two systems of ethics. Someone who has assumed the commitments of awakening mind is a “holder of two sets of vows” because the personal liberation vows of the Universal Way and the awakening mind commitments are identical with respect to their essence. A practitioner who has assumed the mantric pledges is a “holder of all three sets of vows” since prior to that he or she must have assumed the personal liberation vows and awakening mind commitments as well.
To elaborate, the three systems of ethics upheld by a monk who is a tantric practitioner exist with identical nature. However, they can be conceptually distinguished in the following way: the discipline of renunciation [of a monk who is a tantric practitioner], in so far as it implies forsaking harmfulness and its [underlying] basis, comprises the [personal] liberation vows. In so far as [such discipline] is accompanied by an altruistic intention, it comprises the awakening mind commitments. In so far as it is accompanied by the skillful means of making the result [buddhahood] the path, it comprises the Secret Mantra pledges.
“Etc.” [in the root verses] refers to individuals who have assumed the three sets of vows in stages, or those who have first assumed one of the two higher vows and subsequently assumed personal liberation vows.

Abhayakara says that the vows are similar in that they share an attitude of restraint
But are distinguished by their forms. The great scholar Vibhutichandra asserts
That the higher vows outshine the lower, while remaining distinct.

Six assertions generally [prevalent] in India are presented in the Key to the Initiation[334]:
(1) The assertion that the personal liberation vows serve as the foundation for awakening mind commitments, and these as the foundation for mantric vows;
(2) The assertion that the lower vows are refined and enhanced by receiving the higher ones;
(3) The assertion that the vows are identical in nature but diversified in that the personal liberation vows are outer vows; the awakening mind commitments, inner; and the mantra vows, secret.
(4) The assertion that the vows are cumulative in that higher ones contain the lower ones;
(5) The assertion that the vows are graded since by receiving the higher ones the lower ones are transformed [into the higher];
(6) The assertion that the vows coexist but are unmixed, each being a complete system in its own right.
Of these, the assertion of Abhayakara and that of Vibhutichandra are most widely known in Tibet at present. Abhayakara asserts that just as various pieces of gold jewelry share the same nature by virtue of being made of gold, but differ in form—a crown, an anklet, a bracelet, etc.— the three ethical systems share the same nature of being [rooted in] an attitude of restraint, but differ in form. Vibhutichandra's Stream of Light on the Three Vows[335] states that the three ethical systems are like the stars, the moon, and the sun, respectively. The higher ones outshine the lower ones, which become hidden. However, each of the three ethical systems has a different essence.

Gampopa states:
[The three ethical systems are] each of a different essence. These must be observed just as prescribed. If faced with a dilemma, the higher takes precedence. The demerit of transgressing a lower vow is outshined by the merit of [observing] the higher. The qualities [of the lower systems] are contained in the higher.
To elaborate, the three kinds of ethical systems differ in their scriptural origins, preceptors, phases, motivations, ceremonies, precepts, causes of loss of vows, benefits of observing vows, possibilities of restoring damaged vows, etc. Therefore, each is of a distinct essence. The form of each is [to prescribe] restraint from what is unwholesome and to cultivate the remedial correct view. Thus, the three are all of the same nature in being [based on] an attitude of restraint, and all three therefore exist for the same purpose: to serve as remedies [for negative emotions and other impediments]. The vows that pertain to the circumstances one encounters, whether these involve forsaking an action or applying a remedy, should be observed just as they are set out in their respective systems.
If faced with the dilemma, for example, of partaking of the pledge
substances at a tantric feast and thus transgressing the discipline of personal liberation or not partaking of them and thus transgressing the tantric conduct, [the observance of] the higher discipline should take precedence. This is so because if one violates the personal liberation vows with a special attitude, [i.e., the mind of awakening,] or with the skill in means [taught in the Secret Mantra], no fault is incurred. The demerit of transgressing lower vows is outshined [by the merit of observing the higher]. Not only is there no failing or downfall incurred from the transgression [of a lower vow], but also the great benefits from observing higher ethics are accrued. Thus, the qualities [of the lower systems] are contained in the higher. These points were asserted by Gampopa and his followers,[336] who include the learned and accomplished masters of the four major and eight minor Kagyu schools,[337] and especially the omniscient and victorious Seventh [Karmapa,] Chödrak Gyatso.

The venerable Drakpa, the omniscient Longchenpa, and others Assert that the individual identities of the ethical systems are
unmixed; each is complete in prescribing both restraint and requirements.
The essence of one vow changes into the next; thus, the qualities of the higher contain the lower.
Special conduct makes them compatible with each other. One should observe the most important in any given circumstance.

The venerable uncle Drakpa Gyaltsen and his nephew[338] of the Sakya school, the omniscient Longchen Rabjampa, and others such as the great translators Rinchen Zangpo, Rongzom Chözang, and their followers make these assertions: (1) the individual identities of the ethical systems are unmixed; (2) each is complete in prescribing restraint and requirements; (3) the essence of one vow changes into the next; (4) the qualities of the higher contain those of the lower; (5) special conduct makes them compatible with each other; (6) in any given circumstance, the most important is observed.
To elaborate, the three ethical systems differ in their preceptors, ceremonies, benefits, etc. Therefore, their individual identities are unmixed. However, the three sets of ethical systems have identical aims with respect to what is to be refrained from and what is required: to relinquish ordinary emotions and to release the fetters of the emotions. Thus, each system is complete in its prescriptions of what to restrain from and what is required.
In the manner of [extracting] copper from copper ore and then preparing with it the elixir that transforms poor metals into gold, if the personal liberation vows are imbued with the awakening mind which is the distinguishing feature of the Universal Way, [they become Universal Way] vows, and if accompanied by the special skill in means and wisdom, they become mantric vows. Thus, one essence changes into the next.

In following the higher ethical systems, the restraints and requirements [in the lower systems] are included in the restraints and requirements of the higher system. The qualities [of the higher system] are thereby contained in the lower.
Therefore, although certain [higher] vows may seem to be incompatible [with lower ones], such is not the case by virtue of their view and special conduct of skill in means.
Moreover, one should observe [the vow] that is most significant in any given situation. The great scholar Pema Wangyal states[339]:
The wise give this advice: when amid a group of people, or when a deed would be naturally unvirtuous,
The lower vows [of the proclaimers] should have precedence.
When no selfish desire is involved, [physical and verbal unvirtuous acts are permitted].
When engaged in tantric activities, or living in solitude, mantric vows [are most important].
If there is no dilemma about which one to follow, guard all without mixing them.
Faced with a dilemma, weigh the act in terms of restraint and requirement.

According to the followers of the Riwo Gedenpa,[340] the three ethical systems are distinct in their styles since each has its own way to assume vows and its own causes of deterioration. [When higher vows are assumed,] the lower [vows] become branches of them, as when a sapphire is placed in a clean jug filled with limpid water, the water reflects the color of the jewel. Thus, the higher system has as its foundation the lower one.
All of the [above] assertions seem to be substantiated by scriptures and reasonings drawn from the different ethical systems.

A vajra holder possessed of three sets of vows, supreme among all mantric adepts, or anyone who has entered the door of the Secret Mantra and who safeguards the pledges and perseveres in the experiential cultivation of the path, will attain the state of Vajradhara in a single lifetime, in the same body. This statement is found again and again in the tantras. Accordingly, the venerable Rangjung [Dorjé] says:
By maintaining the pledges, the best adept
Will accomplish the state of Vajrasattva in one lifetime, And through aspiration alone, will perfect
All common attainment without impediments.
By honoring one's pledges, even those who are not able to apply themselves to practice will attain spiritual accomplishment before long, as stated in the [Secret Treasury of the Dakini] Tantra[341]:
Whoever abides in the vows and pledges
But, hindered by past deeds, cannot practice now Will [certainly] attain realization in another life.
