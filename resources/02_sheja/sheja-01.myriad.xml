Glorious master, your profound and magnificent form is a treasury of abundant benefit for oneself and others.
[Your voice,] the drum of the highest doctrine, [2] resounds throughout space; [your] mind, bliss and emptiness, pervades all existence.
Source of oceans of the inconceivable qualities of enlightenment, your stream of awakened activity is effortless and spontaneous.
Sovereign of the Hundred Families, [3] remain forever as my crown, with your lotus feet touching my head.
Victorious One[4] who has attained the threefold greatness, [5] your symphony heralds the light of day,
Eliminates the darkness of the three worlds, and illuminates the path to liberation.
Lord of the doctrine, king of the doctrine, no one in the universe equals you;
Compassionate Sarvārthasiddha, with great devotion I revere you in thought, word, and deed.
Glorious Buddha born from a lotus, master of the miraculous powers of all the enlightened ones,
Embodiment of wisdom, your immortal form benefits [others] continually for as long as space exists;
Great bliss, adamantine speech, Padmākara[6] with your consort,
Even though I attain awakening, remain forever in the center of the beautiful lotus in my heart.
[Gentle Splendor], your name just falling upon one's ears topples the banners of a million hordes of demons;
Your resplendent sword of wisdom severs all webs of confusion with a single stroke.
Imparting with ease the brilliance of the two understandings, [7] you open the precious door to the ultimate good.
I bow to you, Gentle Splendor, and to your consort: grant me the supreme gift of flawless intelligence.

To the great pioneers appearing in the past, present, and future who illuminate the Buddha's teaching in India and Tibet,
And to those who uphold their instruction lineages,
To all without distinction, I bow a hundred times
With heartfelt devotion, free of all artifice.

Although my intelligence, narrow as the eye of a needle,
Cannot fathom the infinite depths of knowable phenomena,
I will elucidate this text, which summarizes the essential [points of knowledge],
So that those who share my good fortune may easily understand.

No one can estimate the furthest limits of infinite space and of phenomena;
Nevertheless, when a few essential points[8] have been revealed, the nature of all phenomena can be realized.
Thus, in a mere drop of water contained within the vase of an intelligent mind,
The wise taste the sublime flavor of the vast ocean of knowledge.

All [knowledge] verified by scriptural reference and reason
Has been transmitted by authentic guides;
But since those of average intelligence may find it difficult to comprehend,
I shall elucidate the meaning of this work through commentary on its words.

To achieve liberation and omniscience, one must first traverse the ocean of learning. Then, through the wisdom derived from reflection and meditation, one will gradually and without difficulty attain unsurpassable awakening. This is the authentic path clearly revealed by the victorious ones and their heirs.[9]
In order that, at the very least, the entrance to this path may open easily to anyone whose intellect is as limited as mine, I will explain this treatise in three parts: the introduction, which provides the initial benefit of improving one's condition; the main body of the text, which has the subsequent benefit of leading one to freedom; and the conclusion, which has the final benefit of fulfilling the two objectives.[10]

In the land known as White Expanse (India) because it is a vast land where the clothing is predominantly white, or Exalted Land because it is the land where the exalted Buddha appeared, there are four great language groups: Sanskrit (literally “perfected”), Prākṛit (“ordinary”), Apabhraṃśa (“corrupted”), and Piśāci (“demons'”).[1] The title is rendered in the principal one among these, Sanskrit, the divine language.

With regard to its structure, The Encompassment of All Knowledge is a compilation of the essentials from all treatises that present the distinct systems for spiritual development of gods and humans and the Buddha's three- or nine-stage system.[4] [In the title, ] approaches refers to these systems.
In nature, The Encompassment of All Knowledge is a comprehensive collection of the most important explanations from the Transcendent One's own teachings and from the treatises commenting on them. Therefore, this work is called treasury because those precious teachings are contained within it, or because this [treasury] is inherent within [those teachings].
In character, this treatise[5] clearly, thoroughly, and effectively transmits the three trainings of higher ethics, meditation, and wisdom. It has the qualities that enable one to overcome the enemy of emotions, and to protect oneself from [rebirth in] miserable existences. It is distinct from the six [types of] flawed treatises and possesses the qualities of the three [types of] valid treatises.[6]
These latter words, “treatise that effectively transmits the three trainings,” refer principally to the subject matter [of the work].
Just as space makes it possible for an observer to discern objects, the contents of this treatise make it possible for the intellect to discern all objects of knowledge. Therefore, the contents are an encompassment of all knowledge. Alternatively, just as space is the medium through which the universe and beings unfold, this [work] allows the three kinds of wisdom[7] to unfold.
This [part of the title] refers principally to [the words] that convey the contents.

The resident scholars of Vikramaśīla Monastery[8] expounded treatises by making five kinds of essential observations:
(1) Who the author [of the treatise] is
(2) What its scriptural sources are
(3) How it is classified
(4) For whose benefit it is written
(5) What the import of the work as a whole is
These observations may be made with regard to the present work. First, the identity of the author is stated at the end of the work; in the colophon, his various names are stated. The second is explained by [the words of the title, ] compiled from the approaches of all the systems of spiritual development. The third is indicated by [the words] a treasury of precious teachings.
Fourth, there are two [possible motivations for composing such a work]: to benefit oneself or to benefit others. I have not composed this work in response to others' requests. Instead, I have been motivated by the noblest intention to benefit others
and by [the wish] to refine my own understanding of all knowledge. This is implied by the words, the encompassment of all knowledge. Fifth, the nature of the content is conveyed by the words the treatise that effectively transmits the three trainings.

One might question whether it is logical to give a Sanskrit title to a Tibetan treatise because it is not a translation from that language. However, there is no fault in doing so. Such a title is both logical and meaningful because this work is based on the teachings of the Buddha and commentaries originating in India. This is comparable to calling Indian a person who is ethnically Indian but has been born in Tibet.
In doing so, I have imitated the works of the Tibetan scholar Thumi, the writings of the sagacious Longchenpa, and others. Although this is like a firefly [trying to] imitate the sun, there is no wrong in my wish to emulate [these masters] because my intention is pure.

Appropriate circumstances for expressing reverence include to serve a purpose, for a [particular] reason, to resolve contradictory opinions, to respond to a question, and so forth. These words of reverence are written to serve a particular purpose.
The explanation of the purpose served by this reverence is based on the [words] “I bow at the feet.” To whom is reverence expressed? It is expressed to the illustrious and genuine master who embodies the perfection of all refuges. Who is expressing reverence? The author of the treatise is expressing reverence with great devotion in thought, word, and deed. What is the purpose of expressing reverence? Those who read the praise of such a unique individual will develop faith in that person. Furthermore, discerning readers will first develop confidence in the person who expresses such respect, because by doing so, he is following [the example of] authentic masters. Consequently, they will consider the treatise composed by this person worth studying and will do so. The expression of reverence serves the additional purposes of completing the cultivation of merit and pristine wisdom and of preventing interruptions to the completion of the composition. At what point in the treatise is reverence expressed? It is expressed at the beginning of the composition. In what way is reverence expressed? With great devotion in thought, word, and deed.

Sri means “glory,” signifying both non-dual pristine wisdom and the [spiritual master] who should be relied upon. Grounded in the [experience of the union of] emptiness and appearance, the master has travelled the path, using skillful means and wisdom. As a result, he or she “possesses” (-mant) the fruition [of the path], the unity of pristine wisdom and the dimensions of awakening, and leads disciples to the same attainment. Master in [Sanskrit] is guru, which means laden with good qualities, and uttara, [which means] “highest.”
The [Sanskrit] word sat has many meanings, but in this case denotes “genuine.” Since this signifies perfection, [it describes] one who is master of masters. From the King of Tantras[12]:
An illustrious master is one in whose mind and speech the face of the Buddha is present.
The Buddha [referred to in this quote] is Wheel of Time (Kālacakra). His four faces symbolize the four successive empowerments, the fourth of which is the co-emergent pristine wisdom [empowerment]. One who embodies this wisdom is known as an illustrious master since he or she has realized it and reveals it to disciples through speech.
The above words of reverence are addressed to my own spiritual master from whom I have obtained a measure of his kindness [through receiving such instruction]. The words at the feet indicate that I bow [before him] and show reverence with heartfelt devotion.

Completely purified of all the faults of worldly and inferior spiritual ways, you are the embodiment of the ethics of the three disciplines[13] and stand firm as the basis for all good qualities, like the golden foundation of the universe.
Transcending all mental states that exist from the peak of existence downward, you are the embodiment of incalculable contemplations,[14] such as the contemplation that develops courage. Your beauty is a reflection of these contemplations, distinct like the features of [the universe], Mount Meru, the four continents and their islands.
With unmistaken understanding of the general and specific characteristics [of phenomena], you are the embodiment of wisdom, whose realization has penetrated the two kinds of selflessness.[15] You illuminate all phenomena as they are and as they appear, like the brilliance of the sun and moon illuminating the world.
Unrivalled in any way by anyone renowned in the world as a sage, such as Kapila,[16] you are the supreme embodiment of complete liberation, perfect peace without remainder.[17]
Perfected in the four pristine wisdoms,[18] you are the embodiment of the vision of the pristine wisdom of complete liberation. Thus you fulfill your enlightened intentions for the benefit of those to be spiritually transformed in this age of conflict.[19] Recalling your kindness, I revere you with sincere devotion.
These words of reverence explicitly present the three types of training that constitute the principal qualities of a buddha, along with a subsidiary explanation of the five [aspects of] the embodiment of complete purity and a summary of the contents of this treatise.
The three types of training are common denominators in the three systems of spiritual development. The sequence of the three trainings in the words of reverence above corresponds to the tradition most accessible to ordinary people, that of the proclaimers.[20] Therefore, it would have been appropriate for me to compose the commentary, The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge, based on this tradition.[21] [However, my commentary presents the trainings] in the sequence followed by the Buddha's Way [the Universal Way].[22]

First, you developed the mind of supreme awakening, the excellent seed [of enlightenment]. Of the three ways[23] to accomplish this, you chose the path of the shepherd, the awakening mind of [bodhisattvas of] the highest capacity. With this attitude, you protect beings with compassion for as long as they exist, forfeiting your own buddhahood. While on the path, the power of your mind, great as that of a peerless hero, suffused the universe with an ocean of excellent conduct, such as the ten perfections,[24] which no other bodhi-sattva[25] can match, even partly. As the result [of the path], you are father to all the victorious ones, for you were perfectly awakened from the very beginning. Neverthless, you now appear as the youthful son of the Victorious Ones, working for the benefit of others without weariness or woe, until cyclic existence has ceased.
Gentle Splendor, Lion of Speech, grant me and all who hear or teach the doctrine perfect memory and intelligence free from the flaws of attachment and impediment.[26]
This praise mentions briefly the import of the perfections of the Universal Way.

You understand that the ground continuity [for spiritual development]—the potential for awakening and the radiant awareness nature of mind—is naturally present, like a seed, in every sentient being. Thus, you bestow the empowerments that bring them to spiritual maturity and impart the instructions that liberate them. In these distinctive ways, you nurture their [potential] for freedom.
You cause others to attain the realizations of the path through [their practice of] the two phases of creation and completion, the path continuity. Consequently, they purify all their incidental defilements—experienced, but without intrinsic reality—of emotions, cognitive obscurations, and [the obscuration to] transition.[27]
You bestow or cause others to attain in their present lifetimes the fruition continuity, the four dimensions of awak-ening[28] distinguished by great bliss.
To you, master of indestructible reality, my principal mentor and spiritual guide who is kind in these three ways, and to the masters of the lineages of the three disciplines, I bow with heartfelt devotion.
This [homage] presents all the stages of the path of the Way of Indestructible Reality.

I lack both the natural and acquired wisdom gained from learning, reflection, and meditation, and I do not have even the slightest fraction of the intellectual capacity [required to]
compile correctly the vastness of knowledge. Therefore, I am not worthy to compose this work. Nevertheless, individuals debased by these degenerate times have resorted to corrupt forms of livelihood, using the Three Jewels[29] for their own ends, and have little knowledge or diligence. Seeing this, I have been motivated by the noble intention to benefit myself and others, who like me have neither sufficient good fortune nor power of intelligence to comprehend even minor texts, [30] let alone the voluminous scriptures of the Buddha.
Due to good propensities developed in the past, we have landed on this treasure-island of precious discourses and tantras. To ensure that not even a fraction of this opportunity to understand, experience, and realize be lost, I hereby resolve to compose a short explanatory text on a vast subject. It will be clear because the words and their meanings will be easy to understand. In only a few verses, I will discuss exhaustively all fields of knowledge.

The master Vasubandhu instructed [his students] to include five elements when composing a treatise. [As stated in his Principles of Elucidation][31]:
The following should be expressed:
The purpose, a synopsis,
An explanation, connections,
And counter-arguments.
The first element presented should be the purpose of the treatise. A synopsis should then summarize what fulfills that purpose, while the explanation itself presents in detail the meaning of [what is summarized in] the synopsis. The connections, which should not contradict the sequence [of the subjects], and counter-arguments, which should not contradict reason, are discussed wherever appropriate.
For the first of these, [purpose, Vasubandhu presented] an elaborate analysis of the purpose, the connections, [etc., ] in which each of the four points are divided into three parts. Presented here is a condensation of this [twelve-part] scheme into four [main components (subject matter, purpose, ultimate purpose, and connections) applied to this work]:
First is the subject matter: This treatise [presents] a comprehensive description of the realms where those to be spiritually guided live; their guide, the Buddha, and his teaching; the fields that constitute the progressive practice of the [Buddha's] teachings—ethics, learning, reflection, and meditation; and the complete fruition of travelling the path, the achievement of freedom.
Second is the purpose: By studying and expounding these subjects, one becomes well-versed in them. This education results in the wisdom that allows one to understand the levels of the Buddha's teachings and his systems for spiritual development. This understanding in turn facilitates the development of the authentic wisdom born from reflection and meditation.
Third is the ultimate purpose: Through this [wisdom], one easily attains the state of freedom and omniscience.
Fourth are the connections: The ultimate purpose is connected with the purpose, and the purpose with the subject matter. Each is related in turn to that which precedes it.

Book IV. Extent of the spread and flourishing of the doctrine in this supreme Land of Jambu
Book V. Training in and maintaining of the ethical systems of personal liberation, of awakening mind, and of mantra, these being the initial stages of spiritual practice while the Buddha's doctrine remains in the world

The brief overview of the work [The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge] includes four points: the subject of each division, the specification of number, the order, and a synopsis.
The first, [the subject of each division, ] will be explained extensively in the individual chapters of the divisions which follow.
Second, the fields of knowledge that should be known by novices — those unfamiliar with these subjects — are presented in ten divisions within this work. These are enhanced by a structure of four chapters each. The number is specific because more [chapters are] unnecessary, and fewer would not be comprehensive.
Third, the justification for such a systematic order is [evident in the enumeration of the books] as outlined above.
Fourth, these forty chapters together comprise an explanation of the three trainings. Training in higher ethics is explained by the fifth division; training in wisdom, by the sixth and seventh; and training in meditation, principally by the eighth. The first through the fourth divisions are branches of training in wisdom. The ninth and tenth are related to the eighth division because [their subjects] are derived from the perfection of [meditation].
Therefore, [it is fitting] that this [work] be called “a treatise that effectively transmits the three trainings.”

For as long as infinite space and the countless dispositions of sentient beings exist, the compassionate strength of the victorious ones [buddhas] and the actions and emotions of beings will never end. The [variety of] characters and dispositions of beings (those to be guided to enlightenment) and the expressions of the compassion of buddhas (those who guide them) manifest fully due to the inconceivable power of natural interconnections.
By way of explanation, sentient beings [are unaware[1] of the pure nature] of the [mind's] sphere of reality.[2] Consequently, their characters and dispositions [begin to manifest]. That is to say, instinctive unawareness acts as the principal cause and adventitious conceptualization as the contributing factor in activating the propensities of beings. Craving and grasping cause beings to form a connection with the three realms.[3]
The compassion of buddhas arises in response to this: inconceivable configurations of realms and the dimensions of awakening within those realms manifest spontaneously and effortlessly. The [buddhas'] methods of guiding beings, such as the four great miracles[4] perceived by all, arise in an immeasurable and inconceivable display.

The sphere of reality, the sphere of vision of each of the joyful ones, [5] completely transcends the limited domain of thought, expression, etc., and can be neither measured nor located. It never becomes anything other than itself, even to the slightest degree, nor is it affected by any other substance. At the same time, various causes and conditions — the blessings of the transcendent ones, [6] the extraordinary vows made by bodhisattvas to purify realms, the convergence of sentient beings' multitudinous actions, and natural law — cause oceans of realms to appear. The Flower Ornament Scripture[7] states:
The boundless oceans of realms that I have described Have been purified by the Illuminator's own qualities.
This buddha's world of pristine wisdom is inconceivable,
As are his blessings and miraculous displays.
The bodhisattvas' inconceivable oceans of vows,
Cultivated in response to the inclinations of [beings],
And the inconceivable oceans of beings' actions Cause oceans of realms to manifest in all directions.
The miraculous powers of the bodhisattvas
And their intention to attain omniscience
Cause their oceans of vows to reach fulfillment
And limitless realms to appear throughout infinite space.
While cultivating boundless oceans of excellent conduct, [Bodhisattvas] enter the infinite sphere of the joyful ones.
They spend endless eons in each realm
And purify all oceans of realms in all directions.
Actions generated by the inconceivable range of beings' mentalities
Cause oceans of realms to arise.

Enlightenment is attained when the naturally pure sphere of reality [of the mind] is freed of adventitious defilement, and the sphere of reality becomes inseparable from pristine wisdom. The place where this occurs is called Unsurpassed.[8] It is not limited to any one place or direction, just as the images of one's dream are experienced wherever one falls asleep.
The “Unsurpassed” place of enlightenment is not part of the confused, habitual experience of unenlightened beings, but transcends [everything experienced] in the three realms. This natural expression [of enlightenment] is a pure realm and has a celestial palace of pristine wisdom, without direction or division, adorned with an endless array of ornaments. Clouds of offerings and adornments of complete enjoyment appear naturally and fill all space.
In this place so “richly adorned” dwells the expression of the effortless complete enjoyment of all buddhas, known as Illuminator, Appearing Everywhere, Great Glacial Lake of Wisdom. Each pore of his body contains hundreds of billions of realms, not to mention the infinite oceans of realms that exist within his whole body. Moreover, realms as numerous as the atoms in the [entire] realm appear within each atom [of each realm]. Infinite oceans of [Illuminator's] forms appear within his one form. Each form appears as though it were pervading all of the infinite oceans of his forms and realms. This exists by virtue of a great miracle that transcends the sphere of [ordinary] experience. [The Prayer for Excellence[9]] states:
In as little as [the space of] a hair-breadth in every region without exception,
Rest oceans of buddhas and oceans of realms,
As many as exist throughout all time.
As I engage in [excellent] conduct for an ocean of eons,
I resolve to enter them all!

First, distinctions according to location [and configuration]: The Flower Ornament Scripture[10] states:
Some oceans of realms of pure light rest within the infinity of space;
Others have a luminous nature and rest in oceans of jewels. Further:
Many oceans of realms exceed all boundaries and rest in a vast sea of lotuses.
Further:
Vast oceans of realms rest within the buddhas' blessing.
The existence of these realms depends upon the four elements, the actions of sentient beings, the blessings of the buddhas, and so forth. These realms appear in a variety of configurations such as intersecting, upside-down, and right-side-up.
Second, distinctions according to shape[11]:
Some realms are round, some are triangular,
Some appear square,
Some are [shaped like] eight-spoked wheels, jewels, or lotuses;
All are designed by the oceans of actions [of beings].
Third, [distinctions according to] size:
Each of the ten world-systems from Saffron Banner up to Resplendent Lotus increases in size and qualities by factors of ten. [Certain realms] that are manifesting now, such as Delightful[12] and Blissful, [13] are vast, whereas our own realm,
Endurance, and even more so Thumb-Size[14] (the realm of the buddha called Delight in Stars), and other [realms], are extremely small. The realm of All-Seeing Guide that will manifest in the future, Pure Cluster, will be immeasurably vast. There are many [descriptions] such as these.

<d e="2">
Fourth, [distinctions according to] duration[15]:
Some realms [endure] for just an eon,
Some for ten eons,
Some realms are said [to endure
For] ten million eons times the number of their particles.
Fifth, distinctions according to the arrangements of the decorations[16]:
Some realms are richly embellished With the millions of realm-adornments.
These diversified ornaments of various styles Appear as myriad optical illusions.
Some distinctions according to the presence of buddhas are expressed in these words[17]:
In some realms, there are no buddhas;
In some realms, there are buddhas;
In some realms, there is one buddha;
In some, many buddhas.
[Concerning distinctions according to] light, [18]
In some realms, there is no light.
Beginning with this reference to realms that are dark, fearsome, and terrifying, there follows[19]:
In some, the light of the gods,
Similarly, [20] [some realms are illuminated by]
... the light of palaces,
... the light of the sun and moon,
... natural light, light of trees,
... light of mountains,
... light of jewels,
... light of lamps,
... light of buddhas.
Further[21]
In some realms, there is the light of lotuses.
And:
In [others], the light of fragrant waters.
And:
These realms have been purified through the power of bodhisattvas' vows.
Whether or not [a world-system] comprises four continents forms another distinction. Our own third-order thousand world-system[22] is divided into many four-continent [world-systems], whereas Blissful, as well as some other realms, are flat like the palm of a hand. Among those that comprise [four continents], there are many different sizes [of continents].
There are also distinctions regarding enjoyment. In Truly Joyous, for instance, the gods wish to be human. The massive mountain [that forms the axis of a four-continent world-system] can differ [from one realm to another]. Differences also exist In the forms of life: some beings have emotions, while others embody purity, and so on. Worlds exist in an inconceivable variety of ways.

The extent of the realm Flower-Filled World is determined in the following way:
First of all, the area that includes the four continents, Mount Meru, and the outer rim of mountains — everything from the underlying configuration ofwind[24] up to Unsurpassed, the peak of existence — is referred to as a four-continent world-system. An identical world-system is located in space at a distance of one thousand times the magnitude of that world-system. A total of one thousand such world-systems [evenly distributed in space], encircled by a rim, is referred to as a first-order thousand world-system. This considered as a single unit, replicated one thousand times and surrounded by a perimeter, is referred to as a second-order thousand world-system. One thousand [second-order thousand world-systems] enclosed by a great rim is called a third-order thousand world-system. Thus, one billion four-continent world-systems is called one great thousand third-order thousand world-system.
(Although teachers of phenomenology[25] base their calculations on the area from the heaven [called] The Pure downwards, the description given here is based on the Marvellous Life of the Buddha, the Pure Golden Light Scripture, and other sources. )
The total number of world-systems comprising one Flower-Filled World is calculated by progressively multiplying by factors of one billion: One billion great thousand third-order thousand world-systems constitutes the world-system Infinite Links. A billion of those is the world-system Infinite Continuums. A billion of those is the world-system Oceanic Infinity. One billion of those is the extent of one Flower-Filled World. Each world-system rests on its own great ocean and is encircled by a rim. At the same time, one great rim encircles them all.
One [arrangement] of such dimension constitutes the sphere of influence of a single supreme manifest dimension of awakening. To those of limited intelligence, [the sphere of influence] is taught to be only a third-order thousand world-system.

Within the great outer rim of that [arrangement of one] Flower-Filled World are the indescribable oceans of fragrant waters [descending from] the body of Great Glacial Lake, as numerous as the particles in all the buddha realms. In the center of these oceans are seas of scented waters filled with beautiful anthers on which rest four immense jewelled lotuses.
A tiered arrangement of twenty-five world-systems is supported by these [lotuses]. In the spaces between each [of these world-systems] are infinite tiers of world-systems, which define their boundaries. The thirteenth of these [twenty-five world-systems] is our own third-order thousand world-system, known as Endurance.
The Sanskrit term for Endurance is sahā, which denotes possession, forbearance, or capacity. All sentient beings who have taken birth in this realm endure emotions and sufferings. In other words, beings possess these [afflictions] in great measure. “Endurance” also signifies the forbearance of hardship. The bodhisattvas of this realm patiently endure [hardship] with exceptional courage and excel in bravery. Thus, this realm is known as Endurance.

This is a single form whose vast emanations appear throughout all the Unsurpassed realms in the pure domains and teach the Dharma in the midst of all the powerful [bodhisattvas].[26] The Centrist scholar Dharmamitra explains[27]:
This form, differentiated [from others] by vows, the power of cultivation [of merit and pristine wisdom], and intention, has attained complete enlightenment in one Unsurpassed domain alone. Therefore, the myriad forms of the enjoyment dimension of awakening that dwell in all the [other] Unsurpassed realms are solely his apparition manifesting in a vast [display].[28]

The view most widely shared by Buddhist systems is that [the worlds within] any single third-order thousand world-system are formed together and destroyed [together]. Another view states that all the realms of the emanations of a single supreme manifest dimension of awakening (such as the oceans of realms that are located in the Flower-Filled World) are formed and destroyed together. The magnitude of this latter view is unfathomable to proclaimers and others; it remains the domain of experience solely of the lord [bodhisattvas] of the tenth stage [of awakening].

The collective actions of beings and the power of the vows to purify realms[3] made by the bodhisattvas of the present Fortunate Age produced the following sequence of events:
After the previous age had reached completion and the twenty intermediate ages [that constitute] the age of vacuity had elapsed, winds arose from each of the ten directions.[4] The powerful convergence and compression of these winds created a configuration of wind in the shape of a cross — solid, extremely hard, and indestructible. In the space above the wind, a thick cloud resembling a golden yoke formed. From this cloud, rain fell continuously over a long period of time. The size of raindrops ranged from large [ones to raindrops as big as the diameter of] the main shaft of a chariot. This deluge produced an immense mass of water, supported by the wind. At the center of this great ocean, a thousand golden lotuses appeared. Upon seeing this, the gods and goddesses of the pure domains[5] knew it to be a sign that one thousand buddhas would appear, and so they declared: “How wonderful! This is the dawn of the Fortunate Age!” According to the White Lotus of Compassion Scripture, this age is known as a fortunate one because the gods and goddesses made this announcement. Similarly, the Blossomed Wisdom Scripture refers to this age as “the age when one thousand lotuses are seen.”

The churning of the great mass of water by the wind produced a golden foundation[6] above the water while rain continued to fall uninterruptedly. As a result, a great outer ocean [which contained various elements] formed above the golden disc. Intense churning of the ocean by winds [arising from] various directions gradually developed the three grades of elements— superior, medium, and base. The superior elements became the central, massive Mount Meru, which is made of four precious substances. The elements of medium quality formed the seven ranges of golden mountains. The base elements formed the four continents, surrounded by the eight neighboring islands and many other islands, as well as the outer rim of iron mountains.
On this subject, the master Vasubandhu explains in detail that the waters [of the ocean] contained only various potentials for the elements, [not the actual elements]. When these seeds were driven apart by winds with special agencies, the different types [of elements] were produced.

Four [square] slabs form four tiers of terraces around Mount Meru, beginning at sea level and reaching halfway up its height.

Why is the Land of Jambu known by this name? Situated to the north of the center[10] of the Exalted Land (India), in the region beyond nine black mountain ranges, stands a snow-peaked mountain range called the Snowy Mountains” and further north, the Fragrant Mountain Range.[12] Between these two mountain ranges lies a lake that is the dwelling place of the nāga king, Cool. The lake itself is known as Cool[13] for [this reason: ] In the past, a brahmin named Seer [encouraged a wheel-monarch[14]] to make offerings in order to attain [rebirth as] a god or as a wheel-monarch. [During a twelve-year period of cooking rice for offerings, ] the wheel-monarch poured the warm rice-water [into a pit] where it [eventually] lost its warmth. Cool Lake formed [from this cooled rice-water]. The lake, the source of all rivers, forests, jewels, and medicines, is fifty leagues in depth and breadth.
The four cascades issue from mouths on each of the four sides of the lake. On the eastern side, from a cliff shaped like an elephant's head, falls the river Gaṅga, drawing along with it silver particles. On the southern side, from a cliff the shape of a bull's head, falls the river Sindhu, carrying particles of blue beryl. On the western side, from a cliff the shape of a horse's head, falls the river Vakṣu, carrying crystal particles. On the northern side, from a rock the shape of a lion's head, the river Sītā[15] descends, carrying gold particles. Moreover, each of these four rivers has five hundred tributaries, and all flow seven times in a clockwise direction around Cool Lake before continuing in the four directions toward the great ocean.
At the shore of the lake stands a fruit tree called the jambu,[16] which bears a sweet fruit the size of a clay pot, named “jambu” from the sound made by the ripened fruit falling into the water. Since this continent is adorned by this tree, it is known as the Land of Jambu. It is said that the nāga kings, appearing as fish, eat the jambu fruit; what remains uneaten becomes the gold of the rivers of Jambu.

<d e="2">
Of the six kinds of beings, the human realm has been discussed [above]; a description of the three miserable existences now follows:
The hells and [the world of] the starving spirits[18] are located mainly below the surface of the earth. The eight hot hells are situated [in the lowest positions]. The most intense hot hell, Ceaseless Torture, is located twenty thousand leagues below the Land of Jambu. Above this hell, the other seven hot hells are situated one above the other: Extreme Heat, Heat, Loud Shrieking, Shrieking, Crushing, Black Lines, and Reviving.
On each of the four sides of each of the eight hells are the four neighboring hells: [1] Pit of Live Embers, [2] Swamp of Filth, [3] Road of Razor Blades, [Forest with] Leaves Like Swords, Forest of Iron Spikes, and [4] River Without Ford.
The eight cold hells are located beyond the neighboring hells. Their names are Blistering, Blisters Bursting, Teeth Chattering, Moaning with Cold, Wailing with Cold, Splitting Like a Blue Lotus, Splitting Like a Lotus, Splitting Widely Like a [Great] Lotus.
Since the continents resemble piles of grain, much larger at the bottom, there is no inconsistency in accommodating these [hells below this Land of Jambu]. Moreover, it is unnecessary to strictly define the size of these formations since the hells, according to the Universal Way, are simply projections of one's own mind.
Hells of shorter duration may be either isolated from one another or clustered together and have no fixed location. Their variety is due to specific acts particular to an individual.

</d>
<d e="2">
The Sanskrit word for hell, naraka, is constructed by affixing the negative particle na to the word raka, which means “pleasurable.” This implies that there is no vestige of pleasure [in the hells]. Alternatively, if raka is interpreted as “to take,” [the term] means “hell” because one is led there as a consequence of unwholesome actions.
The king of the starving spirits, Lord of the Dead, lives five hundred leagues below the Land of Jambu. According to the Great Mindfulness Scripture, he rules over thirty-six [types of] starving spirits: those with drooping stomachs, those with mouths as minute as the eye of a needle, etc. [The abode of the Lord of the Dead] is their principal habitat, but they live in many other places. Furthermore, [the Mindfulness Scripture states that] some starving spirits who possess miraculous powers (such as the demi-gods who are classified as starving spirits) experience splendorous lives like those of the gods.
The Tibetan term for starving spirit, yi dwags, corresponds to the [Sanskrit] preta. Preta means completely gone, in other words, departed [from this life] without possibility of return. Alternatively, [yi dwags denotes] suffering greatly from hunger and thirst.

Animals inhabit the sky, the water, and vast stretches of the earth. Their principal habitat, however, is the great ocean where animals such as nāgas inhabit the depths, living [crowded together], like fermenting grains of beer.
[The abode of] the demi-gods is not explicitly mentioned in Vasubandhu's Treasury of Phenomenology. However, the Great Mindfulness Scripture states that the demi-gods dwell in crevices in the base of Mount Meru below the water level. A particular kind of demi-god classified as an animal lives at the bottom of the ocean; the chief demi-gods — Rāhu, Garland Necklace, and others—live at [different] levels above the ocean floor.

<d e="2">
The [Tibetan] term for animal, dud 'gro, means “moving stooped over,” because animals move around in a bent-over position. The [Sanskrit] word tiras [from which tiryañc (animal) is derived] seems to refer to the predominant postures for locomotion since the term denotes being bent over, crooked, or horizontal.

</d>
<d e="2">
The Tibetan term for demi-god, lha min, is derived from the [Sanskrit] asura, meaning “deprived of the essence.” The demigods are said to lack the ambrosia of the gods. Alternatively, sura means “god,” to which the negative particle a is affixed to imply inferiority, [i. e., less than a god].

In brief, the beings [commonly associated] with environments from the hell-realm to this level of heaven may dwell in various other unspecified secondary abodes.

The heaven known as the Thirty-three [Groups of] Gods is located on the summit of the massive Meru. The chiefs of these Thirty-three Groups are enumerated as follows: the eight gods of wealth, the two Aśvīns, the eleven wrathful ones, and the twelve suns. One of the twelve suns, Śakra[20] himself, rules as the principal chief—the Powerful One—of the [Thirty-three]; the remaining thirty-two lesser chiefs are designated by the title Nearly as Powerful.
The Thirty-three Groups of Gods constituting this heaven are enumerated in the Great Mindfulness Scripture[21] as follows:
Dwelling at [the Assembly Hall of the] Excellent Law [1], on the Heights [2], at the Peak of the Mountain [3], and at the Place of Auspicious Vision [4];
Dwelling in One Region [5], in the Cluster of Trees [6], and in the Park of Various Chariots [7];
Dwelling at Delightful [8], at Beautiful [9], by the All-gathering [Tree] [10];

Indra's court, the Victorious Residence, stands at the centre [of this heaven]. This palace is four-sided; each side is fifty leagues [wide] and four and one half high. One hundred and one jewelled turrets encircle the palace. [The palace grounds] are encompassed by a golden wall, each side of which extends two thousand five hundred leagues wide and one and a half leagues high. The ground, as soft as cotton, is made of gold beautified by an assortment of jewels of a hundred and one different hues. Sixteen thousand jewelled columns delineate the terraces [of the palace]. Above them, beams and cross-members support the protecting roofs. Five hundred armored young gods stand guard at each of the gates in the four directions. The palace and its grounds, the four great highways, and many smaller roads are all located within the city called Lovely.
The Park of Various Chariots is found to the east of the city; the Park of Armory, to the south; the Park of Various Activities, to the west; and the Park of Delights, to the north. All four parks are one thousand leagues in circumference. Playing fields [border these parks].
Beyond these parks and northeast of Lovely grows the Allgathering Tree. This tree, the source of the fulfillment of all wishes, grows to a height of one hundred leagues and has branches that reach fifty leagues in length. Its roots extend fifty leagues under the earth. Below the tree lies a square stone slab known as Armoniga, [22] which looks like a white blanket. Each of its sides is fifty leagues long, making it two hundred leagues in perimeter.
The circular Gathering Place Where the Gods Hear the Excellent Law, nine hundred leagues in circumference, is located southwest of Lovely. In its center is the golden throne on which Indra teaches the law of the gods and the seats arranged for the thirty-two Nearly as Powerful chiefs.
Moreover, astounding things are found in this heaven, such as the drumbeat that naturally reverberates with the [sound that proclaims the] four insignia of the Buddhist teaching, [23] urging the gods away from unwholesome ways; the vase of ambrosia which protects the gods from sickness, aging, and untimely death; the elephants [called] Sturdy and Son of the Land Guardian; the horse called Thunder-Cloud with hundreds and thousands of attendants. Secretive yakṣas[24] known as vajra-holders reside on four mounds [located at the comers of the top of Mount Meru].

Above the heaven of the Thirty-three, gods live on levels one above the other, supported by magnificent divine riches resembling cloud formations in the sky. [These riches, ] celestial palaces and so on, have been created by the previous actions particular to each type of god.
On the first of these levels is Free From Conflict, which, although included within the desire realm, remains free from any conflict with the demi-gods. This [level] is also called Twins: the gods here are born (in the miraculous mode of birth)[25] in pairs. Above Free From Conflict are located the other heavens of the desire realm: Joyful, where the gods are [filled] with joy [at hearing] the teaching of the victorious one, Invincible[26]; Enjoying Creations, where the gods can freely enjoy pleasures that they themselves have created; and Mastery Over Others' Creations, where the gods have power over the enjoyments that other gods have created. These [four, along with the heaven of the four Great Kings and the Thirty-three], constitute the six classes of gods of the desire realm.

The sixteen heavens of the form realm,[27] [beginning with] Group of the Pure, are situated above the desire realm and are tiered one above the other. The heaven called Lesser Unsurpassed is located above all of these, for a total of seventeen classes of form realm heavens. These seventeen, [grouped according to the four levels of meditative concentration of their respective resident gods], are described here in ascending order, beginning with the first level of meditative concentration.
The first level comprises three heavens: Group of the Pure, Priests of Brahmā, [28] and Great Pure Ones. Group of the Pure is called “pure” because the gods there have eradicated evil and non-virtue, and “group” because they are considered collectively. Priests of Brahma is so named because the gods there recite prayers before Brahma. Great Pure Ones, lords of this third-order thousand Endurance World-System, surpass others in terms of lifespan, physical dimensions, and so on, due to their great virtue.

Three heavens are found within the second level of meditative concentration: Dim Light, Measureless Light, and Clear Light. In Dim Light, both the magnitude and the strength of the light seem feeble compared to those of higher heavens. In Measureless Light, the magnitude of light appears immeasurably greater than that of lower heavens. In Clear Light, the magnitude and brilliance of the light illuminates all other heavens [below].
The third level of meditative concentration is composed of three heavens: Lesser Virtue, Limitless Virtue, and Flourishing Virtue. Lesser Virtue is so named because the bliss of the gods at this level of meditative concentration is completely peaceful, hence “virtuous,” but less than that of the higher levels, hence “lesser.” In Limitless Virtue, the bliss is immeasurably greater than that of lower levels. In Flourishing Virtue, the bliss of the gods increases greatly; no class of gods embodies greater virtue than this one.

The fourth level of meditative concentration is divided into [eight heavens]: Cloudless, Merit-Born, Great Result, Not Greater, Without Distress, Manifest Richness, Good Vision, and Unsurpassed. The first three are the heavens of ordinary beings: Cloudless lacks a basis of billowing, clustering clouds [that all the other heavens have]. Gods are born in Merit-Born due to the merit of their unwavering [contemplation].[29] In Great Result, the conditions of life (“the result”) are superior to those of ordinary beings in other heavens.
[The latter five heavens are the] “pure domains.” Not Greater has no qualities greater than those of the higher pure heavens. Owing to their attainment of a unique state of contemplation, the gods of Without Distress remain free of the distress of emotions and regret. Manifest Richness reflects perfect tranquillity and unmatched beauty. In Good Vision, the gods' outlook or vision is correct and good. Unsurpassed is so called because within this group of heavens no other heaven surpasses the qualities of this one. This heaven is also known as Final Gathering since it is the final form composed of particles of matter.
It is said that all gods who do not possess the power of discernment inhabit one area of Great Result. The gods of the fourth meditative concentration who share a common environment do not share a common fate: each god undergoes a solitary birth and death, including [the appearance and dissolution of] the celestial palace and possessions. Within the fourth level of meditative concentration, Not Greater to Unsurpassed are known as the pure domains because only exalted ones[30] are born there. Many scriptures, such as the Descent into Lanka Scripture, as well as some tantras, concur that Unsurpassed is the abode of the enjoyment dimension of awakening. Moreover, Asaṇga's Five Treatises on the Stages states that the Place of the Great Lords, where [bodhisattvas] who have attained mastery of the tenth stage [of awakening] take birth, is located above Unsurpassed.

The dimensions and shapes of these realms are all precisely described in the Buddha's teaching on phenomenology and in other sources. Generally speaking, however, [most sources] maintain that the heavens double in size in ascending order and are proportionally more magnificent in terms of power and wealth.
The term “god” in Sanskrit, divaukas, denotes sky dwellers or dwelling in the higher realms because the homes of these gods are in the higher realms. Another Sanskrit word for god is deva, meaning play or sport, since gods frolic about, amusing themselves.

The precise arrangement of just a single second-order thousand world-system or the great thousand third-order thousand world-system as explained above is fathomed by the sublime vision of the exalted proclaimers and solitary sages. Beyond that, the configuration of the realms of the Infinite Oceans world-system remains the field of experience solely of buddhas and the bodhisattvas who have attained the pure stages.[31] [The Treasury of Phenomenology] states:
The saintly [proclaimers], [32] the rhinoceros [-like solitary sages], [33] and the buddhas
Have seen, [respectively, ] the second-order thousand, third-order thousand, and countless world-systems.
The proclaimers and solitary sages assert that the coarse environmental world is composed of an agglomerate formed of the eight constituents of particles, that is, the indivisible minute particles of the four [elements] — earth, water, fire, wind — as well as smell, taste, texture, and form. However, they do not share the opinion held by some non-Buddhists[34] that infinitesimal, indivisible particles of matter remain in empty space following the destruction [of the world-system] of the previous age. Rather, they assert that the collective actions of beings who are to take birth in this world-system produce energy-winds capable of generating the manifold [world] as their coarse result. Thus, they consider these energy-winds to be the initial cause [for the creation of the world]. This view and others will be discussed in detail below (in Chapter Four).

From beginningless time, every sentient being has been in a state of delusion. This instinctive unawareness of the nature of being serves as the concomitant cause that activates the propensity for dualistic experience. This causes a being to wander astray in the three realms [of existence].
Initially, the four levels of absorption[36] of the formless realm come into existence (beginning with Neither [Discernment] nor No [Discernment]) followed sequentially by the form realm and the desire realm. In short, beings diffuse from higher forms of life to lower; thus, all the [different] realms, from the highest down to the hells, come into existence.

The formless realm refers to the four levels of meditative absorption.
Some masters discuss these four levels in descending order, in keeping with the way beings first take birth [and then diffuse downward throughout] cyclic existence. Although that approach is appropriate, the four levels are presented here in ascending order to facilitate understanding.
When an individual first achieves contemplative absorption, the thought occurs, “This is infinite like space.” Once this experience arises, it grows and develops. This path results in a birth having the same name, Absorption of Infinite Space. The other three levels follow the same pattern: the Absorption of Infinite Consciousness is so named because of the initial thought, “This is infinite consciousness.” The Absorption of Nothing Whatever is so named because of the initial thought, “This is nothing at all.” The Absorption of Neither Discernment nor No Discernment is so named because of a feeble discernment, an initial thought: “Discernment is like a sickness, tumor, or pain; no discernment is total numbness.”
During the period of the initial delusion [in which beings do not recognize their own natures] that impels them to take birth in the three realms, beings move from the highest [levels] of the formless realm levels down to the lowest. Subsequently, as beings take birth within the various realms of cyclic life, they are born wherever appropriate, according to which of the four meditative absorptions they developed in a previous existence. Some individuals who have attained the highest [of the four levels] gradually descend from one level to the one below. Others may move from whatever [state] they have attained to any other form of existence. These changes do not follow any fixed pattern.
Generally speaking, however, the majority of beings who attain the four [levels] of this formless realm fall gradually lower and lower. [This process takes place as follows]: When a god [of the highest level] dies, the contemplation of Neither Discernment nor No Discernment—the peak of existence—dissolves, and the discernment of Nothing Whatever arises. This absorption is slightly coarser than the previous one. Since that experience feels blissful, attachment to that state develops and the god falls to that level.

In the same way, at the time of death of [a god in the Infinite] Consciousness [realm], the consciousness of Infinite Space arises. That experience causes the god to be born in the equivalent state. This occurs because long habituation to abiding in a specific state of contemplation facilitates re-entering that state of mind.
The gods of the four formless levels described here are classified simply according to differences in their contemplation rather than according to higher and lower locations since they have neither fixed locations nor physical forms of particular sizes. Wherever a being achieves a [specific] state of absorption, that being attains the same state after death in the same place.
Some specialists in phenomenology assert that the formless levels do have forms and locations in a tiered arrangement above Unsurpassed. They contend that the expression “formless” is a term used simply as a negation of inferior states. Further, the Flower Ornament Scripture makes repeated use of terms that imply that the formless realm has physical structure. For example[37]:
The formless realm has location,... a basis,... an environment, ... and shape.
Similarly, according to Vimalamitra and Padmasaṃbhava, and according to the views expressed in Early Translation[38] texts such as the Great Array: The Tantra of Supreme Wish-Fulfillment, four [realms] such as Sky of Tiered Lotuses are located in space high above the form realm, and these serve as the basis for the forms of beings absorbed in contemplation.

The realm of form is so named because beings within it are free from the attachment endemic to the desire realm but still have attachment to form. This realm's seventeen heavens can be grouped into what are known as the four levels of meditative concentration. Five pure domains — Unsurpassed, etc. — and three heavens for ordinary beings, such as Great Result, are located at the fourth and highest level of meditative concentration. As previously described, three heavens are located at each of the three lower levels of meditative concentrations: Flourishing Virtue, etc., at the third; Clear Light, etc., at the second; and Great Pure Ones, etc., at the first.
At the beginning of the formation of a [new] world, if the previous world has been destroyed by fire, a god of the second level of meditative concentration dies and takes birth in the empty celestial residence of Brahma [that is, on the first level]. From that point onward, beings diffuse progressively [throughout the realms] in descending order, so that all realms of existence from Priests of Brahma and Group of the Pure down to and including the hells [fill with life]. In the case of the previous world having been destroyed by water, [this process] begins by [a god] of the third level of contemplation being born at the level below, and so on.

The desire realm is so named because beings of this realm are preoccupied with sensual pleasures, mainly sexual intercourse, and crave coarse foods.[39] It comprises the six classes of desire realm gods (dwelling in Mastery Over Others' Creations and the others), the [beings that inhabit] the four great continents (Unpleasant Sound, Bountiful Cow, Majestic Body, Land of Jambu) and their eight islands, and the eighteen [types of beings in the] miserable existences (the animals, the starving spirits, and the beings of the eight hot and the eight cold hells. ) Together these are known as thirty-six types of beings of the desire realm.

In other classifications, the gods of the six heavens of the desire realm and the humans of the four continents constitute the “ten happy existences.” The [beings of the] eight hells, the animals, and the starving spirits make up the “ten miserable existences.” Together these are known as the “twenty existences of the desire realm.” If the [beings of the] eight islands are counted separately, there are then twenty-eight existences within the desire realm.
Although the demi-gods may be included in the category of animals, their habitat, physical form, possessions, and so on are qualitatively so similar to those of the gods that they are classified as gods. As the Five Treatises on the Stages and the Wish-Fulfilling Scripture confirm, the negative a in asura, the Sanskrit word for demi-god, denotes inferiority, not a denial of status as a god (sura).

The three realms are divided into nine levels according to different mental states: four levels of the formless realm, differentiated by the four levels of meditative absorption; four levels of the form realm, differentiated by the four levels of meditative concentration; and one level for the desire realm, since there is no such differentiation within it.
When sentient beings are grouped according to their types, there are six distinct groups. The Reunion of Father and Son Scripture[40] states:
The Lion of Humanity taught that The six classes of living beings —
Hell beings, animals, starving spirits,
Demi-gods, humans, and gods — are superficial [reality].
Moreover, the Marvellous Life of the Buddha Scripture[41] states:
Through the forces of craving, becoming, and unawareness, Ordinary beings foolishly spin through the five existences — Human, god, and the three miserable existences —
Just like a potter's wheel spinning 'round.
This fivefold classification is based on the courses of birth and paths of migration experienced by beings. Alternatively, the five paths are explained as the path of dream, the path of instincts, the path of evolutionary actions, the path of unpredictable and deceptive cyclic life, and the path of unpredictable and distinct causes and effects.

Moreover, all who are born, live, and die within this type of world of sentient beings may be included within one of three groups: the definitely pure, the definitely corrupt, and the indeterminate. The first consists of exalted ones; the second, of those who have committed [evil] acts that bring immediate results[43]; and the third includes all other beings.

After the world-system has formed completely and has entered its period of abiding, all beings of the lower realms (with the exception of the animals) and most beings of the higher realms generally experience only the consequences of virtuous or unvirtuous actions committed in previous existences. Thus, their happiness and suffering, their lifespans and enjoyments, and other aspects of their lives are all predetermined.
Although animals experience the results of their previous negative actions, they have indefinite lifespans, etc. At one extreme, the great nāgas and certain other animals live for an entire intermediate age[44]; at the other extreme, some organisms live for only an instant. Moreover, there are innumerable possibilities with respect to their physical shapes and features. The domesticated animals have some vestige of happiness, but those born in the darkness of the areas between continents, as well as some other animals, are tormented by unremitting suffering.
A correlation exists between the lifespans of beings in the six hot hells in descending order (beginning with Reviving) and time as experienced in the six desire realm heavens in ascending order: The number of years in the lifespan of a being in a certain hell equals the number of years in the lifespan of a god in the corresponding heaven. However, what counts as one day in the life of a hell being is equivalent to the entire lifespan of a god.
For example, a being in the Reviving Hell lives for five hundred years, during which period each day is equal to the entire lifespan of the gods of the Four Groups of the Great Kings. The lifespan in Extreme Heat is said to last half an intermediate age, and that of Ceaseless Torture, one full cosmic age. Within the cold hells, the lifespan in Blistering is equal to the time necessary to exhaust the sesame seed stock of Magadhā when it is reduced at the rate of one seed per hundred years. The lifespans of the others increase proportionally, each one twenty times more than the previous.

The lifespan of starving spirits lasts five hundred years, one day in their life being equal to a month in the human realms.
Asaṅga's Facts of the Stages states that the physical size and lifespan of a demi-god are equivalent to those of a god of the Thirty-three Groups of Gods. Within the three miserable realms there is a great variety of physical sizes. The stature of humans in Majestic Body is equal to eight cubits measured on a human in the Land of Jambu; the stature of humans in Bountiful Cow is double that of Majestic Body; and that of Unpleasant Sound is double that of Bountiful Cow. The stature of the six desire gods increases proportionally from one quarter of an earshot in the lowest heaven to one and a half earshots[45] in the highest.
A human being in Majestic Body lives two hundred and fifty years; in Bountiful Cow, five hundred years; and in Unpleasant Sound, one thousand years. For gods in the Four Groups of the Great Kings, a single day is equal to fifty human years, and they live for five hundred years. In the heaven called Thirty-three Groups of Gods, one day is equal to one hundred human years, and the gods there live one thousand years. Lifespan for gods in the heavens above the Thirty-three, up to and including Mastery Over Others' Creations, doubles from heaven to heaven in ascending order.
The gods of the form realm live for ages equal to the number of leagues of their stature. Lifespans range from half an age for a god of Group of the Pure to sixteen thousand ages for a god of Unsurpassed.
The gods of the four formless realms, beginning with Infinite Space, enjoy lifespans of twenty thousand, forty thousand, sixty thousand, and eighty thousand ages, respectively. In these figures, “age” refers to a cosmic age for every level above Faint Light and half a cosmic age for every level below.

In this land of Jambu, humans mainly engage in evolutionary actions.[46] Consequently, there is nothing fixed or definitive regarding their lifespans, wealth, and physical size.
Initially, human lifespan was measureless, but gradually it became calculable; eventually, lifespan will decrease to ten years. This long age concludes with the three periods of famine, plague, and war. Specifically, when lifespan is thirty years, there will be a period of famine lasting for seven years, seven months, and seven days; when twenty years, a period of plague lasting seven months and seven days; and when ten years, a period of war lasting seven days. This entire sequence [during which lifespan decreases from countless to ten years] is termed a long decline.[47]
One cycle refers to a rise and decline together, i. e., the time required for lifespan to rise from ten to eighty thousand years, and then to decline from eighty thousand to ten years. Eighteen such periods are referred to as the eighteen intermediate cycles. Each of these cycles concludes with [periods of] famine, plague, and war. Finally, the period during which lifespan increases from ten to eighty thousand years is called a long rise.[48] Altogether, these are referred to as the twenty intermediate ages. Because of the slower pace during the rise and decline at the beginning and end of the ages, the length of time of each is equal to one intermediate cycle, as pointed out in Purṇavardhana's Commentary [to the Treasury of Phenomenology] and other texts. The Facts of the Stages also refers to the long decline and long rise at the beginning and end of the ages as being each equal to one cycle.
According to the sagacious Longchenpa, after the human lifespan has increased to measureless (during the long rise) and has then begun to decline again, the buddha Inspired[49] will appear [in this world] just as the lifespan first becomes calculable. This statement agrees, for the most part, [with predictions found in] the Universal Way [scriptures].
During both the long rise and decline as well as the eighteen intermediate cycles, the lifespans, physical sizes, and wealth of beings undergo various fluctuations.
One is mistaken if one believes that human life in this world is inferior to others. Since humans of the three other continents experience [only] the results of their past [actions], they have no possibility of performing new evolutionary actions. Therefore, these places are inferior to Jambu.

The Land of Jambu is a place for new evolutionary actions. Therefore, any action performed by persons born here has especially powerful [effects]. Moreover, people feel sad when hearing accounts of impermanence, etc., and so are easily guided [onto the spiritual path]. For these reasons, supreme emanations of awakening—spiritual guides, including our own teacher Śākyamuni—demonstrate enlightenment in this world and become the teachers [of humanity]. Therefore, human life in the Land of Jambu is superior to that on the other continents. The Great Mindfulness Scripture[50] states:
Compared to the other three continents, this is a place for evolutionary action. Here, people are inspired to practice the ten virtues. Here, buddhas appear. All four places of humans depend on this one. Here, people are conscientious about the ten virtuous actions and are inspired to practice them. This is a place for pure conduct. Here, there is an awareness of birth and death. Here, there is the indestructible seat of enlightenment.[51]
From the same source:
Among the four continents of our universe inhabited by humans, the Land of Jambu is the most important.

The genesis of humans on this continent occurred when a god in [the heaven of] Clear Light died and took miraculous birth here. A second, then a third followed, and their numbers increased progressively until there were many, all of whom took miraculous birth here like the first. All could travel through space, had radiant bodies, and were sustained by the nourishment of meditative concentration, like gods of the form realm.
Later, a white earth-nectar that tasted like honey appeared. Eating copiously of this, they began to crave it. Consequently, the nourishment of meditative concentration and other qualities, including miraculous powers and even the earth-nectar itself, disappeared. Then appeared a creamy orange earth-food, and they ate that. Because they began to crave it, both the food and the radiance of their bodies gradually deteriorated. At that point, due to the forces of collective evolutionary actions and the natural laws of existence, [52] the sun and moon began to illuminate the world. In the same way, other earth-nectars as well as fields of sprouts appeared and disappeared. Subsequently, fields of huskless śāli rice grew[53]; reaped in the morning the crop could grow [again] in the evening. Digestion of this rice produced bodily wastes such as feces and urine.
Eating these coarse foods caused the male and female genitals to appear. Gradually, opposite genders became attracted to each other and engaged in sexual intercourse. Others reviled and threw mud at them, whereupon they became ashamed; regarding their sexual activity as inappropriate, they abandoned it for periods of up to seven days. Some of the most depraved individuals constructed houses in order to protect themselves from the embarrassment of being observed while copulating.

Then, because people stored and hoarded the grain, even the śāli rice, which required no cultivation, disappeared. in its place grew a grain with a husk. Because this grain, once harvested, had to be planted again, land was apportioned and fields were farmed. Eventually, [people] began to steal one another's crops and disputes erupted. Consequently, a person of fine physical stature known for his outstanding qualities was chosen from the community to be master of the fields. Honored by everyone, he was offered a portion of the produce, and came to be known as King Honored by Multitudes; he was the [world's] first king. [His descendants] were referred to as royalty because they were lords of the fields, and also because they safeguarded [the well-being of society].
Gradually, people became predominately evil and violated the king's laws. Regardless how stringent the disciplinary measures, people failed to obey the laws, and so capital punishment was instituted. Fearing death, people began to lie and commit other evil acts. Eventually, the five forms of degeneration[54] evolved, culminating in periods of plague, war, and famine.
The history of our continent unfolded in four distinct eras.[55] The first era is called the era of completeness [because splendor and enjoyments were complete]. The second is the era of three-quarters, so called because theft and sexual intercourse reduced the splendor and wealth of the environment and its inhabitants by one quarter. Then, due to lying, the splendor and enjoyments were reduced to one half, and so the third era is referred to as the era of two-quarters. The fourth and final period is the era of conflict, during which even the remnant quarter of wealth and splendor gradually diminishes due to murder and the other forms of non-virtue committed by humans.
Human beings became divided into four classes[56]: royalty descended from the lineage of King Honored by Multitudes; brahmins came from those who were disillusioned by the shortcomings of household life; merchants descended from those who did not steal or commit other forms of non-virtue; and the menial class came from those who engaged in theft and other non-virtuous activities.

Wheel-monarchs, who reign over the four continents [by virtue of their possession of] a gold, silver, copper or iron wheel, are said to appear in this world whenever the lifespan rises above eighty thousand years. The origin of the line of wheel-monarchs of the present age is explained as follows:
According to the Supreme Essence Commentary on Transcendent Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines, the court of King Honored by Multitudes was established at Rājagṛha.[57] King Honored by Multitudes married a queen named Upper River Maiden who bore a son named Beautiful Light. Beautiful Light's queen, named Born from a Mountain, begat a son named Virtue. Virtue's queen, Voice of the Clouds, begat Perfect Virtue. Perfect Virtue's queen, Palm Legs, gave birth to Noble Purification. These are known as the five kings of the Fortunate Age.
A protuberance grew on the crown of the head of the king Noble Purification, and from it sprang [a child] named Suckle Me, [58] [who inherited the throne]. [One day] when he was standing on the terrace of his residence, a gold wheel appeared in space before him. He flung the wheel with the command, “Conquer the East!” The wheel moved in that direction, carrying the king's attendants upon it. In succession, [the inhabitants of] the four continents as well as [the heaven of] the Thirty-three Groups of Gods welcomed them and thus became subjects of the king. That's how Suckle Me became a great wheel-monarch. His physical form and his activities equalled Indra's; however, his lifespan exceeded Indra's by one hundred and forty times.

The son of Suckle Me, called Handsome, possessed a silver wheel; he gained control of three continents — the eastern, southern, and western — simply by advancing in their direction. The son of Handsome, named Very Handsome, possessed a copper wheel; he gained power over the eastern and southern continents simply by preparing for battle. Very Handsome's son, called Having Beauty, possessed an iron wheel; he gained control of the southern continent by brandishing weapons. His son, known as Having Great Beauty, also possessed an iron wheel; by simply brandishing weapons, he too gained control of the southern continent.[59]
All subsequent wheel-monarchs held power over only a single continent. Furthermore, two wheel-monarchs never appeared simultaneously because buddhas, indras, and wheel-monarchs have not performed the actions that cause rivals to appear. Wheel-monarchs exhibit the characteristic marks and signs [of great beings][60] similar to those of a buddha, but not as obvious and complete. For the most part, they are exalted ones. They appear when the [human] lifespan is not less than eighty thousand years, i. e., during the era of completeness, because all ten virtues are practiced. After the era of completeness has ended, their power and prosperity become depleted. However, there are some rulers who are referred to as wheel-monarchs because they reign over most of the Land of Jambu, even though they lack such attributes as the seven precious articles. These monarchs appear whenever [conditions are] appropriate, but only until [human] lifespan has decreased to one hundred years.

Wheel-monarchs own three sets of seven articles endowed with extraordinary characteristics. The first [of these three sets] consists of the seven supremely precious articles, which are described in the Great Mindfulness Scripture[61]:
[1] The precious wheel is made of gold, is five hundred leagues [in diameter] and has one thousand spokes. Within a day it can travel one thousand leagues. By the power of the wheel, the king's attendants, the elephant and so on, are able to travel anywhere through space up to [the heaven of] the Thirty-three and can hear what the king does not hear.
The wheel eliminates rivals. It appeared from space.
[2] The precious jewel has eight facets and equals the size of a large man's thigh. It illuminates the night up to a distance of one hundred leagues, and if the day is hot, it provides cooling water of eight qualities. Within a radius of one hundred leagues, this jewel eliminates all diseases and fulfills all wishes. It was presented by Indra.
[3] The precious queen's body exudes the fragrance of sandalwood; the scent of the blue lotus flower issues from her mouth. Contact with her provokes no passions; all men regard her as a mother or sister. Within the kingdom she eliminates all hunger and thirst and lives in harmony with everyone. She gives birth to many sons. When her husband is absent, [she maintains chastity] and never succumbs to the pleasures of the five senses. She was presented by the minister.

[4] The precious minister is free of disturbing emotions and has forsaken all unvirtuous actions. He is proficient in everything he does, even without training. He is like a loving parent toward all beings.
[5] The precious elephant is wise and obedient. In a single day, he can circle the Land of Jambu three times. When mounted by the king, he goes wherever the king wishes, without being prompted. He defeats the king's adversaries.
[6] The precious horse is bluish-green in color, like the neck of a peacock, and has qualities similar to those of the elephant. Both [the elephant and the horse] were given by Śakra.
[7] The precious general has the power to conquer all enemies, yet he causes no harm to others. Alternatively, the seventh precious article is the precious chamberlain, who obeys the king's commands and keeps his treasury full. Experts on this topic say that a gold wheel-monarch has no general because he does not need to prepare for battle; in that case, the seventh article is the chamberlain, who also serves as treasurer. Since the other three [types of wheel-monarch] must prepare for battle, for them the general is counted as the seventh.

The second set of possessions, the seven semi-precious articles, consists of the following: [The first is] the sword whose mere presence intimidates those who contravene the king's laws. [The second is] the hide canopy, which is ten leagues in length and five in width, impervious to rain and unruffled by wind. It serves as a residence for the king and the members of his entourage wherever they go, providing warmth in cold weather and coolness in the heat. It was offered by a merchant and is said to be the hide of a nāga that came from the ocean. [The third is] the mansion, twelve leagues in length and seven in width, which is warm in the cold and cool in the heat. Goddesses gather there to play music, and from the mansion one can see whatever one wishes—the moon, the constellations, or precious gems. [The fourth is] the garment that is impenetrable to weapons and fire; it is soft and never soils, and whoever wears it remains unaffected by heat, cold, hunger, thirst, and weariness. [The fifth is] the pleasure garden, where young gods and goddesses, birds and other creatures gather at the time of royal visits. [The sixth is] the bedding that frees one from disturbing emotions and clears the mind, and if one cultivates contemplation, it also effects liberation. [The seventh is] the pair of boots that allows the wearer to walk on water and to travel a hundred leagues in an instant, without weariness. [Additional semi-precious articles] include the thousand sons who have renounced the ten unvirtuous actions and the bow and arrow that overpower the enemy.

The last set of possessions, the seven types of jewels, are mentioned in [Haribhadra's] Discussion on the Scripture of Transcendent Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines[62]:
Seven substances—coral, blue beryl,
Silver, gold, crystal,
Pink pearl, and emerald—are [called] precious Because they are universally considered valuable.
Moreover, the Questions of Gaganagañja Scripture mentions that there are wheel-monarchs who control our entire third-order thousand world-system. Further, the Scripture Revealing Dharma and its Meaning[63] states:
In the world-system called Source of Flowers, there appeared a ruler of humanity, a wheel-monarch called Victorious, who was sovereign of this great thousand third-order thousand world-system.

Beings living in their respective realms are [nourished by a variety of foods]. Many kinds of food are eaten in three of the human continents, while in the northern continent only an uncultivated grain is consumed. The gods of the desire realm live on ambrosia, and those of the form realm, on the nourishment of contemplation. These are some of the differences with respect to food. Hunger and thirst are experienced in the desire realm, but not in the two higher realms.
Styles of clothing also distinguish [the different realms]. In the three continents, humans wear clothes in a variety of colors, whereas clothing in the northern continent is exclusively white. In the six [heavens of] the desire realm, the gods wear clothes of multi-colored cloth—white, yellow, blue, and red; in the form realm, all clothing is white. Garments in the three continents are very heavy, being made of silk, cotton, etc.; garments in the northern continent and desire gods' realm are fashioned from the bark of a wish-fulfilling tree, and are soft, supple, and light. Garments in the northern continent weigh only an ounce[64]; [they decrease progressively in weight up to] Unsurpassed, where they are weightless.

In the four continents, the distinction between night and day depends on the light of the sun and moon. Because of the natural radiance [of realms] above [the highest of the golden mountain ranges, ] Yoke, there is no variation in light and dark; the inhabitants of these regions distinguish day from night by the opening and closing of flowers.
A corpse remains after the death of a being born in any mode except miraculous birth. In the latter case, no corpse remains after death.
In three of the continents, humans attach great importance to the amount of rainfall and the quality of the harvest, while humans in the northern continent and the gods feel no such [concern]. Many such features distinguish life in the higher realms.
Except for those who have attained miraculous powers or those who are guided by gods of higher realms, those in lower realms are not able to travel to or to see realms above their own. However, just the opposite applies for those of the higher realms. The gods of the form realm, such as those of the Group of the Pure, can travel to the Land of Jambu. At that time, their bodies do not leave their own abodes, but emanate into our world in a [human] form as a result of having previously experienced this level of existence. Because [the gods of] Mastery Over Others' Creations and [heavens] below it are on the same level—the desire realm—gods [of those realms] travel to our world in their own form.

When the period of abiding comes to an end and the period of destruction begins, all those in the hell realm who have exhausted the causes [for the hell experience] move to higher realms. Those who have not exhausted the causes [for the hell experience] remain and experience suffering when this world is destroyed. Finally they move on, and take birth in the hell of another world. No beings are born anew in the hell realms of this world; in this way the hell realms are emptied. This marks the beginning of the process of destruction; subsequently, the principal habitations of starving spirits and animals are similarly emptied.
Next, one human being of the Land of Jambu, by his own inherent qualities, attains the second level of meditative concentration and remains in that state. Then, arising [from that meditative concentration], he says, “This is the bliss and joy that has come from isolation[65]!” His words instantly pervade the Land of Jambu. Immediately upon hearing these words, others follow the same training, achieve the second level of meditative concentration, and take birth among the class of gods of Clear Light.
When there is no longer a single human left in the Land of Jambu, all the humans of the eastern continent, Majestic Body, and the western, Bountiful Cow, undergo the same change. Those of Unpleasant Sound take birth in the heaven of the Thirty-three. Humans inhabiting the islands follow [a pattern] similar to those of their adjacent continent. In this way, the human world empties. Subsequently, a single god announces the way to attain the second level of meditative concentration, and gradually the [gods below the second level] attain higher levels and are born in the form realm. They then move from lower to higher levels by attaining progressively higher meditative concentrations. When there is no longer a single being left in the heaven of the Pure and below, the destruction (emptying) of the inhabitants is complete.

Below the second level of the form realm, only space remains, a vacuity containing nothing whatsoever. Again, as before, a new world-system comes into existence.

The lower three levels of meditative concentrations are destroyed by fire, water, and wind because these contemplations are imperfect. The imperfection of the first level of meditative concentration, the presence of investigation and examination, resembles fire. The imperfection of the second, the presence of joy and bliss, resembles water. The imperfection of the meditative concentration in the third, the inhalation and exhalation of the breath, resembles wind. Because of these [imperfections], [each meditative concentration] is destroyed by [the element corresponding to its imperfection].
Because the fourth meditative concentration has none of these imperfections, it is not destroyed by external elements. However, sentient beings [of this level of meditative concentration] are said to undergo birth and destruction together with their mentally created celestial palaces and other possessions.
The earth element is not a contributing factor in [these cycles of] destruction because the environmental world itself is composed primarily of the element earth.

The duration of the age of formation equals the time between the initial stage of [the formation] of the wind configuration and the formation of the hells. It also equals the time required for the human lifespan in the Land of Jambu to decrease from incalculable to eighty thousand years. The age of formation comprises twenty intermediate ages: one intermediate age is required for the formation of the environment and nineteen for the inhabitants.
The first intermediate age of the period of abiding is the period during which the lifespan decreases from eighty thousand to ten years. Then, the period of increasing to eighty thousand and the period of again decreasing to ten, taken together, equals one intermediate cycle; eighteen repetitions of this are called the eighteen intermediate cycles. Again, the increase [of lifespan] from ten years to eighty thousand or an incalculable number constitutes the final intermediate age. In total, the period of abiding lasts twenty intermediate ages.
The period of destruction lasts twenty intermediate ages: the destruction of the inhabitants lasts nineteen intermediate ages and the destruction of the environment lasts for one.
The period of vacuity, the period of darkness between the previous world's destruction and the next world's formation, lasts twenty intermediate ages.

In summary, each of the four periods—formation, abiding, destruction, and vacuity—lasts twenty intermediate ages, which, when added together, make eighty intermediate ages; these constitute one cosmic age. These [calculations] have been made from the perspective of our [world-system, ] Endurance. In general, however, the length of days and ages is not precisely fixed. The Inconceivable King Scripture[66] states that for the buddhas Sage of the Śākyas, Infinite Life, Vajra Conqueror, Radiant Fully Bloomed Lotus Form, Dharma Banner, Lion, Illuminator, Dharma Radiance Fully Bloomed Flower Form, King of Wisdom Light, Moon[-like] Intelligence, and Splendor of Excellence, an age in the former buddha's period is merely a single day for the following.

The sagacious Drimé Özer (Longchenpa) and others assert that destruction occurs in a single great cycle [as opposed to the sixty-four cycles of destruction described above]. During this cycle of destruction, everything from the third level of meditative concentration down is destroyed by seven fires of destruction and one deluge, followed by destruction by wind, in the same order of destruction as described above. Because this is a different view according to a different system, it does not coincide with the view expressed in the Individualists' [system of] phenomenology. It should not, however, be considered wrong.
Generally, while this third-order thousand world-system is undergoing formation and destruction, there are inestimable world-systems like ours that exist in other parts of the universe. Even now, periods of destruction, vacuity, formation, and abiding of world-systems in the ten directions are occurring continuously, beyond measure or limit. There are also numerous different patterns of formation and destruction.

Are there places in this world-system not subject to formation and destruction? The pure realms of the enjoyment dimension of awakening, the natural radiance of the pristine wisdom of the exalted ones, are such places. The realms that arise from the force of the bodhisattvas' inconceivable virtue and vows to purify all realms—Blissful[67] and Delightful, for example—belong to the same category. These realms are not subject to formation and destruction until the activity of the buddhas has been completed.
The Seat of Enlightenment, Vulture's Peak,[68] and other sacred places are not destroyed along with this world. Although they are [part of] this world, they have not originated from [evolutionary actions and emotions that are] the origin of suffering.

[The source for this description of space and time] is the Great King of Tantras of the Sacred Primordial Buddha, [2] the [tantra] of the Glorious Wheel of Time, the pinnacle of all Buddhist systems. This tantra refutes the erroneous descriptions of space and time based on incomplete or one-sided perspectives found in the systems of non-Buddhists and the common systems of the proclaimers and solitary sages.
[The outer Wheel of Time denotes] our world-system, which reaches a height of 400, 000 leagues. The inner [Wheel of Time] is the adamantine body[3] which is four of one's own cubits [in height]. The alternative [Wheel of Time] consists of the four parts of the maṇḍalas[4] [of the Wheel of Time, [5]] which are of equal dimensions. Based on these levels, the ultimate [Wheel of Time] (the four branches of familiarization and accomplishment[6] or the binding of the crucial four indestructible states[7]) purifies what must be purified—the impurities of the four states.[8] The result of that purification is the actualization of the four pure dimensions of awakening. Therefore, these levels are unified into a single comprehensive system. The following descriptions of space and time are based on that integration.

In the middle of space rests a spherical foundation of dark wind, 50,000 leagues in thickness. Above that rest the spheres of fire, water, and earth, [one directly on the top of the other]. All are completely circular, of the same thickness [as the wind], and [arranged one within the other, like bowls placed one inside the next, the upper rims of each being level]. The thickness of each of these [four spheres] corresponds proportionally to each of the four hand spans (two cubits) that the human body measures from the soles of the feet to the waist.
The diameters of the spheres are as follows: the wind extends 400, 000 leagues; the fire, 300, 000; the water, 200, 000; and the earth, 100, 000. All four are [semi-]spherical; their outer circumference is three times their diameter.
Above these stands Mount Meru, 100, 000 leagues in height, [corresponding to] the one full cubit measure from the waist to the base of the neck [of a human body]. This mountain is the basis of the celestial spheres and the axis of their rotation.
Above Mount Meru, its “neck” reaches 25, 000 leagues in height; its “face,” 50, 000 leagues; and its “crown protuberance,” 25, 000 leagues, totalling 100, 000. These [three, Mount Meru's neck, face, and crown protuberance] have no physical forms. However, the names “neck,” etc., are used to indicate their imaginary forms. These higher levels [of the world-system] are constituted of only the most subtle elements, whereas the lower levels are composed of all the coarse elements—earth, water, fire, wind, and space. The coarser elements are not found [at the higher levels]; only the last two—wind and space—of the five elements remain [in the higher parts of Mount Meru].
The proportions [of the upper parts of Mount Meru] correspond to those of the human body: the neck is six finger-widths, the face is a hand-span, and from the hairline to the crown of the head is six finger-widths. Altogether, this equals one full cubit. Thus, two cubits [is the measure] from the waist to the crown of the head [of a human being].

The top of Mount Meru measures 50, 000 [leagues] in diameter. The base (where the mountain meets the earth sphere) measures 16, 000 [leagues] in diameter. Thus, Mount Meru is shaped like a porcelain cup, with a vast upper surface. Five concentric enclosures hang from the edge of this vast upper surface, like ornamental curtains, completely encircling the mountain.
From the innermost outward, the enclosures are progressively longer, the outermost enclosure being even with the peak of Cool Mountain Range. As a result, the light of the sun and moon does not strike the continents within this enclosure. However, the human inhabitants there are sustained by their own natural luminosity. (Details of these continents will be presented below. )
The illustrious Tsuglag Trengwa taught that the central of the five [enclosures] of Mount Meru resembles a main axis and that the four remaining [enclosures] hang down, giving the appearance of a five-pointed scepter.
There are evidently many different models of this world-system. This explanation is based upon the most prevalent model.

[The lands between Meru] and the Cool Mountain Range are known as lands [where beings] experience [the results of their past actions, without the possibility of performing new evolutionary actions]. The area between the outer side of Cool Mountain Range and the inner border of the salt water ocean defines the seventh continent ring, known as the Greater Land of Jambu, the land of evolutionary action. The Greater Land of Jambu comprises twelve land masses, evenly distributed in the cardinal and intermediate directions, [with seas surrounding them]. These twelve land masses [plus the seas] form a ring 25, 000 leagues wide.
A salt water ocean, 50, 000 leagues wide, surrounds this continent ring. Beyond the ocean stands the seventh mountain [ring], the Great Indestructible Perimeter. This in turn is surrounded by the fire rising from the sphere of fire (the Horsefaced Fire), which itself is surrounded by the wind rising from the sphere of wind. The width of each of these two extends 50, 000 [leagues]. The four spheres of wind, fire, water, and earth [are arranged] one within the other, the outer edge of each turning upward. The upper exposed surfaces of all [four spheres] rest evenly with one another.
The full height [of our world-system] is the distance between the pinnacle of existence [that is, the crown protuberance of Mount Meru] and the [lower limit of] the wind sphere. The breadth of the world-system is [the distance between the two outer extremities of the wind sphere]. These two dimensions of height and breadth both measure [400, 000] leagues. Surrounding this world-system is only vacuity, devoid of attributes of motility, darkness, and lightness.[13]

The three southern continents together are called the Small Land of Jambu, a land of evolutionary action. The central southern continent contains six regions. The first is Exalted Land (India), which comprises six cities — Magadhā[14] (where the seat of enlightenment, the place where bodhisattvas develop adamantine contemplation, [15] is located), Vaiśālī, [16] Śrāvastī, [17] Kormo Jig, [18] Sāketa, [19] and Campāka[20] — and many surrounding provinces such as Baṅgala, Kauśāmbi, and Kashmir.
A succession of other countries is found to the north of the Exalted Land. In closest proximity is Tibet, the country that the bodhisattva Mighty Lord of the World[21] made his own. Next is Khotan, [22] the land that the exalted Śāriputra and Vaiśravaṇa[23] created by releasing the [waters of a] lake and where the Gomasalakanda Stūpa[24] is found. Next is China, a land enhanced by the four great mountains such as Five-Peaked Mountain (Wu-Tai Shan), where the exalted Mañjuśrī dwells, appearing as a youth. Next is the country of Śambhala, protected by the thirty-two chieftains, [25] Buddhist kings who are emanations of bodhisattvas and wrathful deities. This country has nine hundred and seventy million cities, principal among which is Kalāpa.[26] [Most distant from the Exalted Land] lies the Great Snow Mountain Range that joins the northern snow mountains of Śambhala and is situated at the northernmost extremity of this continent of Jambu.

The [Wheel of Time] Tantra does not enumerate sentient beings, the inhabitants of this world-system, in the conventional way. It teaches that thirty-one [types of] beings — eleven in the desire realm, sixteen in the form realm, and four in the formless realm — live within the cosmological features described above ([i. e., ] Mount Meru and the surrounding regions).
First, eleven [types of beings] live in the desire realm. These are summarized as follows:
Hell [beings], starving spirits, animals,
Humans, demi-gods, and six types of gods in the desire realm.
A hell is located in each half (of the thickness dimension) of the four spherical foundations of this world-system, beginning in the lower half of the spherical foundation of earth. These seven parts, in descending order, are the locations for the following hells:
Pebbles, Sand, Swamp,
Smoke, Fire, Great Darkness,
And Great Wailing—the seven [hells].
The eighth, the Indestructible Flame Hell, is not found in a location separate from that of the seventh hell, but it is considered as a separate hell because a different experience of suffering characterizes it.
The two parts of the upper half of the spherical foundation of earth provide the locations for the realms of the demi-gods and the nāgas. The demi-gods inhabit the upper part; the nāgas, the lower.
Humans [inhabit] various continents, some of which are places where only the results of past actions are experienced; others are places where new evolutionary actions can be performed. Starving spirits and animals also inhabit these places; this Tantra does not specify any other habitats for these forms of life.
There are six [classes of] desire realm gods — the heaven of the Four Groups of the Great Kings is located between the “shoulder” level of Mount Meru and the ground level [where Mount Meru meets the spherical foundation of earth]. The heaven of the Thirty-three rests on the top of Mount Meru. Four heavens are situated above that — Free from Conflict, Joyful, Enjoying Creations, and Mastery Over Others' Creations. Each occupies one quarter of the lower third of the neck of Mount Meru.

Second, the sixteen states of existence of the form realm [are situated as follows]: The four [realms of] wind are located at the four parts of the forehead of Mount Meru—Unsurpassed, Good Vision, Without Distress, and Not Greater. The four [realms of] fire are situated at [the four parts of] the nose area of Mount Meru—Great Results, Merit-Born, Cloudless, and Flourishing Virtue. The four [realms of] water are located at the chin area—Limitless Virtue, Lesser Virtue, Clear Light, and Measureless Light. The four [realms of] earth are located at the two [remaining] thirds of the neck [of Mount Meru]—Dim Light, Great Pure Ones, Chanting in the Presence [of Brahma], and Group of the Pure Ones.
Third, in the formless realm, there are four types of beings. Sentient beings absorbed in the four [states]—Infinite Space, Infinite Consciousness, Nothing Whatever, and Neither Discernment nor No Discernment—are said to live in levels from the crown protuberance of Mount Meru down to the hairline.
The three realms, consisting of the thirty-one existences of our world-system [mentioned above], are formed in temporal sequence. Because the three realms have the nature of enlightened mind, speech, and body, their development follows a parallel sequence: the formless realm [enlightened mind] comes into existence first, followed by the form realm and the desire realm. Furthermore, life within the desire realm comes into existence following the same sequence: life first forms below the earth, then on it, then above it.

The celestial sphere[27] pervades the space between the outer circumference at which the [outermost impenetrable] enclosure of Mount Meru meets Cool Mountain Range and the inner circumference of the mountainous [ring] of fire [i. e., Horse-faced Fire]. The celestial sphere is a circular belt possessing the nature of wind that supports [all] the celestial palaces of the gods. Since it is slightly higher near Mount Meru, it has the bent shape of a bow. Near the mountainous [ring] of fire, it is slightly lower, resembling a lotus petal. It forms a complete circle [around Mount Meru].
Concerning the meaning of the word,
The [Sanskrit] term gola (celestial sphere) may be translated
As hollow, concave and convex, circular, heavy and light, and so forth.
Translated precisely, it denotes “that which holds up the heavens.”
The form [of the celestial sphere] is described differently by different scholars—as resembling the spokes of a wheel; rising up or spreading out; as resembling a stack of helmets, a chain, or a shield. [These descriptions] are based on reason and scriptural reference. The view that the celestial sphere is shaped like a cluster of boats eventually became the most prevalent. The eighth lord [Karmapa] Mikyö Dorjé, with some amusement, provided a clear description of this in the Ocean of the Mind.
The term “house,” from the [Sanskrit] rāśi, denotes a gathering or cluster. The Fundamental Tantra of Mañjuśrī[28] states that there are thirty-six houses; other sources present different enumerations. Regardless of how many houses have formed on the celestial sphere, twelve houses exert the most pronounced influence—both positive and negative — on [the affairs of] this world. They are:
Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer,
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio,
Sagittarius, Capricorn, [29] Aquarius, Pisces.
Infinite numbers of stars are contained within the houses, which are the area of their rotation. The sage Delight in Stars (Jyotirāma) has stated:
Know that the number of stars
Is two hundred and eighty-five million.
Further,
In some discussions related to phenomenology, it is said That in the sky of six empty spheres,
Nāga eyes see the number of stars.[30]
Thus, there are [many viewpoints] such as [this one that asserts] that there are 28, 000, 000 [stars]. In the center of all stars is the pole-star and Canopus, which are shaped like a top ornament and its surrounding canopy.

Each constellation is divided into four quarters, nine such quarters situated in each house. Thus, Beta Arietis, Thirty-five Arietis, and one quarter of Eta Tauri are situated in Aries House, and so on. [The houses and constellations] are situated in a clockwise arrangement. The first of these houses is Aries, and the first constellation is Beta Arietis, since this is where the movement of the sun begins [at the beginning of the year].
The planets rise above the stars[31] that are positioned within their respective houses. These include the Sun in the last quarter of Beta Geminorum[32] and the Moon in the first [quarter] of Beta Arietis, 33 and so forth. These planets govern the houses and constellations like lords.
The ten planets are Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury,
Jupiter, Venus, Saturn,
Long Tail [of Smoke], Eclipser, and Fire of Time.[34]
The eight from the Sun to Long Tail begin their natural movement counterclockwise around Mount Meru, and Eclipser and Fire of Time clockwise. Four of these—Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn—are called malefic planets because they are right branches; and the four—Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Long Tail —are called benefic planets because they are left branches.

One breath refers to one complete breath—the inhalation, pause, and exhalation—of a healthy young person. Six breaths [equals] one minor clepsydra measure, [24 seconds]; sixty minor clepsydra measures [equals] one major clepsydra measure of time [24 minutes][35]; and the time required for sixty major clepsydra measures of time [to elapse] equals one solar day [a 24-hour cycle]. 21, 600 breaths are taken within the period of a solar day. [In one solar day, ] twelve movements[36] or time-conjunctions occur, each time-conjunction being equivalent to 1, 800 breaths or five major clepsydra measures. A time-conjunction is the basis for all calculations of time. The three types of days — lunar day, solar day, and house day[37] — are determined in relation to the movement of the moon, sun, and constellations.

A lunar day is equal to one fifteenth of the waxing or of the waning phase of the moon and is a period of time slightly longer than fifty-nine major clepsydra measures of time. A solar day is equal to one [complete] revolution of the sun around the four continents, from the dawn of one day until the dawn of the next, or one complete cycle of the major clepsydra measures for a day of the week, a period of time equal to sixty major clepsydra measures of time. A house day is equal to one thirtieth of the time [it takes] the sun to move through one of the [twelve] houses, a period of time slightly longer than sixty major clepsydra measures of time. Therefore, the solar day is longer than the lunar day, and the house day is longer than the solar day.
One of these three [days] is used as the basic unit for calculating a month or a year, [depending] on the relative length of time [to be determined]. For a period up to a month, the principal [measure used] is the solar day because both lunar and house days must be calculated in relation to the solar day. For a month, the principal measure is the lunar day. Although the passing of thirty lunar days does not equal thirty solar days, the moon completes its cycle in this period. Therefore, it is necessary to use the lunar day as the basic measure for a month.
[On the other hand], the lunar day is not used as a measure for the year. The reason is that when one subtracts the three hundred and sixty-five solar days from the three hundred and seventy-one lunar days [in a year, ] an excess of six days remains. Because of this extra portion, [a lunar day] does not equal a day of the year. On this point, the Commentary to the Treasury of Phenomenology[38] states:
After the two halves of each month Of winter, spring and summer have elapsed,
An extra half day remains in the month.
Since it does not equal a day of the year, the learned reject [the lunar day as a measure for a year].
The house day is used as the principal unit of measure for a year. This is because a full year equals the time required for one full cycle of the four seasons of equal duration. To complete such a cycle, the sun must make a full revolution through the twelve house months, each consisting of thirty house days.
The Vajra Ḍāka Tantra[39] states:
The journey of the sun, going and returning,
Is referred to as one year.

Thus, the year consists of neither more nor less than three hundred and sixty house days or twelve house months.
A period of twelve [solar or lunar] months, each month consisting of either thirty solar days or thirty lunar days, does not constitute a house year. Eleven days would have to be added [to a year of three hundred and sixty lunar days] for it to equal a house year. Similarly, slightly more than five solar days must be added [to a year of three hundred and sixty solar days] for it to equal a house year.
The completion of the period in which the moon waxes fifteen [days] and wanes fifteen [days] constitutes one month, known as a lunar month. One year, as determined by one complete [cycle of] summer, fall, winter, and spring, is known as a house year.
Stellar houses are the loci for the transits of the nine planets. The effect of these transits on earth is the occurrence of the four seasons. When it is spring in the three southern land masses, it is summer in the eastern continents, autumn in the northern continents, and winter in the western continents. [In other words, the four seasons in the four continents] are occurring in a counterclockwise arrangement. In each of the land masses, however, the seasons occur in their natural sequence (i. e., clockwise): first spring, then summer, autumn, and winter.
Twelve time-conjunctions occur in space. One time-conjunction is defined as the time it takes the planets to transit a single house. [As mentioned above, each constellation has four quarters; ] a house is composed of nine such quarters. Eventually all the planets complete the twelve time-conjunctions. However, the statement that all the houses of the twelve time-conjunctions are transited [in exactly] one year applies only to the sun's movement.[40] Similarly, only the sun transits the twelve time-conjunctions, whereas the houses appear in their entirety once each day.

Inherent to the human body, which is composed of six elements, are the internal energy-winds of the twelve personal time-conjunctions. When these energy-winds circulate in harmony with their natural patterns, the body remains in good health. Discomfort results when these energy-winds are out of harmony with their natural patterns. Similarly, when the external energy-winds of the twelve time-conjunctions move in harmony with their natural patterns, the quality of the environment improves. The Tantra of Wheel of Time[41] states:
Grain will grow in secluded regions, and trees will be laden with firm fruit.
Moreover, [due to their influence, ] the human lifespan increases from 100 years to 800, 000 [years].
When these winds move out of harmony with their natural patterns, the quality of [both] the environment and beings deteriorates, and the lifespan decreases from 800, 000 years to 100. Thus, depending upon the relative harmony or disharmony with natural patterns, the quality of life fluctuates through time in general and during specific periods—the seasons, etc.

In addition to the above description of time, scholars with broad knowledge of the scriptures have presented explanations [on the following topics]: (1) the four eras of the Buddha's doctrine,
(2) the four eras of the wheel-holders, [42] lords over humanity,
(3) the four eras of our world-system, and (4) the four eras of the planets entering vacuity. Numerous presentations of these subjects have been provided by Indian and Tibetan scholars; to elaborate on these would lead to an endless discussion.

The doctrine of the Buddha endures for ten 500-year periods [following his passing from this world]. The first [era], composed of three periods of spiritual attainment, is considered [the era of] completeness. The second, composed of three periods of spiritual practice, is considered [the era of] three-quarters. The third, composed of three periods of theoretical teaching, is called [the era of] two-quarters. The fourth, the one period of time [when] only the outward appearance [of the religious order] is maintained, is called [the era of] conflict.
The division [of the Buddha's doctrine concerning] disci-pline[43] designates the era of completeness as the period [from the Buddha's passing into perfect peace] until the occasion of the formal testimony [in the presence of the monastic community] of the first defeating act.[44] The era of three-quarters is designated as the subsequent period lasting until the occasion of the testimony of the second defeating act, and so on. This is essentially the same theory as that proposed by the scholar [Daṃṣṭrāsena] in his Commentary to the Large, [Medium and Small] Transcendent Wisdom Scriptures.[45] Similarly, the Concise Tantra [of the Wheel of Time][46] provides a source for this classification [of the four eras], implicit in the following:
It is as the Protector of the World [taught].

In our land, [the central of the three southern continents, ] the four eras [of the wheel-holders] lasts for a total of 21,600 years. Completeness, three-quarters, and two-quarters each lasts 5,400 years. The initial stage of the conflict [era] lasts for 3,600 years. This period, added to the total of the former three eras, totals 19,800 years, the time period during which Buddhism prevails. The remaining 1,800 [years is] the time during which barbaric religions prevail.
Fifty-one years after the chieftain Hidden Omnipresent One[47] ascended the lion throne [of the kingdom of Śambhala], the 1,800-year period of barbarism began. It will end fifty-one years after Forceful [Wheel-Holder][48] ascends the lion throne. Forceful [Wheel-Holder] will conquer the arrogant barbarians[49] with the four divisions of his army[50] and convert them to Buddhism. At that point, the era of completeness will begin again, and the human lifespan will gradually increase to 1,800 years. The year that the era of completeness begins [here] corresponds to the first year of the 1,800-year barbaric period on the western of the three southern continents.
At the same time, of the two sons of Forceful [Wheel-Holder],
The Pure and the Chief of the Gods,
The Pure will ascend to power in this land. Other kings descended from the family of the Chief of the Gods will defeat the barbarians of the western southern continent 1,800 years after the era of completeness has begun here. [This victory will mark] the beginning of the era of completeness on that continent.

At that time, the 1,800-year barbaric period begins on the southern of the three western continents. At the end of that period, Buddhist kings descended from the family of Chief of the Gods will defeat the barbarians, and the era of completeness will begin [there]. Following this pattern, the other nine land masses, in succession, enter the 1,800-year period of barbarism. The barbarians are [then] defeated by Buddhist kings and the era of completeness begins. Starting with Chief of the Gods, [wheel-holders] of that lineage appear in a clockwise manner through the twelve lands. When they have all made their appearance, a chieftain also known as Forceful [Wheel-Holder] will once again defeat the barbarians in this land, and the era of completeness will begin.
In brief, the era of completeness is experienced in the land that is the residence of a chieftain who subdues the non-Buddhist barbarians. The adjacent land, in a clockwise direction, experiences the era of conflict; the next experiences two-quarters; and the next to that, three-quarters.

The following quote from the Wheel of Time Tantra[51] states the duration of the four eras of the planets' entering vacuity and how this occurs:
Empty, empty, space, nāga, and hand, the sage, and the moon are the duration of the era of completeness.
Space, empty, flavor, nine, and the sun are known as the number of years of the era of three-quarters.
Empty, space, the Vedas, flavor, and snake [are] in fact the years of the era of two-quarters.
Empty, space, space, eyes, qualities, and sea-treasure are the number of years of the era of conflict.
At the end of these years, the group of planets dwell in pure vacuity devoid of houses.[52]
A complete transit of the seven planets of the week[53] (the sun and the others) and Eclipser through the twenty-seven constellations is known as one great planetary day. This lasts approximately sixty-four years and seven months. One and a half planetary days lasts ninety-six years, ten and a half months. The Tantra of the Wheel of Time designates this a lesser century. A Wheel of Time year is the length of time in a one-hundred-year period that the pristine wisdom aspect is accumulated: three years and three half-months. This is calculated in the following way: one thirty-second of the 36, 000 days of a century is 1, 125 days; converted to years and months, this period equals three years and three half-months.
A hundred-year period, which includes a Wheel of Time year, is equal to three planetary half days. The first [planetary] halfday embodies lightness; the second, motility; and the third, darkness. These are related, in corresponding order, to the external phenomena of phlegm, bile, and wind. When these three —phlegm, bile, and wind—as internal constituents of the human body, are in balance, physical health is maintained. Imbalance [of these constituents] causes disease and deterioration of health. Similarly, even in the world, balance [of these elements] preserves [the environment]; imbalance has a destructive influence. Although there may be some imbalance [in our physical health], the aspect of pristine wisdom [nevertheless enters] the central [channel in the proportion appropriate to] the Wheel of Time year.

Three planetary days, together with the corresponding [two] Wheel of Time years, equals two hundred years. Each day within this period consists of sixty major clepsydra measures of time; this entire period consists of 4, 320, 000 major clepsydra measures. In terms of the human body, 4, 320, 000 breaths are taken during a 200-day period. At the end of this time, some small amount of wind will have entered the central [channel] of even an ordinary individual. In the external [universe], at the end of 4, 320, 000 years (a period numerically equivalent to the number of major clepsydra measures and breaths), all the planets will enter the vacuity [beyond our universe], completing one great [cycle of] the four eras. Then, beginning with the specific transits, the era of completeness again arises, and so on. This cycle of the four eras thus repeats itself again and again.

One may wonder why this description of the universe does not accord with that of phenomenology and other systems. The omniscient Victorious One did not view any aspect of either the environment or the inhabitants of our world-system as ultimately real. Therefore, his teaching is not one that, based on a belief in a single view, sets forth a particular system as the only valid one. Instead, the Buddha spoke in response to the various levels of capabilities, interests, and dispositions of those to be guided [to enlightenment].
All [the different teachings given by the Buddha] are true. However, the Wheel of Time description of time and space contains the essential element of the integration of the three levels —outer, inner, and alternative. This system should thus be considered the supreme one.

The following measures are used to determine the spatial dimensions of the world and its inhabitants: Eight minute particles equals one fine particle. A hair-tip, ketsé seed, [54] louse, barley seed, and finger-width [are determined] in a similar manner; for all seven of these, eight of each of the previous measures, lined up side by side, equals the length of the subsequent one. Twenty-four finger-widths equals a cubit; four cubits equals one bow-length; two thousand bow-lengths, one earshot; and four earshots, one league- The league is used to measure the outer world.

Sixty-four (or sixty, according to some) brief instants elapse during the snap of the fingers of a healthy individual. A single of these brief instants is the smallest unit of time. One hundred and twenty of these units equals one instant. Sixty instants equals one moment. Since there are nine hundred moments in a day, this is one nine-hundredth of a day. Thirty moments equals one period; thirty periods, one solar day; thirty solar days, one month; and twelve months, one year.
Time gradually elapses in the twelve continents (the four great and the eight smaller) as the function of the inner and outer aspects of the twelve experiential elements and of the twelve links of interdependent origination. The so-called twelve houses also move in stages.
Proficient [use of these units of measurement] permits calculation of time periods, lifespans of individuals, etc., of measurable durations (measured in hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands, and so on) and of that which is [considered to be] immeasurable (i. e., beyond ten to the sixtieth power).

The [Sanskrit] vowel a and the consonant ka are examples of individual letters. A combination of two, three, or more of these letters forms a word. For example, the combination of dha and i is dhi, meaning intelligence, and the combination of three consonants [b, d, and dh] and two vowels is [the name] Buddha. A group of several words forms a sentence, namo buddhāya (“Homage to Buddha”), for example. Since a letter is the basic constituent of a word, a letter in itself does not convey meaning. A word conveys [the meaning of an] object; a term, the particularities of an object.
Upon closer examination, however, a group of words, whether many or few, does not capture the essence [of what is intended to be expressed by it]. It is simply a collection of individual letters. [To use some analogies, ] what appears to be a coarse rope is [just] its strands; what appears to be a camel-hair tassel [is just its] individual filaments; and what appears to be a meadow [is just] individual blades of grass. Similarly, [words] are without any true objective status: they are like the reflection of the moon on water, or a mirage, which from the moment of their appearance have a deceptive nature.

The scriptures of the believers in Īśvara[1] state:
If Īśvara, like a potter [who makes his pots], had not created the manifold world,
The earth would not exist, Mt. Meru would not be, and there would be no ocean.
This array of sun, moon, and stars would not be an object of sight.
Since they do exist, some say, “Īśvara is the creator of life.”
This expresses the belief that Īśvara, like a potter, created these worlds where beings live. On the other hand, the Secretists who adhere to the finality of the Vedas,[2] contend that below all the worlds lives an individual—a great sage called Color of the Sun — who is the creator of the worlds. Others assert that everything arose from the self[3] or [non-manifest] principal.[4] Nihilists[5] claim that all worlds and beings have arisen naturally, without [depending on] causes. This is expressed in such words as these:
Good lady, what learned [people] say Is misleading like the tracks of a wolf.
Who created the pollen-bed of a lotus?
Who designed the patterns on the peacock's [feathers]?
Who sharpened the tip of the thorn?
Everything arose naturally, without causes.
There are many erroneous theories [concerning the origin of the world] such as these, fabricated by the confused intellects of non-Buddhist sectarians who are proponents of nihilism or etemalism. [Those who follow] these theories, like blind persons trying to determine the topography of a land, do not reach correct conclusions, but stray far from the truth.

Although an act ceases as soon as it has been done, it will inevitably produce its effect, even after a hundred eons have passed. What is the factor that makes inevitable the causal process through which cause and result are connected?
Some philosophers who have examined this subject assert that the supporting factor is something acquired or possessed. Others maintain that it is an inevitable phenomenon separate [from the cause or its result]. In either case, some sub-schools of the Analysts maintain that this supporting factor is substantially existent while others [maintain that it is] designatively existent. The Idealists assert that fundamental consciousness functions [as the support] upon which the instincts of evolutionary actions are imprinted, after which one experiences their ripening.
Those who postulate the six groups of consciousness[6] but not a fundamental consciousness state that [the support] is the continuum of mental consciousness, [itself only] a designation. Some Centrists assert that the supporting factor is designatively existent, [being the] designation of mere “I” or mere “person.” However many similar philosophical views on this subject there are, all are simply reifications based on partial understanding; they do not reflect the truth. At this point, however, we will not refute or confirm any of these theses.
The Mantra perspective can be expressed in this way:
A subtle, indestructible individual, the great self or person, who is radiant awareness co-existent with the six impure elements, is in every way the basis for the accumulation of actions.
There are two [kinds] of evolutionary action: that which results in shared perception and that which produces personal experience. The former creates the environmental world, and the latter, the inhabitants, sentient beings. The highest yoga tantra, when defining ground, path, and fruition, calls the environmental world “outer,” the inhabiting beings “inner,” and the ground for the manifestation of both environment and inhabitants—pristine wisdom which accords in quality with those two — “alternative.” Both outer [environment] and inner [beings] are the pervaded elements; the alternative (pristine wisdom) is the pervading factor. Together, these are designated as the world-system. “And so forth” [in the root text] indicates that many different explanations of this subject, both general and detailed, have been expounded by Indian and Tibetan scholars.

The stream [of phenomena] is undispersed and coheres through [the effect] of concordant actions.
Lasting form and time are deceptive impressions within naive minds;
It is taught that the exalted ones comprehend the cessation of particles and moments.

The Analyst and Traditionist Proclaimers, in addition to asserting that evolutionary actions cause the formation of the world, maintain that the cause of the first moment of the wind that creates the desire realm at [the outset] of the age of formation is the form realm wind located at the peak [of existence]. This wind is not destroyed during the previous age of destruction and has the power to [initiate] the production of various coarse results caused by [previous] actions.
Moreover, a discourse of the Buddha states:
Winds come carrying seeds from other world-systems.
Based on that source, the environment is [said to be] created from five types of seeds: the seed of the root, the seed which opens, the seed of the seed, the seed of the tip, and the seed of the stalk.
To explain, the coarse world forms when many scattered, indivisible, subtle particles converge. The stream of phenomena, which gives the impression of lasting [over a period of time], remains undispersed by violent winds or other agents and coheres due to the effect of the concordant evolutionary actions of sentient beings. Lasting appearances—forms such as mountains [composed of] many subtle particles, and years [composed of] a sequence of moments—are gross deceptive impressions in the minds of the naive. However, the exalted ones are aware of the impermanence of moments and of subtle particles. As Tsunpa Pel Leg's Seventy Particles[7] states:
A single hair in the palm of a hand Is not felt by anyone,
But if it enters the eye,
It causes great discomfort.
The naive, who are like the palm of the hand,
Do not understand conditioned phenomena as [a collection of] particles;
But the exalted, who are like the eye,
Understand this and develop disengagement.

In order that the perspective of the Tantra of the Wheel of Time may be easily understood, we will explain it in detail employing the format of act, agent, and object acted upon. In the example of a potter who makes a pot, the [creation of the] pot is the act, the potter is the agent, and the clay is the object acted upon. The production process involving the belt, wheel, etc., is the means of creation. Since the act [the creation of the pot] and agent [the potter] are different in substance, the three-fold [format] of act, agent, and object acted upon, posited in relation to the cause and effect of material objects, is a valid one.
[As a second example, ] when sense consciousness understands a blue appearance as blue, the understanding of blue as blue is the act. Sense consciousness to which blue appears is the agent. Blue is the object acted upon. The blue aspect [appearing] is the means in the process [of understanding blue]. In relation to consciousness understanding an object, the act and the agent are identical in substance. Therefore, [in this case,] the threefold [format] of act, agent, and object acted upon is a nominal one.
Of these two [examples], the former will be used here to explain how the physical world is formed.

First, what is the agent that corresponds to the potter? Candrakirti's[8] Introduction to the Central Way[9] states:
The mind itself creates living beings
And the great variety of worlds where they live.
It is also taught that all forms of life are produced from evolutionary actions;
But without the mind, there would be no action.
Thus, generally speaking [the agent that creates the world] is the minds of beings in general and in particular the minds of those beings who have performed concordant actions (such as those that impel them to be born in the same world-system). Principally, [the agent] is the radiant awareness nature of the mind of each being.

What is the means of creation that corresponds to [the production process employing] the [potter's] belt and so forth? The means of creation is described in the following way: from the mind's radiant awareness which is accompanied by the three [factors] of semen, blood, and energy-winds, the three inner lights[10] dawn. Following that, the eighty instinctive conceptions arise. These conceptions activate the instincts (that were created by previous virtuous and non-virtuous actions and that are imprinted on the mind) so that they approach the stage in which the form [of the world] manifests [as their result]. At this point, energy-winds that have a similarity with consciousness—which are only manifestations of the [instincts created by the] actions of beings—depart from one world-system and wander in order to form another world-system, moving into the space left empty after the dissolution of the previous world-system. The motions of these energy-winds are the means of creation [of the world]. This is analogous to the movement of a person's vital energy-wind which departs from the corpse after death and wanders until entering a womb in order to be reborn; the movement of this energy-wind is considered to be the means of creation of the body of a person.

What are the elements acted upon, corresponding to the clay? [These are twofold]: [First are] the subtle particles that remain scattered during the period when the world-system has been emptied [of manifest form]. These particles are not perceived by the limited eye [consciousness of an ordinary person] but appear to the eye [consciousness] of a yogi.[11] [Second are] the supports for these particles, the energy-winds that have a similarity with consciousness. These two elements are analogous to the internal phenomena acted upon during the fetal development of the human body—the semen and blood of the parents, and the ten energy-winds. The very subtle particles that remain scattered [after the destruction of a world-system] are termed emptied since they are merely a manifestation of mental instincts and not the object of sense perception.
Two action energy-winds, one mobile and one stationary, are referred to as “having a similarity with consciousness”: one energy-wind wanders in order to create a new world when a previous world-system has been destroyed; the other energy-wind remains stationary and does not move elsewhere. They are said to have a similarity with consciousness not because they are of the nature of consciousness but because they display an attribute in common with consciousness, just as semen and blood are said to have attributes in common with the moon and sun.

What similarity do these energy-winds have with consciousness? Consciousness itself lacks color and shape, but due to its character of manifestation, consciousness exhibits various lights. Likewise, the nature of the two action energy-winds is that of space. Nevertheless, they manifest six lights, which cannot be perceived by the senses but are seen by the eye consciousness of the yogi. Therefore, the energy-winds have a similarity with consciousness [i. e., the lights].
These energy-winds manifest three principal lights (green, blue, and black) and other secondary ones. Ten energy-winds, such as the vital [energy-winds] and so forth, are produced from these lights. The ten energy-winds are classified into three [groups] according to their functions: holding energy-winds, churning energy-winds, and shaping energy-winds. Which of the ten energy-winds perform which functions? With regard to the microcosm [i. e., the human body], the chapter [of the Wheel of Time Tantra] “Ascertaining the Microcosm”[12] states:
Oh Lord of Humanity,[13] the body is created through time in this way: The seeds that are present in the lotus [i. e., womb] are retained by that which holds [i. e., the energy-winds related to the element of earth] and then coalesce by [the action of the energy-winds related to the element of] water.
After, the body is brought to maturation by [energy-winds related to the element of] fire, tastes, and tastes[14] being consumed. Its growth is caused by [the energy-winds related to the element of] wind.
[The energy-winds related to the element of] space also provide room for growth.
This process, applied to the macrocosm [i. e., the universe], is explained as follows: The pervading and gift of the gods [energy-winds] (related to the water element) gather the subtle particles [that remain in space following the destruction of the previous world-system]; the nāga and wealth king [energy-winds] (related to the earth element) solidify this conglomerate of particles. These are the four holding winds.

The churning winds, the ascending and lizard [energy-winds] (related to the fire element), enhance the conglomeration of particles by their churning action. Following the churning and enhancement of the conglomeration of particles, the shaping energy-winds, the heat-accompanied and turtle [energy-winds] (related to the wind element), shape it while developing and placing it in various locations in space. The vital and downward-voiding [energy-winds] assist all these winds, as their nature is to facilitate [their functions].
Moreover, with respect to the microcosm, the human embryo develops from the semen and blood of the parents through the gelatin[15] and the oblong[16] stages to the fish [-shape][17] and later periods of fetal development.
With respect to the macrocosm, this corresponds to the motions of the most refined essences of the five elements [i. e., the particles] at the beginning stage of the formation of the world when the particular sizes and shapes of the wind and the other spherical foundations have not yet formed. First, during the period of space, the subtle particles, characterized by emptiness, remain scattered. Later, the moving and stationary vital winds (explained above) collide with the subtle particles and cause them to move and cohere. This is the period during which the most refined essence of wind is activated. Just as sparks are produced by striking stones, lightning is generated from the motion and collision of the subtle particles. This is the period during which the most refined essence of fire is set in motion. This produces water which appears like a fine drizzle. This is the period during which the most refined element of water is set in motion. The fine drizzle causes a rainbow to appear in space. This is the period during which the most refined essence of earth is set in motion.
These motions produce a great body of water. When the body of water is churned [by winds], its essence becomes the coarse elements. In the microcosm, this corresponds to the turtle-shape period[18] [of fetal development] during which the four limbs and the head start to emerge.
[Once the coarse elements are produced, ] the shaping winds form Mount Meru, the continents and so forth. This corresponds to the pig-shape period[19] [of fetal development]. Gradually, the world's configuration forms in its entirety, from the wind sphere foundation up to Mt. Meru.

Thus, the power of the different energy-winds produces all the various sizes, shapes, and configurations that appear within our world-system. The distinct action energy-winds themselves are the result of the different manifestations of mind imprinted with instincts [derived from] evolutionary actions. These [different manifestations] are produced by the manifestation of the six lights that are coexistent with the six elements.
How the coarse world-system is formed from the six lights [is explained] in the Glorious Tantra [of the Wheel of Time[20]], beginning with the statement:
In the left branch is the white blaze.
The lights can be explained by using a format of [two sets of] seven pairs: The green light at the zenith and the blue light at the nadir, which are characterized by the radiant awareness of total emptiness,[21] produce two energy-winds, the vital and the downward-voiding. The black blaze in the east, characterized by approaching fullness,[22] produces the macrocosmic heat-accompanied and six other energy-winds. The red blaze in the south, characterized by increase,[23] produces the seven fires; these are the five wrathful planets—Fire of Time, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn—plus Lightning and the Horse-faced Fire. The white blaze in the north, characterized by the dawning of inner light,[24] produces the seven waters: the five peaceful planets —Eclipser, Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Long Tail — plus the rain and the ocean. The yellow blaze in the west, characterized by coarseness, produces the seven earths: subtle earth, coarse earth, subtle minerals, coarse minerals, subtle stars, coarse stars, and rainbows. These are the two sets of seven pairs: the earths and winds of the west and east, and the fires and waters of the south and north. There is a single pair, space and pristine wisdom, at the zenith and at the nadir. The elements of this latter pair are the pervading factors and the former fourteen constitute the pervaded field.

As implied by this explanation, the shapes and the colors of the four sides of Mt. Meru and of the continents and so forth are created by the six lights.
In conclusion, in the formation of a world-system, the mind is the [productive] agent, the environment and inhabitants are the objects [created], and creation is accomplished by evolutionary actions. Most discourses and tantras agree with this presentation.

The productive cause of [a particular] conditioned phenomenon includes all things that are other than the conditioned phenomenon itself. When productive causes are divided into principal and secondary causes, the principal ones are effective productive causes. For example, the eye faculty and [visible] form are the [effective] productive causes that produce the eye consciousness. The eye faculty is the [sense]-base [effective] productive cause, and form is the objective [effective] productive cause. Food acts as the [effective] productive cause of the body because it has the ability to nourish the body. With respect to a seed, shoot, leaf, stalk, and so forth, the former is the [effective] productive cause of the latter in each case because each has the capacity to produce the latter. Secondary [i. e., ineffective] productive causes cannot produce [results], but are included in this category because they do not obstruct [the production of phenomena].

Coemergent causes are any conditioned phenomena that arise simultaneously and act as causes and results of one another. The four main elements [earth, water, fire, and air] are co-emergent causes of one another. Mental factors and [the primary] mind are mutual [co-emergent causes]. Similarly, the characteristics of conditioned phenomena, such as arising and so forth, and phenomena that possess [such] characteristics are mutual causes and results. Therefore, most conditioned phenomena can be considered as co-emergent causes, comparable to travellers who journey together and help one another on the journey.
Causes of the same outcome are preceding phenomena that produce later similar phenomena. For example, barley [is the cause of] similar barley; rice, the cause of rice. Similarly, the five virtuous aggregates act as the causes for the same outcome—virtuous aggregates; non-virtue and obscured neutral [phenomena] act as the causes for the same outcome—defiled [phenomena]; and non-obscured, neutral [phenomena] produce non-obscured, neutral [phenomena].
Concomitant causes denotes mind or mental factors that are concordant by virtue of sharing five factors—[sense-] base, objective object, aspect, time, and substance. The six consciousnesses, together with their respective supporting [sense faculties], are concomitant and identical at the moment [of engagement] of the sense faculties. Thus, they act as concomitant causes for one another and as co-emergent causes. [Concomitant causes] are like travellers who do everything identically—sharing food, drink, baths, bedding, etc. — while on a journey.

Omnipresent causes are the common [factors] relinquished [on the path of] seeing[28] that produce defiled [phenomena] as their result. The Treasury of Phenomenology's presentation of the subtle and proliferating obscuring emotions uses the term omnipresent for the eleven subtle and proliferating [emotions].
A developing cause is non-virtue or contaminated virtue that has the ability to produce a developed result. [Developing causes] are like faultless seeds coming into contact with humidity. Neutral factors do not become developing causes; they are like rotten seeds. Even uncontaminated virtues are not [developing causes] because although they have potency, they do not bring about developed [results] since craving does not exist [at the stage of an exalted one]. They are like healthy seeds never exposed to humidity.

What is the nature of the five results? Developed results are produced by developing causes and arise subsequent to their causes. They pertain to the continuums of individuals, and are unobscured and neutral. Examples of developed results are higher existences [resulting] from virtue and lower existences [resulting] from non-virtue.
Results concordant with [their] causes are produced by either a cause of the same outcome or an omnipresent cause and are of a type concordant [to the cause]. Examples of results concordant with their causes are a short life [resulting] from killing and a long life [resulting] from giving up [killing].
Freedom results refers to cessations [of obscurations] achieved through the power of analytical discrimination. [A cessation is defined as] the attainment of the exhaustion [of obscurations] by eliminating the factors that are to be relinquished by means of appreciative discernment. The relinquishments [and] realizations of the four [types] of exalted ones[29] are examples of freedom results.
Results caused by persons, [also called] results caused by the actions of persons, denotes any results produced and acquired through the power of any cause [created by a person]—crops [produced] by farming, for instance.
Owned results are exclusively conditioned phenomena and arise from what is non-hindering. Such results arise from conditioned phenomena or things that are merely non-hindering [to their arising]. They do not [exist in] the past, but arise in the present and future. Examples are the owned results of virtue and non-virtue.

The following citation provides a general definition of resultant phenomena:
What are resultant phenomena? [They include] all conditioned phenomena and cessations attained through analytical discrimination.
In general, result refers to all conditioned phenomena, as well as analytical cessations or perfect peace, the freedom from obscuring emotions attained by applying the remedial path. Space and non-analytical cessations (both unconditioned phenomena) are considered to be without causes or results since no causal relations exist with respect to these. Being unproduced, no causes or conditions produced [them]; being timeless, they do not have the capacity to produce a result.

What are the causes of the five results? Developed results arise from developing causes (the last mentioned in the section on causes) because developed results are the results of nonvirtue or contaminated virtue.
Owned results are results of productive causes (the first of the six causes) because they are results that are possessed by an owner. Owned results are merely non-obscured, owned [phenomena]. Their [productive] causes, however, are not merely non-obscuring, but also produce results. For instance, the five consciousnesses, such as the eye-consciousness and so forth, are produced by the productive causes of the ten experiential elements. Similarly, the environmental world is produced by the productive causes of actions.
Results concordant with the causes arise from causes of the same outcome (the third) and omnipresent causes (the fifth) because they are similar to these causes.
Results caused by a person are produced by co-emergent causes (the second) and concomitant causes (the fourth). The acts or activity of a person are none other than the nature of that person, and the results are that same person. Likewise, the agents of these causes are the causes themselves, and the results are also [coemergent and concomitant causes]. If this is carefully analyzed, [it can be understood that] results caused by a person may also be produced by the same outcome, omnipresent, or productive causes.

Four conditions are explained in the scriptures. Causal condition refers to all of the [above-mentioned] causes with the exception of the productive cause: the co-emergent, concomitant, same outcome, omnipresent, and developing [causes]. These all act as productive conditions, assisting the production of their own respective results. Productive causes are not considered to be causal conditions because unconditioned phenomena are included within the category of productive causes. Thus, to include productive causes in this category would contradict the assertion that [only] conditioned phenomena are causal conditions.
Concomitant immediate conditions are the mind and mental factors that bring about their own results immediately. When the [previous mind or mental factors] cease, the new ones (of the same substance and not of another concordant type) arise instantly without being interrupted by similar [mind and mental factors] of a concordant type.
Objective conditions are conditioned and unconditioned phenomena that are suitable to be objects of the six consciousnesses (such as the eye [consciousness] and so forth). For example, the experiential element of form is the objective condition that is correlated with eye consciousness.
A dominant condition is any phenomenon that does not obstruct the arising of a conditioned phenomenon different from itself. The dominant condition and the productive mentioned above are mutually inclusive. More phenomena belong to this category of condition than to any other.

The Universalists give names to causes, conditions, and results that are similar [to those of the Individualists]. However, the causes, conditions, and results are asserted in slightly different ways and therefore are explained separately here.
A cause is termed productive or essential when it has been definitely ascertained to be the producer of a particular result.
Phenomena that initially arise from the same [cause] and then continue to remain together while giving support to each other are called co-emergent causes or accompanying causes.[30] This is comparable to two siblings who are born from the same mother and then continue to live together while giving support to each other.
Co-emergent causes are of three types: external, internal, and both. The first refers to the four elements and evolutes of these elements. Each particle of the four elements has eight material particles [earth, water, fire, air, form, smell, taste, and touch]. Although the ceasing of the first moment of an earth particle and the arising of the second moment of a water particle occur simultaneously, a slight causal relationship exists between the former and the latter: they arise from the same productive cause and belong to the same conglomerate. An example in relation to an element evolute is the taste and form of cane sugar.
The second kind, [internal co-emergent causes,] refers to mind and mental factors. Mind and mental factors are co-emergent causes because they arise from the same cause, exist together, and are the cause and effect of one another.
The third, [co-emergent causes that are both internal and external,] are [phenomena] that are [only] designated as cause and effect, like the cause and effect [relationship] of ascribing a definition in relation to the object to be defined.

Causes of the same outcome or augmenting causes refers to virtue resulting in virtue, non-virtue resulting in non-virtue, or neutral [phenomena] resulting in neutral [phenomena]. They are increasing causes because they develop or increase [their results]. These are also called concordant causes since their [effects] are necessarily of the same state and same nature. For example, in order for a desire realm [being's] emotion of attachment to be a concordant cause, it must produce an emotion of the same state—that of the desire realm. It must not produce an emotion of the two higher realms. In this way, it would be of the same state. The emotions [produced] must not be of a dissimilar type, but of the same type — attachment produced as a result of attachment, for instance.
Concomitant causes are causes that are similar by virtue of sharing four common factors, or causes of concordant understanding. Both primary mind and accompanying mental factors have the same productive cause, the same objective object, the same continuum with respect to the object, and a single or identical aspect (i. e., perceptual pattern). For example, the eye consciousness arises from its substantial cause, the stimulation of the instincts present in the fundamental [consciousness]. According to a different explanation, it arises from the first moment of a similar type of consciousness. Likewise, mental factors, such as feeling, which accompany that [consciousness], arise from the [same] causes. The eye consciousness focuses on visual form; its objective condition and likewise [its correlated] mental factors, such as feeling, also focus on it. The object of experience of visual consciousness pertains to the person's [experiential] continuum; the object of experience of the mental factors such as feeling similarly pertain to that continuum. Eye consciousness has a perceptual pattern that perceives the aspect of form; mental factors, such as feeling, also have a perceptual pattern that perceives form. Therefore, both mind and mental factors are concomitant in that they share four common factors.

Omnipresent causes are emotions that produce emotions. [Omnipresent] indicates their functioning throughout the three realms. Since omnipresent causes interfere with beings' attainment of liberation, they are also called obstructive causes. The type, state, and other factors [of the results of omnipresent causes] are indefinite. For instance, anger may be the cause that produces desire or pride. Also, the result of the emotions of the desire realm [may] serve as the basis for the emotions of the two higher realms.
Developing causes are the causes that produce the body, i. e., its development [or result]. They are also called appropriating causes since their effect is to assume a physical form. [Developing causes consist of either] contaminated virtuous or nonvirtuous [actions] which produce neutral results. For example, the body of a hell being is the result of non-virtuous developing causes. Although the experiences of the various sufferings of hell are impelled by non-virtue, the body, the basis [for the experiences of these sufferings], is definitely a neutral [result]. Similarly, contaminated virtuous actions impel [a rebirth as] a god, but the resultant body of a god is not virtuous in itself but solely a neutral phenomenon.

All these causes can be subsumed under productive causes alone. Since productive causes are causes that produce results, ineffective productive causes are not asserted in this system. Asaṅga's Synthesis of Phenomenology presents twenty distinct classifications of productive causes: causes for arising, [for example, the arising] of previously non-existant results; sustaining causes, [for example, sustaining] the body by eating food; supportive causes, like a container that holds water; causes for continuation, [for example, the continuation of] previously existant types [of phenomena]; causes for transformation, for instance, the change from childhood to adolescence; separating causes, [for instance, separation] from what was previously owned; transmuting causes, [for instance,] transmuting gold into statues of humans and gods; causes for proving, [for instance, proving] something as conditioned phenomena by reason of its having birth, abiding, and cessation; achieving causes, [for instance, ] achieving the result by meditation on the path; propelling causes, [for instance, ] projecting into another place and time; accomplishing causes which directly produce [their resultant] phenomena; disruptive causes; causes for the aging of any phenomena; causes for the abiding of what previously existed; causes for ascertainment, [for instance, that in a particular place] there is fire by the reason [that there is] smoke; causes for non-ascertainment, [for instance, that] there is fire by reason that there is no smoke; and other causes.

In this system, the five causes explained above—co-emergent, same outcome, concomitant, omnipresent, and developing— are considered to be categorical causal conditions. Not all the causes that fall into the five categories necessarily act as causal conditions. However, since causal conditions are included within all five categories, all five are considered as such. The Universalists' system of phenomenology also explains that the main substantial causal condition for all external and internal phenomena is the fundamental consciousness, or more specifically, the developed aspect of the fundamental consciousness. The five other causal conditions are in fact cooperative conditions [to the fundamental consciousness].
Objective conditions are objects perceived or objective objects. The five non-conceptual sense consciousnesses clearly perceive their respective objective conditions—the aspect of form, etc. These, therefore, are considered as the objects perceived by these consciousnesses. In the case of conceptual consciousness, the objective basis is merely the pattern of appearance or apprehension [of that conceptual consciousness].

Dominant conditions serve as supports for all phenomena, comparable to a container that holds water, preventing it from spilling out. The general dominant condition [for phenomena] is the fundamental consciousness, and the exclusive dominant conditions are the five sense faculties which provide the bases for the five sense consciousnesses. The dominant conditions for external appearances are the specific supports, locations, and bases of phenomena. The Synthesis of Phenomenology[31] lists nine types of dominant conditions:
Support, propellent, co-emergence, object,
Birth, location, experience of results [of actions],
Mundane purity, and transcendent purity:
All [act] as dominant conditions [for external appearances].
Both objective conditions and dominant conditions are included among productive causes.

The immediately preceding condition is asserted in three different ways. Teachers of the [Treasury of]Phenomenology maintain that the immediate condition has three characteristics: it is similar to its resultant phenomenon; it shares the same cause; and it immediately precedes [its result]. [Some] assert that the immediate condition provides the opportunity for any phenomenon to arise by not hindering it and serves as an aid to its [production]. [Others] assert that the immediate condition merely directs consciousness towards the object. The [Universalists'] system of phenomenology accepts the last of these three assertions.
When all four conditions [the causal condition, objective condition, dominant condition, and immediate condition] are present, consciousness generates [the subsequent] consciousness: the former eye consciousness produces the latter one, for example. When two or three of these conditions are present, consciousness produces the appearance of coarse objects, and coarse objects produce coarse objects. To explain, in order for consciousness to produce the appearance of coarse objects, two conditions are necessary: the causal conditions (i. e., instincts within the fundamental consciousness) and the co-emergent condition. An example of this is formative actions impelling [a being] to take rebirth. In order for coarse objects to produce coarse objects, two conditions are necessary. However, according to those who assert that the immediate condition is a previous similar type [of phenomenon], the immediate condition should also be present. In this case, three conditions are necessary [for coarse objects to produce coarse objects].

Freedom results are cessations that have not been produced by causes. Analytical cessations are actual freedom results since they are superficial phenomena.
The truth of cessation that is the ultimate nature [of phenomena] is freedom itself and is a nominal [freedom] result. The ultimate sphere of reality is considered to be a nominal result because the intrinsic dimension of awakening, itself inseparable from the sphere of reality, is referred to as a result. In fact, the ultimate sphere of reality is not a true result because unconditioned phenomena cannot logically be described in terms of actual causes and results.
Owned results pertain to external objects. A non-analytic viewpoint accepts the existence of external objects: from that perspective, the environment and external form, sound, taste, smell, and touch are owned results. From a slightly analytical standpoint, the existence of external phenomena is not accepted. However, from that perspective, the aspect of consciousness appearing as places and the aspect of consciousness appearing as objects, etc., are considered as owned results.
Developed results pertain to the [experiential] continuums of sentient beings. Examples include the five appropriated aggregates integral to the body [when the existence of external objects is accepted] and the aspect of consciousness manifesting [as the five aggregates, when the existence of external objects is not accepted].
Caused results include all phenomena that arise from productive causes. Results concordant with their causes include all phenomena that arise from causes of the same outcome.
The main [causes, conditions, and results] have been explained above—this does not, however, constitute a definitive presentation of this subject.

Generally speaking, any cause that produces a phenomenon must fall into one of two categories of causes: defiled cause (i. e., the fundamental consciousness which possesses the instincts for cyclic life) or pure cause (the uncontaminated potential). The first—the defiled cause, the fundamental consciousness with all the types of instincts that are potentials for cyclic life—serves as the cause of everything that is defiled in the three realms of cyclic life.
The pure cause is the uncontaminated potential imprinted upon the fundamental consciousness. This cause, in Asaṅga's Synthesis of Phenomenology, [52] is called “the potential that arises from learning” which indicates that the nature of the [uncontaminated potential] is not merely a propensity developed by ordinary virtue (such as generosity and ethics) imprinted [on the fundamental consciousness]. Rather, its nature is an acquired propensity [that leads] one to comprehend the qualities of the Buddha's body, speech, and mind. In this system, the excellent teachings [of the Buddha] are the concordant cause for the reality dimension of awakening—the Buddha's mind. Therefore, the main [uncontaminated potential] is the propensity acquired from the study of these teachings and the consequent understanding of the profound secret aspects of Buddha's body, speech, and mind. This potential imprinted on the fundamental consciousness eventually becomes the cause for an individual's attainment of freedom. Because it leads to freedom, this potential is said to be uncontaminated. Not every sentient being necessarily possesses this uncontaminated potential.
The uncontaminated potential is also explained as either the cause present from birth or the cause that arises from education. The first is a developed aspect of the fundamental [consciousness] and the second is the causal aspect. For example, due to the development of the potential from learning in previous [lives], in this life one is born naturally endowed with superlative wisdom—wisdom present from birth. A great deal of learning in this life develops the [uncontaminated] potential; cultivation of this potential leads to superlative wisdom—wisdom arising from education.
These [explanations concerning contaminated and uncontaminated causes] supplement the discussion on results.

A general overview of the causes and conditions that produce conditioned phenomena as asserted by the common spiritual ways has been presented above. The ultimate view of the exceptional [systems concerning the creation of cyclic life] is presented here.
The Disclosure of the Awakening Mind[33] by the exalted [Nāgārjuna] says:
I maintain that just as sugar cane is sweet And the nature of fire is heat,
The nature of all phenomena Is emptiness.
Cyclic life, evolutionary actions, and their results do not ultimately exist. [Their nature] is just emptiness, lacking true status. Nevertheless, [cyclic life, etc., ] have a superficial mode of appearance: various causes and conditions perpetuate the motion of the wheel of the twelve links of interdependent origination which turns around and around on the path of existence. As the Exalted One's [Disclosure of the Awakening Mind[34]] says:
I assert that the process that unfolds From ignorance to old age and death—
The twelve links of interdependent origination—
Is similar to an illusion or to a dream.
This wheel of twelve links Turns on the path of existence.

Dharmakīrti's Treatise on Valid Cognition[35] states:
When “I” exists, “other” is known.
Self and other produce grasping and aversion.
All faults arise In relation to these.
The root of cyclic life and of an individual's course of experience throughout it is the conception of “I.” This “I” is the conceived object of the instinctive self-habit that apprehends “I” and “property.” Self-habit and property-habit are the bases for all defiled views and emotions, such as desire. These generate formative actions that result [in rebirth]. These in turn lead to all the suffering of existence. Furthermore, the formations of actions and emotions cause the cycle of suffering to recur continually.
The cycle of suffering seems to be very real. However, if one examines it closely, one can see that it is only the magical display of emptiness. It appears although it is without reality, like the dream images seen when one is asleep [or] the hairs [seen] by a person with cataracts, etc.

The Exalted One's [Disclosure of the Awakening Mind[36]] says:

Empty phenomena produce empty phenomena.
Agent, action, and experienced result
Are superficial [reality].
This, in brief, is what the Victorious One taught.

Further[37]:

Emotions and evolutionary actions create superficial reality;
Actions are instigated by the mind.
Mind is the sum of all instincts;
Freedom from instinctual patterns is happiness.
A happy mind is quietude itself;
A quiet mind is not obscured.
The unobscured [mind] knows reality;
To know reality is to attain freedom.

In his first cycle of teachings, the Buddha taught that the root of cyclic life is self-habit, and that the cause of suffering and its origin is attachment. In the middle cycle, he taught that the root of cyclic life is the fabrication of grasping identifiable characteristics (i. e., habitual adherence to subject and object). In the last cycle, he taught that the root of cyclic life is fundamental consciousness itself.
The father tantras of the highest Secret Mantra [teach that] the bases for the origin of existence are the sets of the four emptinesses and the four elements. The mother tantras assert that cyclic life arises from the indestructible vital essence or mundane innate [bliss].

This subject is a vast one if treated in detail. To further one's understanding of it, one should study the clear explanations given in such [texts] as the commentary on [Karmapa Rangjung Dorjé's] Profound Inner Meaning [called] the Elucidation of the Profound Meaning and the commentary on the Showing of the Essence called the Elucidation of the Philosophy of Rangjung Dorjé. What follows is simply a commentary on the words of the root verses written above.
The Phenomenology Scripture[38] states:
The sphere [of reality] without commencement
Is the source of all phenomena.
Because the sphere of reality exists,
Cyclic life and perfect peace exist.
The nature [of mind], being free of fabrications, is empty. Its character is unobscured clarity; its expression is unobstructedly manifest. This intrinsically pure nature of mind, existing from time without beginning, is the sphere of reality. It is transcendent reality without intrinsic objectivity.
The nature of mind is not recognized: Its unborn nature is conceived as self; its unimpeded radiance is conceived as other. Thus, the unobstructed creativity [of mind] appears as subject and object. Mental formations with regard to objects and mind agitate the fundamental consciousness like waves on water. The objective object and subjective consciousness, although not different, manifest as two and are apprehended as other and self.

<d e="2">
[This dualistic apprehension] produces [the aggregate of consciousness], comprised of the six consciousnesses which apprehend objects as external. The increased manifestations of instincts create coarse deceptive appearances. These appear to the consciousnesses as pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral [objects], and as a consequence are regarded with acceptance, rejection, or indifference. In this way, the aggregate of feeling develops.

The aggregate of discernment is produced by the varying degrees of the objectification-habit with respect to objects perceived. Discrimination of the individual features of objects causes mental formations to occur with respect to them. These lead to the [aggregate] of formations constituted by the various mental factors. These mental formations stabilize instincts, which in turn produce habitual adherence to the nature of form, its characteristics, etc. The aggregate of form develops from this adherence.
The [five aggregates] have been presented here in their causal order. The Treasury of Phenomenology presents the [aggregates] in order of defilement or coarseness, beginning with [the coarsest, ] the aggregate of form, and concluding with the most subtle. The Treasury[39] states:
The order is [presented] in terms of coarseness or defilement.
Although their orders differ, the two presentations are not contradictory. [Once the five aggregates have formed, ] desire and craving for an object, together with grasping to obtain the desired object, serve as the links that empower the formative actions to create existence. Consequently, one takes birth in a new life, [eventually experiencing aging and death]. In this way, the wheel of deception turns perpetually throughout cyclic life.
The wheel [of the twelve links] is set in motion because one's own nature is not recognized, just like the deception that occurs when a magical illusion is not recognized as a magical illusion or when a dream is not recognized as a dream.

To summarize what has been said above, three different mental instincts imprinted on the fundamental [consciousness] cause three different deceptive appearances: objects such as form; subjects, or consciousnesses that apprehend [objects]; and one's own body. These three appear but have no reality. Thus, like dust on a mirror, instincts obscure the mind's radiant awareness, and [beings] wander throughout cyclic life. Maitreya's Scripture Ornament[40] states:
The three appear in three [aspects].

The outer world and the five [types] of objects that find support in it—form, sound, smell, taste and touch—do not exist anywhere, externally or internally. Nonetheless, due to object-oriented instincts, objects appear to the mind as if they were externally existent. One adheres to them as [external] objects, and thus they become objects to be rejected or accepted. The constructive thought that the conceived object is external, expressed as “this is form,” is the objective constructive thought.
The group of eight consciousnesses consists of the fundamental consciousness, defiled mind, and the six consciousnesses. Actions are instigated by these [eight] consciousnesses; these include virtuous (meritorious) and nonvirtuous (negative) ones. Instincts based on these actions remain in the mind just as ore and gold are found together. As the power of these subjective instincts increases, the eight consciousnesses apprehend their respective objects both conceptually and non-conceptually. This is the process of subjective constructive thought.
Because of body-oriented instincts, the six types of beings— the matrices for the arising of subject and object—adhere intensely to [their] individual forms and [their functions in terms of] object, agent, and action. Even while dreaming, they adhere to their bodies [as real]. Consequently, they experience pleasure and pain, and the strength of the three types of instincts increases, causing deceptive subjective and objective appearances to manifest. Rejection or acceptance of those [deceptive appearances] increases the power of obscuring emotions, leading to the accumulation of evolutionary actions. In this way, the beginningless and endless chain of cyclic life continuously recreates itself.
Instincts [created] from time without beginning produced our succession of past lives. Habituation to the stream of past lives has led us into the present life. Habituation to the experiences of this present life, such as dreams influenced by the [events] of the day, forms instincts [that will manifest as] objects, subjects, and bodies of future lives.

What causes aging and death, the main suffering of cyclic life? Examination reveals that aging and death arise from birth, which in turn arises from grasping, which is produced by attachment, and so on through the other links [of interdependent origination]. Analyzing this step by step, it can be understood that unawareness lies at the root of all these links. Applying the remedy that eliminates unawareness leads to cessation [liberation], by reversing the order of interdependent origination.
[Alternatively, ] analytical discernment can be used to realize that the cause for wandering throughout cyclic life, i. e., selfhabit, and its condition, instinctive unawareness, have no intrinsic reality. With this realization, the basis of deception collapses from its inner core. Deceptive appearances are exhausted within the sphere of reality, and liberation, supreme happiness, is attained.

What is the fundamental nature of the original, primordial ground of being, before buddhas appear by realizing it and before sentient beings appear by not realizing it? To answer this, the tradition of Great Perfection states that six claims concerning the ground based on the perspectives of persons who adhere to philosophical tenets are mistaken: the claim that [the ground] is (1) spontaneous; or (2) indeterminate; or (3) determinate; or (4) transmutable into anything; or (5) can be defined in any possible way; or (6) that it is manifold and multifaceted.
These six impressions of the ground are erroneous in that they are partial descriptions of the ground.

The reasons for their erroneousness is as follows:
(1) The claim that [the ground of being] is spontaneous is mistaken because if both faults and qualities existed primordially in the ground, their presence would contradict primordial purity. Furthermore, such a ground would constitute an unsuitable basis for the practice of a path [to freedom], and even if practice were undertaken, freedom would be an unsuitable goal.
(2) The claim that [the ground] is indeterminate is mistaken because if the ground were indeterminate, it would become whatever it is intellectually designated to be, leading to the illogical conclusion that deception might be experienced even after freedom has been attained.
(3) The assertion that [the ground] is determinate is mistaken because [if this were the case], the ground would be unchangeable, which implies that the stains of unawareness could never be purified.
(4) The assertion that [the ground] can change into anything whatsoever is mistaken because the ground would not be permanent; the result (freedom) could therefore turn again into a cause [of cyclic life].
(5) The assertion that [the ground] can be defined in any possible way is mistaken because if phenomena are infinite, the ground would also be infinite. [If this were the case, ] one would have to assert the ground to be either permanent or terminated.
(6) The assertion that [the ground] is manifold is mistaken because such a ground would be unsuitable as the basis for authentic freedom, since a ground related to many thought constructs cannot be a primordially pure ground.
These six impressions, each in its own way, are erroneous in that they give one-sided views of the ground. Thus, they do not[3] provide adequate descriptions of the “ground of being,” permitting only a partial comprehension of the fundamental nature of the ground.

The primordial purity of the original ground is the domain of a practitioner of the path [of Great Perfection] who is free from the erroneous biases of conceiving [the ground] in various artificial ways and who has the correct [understanding] of the ground as primordial purity.
[The primordial purity of the ground] wholly transcends words, concepts, and formulations, and surpasses the limitations of existing or not existing.
The nature of the ground is primordially pure. Thus, the ground transcends the limitations of permanence or existence: it cannot be reduced to substantial or objectifiable characteristics. The character of the ground is spontaneous, and therefore the ground surpasses the limitation of non-existence or annihilation. It is radiant intrinsic awareness, the pure reality of emptiness itself, natural and primordial enlightenment, the immutable wisdom of the reality dimension of awakening. Existing neither as cyclic life nor perfect peace, it remains primordially empty. It is great self-existing wisdom, primordially present like space.
As [the nature of the ground] is primordial purity, isn't it illogical for sentient beings to be deceived into cyclic life? Since beings are intrinsically free, no real stains remain to be purified and no innate deception or freedom can be identified. However, beings are deceived into cyclic life because [freedom and deception], like the freedom and deception [experienced in a] dream, manifest as the simple play of intrinsic awareness, non-existent from the first moment they are experienced and therefore primordially pure.

If the character [of the ground] is spontaneous, wouldn't living beings be effortlessly liberated since the goal [i. e., enlightenment] is innate? Because [the ground] is spontaneous, the dimensions of awakening and the pristine wisdoms of the sphere [of reality] are complete in their pure nature from the very beginning. Nevertheless, an actualization [of the dimensions of awakening and of pristine wisdoms] in the primordial [ground] occurs [when beings], in a manner comparable to waking from sleep, become free from incidental stains.
When the [ground of being] arises as manifestation within its own nature, the ground serves as the basis for both freedom and deception and is therefore called the common ground. Because it serves as the basis for freedom, it is called the ground of freedom. Because it also serves as the basis for the deception of sentient beings, it is called the ground for deception. The ground's manifestation is of a single nature, but when distinguished in terms of [serving as the basis for] freedom, deception, [or both, ] it is threefold.
Here, the word primordial (in “primordial purity”) means “basic” or “fundamental” and is synonymous with “original,” “from the beginning,” “from the primordium,” and so on.

Two or three pristine wisdoms are inherent to the primordially pure character [of the ground of being].
Two exist in this way: Intrinsic awareness is devoid of substantiality and therefore indivisible from emptiness. Based on this indivisibility, the character comprises two pristine wisdoms: the pristine wisdom of the primordially pure nature, which is free of mentation, and the pristine wisdom of the spontaneous character, which is the original radiance glowing deep within. The Sixth Expanse[4] states:
The nature [of the ground] is primordial purity;
Its character is spontaneous accomplishment.
The nature aspect [of the ground] transcends the limitations of existing and not existing. The character aspect [of the ground] consists of the creative potential of the ground. The intrinsic indivisibility of these two is Great Perfection, free of limitations. The Intrinsically Free Awareness[5] states:
[Great Perfection] is freedom from the stains of the four limits.
Three pristine wisdoms are inherent [to the ground of primordial purity], as stated in Vajrasattva, Mirror of the Heart[6]:
Know that the ground has three attributes:
Nature, character, and energy.
The reality dimension of awakening exists as the dimension of the originally pure nature and is therefore the basis for the arising of the three dimensions of awakening which are always inherently present in it. The reality dimension of awakening does not, however, have any diversified and objectifiable attributes, such as face and hands.
The character [of the ground] is clear [pristine wisdom], present as five lights. The three effulgences[7] (of these lights) are of original innate clarity; however, they do not exist as separate entities with particular colors.
The energy [of the ground] is present as intrinsic awareness of pristine wisdom: its quality of knowing manifests in various ways, clearly and unobstructedly, without a dualistic experience involving an observer and an observed object.
These pristine wisdoms (nature, character, and energy) are inherent to the primordially pure original ground of being simply as the creative potential of this ground, but they are not manifest. It is therefore consistent [to say] that two pristine wisdoms (that of the primordially pure nature and the spontaneous character) unfold at the time of enlightenment.

The Condensed Transcendent Wisdom Scripture[8] states:
Without pristine wisdom, there would be no qualities to develop, no awakening,
And the oceans of the buddhas' virtues would not arise.
When intrinsic awareness dwells in the ground of being (i. e., is present as the inner sphere of reality), it is present at the beginning and the end[9] as an inner glow which is not manifest as dimensions of awakening and lights. When intrinsic awareness arises from the ground, it then manifests its intrinsic effulgent luminosity.
Intrinsic awareness dwelling in the heart is called intrinsic awareness dwelling in the temporary ground. However, in that case, intrinsic awareness has already arisen from the sphere of reality as cyclic life and has not yet reached the place of freedom; therefore, it is still considered to be the manifestation of the ground. To explain, immature intrinsic awareness[10] dwells, like an unhatched peacock, in the expanse of the self-radiant five lights, which is like the peacock's egg. When the manifestations of the path—the four visions—occur, intrinsic awareness arises like a rainbow in space. Once the material [body] is purified, intrinsic awareness is perfected and develops into the dimensions of awakening, like [the peacock] emerging from its egg. Consequently, the ground of the sphere of reality and the temporary ground differ in that the former does not have a visible luminous halo and the latter does.
[In summary, ] the nature [of the ground] is the indivisibility of emptiness and clarity; its character is the indivisibility of clarity and emptiness; and its energy is the indivisibility of intrinsic awareness and emptiness. To use examples of its presence in us, the nature, a primordially pure pristine wisdom, is present like a clear sky; the character, a spontaneous pristine wisdom, is like a limpid ocean; and the energy, an all-pervasive pristine wisdom, is like an immaculate jewel.

The original ground of the primordially pure (inner) sphere of reality [is called] the youthful vase-body. When its seal breaks, the energy-wind of pristine wisdom is set in motion. The movement of the energy-wind of wisdom causes intrinsic awareness to emerge from the ground of being. This intrinsic awareness itself manifests as the eight gates of being's spontaneity. At that time, the manifestation of the primordially pure dimension of reality appears above, like a cloudless sky. The manifestation of the enjoyment dimension realms of clear light which pervades the expanse of space appears directly in front. From the creativity of intrinsic awareness, the great manifestation of the ground appears below. From the creativity of intrinsic awareness, the manifestation of the enjoyment dimension of awakening appears further below; and [around it] the realms of the natural manifest dimension of awakening appear in the cardinal and intermediate directions. Still further below, the countless realms that are personal perceptions of the six types of beings appear through the gate of cyclic life.
Everything arises naturally from the display of the eight gates of being's spontaneity and is therefore called the great simultaneous display of cyclic life and perfect peace. When inner clarity manifests as outer clarity [the display of cyclic life and perfect peace], the unceasing space of [this display's] nature is innate clarity; the manifestation of its character is the five lights, the primordial radiance; and the manifestation of its energy is the natural quality of openness, like a cloudless sky.

The eight gates of manifestation are as explained in the Tantra of Great Beauty and Auspiciousness[11]:
Unceasing space is [the gate through which the ground of being] manifests as energy.
Unceasing appearance is [the ground] manifesting as lights.
Unceasing enjoyment is [the ground] manifesting as pristine wisdom.[12]
Unceasing nature is [the ground] manifesting as dimensions of awakening.
Unceasing view is [the ground] manifesting as non-duality.
Unceasing method is [the ground] manifesting as freedom from limitations.
The purity of pristine wisdom is the gate to perfection.
Unceasing energy is [the gate] to impure [cyclic life].
These [eight] are precious wish-fulfilling jewels.[13]
To elaborate, [the realms] of the enjoyment dimension of awakening appear from the creative dynamics of the nature [of the ground]. The natural realms of the manifest dimension of awakening appear from the creative dynamics of capabilities [that are the character of the ground]. The gate of cyclic life appears as a dream-like personal perception from the creativity of energy. Although the manifestations of the ground unfold in these ways, deception and freedom from deception have no reality with respect to the nature of the ground's manifestations. The gates of the ground's spontaneity are inherent to the manifestation of the ground: this is the factor that permits the perception of pure realms and impure deceptive appearances.

[The ground's manifestation] is the basis for freedom, while primordial purity is the place of freedom: this is a key distinction. In other words, if the nature of the manifestation of the ground is recognized, the manifestation serves as the condition for freedom, and is therefore considered the basis of freedom. If it is not recognized, the manifestation serves as the condition for deception and is therefore considered the basis of deception. For instance, a white conch shell can serve as a condition for the mistaken [cognition of it] as a yellow [conch shell]. [The ground's manifestation] is not actually deception, but it is regarded as such[14] when it serves as the condition for deception.
Liberation as the [primordial buddha] occurs in the following way: The instant the ground's manifestations arise, one does not apprehend them as something else but rather recognizes them as one's own inner radiance. Consequently, the movement [of constructive thoughts] ceases in itself: at the first instant [of movement], the recognition that the manifestations are inner radiance causes realization to dawn. This realization defines the difference [between liberation and deception].
Immediately thereafter, deception is dispelled and pristine wisdom unfolds. At this point, the ground fully develops into the result [i. e., awakening]. This is re-enlightenment, the realization of primordial enlightenment within one's own nature. When self-manifestations dissolve into primordial purity, the result is awakening within the ground of being itself before anything else manifests [from the ground]. [The personification of] this awakening is the enlightened guide known as Ever-Perfect.

How does deception arise? [To give a brief overview, ] due to the cause (the three unawarenesses) and the four conditions (the impure objective referent), consciousness mistakes the appearances [of the ground] through [dualistic] apprehensions of subject and object. When this occurs, the uninhibited functioning of the six [types of] grasping cognition causes the six emotions[15] to appear as dormant instincts which constrain intrinsic awareness. At this point, one becomes deceived with respect to the appearances of the six objects[16] by not recognizing that such appearances are of the nature [of intrinsic awareness of pristine wisdom], i. e., the basis for their manifestation.
As instincts intensify, various factors, such as the aggregates, sense objects, and so forth (each in groups of five), arise through [the dualistic apprehensions of] subject and object. The twelve links of interdependent origination unfold in their sequence and propel the turning of the dream-like cycle of lives.
To explain in detail, when [appearances] manifest from the ground, the creative dynamic of energy manifests naturally as cognition, which is the clarity and intrinsic awareness capable of analyzing objects. Through non-recognition of the nature [of appearances], three aspects of unawareness manifest in conjunction with appearances. The unawareness identical in nature [with intrinsic awareness], [17] the cause [for deception], is a failure to recognize that cognition is itself [intrinsic awareness]. Co-emergent unawareness is the simultaneous arising of cognition and a failure to recognize its actual nature. Conceptual unawareness is the apprehension of self-manifestations as something “other.”
Further, four conditions contribute to deception: the causal condition is non-recognition of the manifestation of the ground as having arisen from itself; the objective condition is the manifestation [of the ground] as [outer] objects; the dominant condition is the apprehending of [objects] as “I” or “property”; and the immediate condition is the concomitance of these three conditions.
In summation, unawareness is the cause of deception, and the appearance of objects to cognition is the contributing condition.

Six obscurations are produced from the nature aspect of unawarenesses. The [Tantra of] Self-Manifestation [of Awareness][18] states:
Unawareness that is mind, as the root of cyclic life;
Unawareness that becomes absorbed in the objective field that leads to deception;
Unawareness-within-its-own-ground that is the basis of deception;
Unawareness of constructive thought that is the grasping subject;
Unawareness pursuing a path that is its own artificial creation;
Unawareness of deludedness that is non-recognition;
Owing to these six forms of unawareness, the [nature of the] self-manifestation is not seen.[19]
Unawareness causes the arising of six grasping cognitions: (1) mind and its movements; (2) consciousness knowing itself; (3) apprehension of objects; (4) ascertainment of objects; (5) distraction by objects; and (6) coarse emotions. All these are forms of intense grasping, and together they constitute the six obscurations.
These factors of deception propel beings through the course of the twelve links of interdependent origination. The interconnection between a twelve-year [cycle] and the twelve months [of a year] externally, and the twelve emotions internally, make possible the twelve experiential media.[20] Thus, the successive twelve links of interdependent origination evolve from the impure [factor of unawareness] in the following way.

When manifestations of the ground of being arise, the creativity of intrinsic awareness produces cognition which is coemergent with non-recognition [of its own nature as the ground's manifestation]: this is “unawareness.” The ensuing deceptions or “formative actions” lead to exploration of the object's basic appearance, which is “consciousness.” Consciousness instigates the differentiations of objects by designations such as “this is an object,” “this is an appearance,” and so on. The nature of the object of designation is apprehended as “form.” This constitutes the primary deception of existence: “name and form.” Name and form give rise to the six senses, allowing cognitions to arise and develop in relation to the six types of objects. This leads to apprehension of objects, which is “contact” [between object, senses, and consciousness]. Contact leads to the experiences of attraction, aversion, or indifference, which is “feeling.” This evolves into attachment to objects, which is “craving.” Subsequently “grasping” arises, involving the grasper with the related act of grasping an object. The unfolding of unpredictable experiences related to various deceptive appearances is “becoming.” As a result, one is born in the formless, form, or desire realms, which is “birth.” The cycle continues through old age and sickness until death [i. e., the links of “aging” and “death”]. This progression repeats itself again and again. This is how the sequence of the twelve links of interdependent origination that causes cyclic life first arises from the manifestation of the ground.

[From one life to another,] one wanders through the various existences of cyclic life, following the successive links of interdependent origination. When the [manifestation of] reality[21] has passed [and before the intermediate state of existence arises], unawareness of the nature of [intrinsic awareness] generates formative actions for the next life. Consciousness seeks an embodied existence; after it enters a womb, name and form are developed through the phases of fetal development. The six senses develop, and the convergence of contributing factors [i. e., object, sense, and consciousness] creates contact. Then the feeling of pleasure or pain [is experienced], leading to craving for the experience [of feeling]. Grasping related to objects and the act of grasping are followed by intense grasping, [i. e., the entrance into a new life], which is “becoming.” One is born from the womb and gradually experiences the transformations from youth to old age and finally death. All these links arise in dependence upon one another.
During the experience of cyclic life, the five objects (such as form) arise as a result of not recognizing the five lights as a self-manifestation and of apprehending these lights as [outer] objects. The five emotions arise because the nature of the five pristine wisdoms is not recognized. The five [aggregates] (such as body, mind, etc. ), which are composite collections, arise from impurity [i. e., non-recognition] of the natural radiance of the reality [of the ground]. The five [mental phenomena] (such as the ever-searching mental cognition) arise from impurity [non-recognition] of the five energy-winds. The five conceptions of self (thought and memory conceived as the self; a multiplicity of objects conceived as the self; various currents of thoughts conceived as the self; the basic aspect of consciousness conceived as the self; and phenomena and discrimination of phenomena conceived as the self) arise because the movements [of constructive thoughts] do not cease in themselves.
In summation, the impure phenomena of cyclic life arise within ongoing intrinsic awareness, abide within intrinsic awareness, and are simply the play of intrinsic awareness. They have never existed outside intrinsic awareness, just as dreams never occur except in sleep. The various descriptions of cyclic life teach that [phenomena] are in fact empty forms, simply the magical play of vivid appearances that do not exist in reality.

The cause of deception is co-emergent unawareness, the failure to recognize that what arises from the ground of being is the self-manifestation [of intrinsic awareness] itself. The condition contributing [to deception] is unawareness of the imaginaries, apprehending as “other” [the appearances] that are [intrinsic awareness] manifesting to itself. The basis for deception is the manifestation of clear light, [which is also a] self-manifestation. In other words, three forms of deception — in relation to objects, body, and mind — arise due to [this cause, condition, and basis]. Since the nature [of the ground] is empty, it provides space, and thus reality becomes the basis for objective deception. The character of the ground—[clarity, manifesting as] the five lights—becomes the basis for deception with respect to the objective manifestations of the material body and external environment. Intrinsic awareness, creativity, and effulgence of energy are the bases for deception with respect to the mind.
The initial stage of deception within the three realms is the development of beings in the formless realm. Their mental bodies of contemplation, constituted of the four aggregates that are mere names, [22] serve as support for their mental continuums. Next appear beings of the form realm, for whom bodies of the radiant five lights serve as support for their mental continuums. Finally, beings of the desire realm appear, for whom material bodies of flesh and blood serve as support for their mental continuums.

For a being taking birth in a womb, the development of the adamantine body occurs as follows. The emotions cause the production of the elements of earth, water, fire, and wind. These elements perform the function of developing the body: through their three functions of penetrating, scattering, and equalizing, these four elements gather, distribute, and mix.
Initially, during the first week of embryonic development, the subtle channels of the four elements along with four seed-syllables form in the four directions. Subsequently, in the second and following weeks, the two pairs of small eyes — the physical eyes and the “eyes of the lamp” — form at the navel channel knot. The finest essences of flesh, blood, heat, and breath form in the four heart channels and reveal the sense-bases of the eight consciousnesses. The four channel wheels form gradually, each one having two eyes. On the three main channels which support the five sense faculties rest three seed-syllables which serve as supports for the three doors [body, speech, and mind] and the three poisons in the impure state, and as supports for the three dimensions of awakening in the pure state. On the five channel wheels rest the five seed syllables[23] of the heroes.[24] Four hundred and seventy-two subtle channels branch out from these [five channel wheels]. Then the main and secondary energy-winds, such as the three sets (outer, inner, and secret) of five energy-winds, form. [These energy-winds] are either the energy-winds of pristine wisdom or energy-winds of evolutionary actions. The superficial vital essence rests within the right channel; the ultimate vital essence rests within the left; and the natural vital essence rests within the central channel. Thus, the complete body forms through the developing process of the four ultimate and four superficial elements.

[In the root verses above, ] “former” refers to the four superficial elements which serve as the support for the development of the five aggregates. “And so forth” refers to pristine wisdom, since the elements act as the support for pristine wisdom. The development and formation of the aggregates is explained in the following way: The aggregate of form develops on the basis of flesh; discernment develops on the basis of blood; consciousness develops on the basis of heat; mental formations develop on the basis of inhalation; and feeling develops on the basis of exhalation.
Flesh is the basis from which the channels are produced. The channels are the basis from which energy-winds are produced. Energy-winds produce the energy-winds of both evolutionary actions and pristine wisdom. The energy-winds of evolutionary actions permeate cyclic life while [the energy-winds of] pristine wisdom permeate perfect peace.
Furthermore, blood leads to the production of lymph, which in turn produces the vital essences, which produce the five sense faculties, which themselves are the products of superficial elements. The causes of the five sense faculties are the five emotions, while myriad past, present, and future constructive thoughts cause both cyclic life and perfect peace. This completes the account of the development of the four superficial elements.

“The latter” refers to the four ultimate elements. These are based on the superficial elements and serve as the cause of the four lamps, [25] through which the pristine wisdoms of the four visions[26] manifest and are perceived. When the color white reaches full intensity, it serves as the cause for the “water-lamp of the far-sighted [eyes],” which arises from the water energy-wind channel. When red reaches full intensity, it serves as the cause for the “lamp of emptiness which is the sphere,” which arises from the fire channel. When yellow reaches full intensity, it serves as the cause for the “lamp of the pure sphere [of intrinsic awareness],” which arises from the earth channel. When green reaches full intensity, it serves as the cause for the “lamp of self-existing wisdom,” which arises from the path of the wind channel.
[The lamp of] self-existing wisdom produces intrinsic awareness. The [water-lamp of the] far-sighted [eyes] generates light; the [lamp of emptiness which is the] sphere produces the dimensions of awakening; [the lamp of the pure] sphere [of intrinsic awareness] produces pristine wisdoms. The water-lamp of the far-sighted [eyes] leads to the [vision of the] direct perception of reality. The lamp of emptiness which is the sphere leads to the vision of increasing contemplative experience. The lamp of the pure sphere [of intrinsic awareness] leads to the vision of reaching the limit of intrinsic awareness. The lamp of self-existing wisdom leads to the vision of the cessation [of phenomenal] reality.
The superficial channels, vital essence, and energy-winds of evolutionary actions result in evolutionary actions, in emotions, and in the increase and decrease of the four elements. The ultimate channels, vital essences, and the energy-winds of pristine wisdom cause the development of pristine wisdom (the cause), of the lights and colors (the conditions), and of the dimensions of awakening and pristine wisdoms (the result).

The twenty-five elements that pervade the body (five sets of five) are all naturally complete in the body and generate the effulgence and creativity of pristine wisdom, etc. As the Self-Manifestation [of Awareness[27]] states:
Five major elements are all present in one's body:
Five kinds of energy-winds create the radiance of pristine wisdom.
Five kinds of fire generate the creativity of pristine wisdom.
Five kinds of earth create the nature of pristine wisdom.
Five kinds of water create the object of pristine wisdom.
Five kinds of space provide the abode of pristine wisdom.
This tantra provides an extensive explanation of these points.
The five earths are present [within the body] in this way: Ever-illuminating earth co-exists with intrinsic awareness; immutable and impenetrable earth co-exists with the lamps; precious earth, the source of everything, co-exists with the spheres; ever-limitless earth which displays appearances co-exists with both the sphere of reality and pristine wisdom. The earth of ultimate accomplishment co-exists with wisdom.
The five waters are present in this way: changeless water is present in all channels; the water of clear, pure tranquillity is present in every bone; water that increases qualities is present in the blood; water of non-attachment is present in the lymph; and water of perfect non-apprehension is present within the eyes.
The five fires are present in this way: the fire that pervades everything, internally and externally, is present in the lungs; the fire that illuminates everything, internally and externally, is present in the two eyes and the limbs; the fire that is uniform throughout everything is present between the skin and flesh; the fire that conceives of external and internal activities is present in the soles of the two feet; and fire that accomplishes external and internal activities is present in the palms of the two hands.

The five energy-winds are present in this way: life-sustaining energy-wind is present in the life channel; the energy-wind that produces luster and radiance is present between the eyebrows; the energy-wind that co-exists with fire is present in the abdomen; the energy-wind that pervades everything is present throughout the entire body; and the compassionless energy-wind of the evolutionary action of the eon is present between the heart and the heart membrane.
The five spaces are present in this way: all-pervading space is present, inseparable from actual intrinsic awareness; objectless, clear and pure space is present, inseparable from the five lights; unmixed pure space is present, inseparable from the pure sphere of reality; space that is symbolic of ultimate [reality, mind itself], is present, inseparable from pristine wisdom [expressed] as signs—the empty spheres; and liberative space of the pure realms is present, inseparable from all the manifestations of dimensions of awakening and pristine wisdoms.
Although comprehensive teachings exist concerning the location and function of the five energy-winds when each of them is divided into five, these are not included here.

How is buddha-nature (the ground) pervasively present in the continuum of every sentient being in the state of deception? The Vajrasattva, Mirror of the Heart Tantra[18] says:
Buddha-nature is present in all sentient beings throughout the universe, just as oil pervades sesame seeds.
The Cluster of Jewels [Tantra][19] states:

Oil is always naturally present In mustard and sesame seeds.
Likewise, buddha-nature
And its respective luminosity manifest
In every sentient being who takes physical form.

Beyond the Limits of Sound Root Tantra[30] says:

The pristine wisdom of intrinsic awareness is present in the body
Like oil is present in the sesame seed.
The luster and radiance of the body
Are pervaded by the moisture of pristine wisdom.

The Self-Manifestation [of Awareness] Tantra[31] says:

Authentic buddha-mind is present
In the continuum of every sentient being
As dimensions of awakening and pristine wisdoms.

These and other similar references accord with the discourses and tantras of the common [systems] that teach the definitive truth.
On this subject, Longchen Rabjam, [who is] Ever-Perfect [incarnate], using logical reasoning and scriptural references, refutes the viewpoints that buddha-nature [does not] possess the powers [of a buddha] and major and minor marks and signs [of awakening], and [refutes the viewpoints] that the scriptures that expound buddha-nature require interpretation.
Longchenpa gave [three] reasons why one should appreciate [the teaching on buddha-nature]: (1) If buddha-nature is not revealed by a spiritual friend, it cannot be recognized. Because it is discovered through reliance on an authentic master, one should appreciate [the teaching on buddha-nature]. (2) [Buddha-nature] is a difficult topic to understand, even for the bodhisattvas dwelling on the stages of awakening, not to mention egocentric people. Because it is an impenetrable secret known by enlightened beings only, one should appreciate [the teaching on the buddha-nature]. (3) Because one will clearly perceive buddha-nature if revealed by a qualified master, and because buddha-nature manifests naturally in the interval [between lives], one should appreciate [the teachings on buddha-nature]. Longchengpa taught this profound and secret subject [of buddha-nature] comprehensively. One should study his outstanding works in order to fully understand it.
This [completes] the general explanation on the ever-presence of the ground of being.

The special features [of the ground of being] will now be explained in detail. The modes of manifestation and appearance of the ground are taught in six sets of five: Primordially present in the pristine wisdom of the buddha-nature are five dimensions of awakening, five energy-winds of pristine wisdom awarenesses, five lights, five qualities of the [buddha] families, five pristine wisdom energy-winds, and five qualities of nature, character, and energy. Their primordial presence is indicated by impure manifestations: five emotions, five aggregates, five elements, five senses, five sense objects, and five natural qualities of the three doors. The Garland of Pearls[32] states:

Five bodies, five pristine wisdoms,
Five luminosities and their five colors,
Five qualities, five energy-winds of pristine wisdom,
Five natures, five characters,
And five energies present in the [buddha-] nature Pervade all [beings].

To elaborate on this, the pristine wisdoms of intrinsic awareness present from the beginning as the five dimensions of awakening now manifest as the five aggregates.[33] The nature of intrinsic awareness and the sphere of reality manifesting as a spontaneous form is Buddha Illuminator (Vairocana). The unchanging [nature of intrinsic awareness] is Buddha Imperturbable (Akṣobhya). The treasury of precious qualities [of intrinsic awareness] is Buddha Source of Jewels (Ratnasaṃbhava). The boundless light [of intrinsic awareness] is Buddha Measureless Light (Amitābha). Being primordial enlightenment, [the nature of intrinsic awareness] is Buddha Unfailing Accomplishment (Amoghasiddhi).

Likewise, the five pristine wisdoms are present from the beginning and now arise as the five emotions.[34] The dimensions of awakening, realms, and other phenomena naturally manifesting in the state of intrinsic awareness is mirror-like pristine wisdom. The equality of everything within intrinsic awareness is the pristine wisdom of equality. The distinct manifestations of the [dimensions of awakening and realms] is pristine wisdom of discernment. The [dimensions of awakening and the realms] being spontaneously present from the beginning is the pristine wisdom of accomplishing aims. That all are of a single flavor within reality is the pristine wisdom of the sphere of reality.
From the five lights arise five elements.[35] Intrinsic awareness being stainless is [present as] white light; intrinsic awareness being complete in all qualities is [present as] yellow light; intrinsic awareness being the union [of all qualities] is [present as] red light; intrinsic awareness being complete in everything without effort is [present as] green light; and intrinsic awareness being unchangeable is [present as] blue light. These [lights] in their pure aspect are the five consorts.
Five buddha families appear as the five sense faculties (which indicate their presence)[36]. Pristine wisdom is inconceivably realized within the nature of the sphere of transcendent reality, and thus becomes indivisible from the sphere of reality. The inseparability of these two is the transcendent family. [Intrinsic awareness] being unchanging is the adamantine family. Its completeness in qualities is the jewel family. Its being unstained by evolutionary actions and emotions is the lotus family. Its being complete in the enlightened activity or magical play of intrinsic awareness is the action family.

Five energy-winds are related to the five sense objects. [Intrinsic awareness] reaching the warmth of pristine wisdom is the energy-wind that co-exists with fire. [Intrinsic awareness] serving as the basis for the arising of cyclic life [when its nature is not understood] and for perfect peace [when its nature is understood] is the life-sustaining energy-wind. [Intrinsic awareness] distinguishing various appearances is the energy-wind that separates the refined essence from the unrefined. [Intrinsic awareness] pervading everything, from cyclic life to perfect peace, is the pervasive energy-wind. At the time of actualizing intrinsic awareness, [intrinsic awareness] causing cyclic life to become the basis for freedom in the state of perfect peace is the energy-wind of evolutionary action devoid of compassion. These winds are not those related to the movements [of intrinsic awareness], but are designated [as energy-winds] with respect to the aspect [of intrinsic awareness] and are therefore winds of the intrinsic awareness of pristine wisdom.
Five qualities or five insights [are primordially present] and manifest as the groups of five natural qualities of the three gates. [Intrinsic awareness] discriminating the basis of the arising of cyclic life from the basis of the arising of perfect peace is “discriminating insight.” [Intrinsic awareness] being one in ongoing awareness is “comprehensive insight.” [Intrinsic awareness] not departing from intrinsic awareness is “pervading insight.” [Intrinsic awareness'] presence at the time of actualizing intrinsic awareness is “presiding insight.” As an alternative [to the latter], [intrinsic awareness that] cuts the life of both cyclic life and perfect peace is the “liberative insight.” Since these insights are none other than intrinsic awareness, they are called self-existing pristine wisdom, because they are not forms of analytical discernment, but pertain instead to intrinsic awareness of pristine wisdom.

If these [six sets of elements] were not present in intrinsic awareness itself, which is the ground of being, they would not be present in the directly observable body and mind. If they were not present in these [body and mind], they would not be present as external objects appearing to the mind. If they were not present in intrinsic awareness, they would be like the reflection in a mirror of the face of a barren woman's son: his face cannot appear because the son has no face, and he has no face because he does not exist. What manifests as a phenomenon arises due to its presence in the body and mind, which [in turn] arises from being present in intrinsic awareness. This is comparable to Devadatta's having a head, therefore having a face which can appear in a mirror. Concerning this, the Majestic Creative Energy of the Universe[37] states:

How things appear is my[38] being;
How things arise is my reality;
There is no phenomenon that is not me
In the whole universe.

From the Cluster of Jewels Tantra[39]:

All manifestations appear
Just like a face in a mirror.

Buddha-mind (i. e., intrinsic awareness of pristine wisdom) is present mingling with the deceptive manifestation of the material body. The blessing of this presence—the pristine wisdom manifestation—arises in the following way: its actual dwelling place is the center of the glorious knot (Śrīvatsa) in the heart jewel; its effulgences are present in the blazing palace of the conch-shell (Bhenza), in the palace of the eyes that see, and in the palace of the channels that cause movement. Beyond the Limits of Sound Tantra[40] states:

In the palace of the jewel of the heart
Is a composite jewel of eight facets, the entrances;
Five pristine wisdoms and five dimensions of awakening,
Five energy-winds and five channels of consciousness:
Everything has a fivefold character.

Further:

Inside the head, heart, and channels,
The reality of unfabricated purity is present.

Beyond the Limits of Sound Tantra and other scriptures explain this subject in detail.
The nature of intrinsic awareness is present as dimensions of awakening, like a statue in a vase. The character of intrinsic awareness is present as light, like a flame inside a vase. The energy of intrinsic awareness is present as light, like the rays of the sun. Four entrances which become four channels branch out from the clear light of the heart. The great golden crystal (kati) channel serves as the basis for the arising of the clear light vision. The white silk thread channel serves as the basis for apprehending external objects. The finely coiled channel serves as the basis for the self-arising [of intrinsic awareness]. The crystal tubular channel serves as the basis for the self-manifestation [of intrinsic awareness]. The emptiness channel of intrinsic freedom, which inserts itself into the heaven gate at the crown of the head, serves as the basis for the dimensions of the chains [of light].[41]

Together, these five inner channels are the luminosities of the five pristine wisdoms. Since they naturally serve as bases, they reveal and increase the four lamps. The spheres of clear light move through the four channels of light, and based on that, clear light is cultivated: in the excellent fundamental sphere of the great golden crystal channel, the embodiment of the three aspects (nature, character, and energy) is present and supported by the heart. In the excellent path vital sphere of the white silk thread channel, the four lamps, [principally] the water-lamp, is present in the right [side of the body]. In the peak sphere of excellence of the finely coiled channel, the various visions of increasing contemplative experience are present in the left side. In the crystal tubular channel, the basis for the vision of reaching the limit [of awareness] is present as the basis for manifestation of inner clarity. In the empty intrinsic-freedom channel, the dimensions of the indestructible chains of light are present.
The doors through which the visions of pristine wisdom pervade outwardly are the two eyes. In other words, from the right eye, both the lamp of the far-sighted [eyes] and the lamp of self-existing pristine wisdom manifest as the character of the visions; this is the pristine wisdom-means that understands the phenomenal [view]. From the left eye, both the lamp of emptiness which is the sphere and the lamp of the pure sphere [of awareness] manifest as the character of emptiness; this is the insight of pristine wisdom that understands the noumenal [view]. In the center [of the body], from the crown of the head aperture, the chains [of light] dimension of non-conceptual intrinsic awareness manifests as spheres [of light arranged] in tiers.
Based on what has been explained above, one trains in the crucial body postures,[42] ways of gazing,[43] and breathing techniques in relation to the targets of external and internal objects.[44] Practicing the yoga of luminous [absorption] as one's path, the deceptive appearances are ended [in the ground of being]. One effortlessly arrives at the secret jewel cave, the original place of freedom, primordial purity, and one is thereby liberated: this freedom arises from the natural [state] of reality.
