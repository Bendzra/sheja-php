I have thoroughly presented above an outline of the doctrine, the sacred teachings, in general and with specific details.
Book Four, which describes the stages by which that doctrine grew and spread throughout this world named after its Jambu apple trees, has four chapters: (1) how the Victor’s doctrine spread in the land of exalted beings; (2) a recounting of the origins of monastic discipline, the root of the doctrine, and of the enduring systems of teaching in the Himalayan province; (3) the origins of the traditional eight major chariots of lineages of meditation practice; and (4) a presentation of the spread of Buddhist culture and, incidentally, the dissemination of the doctrine in other lands.

In his melodious voice of Brahma, the Buddha lauded eminent Kashyapa as “a great pious attendant like me,” and empowered him as his regent. Kashyapa compiled the canon and performed other acts to complete the Buddha’s activity for the doctrine, which he entrusted to Ananda. Then, in the midst of three Kukkutapada mountains in the south, eminent Kashyapa covered his body with the Buddha’s discarded robes, blessed his physical remains so that they would not decay before the advent of Buddha Loving-Kindness, and transcended sorrow. Gods and other beings worshipped his physical remains, then joined the three mountains into one, enveloping his body.
Ananda ordained Shanavasa, son of a trader, and entrusted the doctrine to him. Ananda emanated an island in the middle of the Ganges River, where five hundred seers took full ordination and became arhats. They became known as mid-stream arhats or mid-day arhats [the time of their ordination]. Ananda advised Shanavasa, chief among them, to preserve the doctrine in general, and specifically to propagate it in Kashmir. Ananda then transcended sorrow in basic space without residue. Shanavasa journeyed to Kashmir, where he subdued the violent naga Audushta and his entourage, and claimed the land [which had been covered by a lake]. Shanavasa obtained saffron seeds from Mount Gandhamadana and planted them in Kashmir, consecrating them so that saffron would grow there as long as the doctrine of the Buddha lasted. It is said that Shanavasa’s teaching led ten thousand persons to the state of arhat and one hundred thousand to the perception of the truth. He ordained Upagupta (son of Gupta, an incense merchant) and entrusted the doctrine to him. The teacher himself had predicted Upagupta’s life when he said,
A century after my transcendence of sorrow, an enlightened
being without the characteristic features [of a buddha] will
perform a buddha’s acts.
Using miraculous powers, exalted Upagupta subdued evil demons. He gave profound instructions for meditation in a cave eighteen cubits deep, twelve cubits wide, and six cubits high. Each [of his disciples] who attained the state of arhat cast into the cave a stick four finger-widths in length. When the cave was filled, Upagupta ordained Dhitika, son of an Ujjaini city Brahmin, and entrusted the doctrine to him.

Dhitika fully illuminated the teacher’s doctrine by such acts as using miraculous powers to convert many people from the royal and brahmin castes who had entered erroneous paths. Dhitika rescued Krishna, a householder’s son, from danger upon an ocean island, ordained him, and entrusted the doctrine to him.
Exalted Venerable Krishna brought many monks, ordinary beings who persisted in their belief in an existent self, to the true view. He performed a wide range of activity in the service of the doctrine, such as illuminating the teachings on the island of Sri Lanka, then entrusted the doctrine to Sudarshana (son of Darshana, a descendant of Pandu), who had previously been brought to liberation by arhat Sukayana. Eminent Sudarshana subdued five hundred nagas and noxious spirits who had no faith in the doctrine. He filled the entirety of south India with temples and members of the Buddhist spiritual community, introduced the doctrine to many minor lands, spread Buddhism a little in China, then transcended sorrow.
Thus, there were seven patriarchs of the doctrine from Eminent Kashyapa to Sudarshana, or eight, if Eminent Madhyantika (mentioned above) is added. All were arhats: they were completely free of the two [obscuring] factors, had attained meditative concentration within the eight aspects of liberation, had heard and retained the entire excellent speech of the Buddha, and preserved the complete doctrine. Their deeds were similar to those of the Buddha himself. Although many arhats followed them, none equaled their deeds. This concludes an account of the doctrine’s seven patriarchs, as it appears in Various Scriptures on Monastic Discipline.
Within the pious attendant [tradition], there are no explicit accounts of patriarchs after these. In the great way, A Commentary on “The Journey to Lanka Discourse” relates a succession of subsequent patriarchs until Bhikshu Singha. This [other] line of patriarchs is as above from our teacher until Dhitika, then Dhitika entrusted the teaching to Vibhaga, who entrusted it to Venerable Buddhanandi, and so on, through Buddhamitra, Bhikshu Parshva, Sushanata, Ashvagosha, Amrita, Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Rahula, Sanghanandi, Bhikshu Arhat, Kalasha, Kumarala, Shavata, Vasubandhu, Manota, Hagalikanayanasha, and Bhikshu Singha. So it is taught.

During the time of those patriarchs, there spread a custom of teaching and studying the earliest treatise, The Great Treasury of Detailed Exposition. Those who received full ordination, applied themselves to meditative concentration, and attained the four results—stream enterer, once returner, non-returner, and arhat—increased daily: they became as numerous as dust motes. On the subject of The Great Treasury of Detailed Exposition, the omniscient master Taranata states:
“Detailed exposition” means “a thorough explanation.” Before this treatise, the exact words of the teacher’s canon were recited, followed by a presentation of their profound instructions. In the course of that teaching, the canon’s meanings were elucidated, yet no separate treatises more accessible than the discourses existed. Subsequently, for the benefit of future beings, this treatise which provides detailed expositions was composed. Some state that arhats living during the time of Upagupta wrote it together. Others believe that Yashah, Sarvakama, and others composed it. Tibetans claim that five hundred arhats, including Sarvakama and Kubjita, wrote this treatise at Nata-bhatika Monastery in the northern Vindhya Hills. That account seems to blend the two former customary versions. In any case, those arhats’ verbal transmissions were compiled in one place; what had been passed from one elder’s ear to another was recorded in writing.

According to the proponents of the materialist school’s tradition, the seven texts on observed phenomena belong to the canon, and the earliest treatise of commentary is The Great Treasury of Detailed Exposition. Proponents of the discourse school believe that pious attendants who were ordinary beings wrote the seven texts on observed phenomena that predate The Great Treasury of Detailed Exposition, and that those seven texts were spuriously promoted as Shariputra’s and others’ compilations of our teacher’s words. They therefore contend that the first treatises to comment upon the Buddha’s intent were the seven texts on observed phenomena. Some masters state that the seven texts on observed phenomena were originally the Buddha’s canon, but words were subsequently interpolated from pious attendants who were ordinary beings; this is possible, as in the case of some discourses that have [differing redactions] in different Buddhist ways. Therefore, errors in these [seven texts] that contradict [proof based upon] the three kinds of logic should be viewed as later contaminating interpolations. [These masters] believe that since the great way tradition has a distinct collection on observed phenomena, a similar collection must also appear in the pious attendant tradition. Although it is true that the three collections are interrelated in meaning, the other two collections did appear in distinct volumes [within the pious attendant tradition]. Therefore, there is no reason why the mother teachings should not follow the same pattern. So they contend.
While this latter proposition seems reasonable, the preeminent Master Vasubandhu appears to have agreed with the discourse school’s belief; thus, I provisionally accept that view.

The eminent monk Dharmatrata from Kashmir, the prominent monk Vasumitra from Maru in the west, the prominent monk Ghoshaka from Togar (Tukharistan), and the monk Buddhadev from Varanasi were known as the detailed exposition school’s four leading masters. Each had disciples numbering in the hundred thousands. The detailed exposition school’s scriptural transmission consists of The Garland of the Three Mixtures and One Hundred Instructions.
“Others” [in the root text] include the discourse school’s prominent elder, Shri Lata, and Kumaralata, Yamana, and others. Each school of these prominent monks swelled to many hundred thousand fully ordained monks, who preserved each master’s school.
This concludes the account of the period during which Buddhists in India mainly practiced the pious attendant teachings.

Following that, after the period of Exalted Nandamitra and others, an elder, the arhat named Nanda (born in the region of Anga) became the first to hold the great way teachings. During his lifetime, the prominent monk Avitarka and others, including Vigataragadvaja, Divyakaragupta, Rahulamitra, and Jnanatala, received teachings directly from lord bodhisattvas of awakening’s tenth stage, including Loving-Kindness, Gentle Splendor, All-Seeing One, and Lord of Secrets. Five hundred such masters appeared who without exception attained the meditative state of the stream of the teachings.
King Lakshashva presented them offerings in faith, and donated temples and disciples. He sponsored the copying of volumes of the teachings’ collections, and initiated their study and teaching. One thousand, five hundred practitioners of the great way appeared; all without exception retained countless discourses, gained unimpeded intelligence, and attained forbearance [of the nature of reality]. Each demonstrated openly to others some displays of miracles and clairvoyance. Many followers of the great way issued from them.
Concurrently, the majority of great way discourses, including the hundred-thousand-verse The Noble Cluster of Jewels Discourse, the hundred-thousand-verse The Flower Ornament Discourse, the twenty-five thousand-verse Journey to Lanka Discourse, the twelve-thousand-verse Discourse of the Richly Designed Ornament, and the twelve-thousand-verse True Compendium of the Dharma, were brought to the human world from such diverse regions as those of gods, nagas, celestial musicians, and ogres. In particular, many texts came from the nagas’ lands. During that period, the great way’s fame filled every region, which did not meet with the pious attendants’ approval. They disparaged the teachings: “The great way does not constitute the Buddha’s word.” Therefore, Aryapada [i.e., Nagarjuna] and other masters later proved the great way to be the Buddha’s word.

Five hundred masters of the great way then conferred. They saw that due to auspicious connections, if Buddhism were taught at Maudgalyayana’s birthplace, it would merely become powerful, whereas if it were taught at exalted Shariputra’s birthplace, it would flourish extensively. Noble Shariputra’s birth [had taken place centuries earlier] in the brahmin town Nalada or Nalanda (translated in Tibetan as either “given continuously“ or “given by reeds”). Later, in the ruins of this town, King Ashoka repaired and honored Shariputra’s stupa and built a temple. It was there that the masters lived and taught.
During this period, two brahmin brothers Udbhatasiddhisvamin and Shamkarapati built eight temples there, and placed within them all the volumes of the great way’s texts. Later, noble Nanda, Paramasena, and Samyaksatya wrote many treatises to elucidate the yogachara scriptural tradition. Those three masters are known as “the early yogachara proponents.” All the earlier five hundred masters, along with their followers, form what is known as the school of aspects of consciousness.

Around that time, Brahmin Rahulabhadra, the ancestor of every accomplished master, took full ordination from Venerable Krishna. He received an ocean of great way discourses and tantras from many [human] masters, such as Avitarka, and from many supreme wisdom deities, such as Lord of Secrets. His teaching of those discourses at Nalanda marked the first full elucidation of the great way’s middle way tradition.
At that time, there appeared just eight masters, including noble Kamalagarbha, who held the middle way tradition. Among them, the prominent monk Prakashdharmamani received teaching directly from the exalted bodhisattva Dispeller of Obscurations, attained the state of forbearance of unborn phenomena, then retrieved the hundred-thousand-verse, thousand-chapter The Great Compendium Discourse from a world beneath the ground.

The great master Nagarjuna, whose impact was that of a second buddha, was born in the southern land of Vaidarbha. The Journey to Lanka Discourse states:
In the southern land of Vaida,
The one known as the monk Shriman
Will be called by the name “Naga.”
This destroyer of the extremes of existence and nonexistence
Will perfectly elucidate my way, the highest great way,
In this world.
He will accomplish awakening’s stage of extreme joy
And depart for Blissful pure realm.
The Victor also foretold his life in various discourses and tantras, such as The Great Drum Discourse, The Root Tantra of Manjushri, and The Wheel of Time Tantra.
Nagarjuna spent two hundred years of his life in Madhyadesha, two hundred in south India, and one hundred and twenty-nine years on Mount Shriparvata. He studied, taught, and meditated, built ten million temples and stupas, provided for Buddhist communities, aided nagas and other nonhuman beings, and defeated challenges from non-Buddhists. He preserved the sacred teachings in these and in every way; in particular, his kindness to the doctrine of the great way was incomparable.
From the nagas’ realm, he retrieved The Perfection of Sublime Insight in One Hundred Thousand Verses, after which no new great way discourses appeared. His three collections—A Collection of Talks, A Collection on Reasoning, and A Collection of Praises—explain the incontrovertible intent of the first, middle, and final wheels of the teachings. He was the founder who initiated this great tradition. In debate, Nagarjuna defeated the pious attendant believers in external reality, sounding a lion’s roar proving the great way to be the Buddha’s word. Finally, after his body clearly displayed the thirty-two excellent signs of physical perfection, Nagarjuna made a gift of his own head to Prince Shaktiman, son of King Udayana. Nagarjuna blessed his head and body so that they would not be destroyed, departed for Blissful pure land, and purified the buddhas’ realms. Before long, he will re-enter his body, transmit the doctrine, and perform acts of infinite benefit for beings.

Concerning the identification of the texts in Nagarjuna’s three collections, most Tibetan scholars concur as follows. A Collection of Talks comprises two texts:
1. A Message from a Friend, a letter he sent a king from afar
2. The Precious Garland, a direct address to the king
A Collection on Reasoning comprises five texts. Four works are a collection on reasoning to refute the extremes of conceptual formulations in relation to what is to be proven:
1. The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight
2. Sixty Stanzas on Reasoning
3. Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness
4. A Refutation of Arguments
One work is a collection on reasoning to refute polemicists’ reasoning [in their arguments] in relation to the proof:
5. Crushed to Powder
A Collection of Praises comprises [nine texts in all]; two works in relation to the basis of being:
1. An Explicit Praise of Apparent Reality
2. Praises to the Basic Space of Phenomena
two works in relation to the path:
3. Praises to Skillful Means, Supreme Compassion
4. Praises to Sublime Insight, Mother of the Four Exalted Beings
and a work concerning the result:
5. Praises to the Three Bodies of Enlightenment
The following are not categorized separately, but are praises made from the perspective of the essence of the view:
6. Praises to the Ultimate
7. Praises to the Incomparable
8. Praises to the Inconceivable
9. Praises to the Supramundane
In Clear Words, Chandrakirti lists the works of Nagarjuna: “The talks, The Precious Garland, the lecture, and the pure praises... ,” then explicitly enumerates The Collection of Reasoning’s five texts. He does not significantly contradict [the above list accepted by most Tibetan masters].

Early Tibetan masters, such as Translator Khu, add Establishing the Validity of Designations to The Collection of Reasoning’s five texts, making that collection a total of six texts. However, Jé Rinpoché [Tsongkapa] states that [Establishing the Validity of Designations] was not listed in Clear Words, nor did any of this exalted master’s direct disciples ever quote from its pertinent passages. Thus, he adds The Precious Garland to make a sixfold Collection on Reasoning.
In A Collection on Reasoning, The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight establishes all phenomena as emptiness, presenting this in detail through many kinds of reasoning without teaching the aspect of skillful means. Sixty Stanzas on Reasoning presents an outline of the corpus of the middle way. The three other works [in the fivefold Collection of Reasoning—Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness, Refutation of Arguments, and Crushed to Powder] teach emptiness alone. The Precious Garland presents the two aspects of the absence of self in detail, and also teaches various kinds of skillful means.
The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight, Sixty Stanzas on Reasoning, and The Precious Garland form the complete body of his treatises. The other three works resemble limbs of The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight.

The Concise Tantra of the Wheel of Time states:
These will gain accomplishment on the path of the ten virtuous acts: Aryadeva, Kambala, Ashvagosha, and...
This and other texts foretold the great master Aryadeva, son of the king of Sri Lanka. Aryadeva relied upon the master Nagarjuna and attained many forms of accomplishment. Aryapada [i.e., Nagarjuna] entrusted the doctrine to Aryadeva, who preserved the teachings for a long time through such acts as study and teaching, building temples, and establishing centers for great way teaching. Aryadeva composed such texts as The Four Hundred Stanza Treatise in sixteen chapters on the subject of yogachara,
The “Hand” Commentary to the Great Middle Way, The Precious Treasury of the Unborn, and A Compendium of the Essence of Wisdom.
Maheshvara granted a Hindu teacher, whose many names include Matriceta, Pitriceta, and Matichitra, the boon that no one born from a womb would ever defeat him. Aryadeva defeated him in debate and had him enter the Buddha’s doctrine. He then became known as the master Shura, who composed Thirty-four Past Lives of Buddha Shakyamuni and other texts of great benefit to the Buddhist doctrine.
A lineage of disciples appeared in succession, including [Aryadeva’s disciple] Rahulabhadra, a commoner who took renunciant vows and attained sublime accomplishment. Further, the uninterrupted succession of excellent direct and lineage disciples of the exalted master [Nagarjuna] and his spiritual heir [Aryadeva] includes Master Nagahvaya; Nagabodhi, who attained the accomplishment of Great Seal; the accomplished master Shavaripa; Buddhapalita; Bhavaviveka; Master Chandrakirti; and the Victor’s heir, Shantideva. These masters preserved and propagated the Victor’s doctrine by both their teaching and meditation practice.

At Nalanda in India’s central region, enemies of the great way teachings rose three times, resulting in the depletion of the great way collection of teachings to one-fifteenth its original size. The Root Tantra of Manjushri states:
Nine hundred years
After my transcendence of sorrow,
A monk named Asanga,
Learned in the meaning of the treatises,
Will differentiate the many aspects
Of the discourses’ provisional and definitive meanings.
Epitome of a teacher of worldly culture,
He will live as a writer of textbooks.
As foretold, exalted venerable Asanga appeared and attained realization of awakening’s third stage. Although he was exceptionally erudite
in all subjects of Buddhist culture, and in the lesser and great way collections, he found the perfection of sublime insight somewhat difficult to understand. Therefore, he meditated on Maitreya for twelve years at Kukkutapada Mountain. Afterward, the mere sight of Maitreya’s face led him to attain the meditative state of the stream of the teachings. Holding the bodhisattva’s robe, he traveled to Joyful Heaven, where during twenty-five human years he received five treatises and other teachings directly from Maitreya. Asanga then returned to the human world to aid beings and became the supreme epitome of inconceivable qualities such as clairvoyance.
He wrote down Maitreya’s five treatises and composed extensive treatises to elucidate their intent—his five treatises on the stages of awakening. He also composed general summaries of the lesser and great way: A Compendium of Observed Phenomena and A Compendium of the Great Way. In particular, this master elucidated the great way’s collection on observed phenomena, which no one had been able to understand. [Through his teaching and spiritual activity,] twenty to thirty thousand persons became fully ordained monks of the great way, some of whom attained [the state of] forbearance of unborn phenomena. He illuminated the great way’s historical tradition like the sun. Thus, he came to be known as the second great founder [of the great way, after Nagarjuna].

Maitreya’s Five Treatises
Maitreya’s five treatises comprise The Ornament of the Discourses, The Ornament of Manifest Realization, Discerning Between the Center and the Extremes, Discerning Between Phenomena and Their Nature, and The Highest Continuity.
It is thought that the prose version of Discerning Between Phenomena and Their Nature constitutes Maitreya’s original teaching, whereas scholars composed the verse version. Maitreya’s first three teachings spread and became widely known from the beginning, but Discerning Between Phenomena and Their Nature and The Highest Continuity were originally unknown to other scholars. At a later time [more than five hundred years later], Métripa saw light shining from a crack in a stupa, where [he retrieved] these two texts. When Métripa prayed to noble Maitreya, the bodhisattva appeared clearly in a gap in the clouds and confirmed the teachings. Métripa gave them to Pandit Nandakirti, who passed them to the Kashmiri Master Sajjana, from whom they passed in a successive lineage. Therefore, such texts as Haribhadra’s An Extensive Commentary to “The Perfection of Sublime Insight Discourse in Eight Thousand Verses” contain no quotations from those two treatises. Further, this is said to be the reason for the relation between the source of Métripa‘s Great Seal view and The Highest Continuity.
Tibetan scholars assign the following sequence to these treatises: The first, The Ornament of Manifest Realization, with its [introductory] expression of homage, constitutes a treatise of pith instructions that elucidate the intent of discourses on the perfection of sublime insight. The second, The Ornament of the Discourses, resembles a compendium of various, miscellaneous great way discourses. They consider that those two treatises’ subjects are somewhat summarized in Discerning Between the Center and the Extremes; their subjects are summarized to a great degree in Discerning Between Phenomena and Their Nature. The treatise The Highest Continuity (which includes a concluding dedication) elucidates the intent of the Buddha’s foremost excellent speech, the definitive meaning based upon the final wheel of the teachings. The three intermediate texts possess neither an [initial] expression of homage nor a [concluding] dedication. The first text has no dedication; the last, no expression of homage. Therefore, they attribute the five treatises this order as one continuous body of work. Thus it is taught.

Among these texts, The Ornament of the Discourses synthesizes all great way teaching into five points, which it presents. Thus, it is a commentary on the intent of infinite discourses of the great way. In twenty-one chapters, it establishes proof of the great way as the Buddha’s word, and other subjects. The stages of the path are explained in ten points, including “Spiritual affinity, the aspiration to practice the teachings... ,” to present various provisional and definitive aspects of the teachings.
The Ornament of Manifest Realization employs eight main topics and seventy branch points to define the hidden meaning of the perfection of sublime insight. Discerning Between the Center and the Extremes employs the three characteristics [dependent, imagined, and consummate] (the text’s subject) to present the path of the middle way by differentiating between the center, which does not fall into the two extremes of imputation and deprecation, and the extremes that result from such falling. Discerning Between Phenomena and Their Nature presents all phenomena by differentiating between the phenomenal, the wheel of life; and the nature of phenomena, transcendence of sorrow. The Highest Continuity’s seven vajra subjects primarily define buddha nature.
Tibetans scholars in general think that The Ornament of the Discourses and the two Discernings primarily elucidate the intent of the final doctrinal cycle and present the mind-only view. Moreover, they state that The Ornament of the Discourses presents the view and conduct equally; the two Discernings primarily present the view; and The Ornament of Manifest Realization belongs to the perfection of sublime insight. There is no disagreement concerning [this description of those four texts].

Concerning The Highest Continuity, early Tibetan masters consider it to be a commentary on the intent of the middle doctrinal cycle, that it teaches the independently verifiable reason view. Lord Drakpa Gyaltsen and peerless Gampopa, along with their disciples, considered it to be a middle way text. Butön Rinpoché stated that it is a commentary to the final doctrinal cycle, and that it teaches mind-only and middle way views, as suitable. Lord Tsongkapa considered it to belong among consequentialist texts; Ludrup Gyatso, mind-only works. Various such conflicting views exist concerning the nature of this text.
Master Vasubandhu, Dignaga, Shantipa, and others explain The Ornament of Manifest Realization as a text that expounds the view of aspects of consciousness. Exalted Haribhadra, Jnanapada, Abhayakaragupta, Lord Atisha, and others explain it to be a text that expounds the view of the lack of inherent nature. Most earlier and later Tibetan scholars consider it a commentary on the second turning of the wheel, presenting the independently verifiable reason view. Venerable Lord Mikyö Dorjé, Tsongkapa, and others consider that it presents the consequentialist view. The omniscient lord of the Jonang teachings, the spiritual father [Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen] and his heirs, consider that apart from mere differences in degree, Maitreya’s five treatises are middle way texts, and that they mostly teach extrinsic emptiness, the view of the great middle way.

Asanga’s Five Treatises
Asanga’s five treatises on awakening’s stages comprise a principal text and four summaries. Among them, the main description of awakening’s stages is synthesized into seventeen stages and presented as such. [The Stages of Contemplative Practice]itself states:
In brief, they are
(1) The stage that has the five consciousnesses,
(2) The stage of the mental function, (3–5) and that of these other three:
Examination with analysis and the others [i.e., analysis without examination, and with neither examination nor analysis];
(6) The stage accompanied by a meditative state, (7) that without it;
(8) The stage with mind, (9) that which is without mind;
(10) The stage with listening, (11) with contemplation, and (12)
with meditation; Likewise, (13–15) those with the three ways,
(16) The stage with psycho-physical aggregates, and (17) the other stage without the aggregates.
These seventeen stages are presented in relation to their support, engagement, and result. The stage with the five consciousnesses and the stage of the mental function constitute the nature of the support. Three stages— examination and analysis, analysis without examination, and with neither examination nor analysis—show how the support is entered. Four stages—settling in evenness, not settling, with mind, and without mind— are the circumstances of the support. In relation to engagement, there are three stages: listening, contemplation, and meditation. In relation to the result, the temporary results are three stages of the three ways—of pious attendants, solitary sages, and bodhisattvas; and the ultimate result—the result accompanied by the psycho-physical aggregates as a remainder or without this remainder.
[Among the four summaries,] A Summary of Definitive Presentations is like a commentary to those stages. A Summary of the Basis presents how the preceding treatises are contained within the three collections. A Summary of Enumerations is so named because it enumerates the terms used, or because it explains specifically the enumeration of defilements and purifications. A Summary of Avenues of Explanation presents teaching methods. In this way, this fivefold collection presents the intent of the Buddha’s excellent speech, Buddhism’s basic texts, and its teachings methods.

The Root Tantra of Manjushri states:
Afterwards, the famed one,
A southern brahmin,
Whose [name] begins with Va,
Will cherish the Buddha’s teachings
And reside at Arama Stupa.
On the stage of an attractive
Reflection of a lamp,
He will adorn everything
As far as the two oceans.
His life thus foretold, it is said of Master Vasubandhu, Asanga’s younger brother, that no one as learned as he has appeared since our teacher’s transcendence of sorrow. All spiritual communities of the lesser and great ways esteem him. He composed at least fifty commentarial treatises on others’ works, as well as eight original works known as the dissertations. He worked widely for the doctrine, including establishing six hundred and fifty-four monasteries, and supporting over sixty thousand monks of the great way. Some Indian and Tibetan [scholars] think that the above prophecy indicates that he was an exalted being who achieved awakening’s eighth stage. An unbroken succession of many scholars and accomplished masters from him include four of his disciples more learned than he himself, and further, the lord of speech Ratnadasa, Vinitadeva, Chandragomi, and master Dharmapala, all of whom spread the doctrine widely.

The eight dissertations, original texts composed by the master himself, are as follows: (1) Thirty Verses presents all phenomena to be mind alone; (2) Twenty Verses uses reasoning to prove [all phenomena to be mind alone];
(3) A Dissertation on the Five Aggregates validates the five aggregates as the basis for [all phenomena]; (4) A Rational System of Exposition validates that study and teaching; (5) The Accomplishment of Actions validates the actions of the three avenues [of body, speech, and mind]. Those five are independent works. (6) A Commentary on “The Ornament of the Discourses,” (7) A Commentary on “The Discourse on Interdependent Causality,” and (8) A Commentary on “Discerning Between the Center and the Extremes,” the three commentaries on others’ works, validate the six transcendent perfections and other aspects of vast conduct; the twelve links of interdependent causality; and the three characteristics [of knowable things: imagined, dependent, and consummate]. So it is said.
Some state that since this master wrote many works, such as A Commentary on “The Discourse of Awakening’s Ten Stages,” such a set of eight texts cannot be definitely ascertained. They further claim the number of texts related to Maitreya’s teachings cannot be delineated as twenty. Those who have settled on a definite number believe the twenty to be these: [Asanga’s] five treatises on awakening’s stages, [Asanga’s] two summaries [of the lesser and great way], Maitreya’s five treatises, and [Vasubandhu’s] eight dissertations.

Of the two masters of logic, The Wheel of Time Tantra states:
Dignaga, who has the motivation to aid others, is named
Moon Lotus-Seedling...
And The Root Tantra of Manjushri states:
The master [named] with the syllable Dha, diligent in vows,
And acclaimed in the south,
Will refute opponents’ challenges.
Likewise, this one diligent in vows will accomplish secret mantra.
The first prophecy refers to Dignaga, Vasubandhu’s disciple more learned in logic than Vasubandhu himself. He received teachings directly from Manjushri. He explained many discourses and composed an extensive collection of works on observed phenomena. Purely through his own exceptional abilities, he wrote many miscellaneous treatises on dialectics. Subsequently, with the intention of compiling them into a single work, he composed an [introductory] expression of homage. A portent [of the work’s success] was a challenge from Brahmin Krishna, whom Dignaga defeated in debate. Dignaga then continued to compose a total of a hundred earlier and later treatises, including A Compendium of All Discourses on Logic. He was the first to illuminate a system of logic. He restored many failing monasteries and established many new ones. Known as “the great bull of debate,” he totally defeated in debate most of the pernicious attacks made by those expressing wrong views. His disciples filled the breadth of all directions, and illuminated the doctrine.
Dharmakirti initially studied logic under Ishvarasena, a disciple of Dignaga. The glorious Héruka granted Dharmakirti the accomplishment of universal triumph. In debate, he defeated non-Buddhist “bulls of debate” and an inconceivable number of brahmins, who all converted to Buddhism. He spread monasteries and Buddhist spiritual communities throughout every region. He composed many treatises, including seven treatises on logic. In brief, Dharmakirti was a unique, unrivalled sun of the teachings. As he himself stated:
If the sun of Dharmakirti’s speech Were to set,
Buddhist teachings would slumber or die,
And the non-Buddhist teachings would rise again!

In brief, in India, the land of exalted beings, from the time the perfect Buddha appeared in this world until the barbarians’ destruction of Vikramashila Temple in later times, especially exalted scholars and accomplished masters appeared uninterruptedly. The principal ones, as famous as the sun and moon, known as six adornments who beautify the world, are Nagarjuna, Asanga, and Dignaga—who wrote the classics—and Aryadeva, Vasubandhu, and Dharmakirti—who wrote commentaries. Shura, Rahulabhadra, Gunaprabha, and Dharmapala are the four supreme masters. Shantideva and Chandragomi are the two marvels; many other outstanding masters appeared, including Shakyaprabha and Haribhadra. In discourses and tantras, the Victor had predicted most of them as masters who would spread the doctrine and finally attain awakening. Their lives of liberation of amazing activity in preserving the doctrine, each in his own way, are unfathomable and inconceivable.

In general, after the Transcendent Conqueror taught action and conduct tantras (two of the four major classes of tantra) to this world’s humans, and to such beings as gods and noxious spirits, fortunate beings in India and elsewhere kept the tantras secret and practiced them, leading many to the achievement of secret mantra’s sublime accomplishments. In particular, not long after the third compilation of the teachings, when all the great way discourses arrived together [in this world] and spread, [these two classes of tantra] were openly practiced, and they flourished. It has been said that one hundred thousand or more awareness holders appeared who accomplished these tantras’ awareness mantras.

Just three hundred years after our teacher’s transcendence of sorrow, at the time Buddhist King Chandravardhana in Shambhala departed to the body of perfect rapture, the great Brahmin Rahula appeared in the region of Lada. He had many teachers, such as Master Avitarka and Visukalpa, king of Orissa, who went to Oddiyana, where a yogini transformed from a naga granted him Matrix of Mystery empowerment, and he attained accomplishment. In particular, Rahula received many tantras directly from Lord of Secrets and other sublime wisdom deities, and then attained sublime accomplishment. When he engaged in tantric conduct, he became known as Saraha. He brought many volumes of an ocean of tantras, including Buddha Skull, from the region of Oddiyana, and he composed A Commentary on “The Buddha Skull Tantra” and other texts.
Before Saraha, it seems that yoga and highest yoga tantras appeared directly only to supremely fortunate disciples but did not remain as continuous transmissions. Later, from this superb master’s time forward, these tantras flourished and endured in continuous transmissions. Therefore, Saraha is the supreme source of every tantra and accomplished master.

It has been taught that secret mantra’s tantras were brought from the region of Oddiyana; how is it that all secret mantra’s tantras dwelled there?
As related above, during the Transcendent Conqueror’s lifetime, the western kingdom of Oddiyana was located five hundred leagues west of Shravasti. There, the king known as Indrabhuti heard the Transcendent Conqueror’s name, had faith and paid homage, and mentally supplicated him. Thus, the Transcendent Conqueror appeared before him, emanated the sacred circle of Matrix of Mystery Unmoving Vajra, and granted empowerment to the king and his court. The Buddha taught the tantra that reveals special techniques to travel the spiritual path without relinquishing sensory pleasures, and he granted its subsequent profound instructions. The king comprehended the entire import of those teachings and began wide-ranging, elaborate tantric conduct. Thus he and his court attained the stage of awareness holder; this is known as this country being emptied all at once.
Immediately thereafter, a southern lake swelled; its waters along with many nagas filled the land. Vajra Holder entrusted volumes of tantras to those nagas, who changed themselves into human beings and built a city on the lakeshore. In cultivating their experience on the path, most attained accomplishment. Those who did not gain achievement became human beings; they and the monarchs who protected them all received Buddhist teaching.
Later, the lake dried up; on its dry bed stood Dharmaganja, called “Trove of the Teachings,” a palace that housed all secret mantra’s tantras. A city where many awareness-holding spiritual heroes and yoginis lived circled the palace. Due to the primary condition of this steady gathering of awakened beings, and a sublime convergence of auspicious connections, this land known as “Oddiyana, Land of the Dakinis” became the supreme source of the secret mantra vajra way.

The exalted master [Nagarjuna] and his spiritual heirs clearly elucidated the traditional path of glorious Matrix of Mystery as follows.
The great Brahmin [Saraha] granted the exalted master [Nagarjuna] empowerment, taught him the tantra and pith instructions; and entrusted the secret mantra doctrine to him. The master himself had also received teachings from sublime wisdom deities and others, and composed works on the secret mantra way in general, and specifically on the subject of Matrix of Mystery: [two texts] concerning the phase of creation—An Abridged Meditation Technique for Matrix of Mystery and The Stages of Meditation on Matrix of Mystery Blended with the Discourses; and, concerning the phase of completion, one major text—The Five Stages.
Nagarjuna’s heart-son Aryadeva elucidated these works by the exalted master, expanding upon them without distortion. His works include A Lamp for the Concise Practice, which has the attribute of not needing other supplementary texts; and a separate small text for self-consecration of the illusory body.
The exalted master’s direct disciple Nagabodhi composed The Twenty-Part Ritual for the Sacred Circle; A Graded Outline for the phase of creation; and Discerning Activity’s Culmination, concerning the phase of completion. Chandrakirti composed a commentary to the tantra, The Radiant Lamp; Narotapa later composed A Clear Summary of the Five Stages.
In general, we count fifty-some known Indian texts concerning Matrix of Mystery, yet the undisputed forebear of all these teachings is the exalted master’s cycle of root texts and commentaries mentioned above. Nevertheless, during the actual lifetimes of Nagarjuna, the father, and his spiritual heirs, those works were not commonly spread in forms such as those [in texts, which have] the three combinations [of terms, words, and letters]. The exalted master’s direct disciple Nagabodhi attained vajra rainbow body and lived at Shriparvata, where about seven hundred years after Nagarjuna’s passing, he accepted two disciples, the untouchable Matangipa and Prince Gomishra, to whom he gave the exalted master’s cycle of teachings. Rakshitapada, a master from Kongkana, met Chandrakirti [in a vision], then acquired the volume The Radiant Lamp. [The teachings on Matrix of Mystery] thus spread and flourished during a later period when the secret mantra way was openly practiced.

Three masters—Luyipa, Vajraghantapa, and Krishnacharya—initially founded the spiritual way of the tradition of glorious Supreme Bliss.

Luyipa
Master Luyipa appeared roughly contemporaneously with master Venerable Asanga and the Tibetan king Lha Totori Nyentsen. He had been the king of Oddiyana’s scribe by the name of Ever Virtuous. His first spiritual master was the accomplished master Shavaripa. In Bangala (eastern India), he ate fish entrails and practiced meditation, thus becoming known as Luyipa in Sanskrit, or “fish entrails man.” Having attained accomplishment, he used miracles to guide Orissa’s king and chief minister. Later, the king attained accomplishment as Darikapa. He and his court of sixty thousand achieved rainbow body. The minister attained accomplishment as Dingipa, and achieved rainbow body along with his circle of five hundred disciples.
Master Luyipa drew forth such tantras as The Tantra of Yoginis’ Conduct and composed the text Binder of the Wheel—A Description of the Deity, for which Kambala wrote a commentary. [Both these works] spread widely throughout all India and Tibet, becoming known as the springs from which the custom of Binder of the Wheel’s [another name for Supreme Bliss] practice has flowed.

Vajraghantapa
Vajraghantapa was a disciple of the accomplished master Darikapa. His actual name was Matigarbhashri. Vajra Sow openly foretold that he would be a scholar able to defeat Hindus’ challenges. When practicing in the region of Orissa, he first refused the king’s invitation. Later, he lived with a consort; as a result, people lost faith in him. To guide them, he emanated a son and daughter, and appeared once with them in a city. When people berated him, he struck his horn drinking vessel on the ground, and water gushed from the earth below. He turned the boy into a vajra, the girl became a bell, and he bore them in his hands. The master and his consort changed into the co-emergent form of Supreme Bliss and flew into the sky. By this display of miracles, he became known as Vajraghantapa [vajra and bell master]. From that time, he accomplished beings’ welfare through the secret mantra way. This master composed what is known as Vajraghantapa’s trilogy: a method of accomplishment for the sacred circle of the body of Supreme Bliss, an empowerment ritual, and a text on the five stages of the phase of completion.
He had many disciples who were accomplished masters, but the main one was Kurmapada, who placed Jalandharipa in the state of accomplishment, who then did the same for Krishnacharya, and so on.

Krishnacharya
The Latter Tantra of the Wheel of Time states:
An adept will appear named Krishna, holding a tantric staff , hand-drum, and beer vessel.
The Tantra of the Great Black Lord’s Manifest Presence states:
In that region of Uruvisha, an individual endowed with diligence will devote himself to [meditative] application. [His name will include] the first of the first set [of letters] and the fourth of the seventh, according to the alphabetical structure given by Ramana. This somewhat youthful sublime being will achieve the eight accomplishments, such as that of the sword. In this Land of Jambu, one such as he has never appeared and will not appear again. Six of his disciples will attain Great Seal’s accomplishment in which the physical body’s substance is abandoned.
Thus was his life foretold. One thousand, four hundred accomplished masters encircled him. He brought all the inhabitants of thirteen great districts to the state of vajra holder. His feats include retrieving The Tantra of Union from the hands of Dakini Subhagini. Encouraged by glorious Héruka’s command, this extremely great master composed what are known as Krishnacharya’s six works: three texts on the phase of creation— a method of accomplishment of Supreme Bliss, an empowerment ritual, and a burnt offering ritual; and three texts on the phase of completion— Spring Vital Essence, The Four Stages, and The Secret Absolute. Among the sources of the cycle of Supreme Bliss teachings, Krishnacharya’s tradition flourished the most. Later, Lord Naropa also identified this tradition alone as the principal one.

Virupa
Soon after Master Luyipa, Virupa, a disciple of Jinadeva, abbot of Nalanda, appeared. From Nagabodhi, he received Slayer of the Lord of Death’s empowerment, together with that meditation’s profound instructions; having meditated upon them, he achieved accomplishment. The sacred circle of fifteen goddesses around Selfless Goddess manifestly appeared and granted him empowerment: he eventually reached awakening’s sixth stage. His miracles subdued many Hindu practitioners, including the Hindu ruler of Varanasi. He retrieved Red Slayer of the Lord of Death from Oddiyana and composed texts that include that meditation’s methods of accomplishment. He was exceptional in his activity for the welfare of beings and the doctrine.
Saroruha
Master Saroruha, also known as Kukuraja, practiced tantric conduct, including celebrating vajra feasts together with many spiritual heroes and yoginis in the form of dogs. Relying on The Tantra of the Secret Moon Vital Essence, he achieved accomplishment. From Oddiyana, he retrieved The Tantra of Vajra of Delight, and also composed treatises, including that tantra’s method of accomplishment. He taught widely on the five esoteric tantras [listed below as Matrix of Mystery, Net of Magical Illusion Tantra, Union with the Buddhas, The Secret Moon Vital Essence, and Wrathful Manjushri] and yoga tantra.
Lalitavajra
Vajra Female Zombie manifestly revealed her face to Master Lalitavajra, and gave him empowerment within Slayer of the Lord of Death’s sacred circle. Having meditated on her pith instructions, he attained [the level of] meditative heat. He practiced the fearless conduct of awareness. In Oddiyana, he memorized many texts, including The Tantra of Black Slayer of the Lord of Death’s Wisdom Body, Speech, and Mind; The Three Vows; and Fearsome Vajra’s Seven Segments. He returned and elucidated them in the land of exalted beings and other places. Employing the activity of manifest wrathful conduct, he eradicated many Hindus and Persians hostile to Buddhism, and thus protected the doctrine.

A set of eighteen tantras, including Union with the Buddhas Tantra, appeared in the region of Zahor. Master Kukuraja explained and taught these to that land’s king, Indrabhuti. The king and his court appeared like the deities of the sacred circle of vajra basic space; their meditation on this led them all to sublime accomplishment. Indrabhuti’s son Shakyaprabhudi with his retinue likewise meditated and gained accomplishment. Shakyaprabhudi’s daughter Gomadevi with her entourage also gained accomplishment. These and other accounts are presented in The One Hundred and Fifty Verse Commentary to the Perfection of Sublime Insight.
It appears that this chronicle corresponds to the traditional explanation of the origin of the eighteen tantras [translated into Tibetan by] the early translation school.

An enumeration of the accomplished masters who appeared in India in earlier and later times, and accounts of their transmission of the teaching methods of the vajra way are inconceivable. Nevertheless, the main figures are those just mentioned, and the following:

Hayagriva
Born in China, Venerable Master Hayagriva attained the accomplishment of Horse Neck and Slayer of the Lord of Death. He retrieved from Oddiyana The Root Tantra of Manjushri and The Net of Magical Illusion Tantra in Sixteen Thousand Verses.

Dombi Héruka
Dombi Héruka, who attained accomplishment from a leather worker, Virupa’s disciple, subdued Senara, king of an eastern kingdom. He liberated all the human beings and domestic animals of that land and caused them to achieve [rebirth in] celestial realms. He retrieved from Oddiyana The Segment on Kurukullé and The Arali Tantra. To ascertain the meaning of the tantras with clairvoyance, he consulted with wisdom dakinis, then drew forth the essence of The Tantra of Vajra of Delight and composed many treatises, including The Meditation Technique of Selfless Goddess and Coemergent Accomplishment. In the region of Oddiyana, Dombi Héruka subjugated Vinasa, a woman who sold alcohol, who then empowered Kambala and entrusted him with the entirety of the tantras.

Kambala
Kambala slept for twelve years in clear light, and thus attained sublime accomplishment. He retrieved from Oddiyana The Tantra of Vajra of Delight and composed many treatises, including Svasamveda-prakrita, which primarily teaches the phase of completion. Oddiyana’s king, the middle Indrabhuti, had faith in Kambala, who placed the king in a state of sublime accomplishment.

Kukuripa
Kukuripa, the great accomplished master of Bangala in the east, retrieved from Oddiyana The Tantra of Mahamaya and composed six treatises, including a method of practice [for that tantra].

Gambhiravajra
The Kashmiri scholar Gambhiravajra retrieved The Vajra Nectar Tantra, which he transmitted to Master Amritaguhya. He in turn accepted Master Bhago [as his disciple], from whom the teachings spread.

Télopa
Tillipa [i.e., Tilopa], the great accomplished master of the eastern region of Jago, relied on Krishnacharya and other spiritual masters of four doctrinal transmissions [fierce inner heat, illusory body and clear light, lucid dreaming, and intermediate state and transference of consciousness]. Tilopa received secret mantra’s tantras in general and particularly the entire cycle of every extant empowerment, tantra, and pith instruction of the highest yoga tantras. Then for a period of twelve years in Bangala, he lived pounding sesame seeds, and thereby manifested sublime accomplishment.
Tilopa mainly received the entire vajra way from the sublime wisdom deity glorious Héruka. When he taught others, it is said that he alone emptied the kingdom of Bangala three times. In short, like the sun, he illuminated the essential doctrine of definitive secrets.

Shantigupta
In later times, during the tenth sixty-year cycle [1567–1626], the great accomplished master Shantigupta appeared in the land of Khagendra in southern India. He relied on the great accomplished master Jnanamitra with inconceivable hardship, and manifested sublime accomplishment. His exalted state and qualities definitely equaled those of such past great masters as Luyipa. This wondrous and outstanding master transmitted widely secret mantra’s doctrine in such lands as southern India and Koki. His disciples, including the great accomplished master Buddhagupta, appeared in countless numbers until the end of the age of conflict. These lords of accomplishment were suns that illuminated the doctrine of the secret mantra vajra way in the land of exalted beings. The great Lord of Jonang [Taranata] states:
In general, hundreds of thousands of awareness holders in the secret mantra tradition initially appeared in India. Then, from the time of glorious Saraha until King Dharmapala passed away, accomplished masters appeared continually, and moreover, many lived contemporaneously. Such an unbroken succession of accomplished masters lasted until Abhayakaragupta passed away. After him, sometimes not more than one appeared. In particular, during a later long period of time, Jnanamitra and Okaranata were the only living accomplished masters, but [they were unable] to greatly aid the Buddha’s doctrine. Eighty years after Okaranata passed away, the great accomplished master Shantigupta achieved accomplishment. Apart from the difference in the extent of his aid to others (due to the paucity of Buddhists in his historical period), his aid to others was like that of great Lord Naropa, and this master’s exalted state was even higher [than Naropa’s].

Prakashchandra
Yoga tantra’s cycle of teachings began with Prakashchandra, a minor king of the eastern Indian Chandra Dynasty of Bangala. [Bodhisattva] Vajra Holder manifestly blessed him and he became an accomplished master. He taught widely on yoga tantra; three of his followers became known as the three masters learned in yoga tantra:
Shakyamitra
Master Shakyamitra composed such texts as The Ornament of Kosala, a commentary on the yoga tantra A Synthesis of the Absolute. This work has had a lasting effect on [the tradition of] yoga tantra.
Buddhaguhya
Master Buddhaguhya caused the doctrine of the three classes of kriya [action], charya [conduct], and yoga tantra to flourish widely, and he composed such texts as A Commentary to Summarize “Vairochana’s Manifest Awakening Tantra,” An Extensive Commentary to “The Later Meditative Concentration Tantra,” and The Meditation Technique of the Vajra Basic Space of Phenomena.
Anandagarbha
In Bangala, Master Anandagarbha from Magadha met many teachers, including Subhutipalita, a disciple of Prakashchandra, and became learned in every yoga tantra. Meditating on those tantras, he saw the sacred circle of the vajra basic space of phenomena and received a prophecy that he should compose treatises. He taught and wrote commentaries on many yoga tantras, such as The Glorious Original Supreme Tantra and A Synthesis of the Absolute. Moreover, he wrote commentaries to many tantras [not among yoga tantras], such as Matrix of Mystery, illuminating secret mantra in general, and the yoga tantra system in particular.
Buddhashanti, Prajnapalita, and others also emphasized yoga tantra’s scholarship and meditation practice, and widely disseminated yoga tantra’s historical tradition.

Chilupa (also known as Pito Acharya the Elder) from Orvipa in the east became a great scholar. When he read every volume of the [three] collections and the tantras at the monasteries of Nalanda, Vikramashila, and Ratnagiri, he saw the necessity of commentaries written by bodhisattvas to reveal secret mantra’s ultimate concealed meaning. Having read that in Shambhala emanated kings taught these texts, and encouraged by a sublime wisdom deity, he decided to travel to Shambhala. On his way, the lineage-bearing monarch [of Shambhala] emanated in the form of a monk, blessed him, and granted him Wheel of Time’s empowerments, tantras, and pith instructions. Once he had memorized every text, Chilupa’s mind was satisfied and he returned [to India]. In Varendra, Chilupa accepted Pindopa the Younger as his disciple, and granted him the entirety of the empowerments, tantras, etc. When war’s destruction erupted, this master concealed the tantra and its commentaries; thus, the root tantra and commentaries later became incomplete.
Of special import to the lineage, the one known as Kalachakrapada the Elder appeared in Varendra. He met Chilupa the Younger, who could not satisfy this disciple. Kalachakrapada journeyed to Shambhala; on his way, he met the lineage bearer’s manifestation, who granted him empowerments and taught the pith instructions. After meditation [on those instructions], he attained accomplishment and arrived in Shambhala, where he received the empowerments, tantra commentaries, and pith instructions directly from the lineage bearer himself.

Kalachakrapada returned to India and extensively spread the cycle of the bodhisattvas’ commentaries. Among his disciples, Shri Bhadra, “Kalachakrapada the Younger,” entered discussions with five hundred scholars in Nalanda and overwhelmed them with his speech. All but Vakishvarakirti and Prajnakara touched [their heads to] his feet.6 [6. Not from disrespect, but because they were the principal gurus present.] He covered the earth with these teachings. Even kings, government officials, and great merchants had volumes of [the Wheel of Time teachings] written out, and developed a [positive] inclination toward them.
If one places accomplished masters of the Wheel of Time together in one group, and all those of other teachings together in another group (apart from those before the Wheel of Time tantra reached India), the Wheel of Time accomplished masters are more numerous.
Kalachakrapada the Younger’s son, named Nalandapa or Bodhibhadra, spread this tradition’s activity widely, such as giving instructions to the Kashmiri scholar Somanata. It is said that illustrious Naropa also emphasized and transmitted the Wheel of Time system.

Throughout the land of exalted beings, countless monasteries of the great and lesser ways appeared, but the best known tantric monastery was Vikramashila. After the conclusion of the Chandra Dynasty [i.e., Gupta], [a series of] fourteen Pala kings arose. King Dharmapala, fourth in that line, wielded extremely great power and influence. In Magadha’s northern edge, at the top of a knoll on the banks of the Ganges, he built what was lauded by the name Vikramashila, “The Nature of Complete Subjugation.” This great temple hosted scholars who illuminated the doctrine— many very great masters of the secret mantra way, such as Buddhajnana; and a succession of masters who defended Buddhism by uniting the discourse and secret mantra doctrines. These included those known as the six learned gate guardians; glorious Lord Atisha; Abhayakaragupta, the second buddha in this age of conflict; and the great scholar Shakyashri, who will become the seventh buddha in the future.

Buddhajnana
Among them, Master Haribhadra’s disciple Venerable Buddhajnana went to Oddiyana, where he pleased Mahalakshmi [by his practice]. He also received the empowerments, tantra, and pith instructions of Matrix of Mystery from Rakshitapada, Manjushrimitra, and others. He meditated on them, achieved accomplishment, then served in Vikramashila Monastery as the great vajra master of secret mantra. He taught the three [exoteric tantras]—kriya, charya, and yoga; five esoteric tantras—Matrix of Mystery, Net of Magical Illusion, Union with the Buddhas, The Secret Moon Vital Essence, and Wrathful Manjushri; and principally explained Matrix of Mystery’s tantras, thus making the vajra way’s doctrine flourish widely. His composition of such works as The Meditation Technique of Ever Excellent and the phase of completion text The Vital Essence of Liberation constitutes Buddhajnana’s tradition of Matrix of Mystery, known as one of this tantra’s major systems. He composed a set of fourteen texts, including Manjushrimitra’s Oral Instructions, a memorandum of [his teacher’s] speech, and he wrote many other works.
Buddhajnana had a large number of disciples, of whom the principal ones were eighteen regents who dwelled on the stages of awakening, and four supreme masters who transcended sorrow during their lifetimes: Dipamkarabhadra, Prashantamitra, Rahulabhadra, and Mahasukhatavajra. The great Lord [Taranata] lists the succession of masters who followed Buddhajnana in this verse summary:
The twelve lauded masters of Vikramashila
Are Buddhajnana, Dipamkarabhadra,
Jinabhadra from Langka, Shri Dhara, Bhavabhadra,
Bhavyakirti, Lilavajra,
Durjayachandra, Samayavajra,
Tatagatarakshita, Bodhibhadra,
And Kamalarakshita.
Then there were the six learned gate guardians and others,
And a multitude of masters of secret mantra.

The Six Gate Guardians
The six learned gate guardians used reason and their capabilities to guard the temple from Hindu and other challengers. The guardian of the eastern gate was Ratnakarashantipa, the omniscient master during the age of conflict; the guardian of the southern gate was Prajnakara; the guardian of the western gate was Vakishvarakirti; the guardian of the northern gate was Naropa; the guardian of the first central pillar was Brahmin Ratnavajra; and the guardian of the second central pillar was Jnanashrimitra. Each was an unrivalled prodigious scholar; they repulsed every attack from Hindus, composed a large number of treatises on the discourses’ and tantras’ doctrine, and performed exceedingly wondrous acts. They thus led their contemporaries to convert to Buddhism and illuminated like suns the joyous Buddha’s doctrine in general, and the great way in particular.

Atisha Dipamkara

It is said that his qualities as a scholar and meditator, and his deeds in transmitting the doctrine, were in no way inferior to those of earlier masters. Learned in all secret mantra tantras, he attained the path of seeing’s qualities. He had many vajra holder disciples, such as the great master Pitopa. In particular, his kindness and activity in the Himalayan region were exceptionally impressive.

Abhayakaragupta
Abhayakaragupta served as abbot at three Buddhist centers: Vajra Seat [Bodhgaya], Vikramashila, and Nalanda. A great lord of the doctrine, he was incomparable in his own time. He caused all lesser and great way teachings to flourish very widely, especially the perfection of sublime insight teaching system. After the six ornaments, it is said that no one so extensively served the doctrine and aided beings as did Ratnakarashantipa (one of the six learned gate guardians) and this master.
After Vajra Yogini blessed Abhayakaragupta and bestowed her authorization, he composed many profound and vast treatises on the secret mantra doctrine, including a commentary on Samputa Tantra, Sheaves of Pith Instructions; and The Garland Trilogy. For later generations, these treatises he wrote are like revitalizing nectar for someone on the point of death. It is said that no one followed him who was his equal as a prodigious scholar who illuminated the doctrine. He also knew this, so he left behind, like answering replies for future generations, eloquent treatises that clarified what had been unclear, compiled what had been scattered, and systematized what had become disorganized.
Abhayakaragupta had many disciples, such as Shubhakaragupta, who were vajra holders, were diligent vow keepers, had crossed the ocean of the Buddha’s teachings, and illuminated the doctrine. In particular, Ratnarakshita attained accomplishment and composed such texts as a commentary to The Origins of Binder of the Wheel Tantra. While Ratnarakshita served as the master of secret mantra at Vikramashila, those known as the twenty-four mahantas appeared and widely transmitted the doctrine of the vajra way.

In the region of Koki (which forms one of the three regions of eastern India), monastic communities appeared from the time of King Ashoka and later increased and proliferated. Before Vasubandhu, these communities were solely composed of the lesser way’s pious attendants. Some of Vasubandhu’s disciples propagated the great way there, where it continued to a minor degree. From the reign of King Dharmapala, a large number of disciples from these regions came to central India. In particular, during the reign of the four Sena Dynasty kings, about half of the monastic community in Magadha originated in Koki. As a result, the great way became very widespread [in Koki], and there, as in Tibet, no distinction was made between the great and lesser ways.
From the time of Abhayakaragupta, the secret mantra way also became very widespread [in Koki]. When the Turukshas conquered Magadha, most central Indian scholars fled to Koki and spread the doctrine widely there. Later, masters who were of supreme kindness to the secret mantra tradition (such as Vanaratna, who was accepted as a disciple by glorious Shavaripa) came from this country and journeyed to Tibet.
Later, a Koki king named Vasundhara appeared. In his land, the textual traditions of the monastic discipline, the collection on observed phenomena, and the great way were very widespread, but secret mantra teachings had become extremely rare apart from a few texts such as those related to Wheel of Time and The Garland Trilogy. Therefore, the king dispatched two hundred scholars as emissaries to the supremely accomplished master Shantigupta and other masters in Dravida and Khagendra in southern India, to have them train in secret mantra teachings. On their return, they revived [secret mantra in their homeland].
Further, in the land of exalted beings’ southern region, the doctrine flourished widely and continued without interruption. In later times in particular, the king of accomplishment Shantigupta’s powerful blessings ensured that the genuine doctrine of mainly secret mantra’s scholarship and practice greatly spread and was transmitted in Khagendra and in the midst of the Vindhya Hills. It is said as well that in some small lands in southeastern and southwestern India, portions of the discourse and secret mantra doctrines continued to exist until later times.

It is said that in the future, when the human life span increases to six hundred years, the sixteen exalted great elders will visibly reappear, fortunate individuals will renounce home life, and the doctrine will be transmitted. It is taught that the previously separated head and body of the exalted Master Nagarjuna, which still remain in India, will be rejoined, and he will aid beings.
The “others” [in the root text] refers to, among others, wise persons’ belief that the lineage-bearing [king of Shambhala] Rudrachakrin and his army will vanquish the barbarians and usher in a new age of perfection throughout this central southern continent. He will spread the doctrine, ensuring that the Victor’s doctrine will long endure.

When did the Buddha’s doctrine reach one of the Land of Jambu’s six major regions, Tibet, snowy land of red-faced people, adopted by exalted Bodhisattva Great Compassion as his own? The Root Tantra of Manjushri states:
In the Himalayas, a lake will shrink
And a sal forest will grow.
As foretold, at first an existing lake gradually dried up, and a thick forest flourished. Then a monkey blessed by [Bodhisattva] Great Compassion arrived from the realm of Potala and cohabited with a female ogre who lived in the cliffs. Ancient Tibetan chronicles state that the Tibetan people descend from their union. [In another account,] Master Prajnavarman’s A Commentary on “The Foremost Praise from the Gods” states that the five Pandava brothers, who lived at the outset of the era of conflict, defeated an army of eighteen regiments. At that time, a king called Rupati, fighting with a single regiment, escaped during battle disguised in women’s clothing. He entered the fastness of the Himalayas and stayed there; the Tibetan people descend from his family. Many such explanations [of the origins of the Tibetan people] have appeared. In any case, nonhumans first claimed this land. Humans gradually appeared, ruled by twelve minor kings and fourteen feudal lords.

The first human king to govern all Tibet was Nyatri Tsenpo. Concerning him, scriptures affirm that Tibet’s Buddhist kings descended from the Licchavi clan. Some believe the royal family comes from the continent Ominous Sound; some, that they descend from the royal Shakya line or from King Shantanika’s son. Some claim that their line begins five generations after Kosala King Prasanajit’s son; or five generations after the son of Tobchung, youngest son of King Bimbisara.
[Another account states that] King Udayana of Vatsa had a son whose eyebrows covered his eyes and whose fingers were connected by webs. This was feared to be a bad omen so he was put in a sealed copper container and sent down the Ganges River. A farmer found and raised him. When he had grown and the previous story was related to him, he became despondent and ran off to the Himalayan hills. In time, he reached the entrance to Lhari Yolwa. When he emerged at Tsentang Gozhi, Bönpos said that since he had arrived on a cord of light, he was a god. “Who are you?” they asked. “I am a ruler [Tibetan: “tsenpo”],” he replied. “Where have you come from?” they asked, and he pointed to the sky. At that, they set him on a wooden palanquin [“tri”], which four people bore on the nape of their necks [“nya”]; and so it was that he was called Nyatri Tsenpo, ruler of the nape-borne palanquin. His descendents, including his son Mutri Tsenpo, ruled in dynasties designated by such names as the seven heavenly thrones, the six earthly goodnesses, the seven fragments, and five generations of kings named Tsen. During these earlier kingdoms, legends and enigmatic riddles guided the system of government.

The Stainless Goddess Prophecy states:
Twenty-five hundred years after my transcendence of sorrow,
the sacred teachings will spread to the land of the red-faced people.
As foretold, during the twenty-seventh dynasty, when King Lha Totori Nyentsen, emanation of Bodhisattva Ever Excellent, lived in Yumbu Lagang Palace, a container fell on the palace roof. Opening it, he found The Discourse of One Hundred Homages to Renunciation and Fulfillment; the long mantra [of Bodhisattva All-Seeing One], chindamani, carved on a bowl; The Discourse of the Container; the six-syllable mantra [of All-Seeing One]; and a golden stupa. Although he didn’t know what these were, he understood them to be good. He called them by the name “Strict Secret,” made offerings, and venerated them; their blessings returned the sixty-one-year-old king to sixteen-year-old youthfulness. Living another sixty years, he reached the age of one hundred and twenty. He received a prophecy that after five generations in his family, the meaning of these events would be understood. Thus did the sacred teachings reach Tibet.
Although this account has been interpreted in many ways, Nelpa Pandit states that the so-called falling [of the objects] out of the sky is a Bön tale because Bönpos like space. He says that in fact Scholar Buddhirakshita and Translator Tilésé bore the two texts on their arrival in Tibet, but as the king was illiterate and couldn’t understand their meaning, the scholar and translator returned home. This is probably the case.
Later, when Ba Salnang went to Nepal to meet the abbot Shantarakshita, the abbot said, “During the time of Kashyapa’s doctrine, the three of us—the Tibetan king, you, and I—were a poultry woman’s three sons, and we made aspirations to spread the doctrine in Tibet. The king hadn’t been born yet and you were not old enough, so I have waited here for nine royal generations, until now.” Most scholars consider that since this is quoted in the pure Ba Salnang’s Chronicles, it is truthful.

The Root Tantra of Manjushri states:
In what is known as “land of the gods”
Among the Himalayan mountains,
A king called a god among humans
Will appear in the Licchavi clan.
As foretold, in the fifth generation after Lha Totori Nyentsen, Lord All-Seeing One showed himself in the guise of a human leader: at thirteen, the Buddhist King Songtsen Gampo assumed the throne. When the king was fifteen, the emanated monk Akaramati Shila brought the self-formed [statue] of the exalted bodhisattva [All-Seeing One to Tibet]. The king commanded the Buddhist official Gar, emanation of Bodhisattva Vajra Holder: “Bring to Tibet life-size statues that are actual representatives of our teacher at the age of eight and twelve years old.”[7] To that end, the king conformed to worldly customs and married two women known as lotuses in the lake: the Nepali bride Tritsun, an emanation of Frowning Goddess, and the Chinese bride Princess Wencheng Gonju, emanation of Tara. Since nonhuman spirits impeded the construction of the Temple of Magical Manifestation [now called the Jokang, in Lhasa], the three — the king and the two queens — entered retreat at Kyishö Valley’s Nyangtren Rock, known as Maru Palace. They practiced the wisdom deity and gained success. Then, as foretold, on vital points on the land which is a demoness lying supine, they constructed border-subduing and suppression temples, conquering evil enemy earth spirits. They erected in Lhasa the structure and contents of Ramoché Temple and the Temple of Magical Manifestation. The king invited Master Kusara and Brahmin Shamkara from India;
Master Shila Manju from Nepal; Master Hashang Mahayana from China, and others. They translated many of the three collections and parts of the tantras, and thus introduced Buddhist customs.

Although the king did not openly study or teach, he secretly imparted to many fortunate persons profound instruction on the peaceful and wrathful aspects of Great Compassion. They cultivated their experience and it is said that [at that time, generations] before the seven men under examination renounced home life [i.e., the first Tibetan monks], about one hundred long-haired adepts continually engaged in the contemplative practice of Great Compassion at Kyishö Valley’s Nyangtren Rock.
All the teachings the king imparted during that time were compiled as the cycle of the king’s testament and concealed as three treasures. Three treasure revealers — the accomplished master Drup-tob Ngödrup, Lord Nyang-ral Nyima Özer, and the teacher Shakya Ö — drew them from their treasure repositories. Now known as The Hundred Thousand Instructions on the “Mani” Mantra, this represents Tibet’s first indigenous Buddhist text.

The king dispatched Tonmi Sambhota, emanation of Bodhisattva Gentle Melody, to India to learn linguistics and writing. Using Indian letters as a model, he invented Tibetan orthography and composed eight treatises on grammar. Previously in the Himalayan region, there had been no Buddhist discussion of what was to be adopted and what was to be rejected. This point marked the initial opening of the great gateway of the sacred teachings and Buddhist discourse.

Then, after five royal generations had passed, Gentle Melody’s magical manifestation Lord Trisong Déutsen appeared. His ancestor Songtsen Gampo had foretold, “Five generations of our family from now, during the time of my descendent called King Dé, the sacred teachings will appear.” He engraved this on a copper plate and placed it in the king’s vault. When the predicted time arrived, King Trisong Déutsen developed the intention to spread the sacred teachings. He invited the abbot from Zahor, Shantarakshita, who imparted the eight precepts to some people and gave teachings relating to the ten virtues and the eighteen sense constituents. At this, Tibet’s hostile gods and demons became incensed and acted harmfully, making various obstacles.
The time [of the ripening] of previous aspirations and prayers thus arrived: as the abbot advised, the king invited to Tibet the master from Oddiyana, Padmasambhava. When the king had reached twenty-two years of age, the foundation of glorious Samyé Monastery was laid. Padmasambhava performed the earth consecration ritual; Bodhisatto [i.e., Shantarakshita], the geomancy. Using [India’s] Odantapuri Temple as a model, they constructed the arrangement of [this world system’s] Supreme Mountain, twelve continents, the pair of the sun and moon, and circle of iron mountains. In one [twelve-year] cycle, the work was completed, and the two—abbot and adept—performed the consecration.

Those known as the one hundred and eight scholars, including that abbot and master, as well as Master Vimalamitra, Shantingarbha, and Dharmakirti; and Tibetan translators, including Bérotsana, Kawa Paltsek, and Chokro Lu’i Gyaltsen, translated the texts on monastic discipline, every discourse of the lesser and great ways, and the main treatises of commentary; and they founded major schools of study and meditation practice. Translations and teachings of secret mantra were extremely secret and reserved as private instruction.
It is said that there were twelve colleges, one hundred and eight accomplished masters each at Yerpa and Chuwori, and twenty-five great accomplished masters at Chimpu, etc. Particularly, great Master Padmasambhava accepted as disciples infinite numbers of fortunate persons, including twenty-five disciples (the king and his subjects), within the unsurpassable secret mantra way; the numbers of those who traveled to the exalted state of supreme accomplishment exceed all reckoning.
Master Padmasambhava concealed countless treasures of teaching and wealth, subdued all hostile gods and demons, and issued commands to the twelve subterranean goddesses. He thus prevented Hindu intrusion [into the country]. He consecrated most of the land, such as mountains and cliffs, as sites for spiritual practice. The occasions of his kindness to the beings of the Himalayas, such as emanating in a series of individuals who are his representatives, cannot be contained, even by space.

Buddhist King Trisong Déutsen had three sons, brother princes. The eldest was known as Muné Tsépo; the middle, Murum Tsépo; the youngest, Mutik Tsépo or Sénalek Jingyön. They increasingly propagated the doctrine’s spirit. In particular, when Muné Tsépo ruled, he established four great offering festivals at Samyé Monastery, and he equalized the want and wealth of his Tibetan subjects three times.
Mutik Tsépo constructed Karchung Dorjé Ying Temple. He had five sons, of which the most outstanding was a magical manifestation of Bodhisattva Vajra Holder—Tri Ralpachen or Tridé Tsukten. It is said that he offered seven families of his subjects to each ordained person and that he constructed a thousand temples. He had the two religious divisions [of ordained persons and yogis] place their feet on the ends of his hair ribbons, and presented them offerings and honor. Such acts of his veneration to the precious teachings’ spirit were limitless.

Tri Ralpachen constructed Changdo Pémé Tashi Gépel Temple at Ön on the lower Kyichu River. From India, he invited many scholars, including Surendra Bodhi, Shilendra Bodhi, and Danashila; [and assembled] the Tibetan scholars Ratnarakshita and Dharmata Shila, and translators, such as Jnanaséna. To them he said, “In my forefathers’ time, when the translators and scholars translated the teachings, among terms unknown in Tibetan, they used some words inconsistent with Buddhist scriptures and the vyakarana system, and which are difficult to understand. For these, search for valuable words from our language and add them, revising the translations to make them consistent with the terminology of the lesser and great ways.” Thus in Penyul’s Kawa Namo Ché, the extensive version of the mother [discourse on the perfection of sublime insight] was revised and made into sixteen volumes. Likewise, most of the scriptures translated during his forefathers’ time were finalized using contemporary language. Since secret mantra’s inner tantras were very strict, and accessible only to qualified recipients, not to common, unsuitable persons, the original translations were left unchanged.
Therefore, here in Himalayan region, those who had the greatest impact on the Victor’s doctrine and who were kindest to beings were these [members of what is] known as “the dynasty of Buddhist kings.” Among them, the kindness of Songtsen Gampo and Trisong Déutsen was most exceptional; the kindness of Abbot Shantarakshita and Padmasambhava, translators Tonmi Sambhota, Bérotsana, and the three—Kawa Paltsek, Chokro Lu’i Gyaltsen, and Zhang Yeshé-dé — was marvelous.

Whether or not the Victor’s doctrine exists [in any country] is determined entirely upon whether or not the training and practice of the vows of individual liberation exist there. [What follows is a description] of how those who hold the collection of the sacred teachings on monastic discipline, the basis of all the Buddha’s doctrine, appeared [in Tibet].
When Buddhist King Trisong Déutsen heard that the great abbot from Zahor [named] Bodhisatto or Shantarakshita, lord of all collections of teachings and the entire doctrine, was staying in Nepal, he sent Ba Salnang as an envoy to invite him. With deep respect, the king served the scholar attentively and invited from India twelve monks of the substantialist order.
At one point, to determine if Tibetans were capable of living as homeless renunciants, the king requested Ba Trizik, his close advisor and a faithful Buddhist, to take ordination. Bodhisatto served as abbot; Danashila and Jinamitra, the action master and secret teacher; and ten other scholars, the full assembly. Ba Trizik renounced home life and took monastic vows of full ordination. His monastic name was Palyang; lauded by the king, he was also known as Ba Ratna. Having meditated, he became endowed with five kinds of clairvoyance. Then, Ba Salnang, Pagor Bérotsana, Ngenlam Gyalwa Chok-yang, Ma Rinchen Chok, Kön Lu’i Wangpo Sungwa, and Lasum Gyalwa Jangchub respectively renounced home life, changed their names to Yeshé Wangpo, etc., and took full ordination. These seven, known as the seven men under examination, constitute the first Tibetans to renounce home life. The king then concluded that Tibetans could renounce home life, so his close advisor Drama and three hundred intelligent subjects were ordained. As all Tibetans heeded the king’s commands, the king instituted the major Buddhist law that the king and his subjects should all make those who had renounced home life the foremost recipients of their offerings, and should honor, venerate, and respect them. A stone pillar with this edict [engraved upon it] was erected.
One hundred translators, including Kawa Paltsek, studied with the seven men under examination. In turn, one thousand assistant translators, including Chokro Lu’i Gyaltsen, studied under [the hundred]: countless sublime individuals—emanations, translators, and monks—appeared.

Due to perverted aspirations, a demon entered the mind of Lord Tri Ralpachen’s younger brother, Lang Darma Udum Tsen, and he suppressed Buddhism. During that time, three of Ba Ratna’s disciples—Mar Shakyamuni, Yo Géjung, and Tsang Rabsal—took the texts of monastic discipline in one mule-load and went [eastward] to Golok and Mongolia. Unable to propagate the doctrine there, they journeyed to Kham [eastern Tibet]. While meditating and living in Malung at Dorjé Drakra Enchung Nam-dzong, or the hermitage of Dentik Shel, [a man named] Muzuk Labar went to investigate, developed faith in them, and requested to renounce home life. Mar Shakyamuni served as abbot and Yo Géjung as the master, and he was ordained. They named him Shakya Géwa Rabsal. He requested full ordination but [the necessary quorum of] five fully ordained monks was not complete. They sought Lhalung Palgyi Dorjé, who lived in Den, who replied, “Since I killed the evil king, it is impossible for me to join the full assembly. However, I will look for another monk and send him.” He sent two, the Chinese monks Kéwang and Gyipen; as this completed the assembly of five, [Shakya Géwa Rabsal] took full ordination. He studied monastic discipline for fifteen years with the abbot and master. Later, he studied monastic discipline with Gorong Sengé Drak, the perfection of sublime insight with Kawa Ö Chok-drak, and the mind cycle of great perfection with Yudra Nyingpo. The explanation of The Sovereign All-Creating Mind Tantra passed through him until later times. Due to his outstanding activity, illustrated by these examples, and his vast knowledge, he was also known as Lachen Gongpa Rabsal (the great lama with brilliant realization).
Five years after he received full ordination, Lord Yeshé Gyaltsen and others sent to Kham five persons from central Tibet, including Lumé Tsultrim Sherab, and five persons from western Tibet, including Lotön Dorjé Wangchuk, to repair the doctrine’s deterioration in central Tibet. On a single occasion, those ten men received the three-part full ordination in stages; they then studied monastic discipline and became learned in it.

Thus, Lachen Gongpa Rabsal granted the full ordination at one time without having completed the requisite ten-year supplementary qualification for an elder. Nevertheless, because Lachen was known to be a bodhisattva acting on his aspirations, because [the others who officiated] on this occasion—Mar Shakyamuni, Yo Géjung, and Tsang Rabsal— were special individuals, and because there was an important purpose in that the doctrine had reached a crossroad between its disappearance or re-emergence, holy persons deemed the ordination appropriate and authorized it as faultless. At the ordination, Mar Shakyamuni, Yo Géjung, and Tsang Rabsal were present, but said they were too elderly to continually keep disciples, so they served as action masters [while Lachen Gongpa Rabsal, who they themselves had ordained, served as abbot]. He appointed Lumé Tsultrim Sherab abbot; the ten men from central and western Tibet returned [to central Tibet] and became teachers to the country’s rulers.

Lumé Tsultrim Sherab’s disciples included four “pillars,” eight “beams,” thirty-two “rafters,” and one thousand “planks”; he thus restored the doctrine’s decline from its foundation. He founded countless monastic centers, such as Lamo Ragyel, Yerpa, and Baré Tsongdu. His disciple from Yamshu, Geshé Trapa, is said to have alone established one hundred and eight monastic centers. In these and other ways, it was as if monastic centers founded by Master Lumé Tsultrim Sherab and his disciples covered the earth. Every day, the ranks of the spiritual community who had renounced home life greatly increased.
This was known as the tradition of monastic discipline from lower Tibet; these were the men who renounced home life during the period of the early translations. Later, Yudra Nyingpo’s magical manifestation Lochen Dharmashri transmitted widely this tradition’s teachings and practices; thus, the unique ornament of the Tibetan Himalayas, Orgyen Mindrol Ling’s monastic community and its branch institutions, [preserve] this line of the vows. Most of the earliest sublime individuals who persevered in the vows during the doctrine’s later propagation, and most of the spiritual mentors of the old and new Kadampa orders, were diligent in this lineage of vows. These include many outstanding holders of monastic discipline, such as Gya Duldzin, Matso Changdor, Ja Duldzin, and Shami Mönlam Dorjé. Many well-known sublime individuals appeared uninterruptedly [later within this lineage], such as the great Translator Rinchen Zangpo, Putopa, Pu-chungwa, Sharawa Yönten Drak, Translator Ngok Loden Sherab, Dré Sherab Bar, Dakpo Lhajé [Gampopa], Drogön Pakdru, and Chomden Rikpé Raldri.

Shakyashri, a great Kashmiri scholar known to be a magical manifestation of Great Illumination, the third buddha in the future, mastered the entirety of the discourses and tantras and had visions of many wisdom deities. He physically cultivated the twelve qualities of training and was chief among all holders of monastic discipline of his time. His widespread renown was such that it was said, “Even one offering of alms to him causes rebirth in the Heaven of the Thirty-three.” When he lived in India, Translator Chal Chökyi Zangpo, Chak Drachom, and others from Tibet took full ordination in his presence.
Translator Tropu Champa Pal invited the great scholar himself to Tibet, resulting in boundless activity. Eleven men took full ordination one day at Chushul Sokma Monastery; among them, Droshul Khergé Jangchub Pal and Dorjé Pal from Tsang became his main disciples. Jangchub Pal founded Gendun Gang; and Dorjé Pal, Nyémo Tsalmik. Their two disciples Umdzé Sönam and Könchok Gyaltsen started four groups, including Chölung and Jé-dzing, from which what became known as the four communities flourished.
In the upper temple of Nyang-tö Gyen, Jamyang Sakya Pandita took full ordination; he transmitted [this vow lineage] widely. In particular, the vow lineages of the two named Pal have spread and flourished until the present within the Karma Kagyu and Sakya traditions: the omniscient Karmapas’ successive incarnations have accepted Jangchub Pal’s vow lineage, while Buddha Vajra Bearer Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo accepted that of Dorjé Pal. Sakya Pandit’s vow lineage later flourished through the activity of the great fifth Dalai Lama.
It seems that Chölung and Jé-dzing monasteries’ vow lineages no longer exist today. In general, although each vow lineage died out within each of the four communities’ monastic colleges, they were passed elsewhere and transmitted. Countless sublime individuals, scholars, and accomplished masters well known during Buddhism’s later propagation appeared in this vow lineage. In particular, the omniscient master of the age of dispute, Butön Rinchen Drup, and the precious lord father Lozang Drakpa [Tsongkapa] and his spiritual sons filled this great world with their especially exalted teachings and practice of the sacred teachings of monastic discipline.

After Lang Darma‘s suppression of Buddhism, Tibet became [politically] fragmented. However, in upper Ngari, at a period when the Buddhist kings’ dynasty had only patches of authority, the later propagation of Buddhism began. Lha Lama Yeshé Ö invited from India Scholar Dharmapala, who inspired many men, including three named Pala, to renounce home life and take full ordination. Among these, Prajnapala had a disciple Zhang Zhung Gyalwé Sherab, who met many scholars. In particular, under the Nepalese holder of monastic discipline Prétaka, he studied and became learned in all practices of monastic discipline. With the Kashmiri Jnanashila, he studied The Concise Version of Monastic Discipline, a commentary on The Individual Liberation Discourse; with the Kashmiri Shri Subhuti Shanta, the root text and commentary to Three Hundred Verses on Monastic Discipline; and with Samanta Shri Jnana, The Fifty-Verse Karika for Novices and questions [to be posed to monks at ordination]. His revisions, translations, and teachings, etc., produced excellent definitive [editions of these texts]. Zhang Zhung Gyalwé Sherab’s disciple, Translator Paljor, studied The Fully Ordained Monks’ Karika with the Nepalese Master Jayakara, and The Discourse on the Bases of Training for Novices with the Kashmiri masters Barahita and Mahajana: the lineage has come progressively through them.
In brief, the Pala transmission, better known as the monastic discipline from upper Tibet, did not flourish extensively, only slightly. Nevertheless, this lineage did produce a few outstanding scholars and accomplished masters, such as Translator Gö Zhönnu Pal and Chen-nga Chökyi Drakpa, who took full ordination within this lineage of vows.
All three vow lineages belong to the substantialist order. Here in Tibet, by command of the Buddhist kings, except for the middle way view and the substantialist order of monastic conduct, no other [views or monastic orders] were authorized [to be transmitted in the country]. Therefore, since Atisha, for example, belonged to the majority order, he wasn’t asked to transmit that vow lineage.

The sacred teachings of Buddhism can be synthesized as those found in scripture and in realization. The way to preserve these doctrines is, in the case of scriptural teachings, to come to a conclusion through teaching and study. In the case of the doctrine of realization, one makes meditation practice on the meaning of what one has heard one’s spiritual path, cultivating the experience of the thirty-seven aspects of awakening in one’s own stream of being. This is how the doctrine of realization must be preserved. Venerable Master Vasubandhu states:
Our teacher’s doctrine has two aspects —
Epitomes of scripture and realization.
These can be preserved only through articulating [the teachings]
And through meditation practice.

I will first describe the origin of the teaching lineage of the sacred teachings of monastic discipline. In the beginning in southern India, four principal orders of pious attendants existed, each of which used a different language, such as Sanskrit, to encode the root text, The Individual Liberation Discourse. In turn, each had different explanatory scriptures for that root text’s four sections of monastic discipline. These four orders split into eighteen, and it was said that each kept its own separate root and explanatory scriptures. Here, I will describe the substantialist order’s system—the series of their four explanatory scriptures [The Scripture of Distinctions, The Minor Scripture on Monastic Discipline, The Basic Scripture on Monastic Discipline, and The Highest Scripture] and the meaning of their contents—according to Serdok Panchen.
The Scripture of Distinctions provides a commentary to the words of The Individual Liberation Discourse. The Minor Scripture on Monastic Discipline expands upon the fine points of training to elucidate the general meaning of The Individual Liberation Discourse. The Basic Scripture on Monastic Discipline is a supplementary text to complete anything left out. The Highest Scripture is crucial in that it resolves contentious issues. Treatises of explanation include The Great Treasury of Detailed Exposition, which is said to present the pious attendants’ own monastic discipline.

Concerning monastic discipline held in common with the great way, among Vasubandhu’s four disciples more learned than himself, the one more learned in monastic discipline was a brahmin, Master Gunaprabha, who dwelled on awakening’s third stage, Luminous. He systematized what had lacked order in the four scriptures, subsuming their topics into [the monastic legal code’s] seventeen bases in his work, The Basic Discourse on Monastic Discipline. Among his other books, he collected [the monastic community’s] activity rituals into one place in the text Karma Shatam. The arhat Vishakhadéva wrote The Continual Flower Garland; the Kashmiri Sanghabhadra wrote The Fifty-Verse Karika for Novices; and Master Shakyaprabha wrote the root text and commentary of Three Hundred Verses on Monastic Discipline, and so on. Among all of these, Gunaprabha and Shakyaprabha are widely recognized as the chief authorities.
It is said that five hundred disciples of Gunaprabha could recite [from memory] the one hundred thousand sections of monastic discipline. Among these men, Dharmamitra wrote An Extensive Commentary to “The Basic Discourse on Monastic Discipline,” which became the authoritative work on the subject everywhere in India and Tibet. Six masters named Mitra—Vimalamitra, Vishésamitra, Kalyanamitra, Géwé Shenyen, and Shilamitra—and others extensively explained and transmitted this lineage.

In this Himalayan land, Chokro Lu’i Gyaltsen received [the teaching lineage of monastic discipline] from two masters from the land of exalted beings, Danashila and Jinamitra. Mar Shakyamuni, Yo Géjung, and Rabsal of Tsang requested it from Chokro Lu’i Gyaltsen; they in turn taught Lachen Gongpa Rabsal; and the four of them taught Lumé Tsultrim Sherab, who taught Zu Dorjé Gyaltsen. [The lineage also passed] from both Danashila and Jinamitra to Shakyasena, Dharmapala, and to Translator Lupa and Kyok Duldzin. Zu Dorjé Gyaltsen met them, [received their lineage,] and united the two teaching lineages of upper and lower Tibet. The masters known as Zu’s four sons (two sons from western Tibet—Dzimpa Sherab Ö and Néso Drakpa Gyaltsen; and two sons from central Tibet—Pochung Tsultrim Lama and Len Tsul-jang) extensively spread and transmitted this [combined] lineage. Later, Tsonapa the Great appeared [within this lineage]; in a dream, he received teachings on The Basic Discourse on Monastic Discipline from Gunaprabha. At the request of the protector Trakshé, he composed such texts as a detailed explanation of monastic discipline, Rays of Sunlight, and thereby established the foundation for the doctrine of monastic discipline.
Other famous Tibetan masters of monastic discipline during Buddhism’s later propagation include Gyadulwa Wangchuk Tsultrim and Jadulwa Wangchuk Bar, each of whom wrote a commentary to The Basic Discourse on Monastic Discipline and founded monastic colleges such as Zulpu. Thus it was said that monastic discipline had gone to the birds [a pun on another meaning of the name Ja, “Bird”]. Furthermore, many especially exalted individuals appeared, such as Tsi Dulwa Dzinpa. The stream of his teaching lineage passed from Sönam Drak to omniscient Butön Rinchen Drup.

Moreover, the great scholar from Kashmir, Shakyashri, also taught The Basic Discourse on Monastic Discipline to Sakya Pandit. During a monsoon season retreat at Narlé Moché, his teaching of Vishakhadéva’s The Continual Flower Garland was received by both Sengé Zilnön and Shangpa Joten, and each wrote a commentary to the text. Tsémé Kyébu received teachings on this text from the former. Butön Rinchen Drup learned it from Tsémé Kyébu and then composed a lengthy commentary. Thus, omniscient Butön Rinchen Drup received the legacy of the monastic discipline teaching lineage and composed such works as The Great Compendium of Activity Rituals and A Commentary on the Difficult Points of “The Basic Discourse on Monastic Discipline.” He exhibited scholastic prowess; at the depths of this era of dispute he was a lamp illuminating the doctrine, performing the activity of a second powerful Sage.
Furthermore, Omniscient Rongpo relied on Nakrin Panchen’s instruction and received an Indian text. Another lineage of exposition appeared based on its complete explanation that informed his definitive writings. In brief, among the treatises on monastic discipline, the teaching lineage of The Basic Discourse on Monastic Discipline from past generations continues to the present day.

The foundation of scholastic activity is the great ocean-like collection on observed phenomena, the abhidharma—the sacred teachings’ mother text, and all Buddhist teachings’ basis and gateway. Its explanatory treatises [are twofold]: the great way’s collection on observed phenomena which [originated with] Asanga, who received One Hundred Thousand Verses on Observed Phenomena and other texts from Maitreya and wrote A Compendium of Observed Phenomena. The lesser way’s collection on observed phenomena [originated with Asanga’s] younger brother, Vasubandhu, who wrote The Treasury of Observed Phenomena along with an autocommentary. These two brothers’ texts are known as the higher and lower collections on observed phenomena.
The Kashmiri Master Stiramati, Master Jinaputra, and others wrote commentaries to A Compendium of Observed Phenomena. Vasubandhu’s own master, Kashmiri Sanghabhadra, and his [Vasubandhu’s] disciples Dignaga, Stiramati (who was more learned in the collection on observed phenomena than Vasubandhu himself), Purnavardhana, Jinaputra, Vasumitra, and others wrote and transmitted commentaries to The Treasury of Observed Phenomena and further explanations of those commentaries.

Here in Tibet during the early propagation of the doctrine, Scholar Jinamitra, Translator Kawa Paltsek and others translated and taught three [subjects]—cosmological nomenclature, cause nomenclature, and action nomenclature—from the nomenclature treatises, such as The Victor’s Spiritual Heir, derived from commentaries and autocommentaries to the higher and lower collections on observed phenomena. Of their three disciples—Nanam Dawé Dorjé, Lhalung Palgyi Dorjé, and Wé Yeshé Gyalwa—the latter went to eastern Tibet and taught Drum Gyalwé Yeshé. From him this line of teaching spread upward into the provinces of central and western Tibet. Omniscient Dharmakara states:
Translator Gö Zhönnu Pal and others state that the lineage that spread from this time forward is exclusively that of the higher collection on observed phenomena. Although they claim that the teaching lineage of The Treasury of Observed Phenomena did not have any succession (and it might be that this teaching tradition spread A Compendium of Observed Phenomena as the more important [of the two]), The Treasury of Observed Phenomena and its commentary must have definitely appeared in this lineage because all scholars, such as omniscient Butön Rinchen Drup, refer to this source of the lineage as the principal one.
Afterward, Drangti Darma Nyingpo gained mastery in the teaching and study of A Compendium of Observed Phenomena. The great Translator
Pang Loten composed an explanatory text, The Illumination of Knowledge; and the great Scholar Shakya Chok-den wrote The Thought’s Meaning: A Series of Ocean Waves and other texts. Although they then transmitted this tradition, and in the interim the teaching and study of The Treasury of Observed Phenomena spread, the teaching and study of A Compendium of Observed Phenomena were lost: the lineage no longer exists.

The principal present-day spread of The Treasury of Observed Phenomena’s teaching lineage [originates with] Naropa’s disciple, Scholar Smriti Jnana. He journeyed to Tibet and taught The Treasury of Observed Phenomena at Denlong Plain in Kham. Many scholars and monks gathered; he laid the foundation for the lower collection on observed phenomena. His disciples Yé Chenpo Sherab Drak and others transmitted the teachings throughout the three regions of central, western, and eastern Tibet.
Drangti Darma Nyingpo was the designated heir of both teaching traditions of higher and lower collections on observed phenomena. His disciples Rok Chökyi Tsöndru and Gowo Yeshé Jungné, the latter’s disciple Ben Könchok Dorjé, and his disciple Togar Namdé (or To Kunga Dorjé) spread these teachings far and wide. Chimtsön Sengé composed a commentary known as Running Letters, the first Tibetan commentary on the collection on observed phenomena. Subsequently, many scholars — Chim Namka Drak, Samten Zangpo, Chomden Rikpé Raldri, Rendawa, and their lineage holders—wrote commentaries and transmitted them.

The Treasury of Observed Phenomena
Thus, with regard to this subject of the collection on observed phenomena, Serdok Panchen presents it summarized in two points: the subject of the collection, ultimate knowledge—the training in superior sublime insight and its attendant factors; and how that subject is expressed—the verbal collection on observed phenomena, our teacher’s excellent speech. Most Tibetans quote from The Treasury of Observed Phenomena:
The collection on observed phenomena is flawless sublime insight and that which follows it. Since this is what is to be attained, there is both this [sublime insight] and its treatises.
This quote refers to ultimate knowledge and representative knowledge. The first [ultimate knowledge] is flawless sublime insight that discerns phenomena’s specific and general characteristics, along with the five psycho-physical aggregates. The second [representative knowledge] has two parts: flawed knowledge and the treatises. First, contaminated knowledge is knowledge gained from listening, reflection, and meditation, [that is, knowledge that] has arisen from application or which is innate. The second is treatises, such as the seven texts on observed phenomena.
To explain those subjects, all the contents of the treatise The Treasury of Observed Phenomena are summarized within its body’s outline into two sections — defiled afflictive emotions and complete purity—[referred to with the words] “contaminated and uncontaminated phenomena.” How these are connected in sequence within the treatise is as follows.
Phenomena that are synthesized into [two categories,] contaminated and uncontaminated, can also be summarized into psycho-physical aggregates, sense constituents, and sense bases. Therefore, Chapter One presents the framework of the aggregates, sense constituents, and so on. Since the presentation of the sense constituents is the largest part, Chapter One is said to be The Treasury of Observed Phenomena’s chapter on the sense constituents.
Likewise, Chapter Two presents the senses, since defiled afflictive emotions and complete purity enter through the sense faculties and are the focus of them.

Chapter Three presents the world system’s vessel and contents. [This includes] the stages of birth, along with interdependent arising, of those who embody sense constituents and faculties—sentient beings imbued with afflictive emotions, differentiated by such details as their realms and places of birth. This chapter also describes how the [world-system’s] vessel comes into being.
Chapter Four presents karma. While there is limitless diversity in vessels [worlds] and their contents [beings], karma has created them, there being no other creator.
Chapter Five presents the afflictive emotions in full detail. Karma can create [worlds and beings] together with the afflictive emotions, not without them.
Chapter Six presents the spiritual path and the individual who treads that path. This provides an overview of the complete path of purification of the afflictive emotions by describing the path’s stages, such as meditation on what is repulsive.
Chapter Seven presents wisdom and its qualities. Having entered the spiritual path, [wisdom and its qualities arise] from conquering the afflictive emotions, or through wisdom itself.
Chapter Eight presents states of meditative absorption—meditative concentration, along with its natural qualities. All aspects of wisdom depend exclusively upon meditative concentration.
Chapter Nine is called “a definitive presentation of the individual,” although it is said to be a supplementary topic to Chapter Eight.

Six topics elucidate these chapters’ subjects:
Phenomena are proclaimed in six topics:
Number, a presentation of definitions,
Classifications, synopses,
Proofs, and similarities.
[For example,] the number [of phenomena is presented as]
Contaminated and uncontaminated phenomena...
and,
Moreover, all these composite phenomena Have five aggregates: form, and the others...
and so on. Definitions [are presented as, for example,]
The perception, “I experience sensation”
Is the chief fixator upon characteristics...
and so on. Classifications [are presented as, for example,]
In this presentation, there is form alone:
There are ten [kinds of] tangible form...
and so on. Synopses [are presented as, for example,]
The aggregates, sense bases, and sense constituents
Encompass everything...
and so on. Similarities [are presented as, for example,] “kinds of pleasure and attachment... ,” and so on. Proofs [are presented as, for example,] “Because there are cycles, Ishvara or another [god] is not [the creator]... ,” and so on.

Two “chariot” systems of commentary emerged to explain the canon’s middle wheel, the perfection of sublime insight. [First,] the Buddha’s regent Maitreya perfectly elucidated in the scripture known as The Ornament of Manifest Realization the hidden meaning of the perfection of sublime insight—the stages of manifest realization. Venerable Asanga considered that this text and The Discourse on the Perfection of Sublime Insight in Twenty-five Thousand Verses shared the same meaning, and he composed the commentary Certainty in Relation to the Ultimate. [Second,] Asanga’s brother Vasubandhu wrote Defeat of Harm to the Three Versions of the Mother of Sublime Insight, explaining [the mind-only view of] consciousness. [Thus did the brothers] first illuminate these [teachings].

In particular, Vasubandhu had a disciple said to be more learned than he in the perfection of sublime insight, the eminent Vimuktisena. Consistent with the middle way style of expressing essenceless-ness, this master combined The Ornament of Manifest Realization and The Discourse on the Perfection of Sublime Insight in Twenty-five Thousand Verses in his commentary Illuminating the Twenty Thousand Verses. That text marks the inception of the tradition of joining the discourses with The Ornament of Manifest Realization. Later, Vairochanabhadra and others wrote many commentaries blending that text with the extensive and the medium-length perfection of sublime insight texts.
In particular, Master Haribhadra understood all systems of the perfection of sublime insight. Lord Maitreya granted permission [for his writing]; the force of that blessing led him to compose The Eighth Chapter’s Concise Meaning, which blended [The Ornament of Manifest Realization] with the medium-length version [of the perfection of sublime insight text]; The Great Commentary on “The Perfection of Sublime Insight in Eight Thousand Verses,” which blended that text with The Discourse on the Perfection of Sublime Insight in Eight Thousand Verses; An Easy-to-Understand Commentary on “The Concise Discourse on the Perfection of Sublime Insight,” which combined it with the concise version; and A Commentary of Clear Meaning, which integrated it with all three versions of the mother of sublime insight.
These elucidations in the intrinsic emptiness style constitute an excellent teaching system, thus all later masters who taught the perfection of sublime insight followed in their footsteps: their enlightened activity has proved to be especially exalted.

It is said that all teachings of the middle wheel, the cycle of the perfection of sublime insight, which existed in the land of exalted beings came here to the province of Tibet. During the doctrine’s early propagation, Lang Khampa Gocha went to India, learned The Discourse on the Perfection of Sublime Insight in One Hundred Thousand Verses by heart and translated it thoroughly into Tibetan. King Trisong Déutsen, in great respect for the great way teachings, mixed his own blood with a white ewe’s milk and had the text copied [using this mixture as ink]. Called The Red Records, it rests in a brick stupa in upper Lhasa. This version is also known as The Short Length Master Copy. Further, Wé Manjushri and Nyang Indrawaro together brought a text [of The Discourse on the Perfection of Sublime Insight] from India and translated it. They wrote it with a mixture of ashes from the king’s hair and a white ewe’s milk. [This copy,] known as The Blue Records, is said to exist in four volumes.
Since in both The Blue Records and Red Records all the verse repetitions were not written in full, Pagor Bérotsana completed another major revision, adding the missing repetitions, etc. He lengthened some lines to facilitate their recitation. This time, the great translator wrote it out himself. Known as The Deer-Skin Case One Hundred Thousand Verses, after its container, it still dwells in Chimpu; it is also called The Medium Length Master Copy.
During the reign of King Tri Ralpachen, scholars such as Surendra Bodhi, and the two translators Kawa Paltsek and Chokro Lu’i Gyaltsen completed a major revision [of The Discourse on the Perfection of Sublime Insight in One Hundred Thousand Verses]; this version in sixteen volumes is The Full Length Master Copy. It is said that there were several such different translations. The same group also translated a cycle of commentaries, including Damshtasena’s A Commentary on “The Perfection of Sublime Insight in One Hundred Thousand Verses.” By the kindness of these [teachers and translators, the perfection of sublime insight teachings] have been widely taught and practiced.

During the doctrine’s later propagation, great Translator Rinchen Zangpo went to the land of exalted beings, received from Scholar Gunamitra The Ornament of Manifest Realization with its commentary, then founded a teaching system. As well, illustrious Lord Atisha gave thorough instruction on the perfection of sublime insight to Ku Chenpo Lhadingpa and Dromtön Gyalwé Jungné. Atisha and great Translator Rinchen Zangpo translated the commentary Illuminating What Is Difficult to Understand and revised many texts from the early translations, including The Discourse on the Perfection of Sublime Insight in Eight Thousand Verses, Illuminating the Twenty Thousand Verses, and The Great Commentary on “The Perfection of Sublime Insight in Eight Thousand Verses.”
Dromtön Gyalwé Jungné taught Drom Tongtsen (also known as Go Lama) and others, thus a major teaching system emerged. Further, Lord Atisha taught Chadar Tönpa, beginning the spread of what would be called the eastern Tibetan [Kham] tradition of the perfection of sublime insight teachings.
In particular, [among these diverse later systems,] The Root Tantra of Manjushri states:
To the north of here, on the Himalayan slopes,
One [named] Loden will appear.
His understanding of language, grammar, and knowledge
Will be unimpeded.
This predicts the life of great Translator Ngok Loden Sherab. From Pandit Stirapala (or Bümtrak Sumpa [in Tibetan]), he received instruction on every scriptural tradition concerned with the perfection of sublime insight. Furthermore, he received teachings on the entire range of discourses and tantras from many learned, accomplished masters. He corrected [the edition of] The Discourse on the Perfection of Sublime Insight in One Hundred Thousand Verses in Nepal’s Pamting Temple, for example by adding missing names of meditative states. He completed many corrections and new translations of the root text The Ornament of Manifest Realization and several commentaries to it. He also completed definitive versions of those texts’ teaching systems, and spread them widely.

During the doctrine’s original propagation in Tibet, the teaching lineage of the perfection of sublime insight moved to eastern Tibet. Its stream, and all streams of the later propagation’s teachings, including doctrinal transmissions from Lord Atisha, Rinchen Zangpo, and great Translator Ngok Loden Sherab, were united as one by Dré Sherab Bar, who among Ngok’s four main disciples was the designated heir of the perfection of sublime insight instructions. He thus founded a single major system.
Ar Jangchub Sengé upheld this and valued its doctrine; thus it was passed through a lineage. Yak Mipam Chökyi Lama received it from Translator Rinchen Namgyal, the precious master Butön Rinchen Drup’s main disciple and heart-son. Yak Mipam Chökyi Lama composed three commentaries—long, medium, and short. His prowess in teaching was such that it was said that the perfection of sublime insight had reached a yak! His disciple, great Rongtön Shéja Kunzik, wrote as many as forty-three detailed explanations and scriptural commentaries on the discourses, primarily those of the perfection of sublime insight, particularly such works as Rongtön’s Major Commentary on the Perfection of Sublime Insight. He thus assumed responsibility for [this tradition’s] system of teaching and study. These spiritual fathers’ and sons’ superlative strength of intellect has flowed in an excellent, undiminished stream of teaching until the present day.

The Ornament of Manifest Realization
As to the meaning of the content of The Ornament of Manifest Realization, its text states:
Eight points fully elucidate The perfection of sublime insight.
After that synopsis, [the same text lists the eight:]
Knowledge of all aspects of phenomena, knowledge of paths,
Knowledge of everything...
These three forms of knowledge—knowledge of aspects of phenomena, knowledge of the paths, and knowledge of the bases—constitute the domain of listening and reflection.
Manifest perfect realization of all aspects of phenomena,
Reaching the peak, culmination,
Instantaneous manifest perfect awakening...
These four facets of application—application of complete realization of all aspects of phenomena, peak application, culmination of application, and instantaneous application—constitute the experience to be cultivated.
And the body of ultimate enlightenment [dharmakaya]. These are the eight points.
The result attained is the body of ultimate enlightenment, accompanied by its activity. Thus the underlying basis [of The Ornament of Manifest Realization is synthesized in] these eight points.
Among them, point one is manifest knowledge of all aspects of phenomena. This is instantaneous direct knowledge of all aspects [of phenomena] without exception—their nature and their myriad appearances. Point two is knowledge of paths. Having realized the three paths [of pious attendants, solitary sages, and bodhisattvas] to be without an intrinsic nature, this is knowledge of the path of learning which makes manifest correct conclusions through [stages of] fulfillment, ripening, and purification. Point three, knowledge of all bases, is fleeting knowledge that realizes that all bases are empty of an individual self.
Point four is application of manifest perfect realization of all aspects of phenomena. Here, in order to gain mastery in these three forms of knowledge [of aspects of phenomena, the paths, and the bases], they are synthesized as the three facets of non-arising, and they are made the mental contemplative practice of meditation. Point five is application that reaches the peak: based on [point four, application of complete realization of all aspects of phenomena], the three facets of non-arising are synthesized and meditation is mastered through mental contemplative practice.

Point six is application of culmination: this is mental contemplative practice in gradual training in thirteen qualities, aspects of the three forms of knowledge. This is done to stabilize realization of the simultaneous arising of the aspects of the three kinds of knowledge. Point seven, application of instantaneous, manifest perfect awakening, is the ultimate mental contemplative practice of progressive meditation on the three forms of knowledge. Point eight, the result, the body of ultimate enlightenment, is the full ripening of meditation on the four applications, or the ultimate result endowed with many flawless attributes. The Two Truths of the Middle Way states:
Because it is the body of all phenomena,
Because it is the support of all inconceivable qualities,
Because it is the essence of what follows awareness,
It is the body of ultimate enlightenment of all refuges.
Further, in the [perfection of sublime insight] discourse, the chapter [in answer to questions posed by] Subhuti presents knowledge of all aspects of phenomena. The chapter on purification of the two extremes presents knowledge of the paths. The chapter on special conduct presents knowledge of the bases. The chapter on suchness presents knowledge of all aspects of phenomena. The chapter on completely pure training presents peak application. The chapter on progressive engagement presents culmination. The chapter on complete training presents instantaneous [awakening]. The chapter on the result of training presents the body of ultimate enlightenment.

The reason why there are exactly eight points is that, to attain enlightenment, an individual needs three aspects of knowledge of the domain of knowable objects, four forms of application on the path of experiential cultivation, and the accepted result—the body of ultimate enlightenment. The Concise Meaning, the Jewel Lamp states:
The three aspects of knowledge in the domain of knowable
objects;
During meditation, the four applications;
The ultimate result, the body of ultimate enlightenment...
An analysis of these eight points produces what is known as the seventy-part hidden meaning. Ten points illustrate knowledge of aspects,
including the development of the mind of awakening (1–10). To attain the result, omniscience, you must meditate on its cause—knowledge of the paths: eleven topics illustrate this (11–21). For perfect knowledge of the path, you must know what is unconducive to the basis and various kinds of antidotes; nine topics illustrate knowledge of the bases (22–30). You must meditate on the three aspects of knowledge having used listening and reflection to synthesize one hundred and seventy-three subjects that define them: eleven topics illustrate application of complete [realization of all] aspects of phenomena (31–41). On the bodhisattva path of accumulation, having meditated alternatively on fulfillment and application, this meditation causes the arising of experiences mainly from meditation. This is peak application: eight topics illustrate this (42–49). Mental stabilization in consecutive order of the three forms of knowledge and their collective meanings, followed by meditation, constitutes the application of culmination: thirteen topics illustrate this (50–62). Although those stages of meditation on consummation exist right after attainment of meditative heat on the path of preparation, meditation after awakening’s first stage simultaneously actualizes all kinds of realization. Once stability in these is gained, the first instant of wisdom produces meditation upon the three forms of knowledge—certain application that immediately actualizes complete awakening. This is instantaneous application: four topics illustrate this (63–66). In the second instant of wisdom, enlightenment’s three bodies develop, along with their activity. This is the ultimate ripening of meditation on the four applications. Enlightenment’s three bodies and their deeds are [counted as] four (67–70). Thus, in total, there are seventy topics.

In the first of the eight points, omniscience is presented to instill interest in the result. The first of the seventy topics, development of the mind of awakening, is presented to make known that the mind of awakening forms the root of all great way teachings.
To summarize these subjects in relation to the basis of their classification, the ultimate result to be attained is knowledge of all aspects of phenomena. The cause for that attainment is knowledge of the paths. As a branch of the paths, what to accept and reject—knowledge of what is unconducive to the basis and classifications of its antidotes—is the knowledge of the bases. These three forms of knowledge are the domain of cutting through imputations.
Application of complete knowledge of all aspects of phenomena involves sequential meditation on the conclusions arrived at through listening and reflection, summarized into one hundred and seventy-three points. Peak application is the foremost realization that arises from this meditation on the condensed [meaning]. To attain stability in this, simultaneous meditation on them in sequence is consummate application. Once stability is attained, the first instant of wisdom [produces] meditation on the three forms of knowledge, which immediately and definitely actualizes the result—instantaneous application. These are the four applications of experiential cultivation.
Having cultivated your experience as described, the inseparability of the basic space of phenomena and wisdom is enlightenment’s essential body; the complete enjoyment of the great way teachings is the body of perfect rapture; deeds for sentient beings’ myriad requirements through manifold skillful means attuned to others’ needs is the manifest body; and acts for others’ benefit, summarized as twenty-seven activities, are enlightened activity. These four are the result, the body of ultimate enlightenment.
Apart from [this system], another presents an outline in three [headings]: the three forms of knowledge (counted as one), the six manifest realizations, and the four applications (or what are called “the causes of attainment,” [also] counted as one).

Those who present, teach, and cultivate the experience of what is explicitly presented in [the texts on] the perfection of sublime insight — emptiness — are known as [followers of] the middle way. Its meaning was incontrovertibly presented by exalted Master [Nagarjuna] in his written works, chiefly The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight. Based on commentaries to this book, written by the masters Buddhapalita and Bhavaviveka, the middle way grew into two schools of thought, [known as] consequentialist and independently verifiable reason. Holders of the former tradition include Chandrakirti and Shantideva; holders of the latter tradition include Jnanagarbha, Shantarakshita, and Kamalashila, known as the three eastern proponents of the independently verifiable reason school. Very many masters follow either of these two middle way systems.
Of eight known Indian commentaries to The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight, four were translated into Tibetan: Fearing Nothing, Buddhapalita’s Buddhapalita, Chandrakirti’s Clear Words, and Bhavaviveka’s Garlands of Lamps of Knowledge. Among these, earlier catalogs, the omniscient master of Jonang, and other sources consider Fearing Nothing to be an autocommentary [by Nagarjuna]. The learned, accomplished Gélek Palzang (Kédrup Jé) states that it cannot be an autocommentary because the exalted master’s disciples did not cite even one quotation from that text in their works and because the twenty-seventh chapter draws from The Four Hundred Stanza Treatise, beginning, “Noble Aryadeva states...”
Avalokitavrata’s explanatory eighty-section commentary to Garlands of Lamps of Knowledge, entitled All-Seeing One’s Fearless Conduct, describes non-Buddhist beliefs and the beliefs of the eighteen pious attendant orders in detail. No treatise translated into Tibetan describes non-Buddhist beliefs more thoroughly.

Jnanagarbha’s The Two Truths of the Middle Way with its autocommentary; Shantarakshita’s Ornament of the Middle Way and its autocommentary; Kamalashila’s nine-section Illumination of the Middle Way with the stages of meditation of the beginning, middle, and end; [and the above-mentioned All-Seeing One’s Fearless Conduct] are independently verifiable reason scriptures.
The following are consequentialist scriptures: Entering the Middle Way by Chandrakirti, Entering the Conduct of Enlightenment by Shantideva, and the root text and commentary of Ascertaining the Two Truths by noble lord [Atisha], follower of the elder and younger Rikpé Kuchuk, themselves disciples of Chandrakirti.
Bhavaviveka read Buddhapalita’s commentary, wrote a refutation, and started his own school. Chandrakirti refuted it and supported Buddhapalita’s original tradition; thus, two schools are known. They are differentiated according to how the ultimate view develops in an individual’s stream of being. [However,] in relation to the belief in the essence of the ultimate, there is no difference. Impartial scholars explain it thus and [I, Jamgön Kongtrul,] agree; both are authentic proponents of the middle way.

Initially here in Tibet, Scholar Jnanagarbha and Chokro Lu’i Gyaltsen translated The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight and Garlands of Lamps of Knowledge. They spread the independently verifiable reason school of teaching and study based on Shantarakshita’s teachings.
During Buddhism’s later period of dissemination in Tibet, Translator Ngok Loden Sherab taught and studied the scriptures, principally Garlands of Lamps of Knowledge, and transmitted them widely. The stream of his teachings reached the holders of the seat of glorious Sangpu Monastery, particularly the fifth, Chapa Chökyi Sengé. His disciples included eight known as great lions [in Tibetan: sengé] — Tsang Nakpa Tsöndru Sengé, Den-pakpa Mawé Sengé, Drusha Sönam Sengé, Majawa Tsöpé Sengé, Tsak Wangchuk Sengé, Nyangdren Chökyi Sengé, Denma Könchok Sengé, and Nyalpa Yönten Sengé; as well as three holy sons, three wise masters, and three accomplished masters. Among them, Tsang Nakpa Tsöndru Sengé and Majawa Tsöpé Sengé generally followed Chandrakirti. The rest and, later, the lion of speech, great Rongtön Shéja Kunzik, in whom the karmic imprints of Kamalashila awakened, trusted the independently verifiable reason school’s point of view, having attained deep certainty in it. A few of their followers, such as those in some of the monastic colleges that adhered to the early translations, also maintain the independently verifiable reason school until the present day, although the continuity of their established teaching system did not last.
As to the consequentialist school, Translator Patsab journeyed to Kashmir, where he relied on Sajjana’s two spiritual sons and others, and trained for twenty-three years. Then in Tibet he translated all of Chandrakirti’s works, including commentaries to The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight, Entering the Middle Way, and The Four Hundred Stanza Treatise. He finalized [these translations] through teaching and study. His disciples—Gangpa Shéu, expert in terminology; Tsangpa Drégur, expert in meaning; Maja Jangtsön, expert in both; and Zhangtang Sakpa Yeshé Jungné, expert in neither—were known as Patsab’s four spiritual sons. They and their assembly of disciples opened the great systematic path of teaching, debate, and composition of Chandrakirti’s scriptural tradition. All upholders of the consequentialist middle way in the Himalayan region draw from their work.

Most outstanding scholars in Tibet upheld this teaching system; such masters specifically include the erudite masters who held the seat of Zhangtang Sakpa Yeshé Jungné; the Sakya lords and their followers; the supreme scholar, the precious master Butön Rinchen Drup; Lord Rendawa; his disciple, omniscient lord precious master Lozang Drakpa, along with his lineage; and powerful victor Mikyö Dorjé and omniscient Péma Karpo, with their followers.
This tradition’s continuity of experiential cultivation was transmitted through Atisha and his spiritual sons, and mainly spread to the precious Kadampa order.
Nagarjuna’s The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight has twenty-seven chapters, from the first, an examination of secondary causes, until the last, an examination of the view. [Chandrakirti’s] Entering the Middle Way is a commentary on the meaning of The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight; its teaching system remains undiminished to the present day.
An outline of the body of Entering the Middle Way has two main parts, explanations of the primary cause, awakening’s stages; and of the result, the state of enlightenment. The first has two parts, a presentation of the essence of each of awakening’s ten stages and a presentation of their common qualities. The first [the ten stages’ essence] has three parts: a brief exposition of the stages’ essence, the basis of the subject; a full explanation of the stages’ qualities, their special attributes; and a conclusion, based on a description of the stages’ qualities.
The presentation of the result, the state of enlightenment, is summarized in five points: the place where awakening is attained; how one awakens; an outline of the bodies of enlightenment, the essence of awakening; a presentation of the underlying intention of the three awakenings; and awakening and its time. Among these, the sixth chapter on the perfection of sublime insight clearly and extensively presents the meaning of the middle way.

The final wheel [of the Buddha’s teaching], including twenty discourses on buddha nature, was well elucidated by the Buddha’s regent Maitreya in four [of his five] teachings—The Ornament of the Discourses, the two texts of discernment [Discerning Between the Center and the Extremes and Discerning Between Phenomena and Their Nature] and The Highest Continuity—and in venerable exalted Nagarjuna’s A Collection of Praises. [This latter text] contains separate praises in the context of the basis—to phenomena and the nature of phenomena; in the context of the path—to skillful means and sublime insight; in the context of the result—to the three bodies of enlightenment; and a praise in the context of the essence of the view itself. Such masters as Asanga, his brother [Vasubandhu], Master Chandragomi, and their followers; and Shantipa, the omniscient master of the era of dispute, taught and transmitted widely the meaning of these texts.

In Tibet during both the early and later dissemination of Buddhism, countless discourses and treatises of commentary on the subject of the final wheel [of the Buddha’s instruction] were translated. Especially during the later spread, great Translator Ngok Loden Sherab received the scriptures, commentary, and teaching on Maitreya’s four later instructions from the Kashmiri Master Sajjana; he then transmitted them widely. From Translator Ngok, Trapa Ngonshé’s disciple Tsen Kawoché received The Highest Continuity and the other [texts of Maitreya]. The teaching system reached Chang Rawa and others, and continued until later times. The former [Ngok Loden Sherab] inherited the teaching transmission; the latter [Tsen Kawoché], the practice transmission. It is thought that two traditions gradually developed, that of those who hold the middle way view and that of those who hold the mind-only view. In later writings, they both accept knowledge of emptiness—truly existent, naturally clear intrinsic awareness—as the potent cause of enlightenment. Thus states omniscient Dharmakara.
From the streams of these transmissions, such masters as Scholar Tsang Nakpa Tsöndru Sengé; the second Victor, Rangjung Dorjé; the great omniscient master of Jonang [Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen] and his spiritual children; omniscient Drimé Özer [i.e., Longchenpa]; Minling Terchen and his brother [Dharmashri]; and Lord Tenpé Nyinjé [i.e., Chökyi Jungné], along with his followers, sounded a lion’s great roar of the incontrovertible meaning and elucidated the definite meaning beyond the mind-only view, the historical tradition of the great middle way.

In the land of exalted beings, the outstanding Master Venerable Shri Dharmapala wrote the treatise The Dawn of Positive Forms elucidating how [Nagarjuna’s] six collections of middle way reasoning and The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight in particular constitute the final wheel’s intent.
Thus, in both India and Tibet, the source of this renowned philosophical school is The Highest Continuity, which states:
Buddha, the teachings, the assembly, the innate constituent,
awakening,
Enlightenment’s qualities, and, finally, activity:
These constitute the body of the entire treatise.
In brief, they are the seven vajra points.
The content of The Highest Continuity is synthesized as the ultimate vajra’s seven points. [The text’s] seven vajra sections of four chapters [each] explain them. The connections among the topics in order are, as the same text states,
From the Buddha, the teachings arise; from the teachings,
the exalted assembly;
From the assembly, attainment of the innate constituent,
the wisdom of buddha nature;
And finally, from that wisdom, attainment of sublime awakening
And other qualities of acting for all beings’ benefit.
This schema presents the body of complete liberation’s basis, path, and result in its entirety: the Buddha, the path’s teacher; the sacred teachings, the doctrine; the spiritual community, those who train in it; those endowed with the inherent propensity to be guided by them [the three jewels]; complete liberation’s awakening; and [awakening’s] qualities, together with its deeds.
Furthermore, to summarize these within the stages of experiential cultivation on the path of the supreme way, the development of the mind of awakening resembles a leader; thus, this work presents the stages of the correct undertaking of that intention. Further, it overtly presents taking refuge in the three [jewels]. The focus of the mind of awakening is others’ benefit and awakening. The object for whom the mind of awakening is generated is others—sentient beings; thus, it presents suchness with impurities. Aiding others is taught [through explaining] activity. Its cause is awakening. Qualities accompany awakening’s acts for others’ benefit. All these topics are explained in each section, and all are defined in relation to the two truths.

Among what are known in the new translation schools as the four major tantras, the first [two] are action and conduct tantras. In the land of exalted beings, the masters Uttamabodhibhagavan and Buddhaguhya became outstanding scholars. They exhibited skill in teaching and practice (the former in action tantra, the latter in conduct tantra), and thereby transmitted them. Further, Jétari and other masters also transmitted many of these tantras.
During the doctrine’s early spread in Tibet, Buddhist King Trisong Déutsen sent an invitation to Master Buddhaguhya through Wé Manjushri and others. Buddhaguhya declined, but the envoys received his teaching on the three [outer] tantras—kriya, [charya,] and yoga. He gave them his written commentaries, which they carried back and offered to their ruler. They also taught them to disciples and thus spread these tantras in Tibet. Thus, [during the early period of translation,] the following texts were translated into Tibetan: The Questions of Subahu Tantra, The Secret Tantra of the Rites of All Sacred Circles, The Later Meditative Concentration Tantra, and other [action tantras]; and these conduct tantra texts: Master Buddhaguhya’s concise commentary on The Tantra of Buddha Illuminator’s Manifest Awakening, transcripts of Buddhaguhya’s words perfectly recalled by the translators, and a commentary to The Vajra Holder Empowerment Tantra. It seems that these and other texts’ teaching and study systems continue to exist, yet during the period of the doctrine’s later spread, many sublime individuals (such as Translator Bari Rinchen Drakpa, who transmitted the streams of various doctrinal empowerments) transmitted various traditions [of action and conduct tantras], but independent lines of teaching did not ensue to any significant degree.

Buddha Vajra Bearer Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo spent three years in retreat in Gorum Library of Sakya Monastery, where he thoroughly examined all tantras and their Indian commentaries. He composed A General Presentation of the Action and Conduct Tantras, and devoted great energy to transmitting its doctrine.
Today, the continuity of the reading transmission exists for the tantras, and many kinds of empowerments, authorization empowerments, [empowerment] rituals to orient awareness [to the deity], and the giving of transmission of such [action tantras] as The Three General Families of the Action Tantras, the two flawless deities [Flawless Topknot and Flawless Light], The Array of the Three Pledges, the forty-seven-deity sacred circle of Medicine Buddha, Purposeful Lasso with many deities, the nine-deity sacred circle of Buddha Unmoving, Nagarjuna’s tradition of eleven-faced [All-Seeing One], and Sugatigarbha’s tradition of Vajra Holder; and the conduct tantras’ empowerments of the sacred circle of one hundred and twenty-two deities of both genders in The Tantra of Buddha Illuminator’s Manifest Awakening, and the five-deity sacred circle of Arapacha Manjugosha. Yet, apart from these, no continuity of teaching systems remains.

In the land of exalted beings, three yoga tantra doctrinal systems were best known: those of Shakyamitra, who was learned in the words; Buddhaguhya, learned in the meaning; and Anandagarbha, learned in both. Buddhaguhya’s tradition appeared in Tibet during the doctrine’s early spread but ceased in later times. During the later spread, only Anandagarbha’s tradition was introduced. Initially, the great Translator Rinchen Zangpo went to Kashmir and relied on many masters. He received many tantras and profound instructions for meditation, and became very learned in secret mantra in general, and in yoga tantra in particular. Although most yoga tantras had already reached Tibet, [Rinchen Zangpo] made new translations consistent with the commentaries. He also translated commentaries such as Illuminating the Absolute, a commentary to A Synthesis of the Absolute, and finalized them through teaching and study. He composed a text of their practical instructions, The Definite Essence, and gave [the entire transmission] to many disciples, principally his four heart-sons: Lochung Lekpé Sherab, Gungshing Tsöndru Gyaltsen, Drapa Zhönnu Sherab, and Kyinor Jnana. Many preserved this lineage through study and teaching.
Following [Rinchen Zangpo’s death in 1050], Podrang Shiwa Ö invited to Tibet Scholar Kalasha and others, who made many translations, particularly the untranslated sections of The Glorious Original Supreme Tantra. Kalasha taught many disciples The Vajra Pinnacle Instruction Tantra. The supreme Master Atisha gave empowerments and pith instructions for The Purification Tantra of Buddha All Knowing to Gomi Gomchen and others. These were transmitted successively through Kyinor Jnana, Nyalpa Nyima Sherab, and others, and were spread widely.

Translator Zangkar studied the yoga tantra cycle thoroughly and made a complete translation of the three chapters of the latter part of the commentary [Illuminating the Absolute]. He transmitted this principally to those known as Zangkar’s four sons: Nyalpa Nyima Sherab, Marpa Dorjé Yeshé, Nyentön Tsultrim Bar, and Chang Tsangpa Sengé Gyaltsen. This teaching system became very widespread. During an interim period, Tsakyawa Tönshak, Nur Nyima Özer (a disciple of Nyalpa Nyima Sherab), and Dzimpa Lochen were the three principal masters who upheld this tradition through their study and teaching. Further, several other systems appeared, such as a lineage transmitted from the Nepalese Master Ravindra to Translator Mal Lodrö Drakpa, and another transmitted from Vibhutichandra to Yakdé Zémarwa.
Later, these traditions almost disappeared, becoming very slender threads. The hundred streams of these [yoga tantra traditions] flowed into the ocean of learning of Butön Rinchen Drup, whose karmic affinity with the yoga tantras had fully awakened at the end of this later period. He composed many texts, including The Foremost Presentation of the Concise Meaning of the Yoga Tantras, and other rituals for sacred circles, and thereby restored the yoga tantras’ doctrines from their very foundations.

These days, the scholastic tradition [of the yoga tantras] no longer exists. There number now just thirteen major and minor empowerments, including A Compilation of the Original Supreme Glory Tantra, A Compilation of the Vajra Pinnacle Tantra, and Vajra Basic Space Tantra; the reading transmission for those tantras; and the empowerments for twelve sacred circles related to or extrapolated from The Purification Tantra of Buddha All Knowing.
Within the yoga tantra tradition, there is what are known as the upper and lower traditions. In the early half of his life, the great translator [Rinchen Zangpo] followed Shakyamitra’s teaching system and Anandagarbha’s practical instructions. Although this occurred in the upper half of his life, this tradition is known as the lower yoga tantra tradition, because it spread toward the lowlands [i.e., eastward]. Gyalpo Chölo of upper Nyang, Sumtön of Rinpung, and Bodong Bangka Dangchung upheld this tradition.
Concerning the upper tradition, later in life, the great translator followed Anandagarbha’s tradition in both teaching and practice. Although this occurred during the latter part of his life, it is known as the upper yoga tantra tradition, because it spread toward the highlands. Translator Mal Lodrö Drakpa passed it to the great Sakya lama [Sachen Kunga Nyingpo], allowing it to continue as an oral lineage. Supreme Lord Drakpa Gyaltsen, fearful that the lineage would disappear because disciples of future generations would have weak intellects and memories, and would be unable to preserve an orally transmitted lineage, wrote such texts as The Benefit of Others Trilogy. The gradual dissemination of his works has ensured that the practical instructions of The Purification Tantra of Buddha All Knowing has spread widely throughout all schools to the present time.

As many as twenty-four traditions of the highest yoga father tantra, Matrix of Mystery, were said to have arisen in India. These include those of the supreme Master Padmavajra, Anangavajra, Nagarjuna, Lalitavajra, Vajrahasa, Trikandhendra, Madhuraghoshapala, Buddhajnana, Shantipa, and Anandagarbha. Among them, the last is considered incorrect since, although based upon commentaries by an Indian scholar, it elucidates what is definitely a highest yoga tantra as a yoga tantra.

Among those [twenty-four] traditions, six appeared here in Tibet: traditions from the exalted master [Nagarjuna], Venerable Buddhajnana, Shantipa, Vajrahasa, Padmavajra, and Anandagarbha.
During Buddhism’s early spread in Tibet, [a translator] named Ché Tashi translated this tantra, and it was known among the eighteen major tantras as The Matrix of Mystery Mind Tantra. Teachings that elucidated it appeared, as the appearance of Vajrahasa’s tradition illustrates. Nevertheless, the empowerments, teaching systems, and pith instructions of the later [four traditions on the list] were not disseminated for long. The principal traditions are those of the exalted master—Nagarjuna’s tradition—and Buddhajnana’s tradition. These two traditions’ complete series of empowerments, teaching systems, and pith instructions reached Tibet and continue to the present day.

Concerning the former tradition (that of the exalted master [Nagarjuna]) at the inception of Buddhism’s later spread in Tibet, the great Translator Rinchen Zangpo translated The Matrix of Mystery Tantra itself; a commentary to that tantra, The Radiant Lamp; and many other long and short related scriptures. He thoroughly mastered their empowerments, teachings, and so on. Later, many Tibetan translators studied Matrix of Mystery in India, made various translations of it, and taught them. The most renowned of these are two traditions, those of Marpa Chökyi Lodrö and Gö Kukpa Lhétsé.
Translator Marpa Chökyi Lodrö received the Matrix of Mystery cycle from masters Naropa, Jnanagarbha, and others. He taught this to his disciples in Tibet; among his foremost disciples—the “four pillars”—he particularly transmitted the complete Matrix of Mystery cycle to Tsurtön Wang-gi Dorjé, who passed it in turn to Khampa Ronyam Dorjé, who had started a journey to India to obtain Matrix of Mystery teachings. En route, he met two Indians who were on their way to receive Matrix of Mystery from Marpa Chökyi Lodrö; Ronyam Dorjé decided to return. Since Marpa had already passed away, Khampa Ronyam Dorjé received Matrix of Mystery, etc., from Tsurtön Wang-gi Dorjé. This proximate lineage from Khampa Ronyam Dorjé became known as Marpa Chökyi Lodrö’s tradition.
On the subject of Gö Kukpa Lhétsé’s tradition, the great Translator Gö Kukpa Lhétsé received Matrix of Mystery empowerments, tantras, commentaries, and pith instructions from seventy scholars, including the supreme Master Dipamkara, Dévakarachandra, and Viryabhadra, and from two dakinis. In Tibet, he made excellent corrections and revisions of the earlier period’s translations of The Matrix of Mystery Tantra and its major and minor commentaries. He gave extensive Matrix of Mystery teachings to his disciples. Among his disciples were four who planted the tantra’s pillars, eight who raised the pith instructions’ beams, and innumerable ones who set the rafters—skill in minor activities and enlightened activity. These disciples include Gö Kukpa Lhétsé’s six supreme disciples, including Marab Sengé Gyaltsen. The proximate lineage that stems from them greatly spread Matrix of Mystery teachings; it is known as Gö Kukpa Lhétsé’s tradition.

Atisha taught Matrix of Mystery to Translator Naktso Tsultrim Gyalwa, who taught it to Rongpa Chaksorpa. This is known as Atisha’s tradition. Chak Chöje Pal relied on Pandit Ravindra and others, and received Matrix of Mystery teachings. He taught it to his disciples, including Uyuk Kung-rab Lama Pal. That proximate lineage is known as Chak Chöjé Pal’s tradition.
Scholar [Shakyashri] from Kashmir taught Matrix of Mystery to Sakya Pandit, Chal Chökyi Zangpo, and others. This is known as Panchen’s tradition. That lineage from Sakya Pandit divided into two, the Sakya tradition and the Chak tradition. Thus, we count six traditions of Matrix of Mystery [from Nagarjuna]. Further, there are various lineages that have slightly differing teaching systems.
Concerning the latter tradition that originated from Buddhajnana, great Translator Rinchen Zangpo first passed it to Kyangpo Chökyi Lodrö and others. Smriti Jnana also taught it in Kham [eastern Tibet]. Therefore, it is known as the Kham tradition. The lineage of these teachings from Scholar Sunayashri and Translator Nyen became prevalent among the Sakyapas; thus it is known as the Sakya tradition. Ra Chörab received Matrix of Mystery from Scholar Punyéshri and others, and then spread it; thus, it is known as Ra’s tradition. Nyö Jungpo relied upon Baling Acharya and received Matrix of Mystery; thus his lineage is known as the Nyö tradition. These and other traditions arose.
In these two traditions [of Matrix of Mystery from Nagarjuna and Buddhajnana], there seems to have been in Tibet a very great number of writers of such works as commentaries, practice texts, rituals of the sacred circle, and pith instructions.

Among those traditions, Marpa Chökyi Lodrö’s and Gö Kukpa Lhétsé’s traditions reign supreme. The former constitutes the transmission of
the practice of experiential cultivation; the latter, that of the teaching system.
Marpa’s teaching system flowed through Tsurtön Wang-gi Dorjé [and his disciples] such as Khampa Ronyam Dorjé and Khön Gépa Kirti. Translator Gö Kukpa Lhétsé’s teaching system passed through his disciples, including the tantras’ “four pillars.” These traditions of teaching were united by omniscient master Chöku Özer (a rebirth of Kashmiri Scholar [Shakyashri]), who could comprehend any treatise by merely reading it. He gave these teachings to Pakpa Ö, a master of Nagarjuna’s [work], yoga tantra, and Wheel of Time. From him, the precious master Butön Rinchen Drup received [the transmission of Matrix of Mystery], became greatly learned in it, and composed texts, such as The Major Commentary: A Clear Lamp. Butön Rinchen Drup’s disciple, Kyung Lhépa Zhönnu Sönam, taught the supreme Lord Lozang Drakpa [Tsongkapa] whose teaching of Matrix of Mystery covered the entire earth. Matrix of Mystery All-Seeing One is Lord Atisha’s personal tradition he gave Lhatsun Jangchub Ö. A minor tradition, only its empowerment remains today.
Only the doctrinal empowerments and the tantras’ reading transmissions in both traditions of Matrix of Mystery are widespread in every [school]. Within the Zhalu tradition, the continuity of direct instruction in the five stages of meditation, along with their experiential cultivation, remains uninterrupted. Within the Géden tradition, a teaching system continues uninterrupted that proclaims a fourfold interweaving of the root tantra, The Major Commentary: A Clear Lamp, interlinear notes, and a concluding analysis.
It is said that Lord Marpa had seven teaching systems for Matrix of Mystery, but their streams disappeared in later times.
Translator Gö Kukpa Lhétsé received many textual teaching traditions based on the scriptures of Nagarjuna’s fivefold cycle of Matrix of Mystery. Among them, he emphasized three traditions—from Abhijna, a scholar from Bengal; Dévikara (known in Tibetan as Tsunmo Chen), a scholar from Sahor; and Krishna-samaya-vajra, a scholar from Vajra Seat. From among these three, he took Krishna-samaya-vajra’s tradition as the basis of his teachings.

The Matrix of Mystery Tantra
That system (the view of the father exalted Master [Nagarjuna] and his spiritual heirs) considers that the teachings in the great sovereign Matrix of Mystery tantra have two aspects: those determined by its true substance and those determined by specific circumstances.
Concerning the first [the teaching of the true substance of the tantra], the meaning presented in such lines [from the tantra] as, “Non-meditation within insubstantiality” is that of the inexpressible and indescribable abiding nature of nondual [relative and ultimate] truth.
Concerning the second [the teaching based on specific circumstances], the tantra can be synthesized under three categories: the tantra’s subject matter, its means of expression, and the relation between those two.

First, [the tantra’s subject:] Translator Gö Kukpa Lhétsé’s The Great Teaching Session states:
The individual, the support which enters the tantra, purifies these ordinary appearances of natural phenomena, which constitute the basis of purification. What must be relinquished are the seeds of the three kinds of thoughts present in the individual’s own mind stream. To eliminate them, the individual focuses on the focal point—the sixth Buddha Great Vajra Bearer—then cultivates experience on the two paths: the path of maturation and the path of liberation. Thus, the individual attains temporary and ultimate results. These points comprise the subject matter of Matrix of Mystery.
As stated, this tantra’s subject matter has six points: (1) the individual, the support which enters the tantra; (2) natural phenomena, the basis of purification, which the individual must know and transform; (3) what must be relinquished, conflictual impurities encountered on the path;
(4) the focal point; (5) techniques of experiential cultivation; and (6) the results gained from perfecting experiential cultivation.

(1) First, there are two kinds of individuals: those to be rejected—non-Buddhists who view the self [as existent]; and those to be accepted— Buddhists, proponents of the absence of a self. This latter group comprises those of the lesser way, pious attendants and solitary sages; and those of the great way, those free from desire and those with desire. The first three [pious attendants, solitary sages, and those without desire] are not true vessels for this tantra, yet since this tantra synthesizes all approaches to the teachings, the text’s words mention them.
There are two kinds of individuals with desire: those with the afflictive emotion of desire and those with desire for the antidotes. The first has four kinds: [the desire] to gaze [at the object of desire], to laugh [with the object of desire], to embrace, and to unite. The last [is relevant here]. There are four kinds of desire for the antidotes: devotion, compassion, faith, and wisdom, which are, respectively, desire toward the spiritual master, sentient beings, the wisdom deity, and the nature of reality. Further, among those of the lowest degree of acumen, who delight in knowledge, and those with the highest degree of acumen, who delight in methods, it is taught that the latter are worthy vessels for this tantra.
These subjects [related to individuals who enter this tantra] are synthesized under [four headings]: the individual’s essence; concise and detailed classifications of the individual; characteristics [of the individual] in general, in specific cases, and of worthy recipients [for the teachings]; and the reasoning of the literal definition [of the individual].

(2) Second, the basis of purification has two parts: birth, the basis of purification of relative truth; and death, the basis of purification of ultimate truth. The former comprises two supreme victors—the sacred residence and the sacred residents. The latter entails application to each of the five stages’ bases of purification.

(3) Third, impurities encountered on the path has three parts: strong defilements, unbridled thoughts of material phenomena as ordinary; subtle defilements, active dualistic thoughts; and very subtle defilements, concepts of the very essence of material substance. Each of these has two kinds of remedies: a weaker remedy that purifies coarse defilements to be relinquished, and a strong remedy that purifies subtle defilements to be relinquished.

(5) Fifth, the techniques of experiential cultivation has two parts: (1) the path of maturation [i.e., empowerment] that ripens those whose mind streams are immature and that makes individuals worthy vessels for the achievement of the three kinds of accomplishment; and (2) the path of liberation [i.e., instruction in meditation practice] that frees those not liberated from the three concepts.

The first has three parts: the preliminary practice of approach, the master’s entry [into the sacred circle], and the disciples’ entry. The first has three degrees: the best is authorization from the deity, the middle is attainment of signs, and the last is completion of the prescribed number of mantra repetitions. The second [entry of the master] has five parts: the three rites for [the adoption of] the ground, preparation, and [setting out] the colored lines [used in drawing the sacred circle]; consecration [of the sacred circle]; its practice; offerings; and self-empowerment. The third [induction of disciples] has five parts: disciples’ entry into the sacred circle, so they become of equal fortune to the deity; presentation of the sacred circle [to disciples], so they recognize the deity; bestowal of empowerment, so they will be empowered or have authorization to meditate on both the creation and completion phases; entrustment of mantras and mudras, so those entrusted can attain the two accomplishments in this very lifetime; and the presentation of pledges and vows, to prevent impairment of the customs of the great way. Each of these fivehas many subdivisions.

(2) Second, the path of liberation—techniques of experiential cultivation—has two parts: post-meditative conduct and settling in evenness.
Conduct has two kinds: the inferior conduct of the lesser way and the sublime conduct of the great way. The latter is of two kinds: that which is free from desire, the vast activity of the transcendent perfections; and that which has desire, the profound conduct of secret mantra. On the subject of secret mantra conduct, this is taught in general in relation to the four tantras’ methods; in this case, the conduct of the final class of tantra, supreme yoga, takes two specific forms: a lord’s conduct and secret mantra conduct. These are known respectively as “the conduct of total victory,” and “the conduct of the young king” (or “the conduct of the illustrious regent”). The latter conduct has two kinds: the common conduct of training based on engagement in desire, and the conduct of the tantric discipline of awareness. Each of these is presented in three modes: elaborate, simple, and very simple.
The elaborate conduct of the discipline of awareness has five aspects: practices of the number of seals; two categories of the inner propensity and those who have that propensity; characteristics; time; and attributes. The simple conduct of the discipline of awareness has five aspects: union with the wisdom mudra [consort], which is the conduct of desire for the diligent to achieve enlightenment within their lifetime; the conduct of blending with death for the lazy, the primary cause for enlightenment during the interval between death and rebirth; the conduct of blending with sleep for those who have obstacles, the primary cause for their enlightenment after a succession of lifetimes; the conduct of Shakyamuni’s way to enlightenment, beginning the spiritual path with the way of philosophical systems and concluding the path with the secret mantra way (the former brings attainment of awakening’s ten stages; the latter, bestowal of the three higher empowerments in the highest pure land and attainment of enlightenment); and the conduct that seals the first three forms of conduct—[realization of] the absence of a self of phenomena and the conduct of union. The rituals for elaborate and simple conduct include the place, implements, and how to practice the forms of conduct. The special characteristics of the individuals who engage in these forms of conduct are presented as ancillary subjects.

Settling in evenness has two aspects: the preliminary to the practice, how to train in the motivation of the Buddha’s way; and the actual practice.

(1) Creation phase meditation is synthesized in two parts. The first is the basis of purification, the authentic creation phase, which is presented through three subjects: its essence, classification, and the reasoning of its literal meaning. [The second part of creation phase meditation] is purification, the nominal creation phase, which is made up of two aspects: approach and practice. Approach, which pleases the wisdom deities, has two aspects: single-pointed mindfulness, which is training in single-minded concentration on coarse [phenomena] using familiarity with the deities’ substantial [appearances]; and conceptual contemplative practice, attachment to and conceptualization of very subtle phenomena.
The former, single-pointed mindfulness, has two categories: [meditation on] the sacred circle’s wheel and on the spiritual warrior alone. Each of these has a support, the celestial palace; and contents, wisdom deities. Or, [they can be treated separately,] with the wheel of the sacred circle as the subject of meditation—[Matrix of Mystery’s] thirty-two deities. The principal deity upon which the buddha-family flower landed [during the empowerment] moves [to the center; that configuration] is counted [as a whole circle of thirty-two]. Further, each deity has both a pledge and wisdom aspect; counted together, there are ninety-six “applications.” [Second,] for [meditation on] the spiritual warrior alone, individuals with the highest degree of acumen create the deity’s presence using four contemplative practices. Those with a moderate degree of acumen create the deity’s presence using [a ritual comprising] the five aspects of manifest awakening. Those with a lesser degree of acumen create the deity using [a ritual comprising] the four vajras. Each has a sacred circle of thirty-two deities, with one that moves to become the principal deity, thus ninety-six “applications.” The techniques for their experiential cultivation can be synthesized into two: the preliminary practices and the main practice.
Second, conceptual contemplative practice has two aspects: inner absorption, taught for those with a high degree of acumen, who delight in meditation; and absorption in mantra [recitation], taught for those of a low degree of acumen, who delight in mantra recitation.

In the first, there are two aspects, the upper gate and the lower gate, applied as antidotes for the elements, afflictive emotions, and constituents of sickness. In these practices, one trains in the meditative state of the five certainties. The second [absorption in mantra recitation] has two kinds: counting recitations of the three syllables or mantra garlands, for those who delight in either concise [the first] or lengthy practices [the latter]. [In either case,] burnt offerings supplement the recitations. Each of these former and latter four categories [two aspects of inner absorption and two aspects of mantra recitation absorption] has thirty-two deities, as before [in the description of single-pointed mindfulness]; thus, a total of one hundred and twenty-eight “applications.”
In a beginner’s absorption to practice for desired accomplishments, the preliminary practices entail six months of engagement in the conduct of the discipline of awareness. The actual practice has two parts: practice for worldly accomplishment—the four activities [listed below]; and practice for common accomplishment—the eight supreme attainments. First, [the four activities are] concentration produced by the phase of creation; concentration produced by the phase of completion; mantra and text recitations endowed with eight distinctive features; and four devices endowed with four special absorptions: burnt offerings, yantra substances, mantras, and tantra. Each of these four has thirty-two categories of practitioners, making a hundred and twenty-eight categories. It is also taught that each of the four activities has many subdivisions in terms of the aims of the practice.
[Second,] in relation to common accomplishments, the root tantra lists six, whereas the explanatory tantra lists eight. First is the sword; second, awareness holder, which has five kinds, one for each of the fivewisdom families; third, pills, which are of two kinds: mantra pills of wisdom body, speech, and mind, and general and specific material pills; clairvoyance, which is of two kinds: practice of the array of bodhisattvas and of transcendent buddhas [in celestial palaces]; swift feet, which is of two kinds: mundane swiftness, and supramundane swiftness of wisdom body, speech, and mind; eye-salve; the excellent vase; and boots. The last three have no subdivisions.

(2) The phase of completion has two parts. [First,] three topics—the essence, classification, and etymology—present the authentic completion phase, the basis of purification. [Second,] the nominal completion phase, the agent of purification, comprises the six aspects of approach and accomplishment—five stages of approach, and accomplishment of union.
First, among the five stages of approach—three facets of solitude, illusory body, and clear light—the first is physical solitude, which has nine topics: the individual, who is the support; the essence of physical solitude; etymology; what must be known; defilements to be relinquished; the classification of physical solitude into form, nature, consciousness, and meditative states (these constitute the basis of solitude synthesized into its subjects); techniques of experiential cultivation; evaluation of signs; and the results of having cultivated the experience.
Second, vocal solitude is presented like physical solitude, in nine topics: basis, essence, etc. There are three categories: the ultimate nature of circulating energy, the basis; the ultimate nature of sound, its content; and the ultimate nature of the root of those two, the sound to be known. The first [the ultimate nature of circulating energy] has thirteen aspects: essence, etymology, outer and inner categories, function, source, gateways of movement, individual names, colors, sequence, enumeration, methods of training, evaluation of signs, and results. Second, [the ultimate nature of sound] has three general topics: mantras of the continuity of the cause, mantras of the continuity of techniques, and mantras of the continuity of the result. Each of these is presented in four topics: essence, etymology, categories, and their functions in the wheel of life and transcendence. Specifically, in the case of the mantras of the continuity of techniques, to those four topics the following are added: a full classification of terms, how mantras multiply, the mantras’ meanings, the mantras’ symbolism, accumulation of mantras, techniques of recitation, counting mantras, evaluation of signs, and results. The last [nine] among those thirteen are taught in relation to both creation and completion phases.

Third, mental solitude is presented in fourteen topics: the individual who is the support; essence; etymology; categories of the object, the mind’s apparent phenomena, and of the subject, the apparent phenomena of wisdom, the mind’s focus; the mind’s function that creates the wheel of life and transcendence; the time of mental events; the timing of engagement; the mind’s characteristics; enumeration of terms; the faults of lacking realization and the qualities of realization; what must be known of mental solitude; establishing subject and object; evaluation of signs of consummation; and results.

Fifth, clear light has eighteen topics: the support; essence; etymology; categories such as the eighteen degrees of emptiness, or outer and inner manifest awakening; stages that make one a [worthy] vessel; what must be known; what must be relinquished, antidotes and manifest awakening; methods of practice and meditative concentration; enumeration of terms; how clear light pervades; causes and consequences; categories; characteristics; engagement and reversal; classification of pith instructions; meditation; evaluation of signs; and results.

[Sixth,] the contemplative practice of union has twelve topics: the individual who is the support; essence; etymology; categories of [stages of] learning and beyond learning; how to rise from clear light; enumeration of terms; characteristics; causes and conditions of accomplishment; what must be known; techniques for experiential cultivation; evaluation of signs; and results. Or, the accomplishment of union can be taught through these topics: the support; what must be known; what must be relinquished; illustrative examples, among which are three characteristics of union—cessation, appearance, and their interrelation; two methods of training; evaluation of consummation; and the benefits.
Among those six [aspects of approach and accomplishment], the initial three solitudes make the body, speech, and mind pliable; and they set a foundation for tranquil abiding. The latter three primarily teach insight, the abiding nature of things—illusory body, the emptiness of the [mind’s] objects, is the proximate cause of the body of perfect rapture; clear light, the emptiness of mind, is the ultimate truth; and [the accomplishment of union], the emptiness of nondual mind and its objects, the indivisible two truths, abides as the result.

(6) The sixth main topic [the results of perfecting experiential cultivation] has two parts: common accomplishments and sublime accomplishment. These are categorized as twenty-four: common accomplishments are the eight great activities and the eight feats; supreme accomplishments are the eight qualities of union.
That concludes the presentation of this tantra’s subject matter. Second, the means of expression, the verbal tantra, is presented by means of the six parameters and the four modes.
Both provisional meanings and definitive meanings are based on the limits of meaning: the same words can present both an obvious and an obscure meaning. Implicit and explicit meanings are based on the limits of words: words of both provisional and definitive meanings can present the same definite meaning. Literal and non-literal meanings are based in both limits of [meanings and words], since two [different] words can present the same meaning, and the same word can have two meanings.
Provisional meaning can conclusively present only the creation phase; definitive meaning can conclusively present only the completion phase. Implicit teachings mostly present the completion phase, yet [some] present the creation phase. The contrary is the case for teachings of explicit meaning. Non-literal meaning mostly presents the completion phase, yet in some cases it teaches the creation phase. The contrary is the case for the literal meaning. If two meanings are understood from one word, there is definitely a provisional and a definitive meaning. If there is an inapposite word in whichever of the two phases are taught, this is an explanation with an implicit meaning. The contrary case [i.e., no inapposite words] is an explicit explanation. Likewise, if there is just a symbolic explanation, the words will have a non-literal meaning. If the explanation can be understood by everyone, learned and unlearned, the words are to be understood literally.
Teaching using the four modes is explained in detail below [in Systems of Buddhist Tantra, pp. 287–290]. In brief, one word [in a tantra] can have four meanings: The first two meanings are taught on the basis of the words themselves: the semantic meaning and the general meaning. The hidden meaning and the ultimate meaning are taught based on the [tantra’s] meaning. All ten (the six limits and four modes) are taught in two contexts, public lectures and teaching to disciples.

Third is the relation between the tantra’s subject matter and its means of expression, the connection between the subject matter’s six topics and the twelve means of expression by which they are taught. For example, in the tantra’s first topic, the four kinds of individual who are the support (such as an individual like sandalwood, [or like a blue lotus, or a white lotus, or a red lotus]) are taught using the provisional meaning and a semantic mode of explanation. A jewel-like individual is taught using the definitive meaning and the ultimate mode of explanation. The provisional meaning, and semantic and general modes of explanation, are used to present the phase of creation’s basis of purification (the defilements of thoughts of things as ordinary); the phase of creation’s focus; the vase empowerment; the phase of creation’s path; the first half of physical solitude; and the worldly and common accomplishments. The definitive meaning and the hidden and ultimate modes of explanation are used to present the phase of completion’s basis of purification, active dualistic thoughts; the phase of completion’s focus; the higher three empowerments; the phase of completion’s six stages; and sublime accomplishment. The four [of the six limits not explained here], such as implicit and explicit meaning, are taught related to all six points of the subject matter.

In brief, the subject, the ultimate Matrix of Mystery, is as stated here:
I have taught the mystery in three aspects:
Wisdom body, wisdom speech, and wisdom mind.
The assembly, expressed as a matrix,
Is a synonym for all buddhas.
Thus, all buddhas’ ultimate wisdom body, speech, and mind are the mystery, since they are secret to those not endowed with outstanding fortune, such as pious attendants, solitary sages, and even followers of the great way. This is not a Buddha related to a limited realm and set of disciples, but one who epitomizes all buddhas’ assembly or matrix, a body of integral union, known as supreme Buddha Vajra Bearer or “the one who is all buddhas.” It is taught, “This is the place of the ultimate. Therefore, its means of expression, the verbal Matrix of Mystery [tantra], is the crown of all tantras.”
It is thought that even the bodhisattvas’ commentaries on the Wheel of Time [tantra] present Matrix of Mystery’s meaning, the tantras of Vajra of Delight are oriented toward Matrix of Mystery, and the Wheel of Supreme Bliss [tantras] elucidate Matrix of Mystery’s ultimate nature.

Slayer of the Lord of Death’s cycle of teachings appeared in India during five successive time periods. Not long after the canon’s third compilation, the secret mantra tantras of Slayer of the Lord of Death spread: that period of two hundred years constitutes the first time period, Desired Accomplishment. Groups of many thousands of followers reached great seal’s sublime accomplishment.
The second time period, Accomplishment of Various Forms of Conduct, lasted three hundred years. All without a single exception who entered this sacred circle achieved their goal. Further, very many reached sublime accomplishment. The third period, Harmful, lasted over five hundred years. Although many attained accomplishment, this was the era of Brahmin Chanaka and others, who primarily used their powers to enact overt conduct of wrathful activity. During the fourth period (from Master Lalitavajra until Kamalarakshita), Definite Engagement, [persons] definitely engaged in and mastered the creation phase and its activity.
The fifth time period, Partial Engagement, continues until the present day. For a hundred years (from the time of the six learned gate-keepers [of Vikramashila Monastery] until Abhayakaragupta), the tantra spread in India and accomplishment of its activity was swift. Then [the tantra of] Red Slayer of the Lord of Death spread and the cycle of Fearsome Vajra fell into disuse, and it seemed that barbarian [armies] reached central India. Therefore, the supreme general remedy [to repel] barbarian [armies] is Yamantaka [i.e., Slayer of the Lord of Death], king of wrathful deities, and great Fearsome Vajra in particular.

Although [Slayer of the Lord of Death] spread during those five time periods, in the experience of common disciples, the actual spread of the tantra’s empowerment and teaching began with Master Lalitavajra, continued with Venerable Buddhajnana, and ended with the Brahmin Master Shri Dhara. These three masters were, respectively, the early, middle, and last designated heirs of Slayer of the Lord of Death, and all three accepted the title “vajra master of the supreme sacred circle.”

In particular, Shri Dhara compiled all rivers of tantras and pith instructions of Slayer of the Lord of Death—the red and black forms, and Fearsome Vajra. They passed through a succession of other teachers; many of those teachings appeared in Tibet. It is said that in this land, emanated King Songtsen Gampo composed a practice text for this deity, which marked the earliest appearance of secret mantra in Tibet. As soon as communities of renunciants began to spread [in Tibet], The Victorious Slayer of the Lord of Death Tantra was translated, and its empowerment, teaching, pith instructions, and practical instructions appeared. Nupchen Sangyé Yeshé diffused countless cycles of Slayer of the Lord of Death: many accomplished masters of awareness mantras appeared. In these ways, this became the first secret mantra tantra to appear [in Tibet].

During the doctrine’s later spread, Translator Chokdru Sherab Lama first translated such texts as Black Slayer of the Lord of Death Tantra, Fearsome Vajra’s Seven Segments, and the practice text of Fearsome Vajra’s forty-nine-deity [sacred circle]. He also spread the empowerments and teachings of the black and red forms of Slayer of the Lord of Death, and Fearsome Vajra. Translator Naktso Tsultrim Gyalwa also studied [Slayer of the Lord of Death] with Atisha and Krishna-samaya-vajra and translated the tantra’s commentaries. Slayer of the Lord of Death became widespread through such activity as empowerments and teachings on the tantra.
Rongzom Chökyi Zangpo relied upon Upaya Shrimitra, then translated the tantras of Black Slayer of the Lord of Death and Fearsome Vajra, and taught them. Further, Translator Nyö Jungpo, Translator Ra Dorjé Drak, Translator Shuké Drakpa Gyaltsen, and many others made numerous new translations, revisions, and so on, of the red and black forms of Slayer of the Lord of Death, and Fearsome Vajra tantras, scriptures, and pith instructions.

In particular, this great tradition had eight founders: a group of four, including Translator Chal Chöpal Zangpo; a group of three—Translator Ra Dorjé Drak, Lama Kyo, and Zhang; and Translator Nyö Jungpo. [The four mentioned first] are Translator Chal Chöpal Zangpo, who received the cycles of Red and Black Slayer of the Lord of Death from Nishkalangka and then spread them in Tibet; Danashila, who gave them to Sakya Pandit; Translator Chak Chöjé Pal, who translated and taught texts by Virupa and others; and Translator Lowo Sherab Rinchen, who studied with Darpana Acharya and others, then transmitted the teachings. The empowerments, instructions, and pith instructions of Red Slayer of the Lord of Death have appeared from these streams of transmission.
The Ra tradition began with Translator Ra Dorjé Drak, who relied upon the Nepalese masters Baro Chak-dum and Mechalingpa, and received Fearsome Vajra’s empowerment, tantras, and pith instructions. In particular, he received from the Nepalese master Mahakaruna the complete cycles of such deities as Black Slayer of the Lord of Death, Red Slayer of the Lord of Death, and Fearsome Vajra. He then turned the great wheel of the teachings in Tibet. It is said that just the disciples to whom he gave the Slayer of the Lord of Death cycle numbered two thousand. These teachings were primarily continued by such teachers as Ra Chörab, but the way they became widespread is indescribable.

The Kyo tradition began with Lama Kyo, who fostered the spread of the Fearsome Vajra cycle he received from Amoghavajra and others. The Zhang tradition began with Translator Chokdru Sherab Lama (mentioned above), who received Black Slayer of the Lord of Death and Fearsome Vajra from Dévakarachandra. The tradition derives from those whom Chokdru Sherab Lama taught. The Nyö tradition began with Translator Nyö Jungpo, who received the threefold cycle of the Black Slayer of the Lord of Death from Baling Acharya and others.
Among these, the tradition of great Translator Ra Dorjé Drak, Manjushri Fearsome Vajra in the guise of a spiritual mentor, has a teaching system, practice, and power that continue uninterrupted; thus, its activity pervades all schools and is most exalted. In modern times, these tantras’ teaching systems no longer exist, yet we still have the tantras, reading transmissions for the works of Translator Ra Dorjé Drak, and the stream of empowerments and gradual guidance in the pith instructions from seven different traditions.
The eighth lord [Karmapa Mikyö Dorjé] highly praised the Nyö tradition of Fearsome Vajra, and composed texts for the practice of its sacred circle. The streams of its empowerment and reading transmissions still exist.

The Full Litany of the Names of Manjushri, chief of all tantras, comes from the chapter on the net of meditative states of the sixteen-thousand-verse Manjushri’s Net of Magical Illusion Tantra, a tantra of the father tantras’ stupidity family. The bodhisattvas elucidated it as part of the Wheel of Time tradition; Lalitavajra, as a father tantra of the highest yoga tantras; Manjushrikirti and Manjushrimitra, as a yoga tantra. It is even said that in Tibet, it is elucidated as great perfection, and in India as the middle way.
The great Translator Rinchen Zangpo first translated this tantra; various translators later revised it. Ngoktön Chöku Dorjé received from Kyi Jéma Lungpa the teaching transmission, the stream of the empowerment, along with the pith instructions passed from the great scholar Smriti Jnana—the yoga tantra tradition. Ngoktön also received the highest yoga tantra tradition, Métripa’s doctrinal custom, directly from his teacher Marpa Chökyi Lodrö. The streams of these empowerments and reading transmissions still exist undiminished, and the former lineage’s teaching system [that of the yoga tantra] still survives.
When one gains certainty in this sovereign tantra, one gains certainty in the entirety of the highest yoga tantras. If one doesn’t know this tantra’s meaning, one won’t know the essentials of the highest yoga tantras’ path.
The Stainless Light Commentary to the Concise Tantra of the Wheel of Time
states:
To dispel sentient beings’ doubts, the Transcendent Conqueror gathered [Manjushri’s names] from all secret mantra ways into The Full Litany of the Names of Manjushri, and taught it thoroughly to Bodhisattva Vajra Holder. Those who do not know The Full Litany of the Names of Manjushri do not know Buddha Vajra Bearer’s wisdom body. Those who do not know Buddha Vajra Bearer’s wisdom body do not know the secret mantra way. Those who do not know the secret mantra way are beings in the wheel of life, since they live apart from the path of the Transcendent Conqueror Vajra Bearer.

It has been said that The Full Litany of the Names of Manjushri Tantra, like a wish-granting tree or a wish-fulfilling jewel, bestows to all beings every temporary and ultimate desired goal. As stated in the chapter on this tantra’s benefits, just to read this tantra’s words at the very least reaps boundless benefits, such as purification of very powerful obscurations and negative karma, and rapid reception of Lord Manjushri’s blessings.
On the subject of an outline of the body of this tantra, the lineage-bearing king [of Shambhala], Pundarika, divided it into fourteen chapters, as follows:
The request, the reply, surveying the groups of propensities, The net of magical illusion’s manifest awakening, Vajra basic space, [wisdom of the basic space of phenomena,] Mirrorlike wisdom, discerning [wisdom], [the wisdom of]
equality, Accomplishing [wisdom], praise of the fivetranscendent buddhas’ qualities, Benefits, praises, and rejoicing.
The chapter on the net of magical illusion forms this tantra’s root. The later chapters were added as an explanatory tantra, or as branches. In them, the provisional meaning—emanation of six sacred circles—is conjoined with the teaching of the definitive meaning—six vital essences. Among those chapters, only the chapter on discerning wisdom teaches completely the result of [the paths of] maturation [i.e., empowerment] and liberation [i.e., instruction in meditation]. Within that [eighth] chapter, the [fifth] verse that begins,
In the three worlds, your youthful form is unique. [An aged elder, or a chief of beings, You bear the thirty-two marks of physical perfection. Beautiful, you are the most handsome in the three worlds.]
teaches the meaning of the entire tantra. Therefore that verse is taught joined with the general tantra’s process of manifest realization [i.e., the phase of creation].
Although many different translations of The Full Litany of the Names of Manjushri appeared, their meaning is the same. What lasting dissimilarities [between editions] exist are due to two systems of commentary. According to the yoga tantra, [the tantra reads]:
There are a thousand drops and a hundred syllables.
While the highest yoga tantra states, “. . . six syllables.”

Supreme Bliss represents the mother tantras’ innermost essence. Twenty-six or twenty-seven independent traditions of it are said to have appeared in India. Most of the root and explanatory tantras’ empowerments, reading transmissions, and teaching doctrines reached Tibet. A large proportion of Indian accomplished masters gained accomplishment in this tantra. Therefore, in general, traditions of Supreme Bliss were very numerous. Nevertheless, three traditions—from Luyipa, Vajraghantapa, and Krishnacharya—predominated, as renowned as the sun and moon. Further, there were traditions from Darikapa, Dengipa, Indrabhuti the lesser, the Sri Lankan Jinabhadra, Durjayachandra, the eastern Lavapa ([also known as] Sunyata-samadhi), the first part of Vajra Holder’s commentary, Bhavabhadra, and Brahmin Ratnavajra. These were independent traditions based upon the root tantra of Supreme Bliss; they have been translated into Tibetan.
There were an additional fifteen independent traditions developed in India by fifteen great accomplished masters: the accomplished Master Luyang Ken, Krishnavajra (a style in which the deity has an extended left leg), Kalahamsakumara, Dharmapa (a style in which all the deities are black), Kukkutipa (a style in which all the deities have animal heads), Ghundaripa (a style in which the male and female consorts have the same color, and all other deities have no definite color), Chatipa, Nadipa, Ghandhatapa, Vinapa (a style in which all deities have two arms), Tantapa, Bhadepa, Tadakapa, Kamkalapa, and Jayanandipa (a style in which all the deities are yellow). Further, the tradition of Master Bodhivajra, whose life was foretold in The Latter Tantra of the Wheel of Time, did not spread for long in India but continues in Dravida until the present day.
The explanatory tantras [of Supreme Bliss] present many sacred circles.
Their empowerments, explanatory doctrines, texts, etc., were widespread in India. Among them, just six sacred circles from the explanatory tantras reached Tibet.

In Tibet, at the outset of the doctrine’s later spread, the great Translator Rinchen Zangpo, Translator Gö Kukpa Lhétsé, and others translated many scriptures of the Supreme Bliss cycle, such as tantras, practice texts, and commentaries.
Lokya Sherab Tsek received the Supreme Bliss cycle from the Pam-ting brothers in Nepal and passed it to Translator Mal Lodrö Drakpa and others. Translator Mal himself relied upon many masters, including the Pamting brothers, and became proficient in the Supreme Bliss cycle. When Sachen Kunga Nyingpo and others received these teachings from him, they spread widely among the Sakya father and sons, and through their lineage.
Translator Marpa Chökyi Lodrö received the highest, definitive, secret teachings of the Supreme Bliss cycle from Naropa and later taught them to his disciples in Tibet. It appears that many special systems of empowerment and instructions were transmitted through the Marpa and Milarepa doctrinal lineages. In particular, Marpa Dopa Chökyi Wangchuk relied upon many teachers, including Naropa’s disciple Manakashri, and received Naropa’s tradition of the empowerments, tantras, teaching system, and pith instructions for Supreme Bliss. He also translated many parts of the Supreme Bliss cycle and had many disciples in Tibet.

Various lineages appeared, which include those of Puhrang Lochung and Translator Nyö Jungpo, who received instruction from the three Pamting brothers and other masters. In particular, the lineages that passed through Puhrang Lochung had an excellent teaching system that lasted a long time. Lord Atisha gave Supreme Bliss to great Translator Rinchen Zangpo, Rongpo Gargé, and others. The latter passed this to Yakdé Zémarwa, from whom a tradition of explanatory teachings, etc.,
arose. Further, Lord Atisha gave these teachings to Translator Naktso Tsultrim Gyalwa; from that current, a stream known as Balpang Nawa’s tradition arose. “Including” in the root text alludes to such traditions as that of Translator Sumpa Dharma Yönten, who relied upon Scholar Jayasena and received from him An Ocean of Dakas Supreme Bliss Tantra, its commentary, and ancillary texts, which he translated. The doctrines of its empowerments and teaching system, etc., spread widely in Tibet.
Among the various other empowerment doctrines and teaching doctrines related to other explanatory tantras, the most exalted was that of Marpa Dopa Chökyi Wangchuk. His disciples, including the Tsang scholar Gyanam Dozepa Loden, perfectly preserved his lineage of teachings: the stream of its teaching and practice diffused throughout all schools. Among those lineages, Butön Rinpoché composed commentaries to the root tantra and The Tantra of Yoginis’ Conduct: his teaching system continues within the Gédenpa order to this day. Over twenty minor lineage empowerments, instruction in the Luyipa, Vajraghantapa, and Krishnacharya traditions, and many kinds of creation and completion phase meditations of the female consort’s [Vajra Yogini] doctrine continue to exist.

Explanation of the Tantra of Supreme Bliss
This king of tantras of supreme contemplative practice brings accomplishment by having been read; it constitutes a marvelous rite for accomplishment. To explain this primordially existent great tantra, Lord Jampal Nyingpo’s teaching system in The Complete Illumination of the Hidden Meaning provides a wonderful, brilliant analysis of the profound subjects of the discourses and tantras without relying on others’ work. He presents a preliminary outline of the Buddha’s word in general and then introduces the specific tantra of Supreme Bliss. Within that, he begins the main explanation of The Short Root Tantra of Supreme Bliss with a synthesis in three parts: the pith instructions used for the teaching, how the teaching is given, and the actual teaching.
First [the pith instructions used for the teaching], the tantras can be taught using other tantras [as models], using the bodhisattvas’ commentaries, or based upon spiritual masters’ pith instructions. Among those options, this explanation is based on the first and third. Thus, the tantra is taught using illustrious Master Narotapa’s pith instructions: the root and explanatory tantras are correlated based upon uncommon tantras that teach the root tantra—The Highest Tantra of Manifest Expression, The Vajra Daka Tantra, The Origins of Binder of the Wheel Tantra, and The Tantra of Yoginis’ Conduct; the common The Sambuta Tantra; and texts by Luyipa, Vajraghantapa and Krishnacharya.

Second [how the teaching is given], The Short Root Tantra of Supreme Bliss has fifty-one chapters which contain the meaning of inseparable skillful means and sublime insight, related to the nature of the [Sanskrit alphabet’s] fifty vowels and consonants, and to the general essential nature. According to An Introduction to the Brief Tantra of the Wheel of Supreme Bliss by Scholar Sumatikirti, the first chapter provides a brief presentation, chapters two to fifty give a full explanation, and the last chapter offers a summary of those chapters.
A brief outline of what is taught contains six topics: bestowal of empowerment, and within it, the presentation of the [fourteen] natures [listed below]; accumulation of numbers of mantras and the attainment of accomplishment; attainment of both [common and sublime] accomplishments through the kindness of female emissaries; tantric pledges that accompany one on the path and conduct that enriches [meditative experience]; the four seals, including great seal; and understanding signs of the swift attainment of accomplishment. The stages of the path can also be understood from this brief outline [of The Short Root Tantra of Supreme Bliss], due to their parallel sequence.

<d e="2">
Third, the actual teaching, has four parts: the title’s meaning, the translator’s salutation, the text’s meaning, and the conclusion’s meaning. The text’s meaning has three parts: a brief presentation, the full explanation, and a conclusion. The first [a brief presentation] has four parts: the commitment to explain the secrets, an exhortation to listen to the secrets, the techniques for completing the journey through the path’s secrets, and presentation of the subject of the practice of secrets. These four are taught both in literal and non-literal language. This constitutes the first chapter [of the tantra]. Second, [the full explanation] comprises the forty-nine remaining chapters. Third, chapter fifty-one contains the conclusion.
Thus, after the commitment to teach [the tantra], its meaning has five parts: a presentation of the extreme difficulty to obtain this tantra’s pith instructions; an explanation of the techniques for easy attainment, the fourteen natures; a presentation of the benefits of engaging in those natures and the shortcomings of lack of faith; a description of the process of meditation, having synthesized the fourteen natures; and a presentation of techniques to not reject any of the Buddha’s excellent speech.
The fourteen natures mentioned here are the following: the nature of the clothing or residence, the five seals, etc.; the nature of the branches of sublime insight; the nature of the daggers and [protective] tent; the nature of the [Sanskrit] vowels; the nature of the [Sanskrit] consonants; the nature of preliminary emptiness, including emptiness of the cause; the nature of the entry, including sound; the nature of the concise application; the nature of satisfaction with nectar; the nature of transcendence; the nature of the hand-given offering; the nature of the empowerments; the nature of perfect protection with supreme armor; and the nature of offerings made with all mantras.

Taranata’s Explanation of the Tantra of Supreme Bliss
Taranata was glorious Supreme Bliss manifest in the form of a vajra-holding spiritual mentor. He opened a previously unknown door to a treasure of profound, eloquent teachings based on the power of his wisdom and realization of the threefold explanation described above, the oral transmission from great Indian accomplished masters, and his discernment of secret subjects.
Taranata’s explanation of the tantras of Supreme Bliss is synthesized in two parts: its subject matter, the tantra’s meaning, presented as the binding of manifest realization; and its means of expression, the tantra’s words, elucidated in terms of provisional and definitive meanings. The first [the tantra’s subject] has three parts: the mystery of the basis, the continuity of the cause; the mystery of the path, the continuity of techniques; and the mystery of the result, the continuity of the result.
The first [continuity of the basis] has five parts: the glorious héruka as the epitome of the four doors of liberation; union free from formulations; binding in all aspects; that which is pervasive and difficult to realize; and how [the tantra] comprises all the qualities of the basis of being.
The second [continuity of the path] has three parts: tantric pledges, the root of the path; the two phases [of tantric meditation], the actual path; and conduct of enrichment. The first [the pledges] has three parts: giving pledges to those who do not have them—the empowerment; preventing impairment once one has taken the pledges; and preserving the entirety of pledges. The second [the actual path] has two parts: the creation phase and the completion phase. The first has various kinds of detailed and simplified categories. The second [the completion phase] has five parts: an outline of the channels, vital essences, and circulating energies—the basis for [the phase of completion’s] meditations; the subject of meditation— the meaning of the four seals; identification of the essence of the completion phase; the difference between metaphors and their meanings; and how the path’s stages are traversed. The third, conduct, has two parts: general and specific conduct.
Third, continuity of the result, has three parts: activities, such as pacification; the common accomplishments; and sublime accomplishment, great seal.

Second, the means of expression, the verbal tantra, has three parts: the first chapter provides a brief presentation; the second chapter up to halfway through the fiftieth chapter provides a full explanation; and the remaining one and a half chapters (from “. . . then something else must be taught...”) contain the conclusion.
The first [the brief presentation] has eight parts: an exposition of [the tantra’s] relevant purposes in the form of a preamble; an explanation mainly of the mystery of the result, in the form of a description of the [tantra’s] magnificent setting; advice to listen that mainly presents the mystery of the ground and path; the rite of offering to the lineage-bearing consort; identification of the mystery of the path; the entirety of the path’s secondary pledges; the meaning of the four seals; and a presentation of the [tantra’s] definite chapters.
Second is a very detailed explanation, from a presentation of the master’s qualifications to the burnt offering rite for the activity of magnetizing.
Third, the last half of the fiftieth chapter presents such subjects as awakening’s stages. The fifty-first chapter begins with a commitment to teach, then synthesizes [the tantra] in a threefold presentation of the mystery of the path, the mystery of the basis, and the gateway to them. The first [the path] has four parts: the actual mystery, the fourteen natures; their benefits; a supplement for the creation phase; and advice to have faith. Each of these four has sub-categories. The first [the fourteen natures] is presented as threefold, related to the nature of the creation phase alone, the nature of the completion phase alone, and the nature of the entire tantra’s meaning. Here, I have presented this subject according to the last of these three.

Many different traditions of Vajra of Delight, the ultimate mother tantra, appeared in India. The seven principal ones were complete in empowerments, teachings, and pith instructions: those of Master Saroruha, Krishna-samaya-vajra, Durjayachandra, Ratnakara, Naropa, Métripa, and the Kashmiri Yashobhadra. Twelve commentaries to this tantra are known, including The Vajra Essence Commentary and Lotus Commentary Elucidating the Diffi cult Points.
The three traditions from Saroruha, Krishna-samaya-vajra, and Durjayachandra each formed an independent tradition. The others resemble compilations of the best aspects of those three. It seems that “the Kashmiri Yashobhadra” is considered to be one of Naropa’s names.

Among those traditions, in Tibet, Drokmi Shakya Yeshé relied on such masters as Scholar Gayadhara and received the empowerments, teaching, and pith instructions of Master Virupa’s tradition, which preserved the lineage of Dombi Héruka and others. Drokmi’s direct lineage diff used widely from such masters as the lord of the Sakyas [Sakya Pandit]. Gö Kukpa Lhétsé received Saroruha’s and Shantipa’s tradition from Brahmin Krishnapada and spread it in Tibet. A tradition appeared from Gyijo Dawé Özer’s translations and teachings. The tradition of the great scholar Naropa’s lineage transmitted through the teacher from Lhodrak, Marpa Chökyi Lodrö, was spread by Métön Sönam Gyaltsen, Ngoktön Chöku Dorjé, and others. Translator Chal Sönam Gyaltsen received Naropa’s tradition from Pamtingpa and spread it. Ngoktön Chöku Dorjé’s lineage of disciples is known as the Ram tradition. In later times, the transmission to Taklungpa is the Jnana tradition of Vajra of Delight; the transmission to all-knowing lord Taranata is the Shantigupta tradition.
Among the many traditions (of which these are the main ones), the most exalted are those whose streams of empowerments, teachings, pith instructions, and experiential cultivation have not disappeared: the lineage from Translator Marpa Chökyi Lodrö to Métön Sönam Gyaltsen, Ngoktön Chöku Dorjé, and Tsurtön Wang-gi Dorjé; and the lineage from Translator Drokmi Shakya Yeshé to the Sakyapa lineage holders. Together they have hoisted a victory banner of the doctrine of glorious Vajra of Delight’s teaching and practice that stands until the end of existence.
It is said that Drokmi’s followers, the fathers and spiritual sons of the Sakya line, have six traditions of Vajra of Delight: the tradition of Virupa’s pith instructions, Dombi Héruka’s tradition or the commentarial tradition, Saroruha’s tradition, Krishnapada’s tradition, Naropa’s tradition, and Métripa’s tradition. Since among them, the transmissions of the last two were interrupted, later generations of Sakyapas are said to have inherited four transmissions.

Explanation of Vajra of Delight Tantra
A definitive presentation of Vajra of Delight’s root and explanatory tantras has two parts: the general meaning and the meaning of the texts. The general meaning is taught with four methods: an outline of the tantras in general; presentation of the title’s meaning; the pith instructions, techniques to explain the tantra; and manifest realization of the tantra.
[First,] the general outline has two parts: outlines of the result to be attained and of the path that leads to that attainment. [Second,] the meaning of the tantra’s title has two parts: presentations of the meaning which is expressed; and the means of its expression, the verbal tantra. [Third,] the pith instructions, techniques to explain the tantra, have six parts: teaching using six profound instructions, three continuities, three natures, four locations, three aspects of purity, and seven facets of mystery. [Fourth,] the tantra’s manifest realization has three parts: the preliminary continuity of the cause, the individual who is the basis [for the practice]; the continuity of techniques, the experience the individual must cultivate [in meditation]; the continuity of the result, what arises from that cultivation. The first [continuity of the cause] has four teachings: cause, family, what must be eliminated, and dependence on conditions. The second [continuity of techniques] has [fifty-three teachings]: ten on stages of conduct, four on stages of the view, four on uncommon stages, seven for the highest stages, eleven on the main part of the path, twelve stages in the temporary results, and five branches in the ultimate result. Thus, manifest realization [of the deity] is taught in fifty-seven points.

The followers of Naropa and Métripa—Lord Marpa’s doctrinal lineage—have such transmissions as the four empowerments accompanied by relevant parts of the root and explanatory tantras; teaching transmissions for The Vajra Tent Tantra, The Vajra of Delight Tantra’s Two Chapters, and The Sambuta Tantra; and guidance for [the meditation practices of] mixing and transference. Among them, in modern times the teaching of The Vajra Tent Tantra and The Sambuta Tantra has ceased. In the Marpa Kagyu, there are three traditions, of Ngoktön Chöku Dorjé, Métön Sönam Gyaltsen, and Tsurtön Wang-gi Dorjé. In Ngoktön’s tradition, a transmission from Ram Tsenchen, called the Ram tradition, is classified separately.
The teaching of the root tantra has four parts: identification of the tantra to which general and specific doctrines belong, based on their characteristics; an explanation of how the tantra appeared in the human world and how it was passed down; a presentation of the tantra’s subject—an outline of the basis, path, and result; and the verbal tantra’s manner of expression, the headings of its teaching method, and complete explanation of every word of the tantra, preceded by a description of the magnificent setting of its teaching.
At present, there exist fifteen different doctrines of the empowerment for Vajra of Delight and his consort, along with the root and explanatory tantras, teaching systems, and traditions of meditation instruction. All of these continue without decline.

Some Indian doctrinal traditions of Mahamaya, such as those of Master Vinayadatta and Ratnakarashanti, were translated, taught, and spread [in Tibet] by Translator Gö Kukpa Lhétsé and Atisha, but now their transmission has disappeared. Lord Marpa received [Mahamaya] from Shantibhadra; from those empowerments and teachings, along with pith instructions, the great lord of Jonang [Taranata] composed instructions for the empowerments, and commentaries to the tantra, for which only the instruction through reading transmission remains.
There were two Indian traditions of the family of permanence deity, Four Seats: Aryadeva’s tradition based upon the root tantra, and Master Bhavabhadra’s tradition based upon the concise tantra. In Tibet, there were Gö Kukpa Lhétsé’s tradition, from Scholar Smriti Jnana’s own cycle of translations; and Gayadhara’s and Drokmi Pönlop’s [i.e., Drokmi Shakya Yeshé’s] teachings and translations. The main tradition is the one Lord Marpa received from Dakini Wearer of Human Bone Ornaments and others. The complete empowerments, explanations, and pith instructions appeared [in that tradition], and even today, an unbroken transmission of the empowerments and meditation instructions continues.
In Tibet, Translator Gyijo Dawé Özer and Drongzho Salwa Drak translated and taught traditions of Buddha Skull from the great accomplished master Saraha (the pith instruction tradition) and from Master Abhayakaragupta. Now, however, only the transmission of the empowerment that derives from Marpa remains. There continues to be a reading transmission for the texts of these tantras (Mahamaya, Four Seats, and Buddha Skull) included within the collection The Hundred Thousand Later Tantras [i.e., the section of tantras withinThe Collection of the Buddha’s Words in Translation].

In brief, through the kindness of those translators, the empowerments, teachings, and profound instructions for meditation of many tantras spread for a long time, and due to that, countless accomplished masters appeared. Nevertheless, the strand of the transmission of their teachings and practice is extremely tenuous. Therefore, I ask those who care about the doctrine to apply themselves with great effort to preserve these transmissions with as much diligence as they are able.
Further, in the sovereign horse family, The Source of Liberation Ultimate Tantra, two traditions appeared, those of Lilavajra and Lokaprada. Their empowerments, tantras, teachings, and pith instructions were passed from the accomplished master Venerable Shantigupta to Lord Taranata, who translated and taught them. Now, only the teaching in the form of a reading transmission for the empowerments and pith instructions remains.
In this section, only Four Seats in fact belongs to the family of permanence, but I have presented the others here due to constraints in the root text’s verses.

The Wheel of Time Tantra was very widespread in India. Yet, since both the tantra and its commentary were very clear, there were no variant traditions. The texts Master Kalachakrapada the Elder, Manjuvajra, Master Chilupa, and Pito Acharya each brought to India from Shambhala differed [only] in having one or two more, or less, verses.
In Tibet, initially Scholar Shri Bhadrabodhi and Translator Gyijo Dawé Özer translated the tantra and its commentary. The lineage of masters to whom they entrusted the empowerments, teachings, and pith instructions, including Translator Trom, is known as the Jo tradition. Tsami Sangyé Drak received the teachings from Kalachakrapada and translated the major commentary. He taught this to his disciples, including Translator Ga Namgyal Dorjé; this is the Tsami tradition. Ra Chörab received from the Nepalese Pandit Samantashri the tantra and commentary, and translated them. He then taught Ra Yeshé Sengé and others; this is the Ra tradition.
Translator Dro Sherab Drak relied upon Somanata of Kashmir, and translated the tantra and the entire commentary, except for the changeless perfection chapter. He received the empowerments, teachings, and pith instructions. Later, Scholar [Somanata] made his own translation of the changeless perfection chapter. Penyul Drapgom met this great scholar and became both a scholar and an accomplished master of the Wheel of Time. He taught Drotön [Lhajé Dropukpa?] and others, through whom his teachings became widespread. As these teachings were based upon Translator Dro Sherab Drak’s translations, this is the Dro tradition.

Further, the great Kashmiri Scholar Shakyashri taught Chak Drachom, Chal Chökyi Zangpo, and Sakya Pandit; three traditions originated from those three masters. Translator Rongling Dorjé Wangchuk, Translator Teng Tsultrim Jungné, Translator Shéu, and Translator Sé Zhönnu Tsultrim each received teachings from such masters as Tsami Sangyé Drak and Abhayakaragupta, and transmitted them. Translator Rongling Dorjé Wangchuk founded Rongling Soka Monastery. Translator Chak Chöjé Pal received the complete cycle of empowerments, teachings, and pith instructions from such masters as Rahulashribhadra and Jinarakshita. This is the source of the Chak tradition. The great Scholar Vibhutichandra gave empowerments, teachings, and instructions to many Tibetan spiritual guides. In particular, he gave his nine sublime disciples, including Ko Drakpa, the six branches of application from Shavaripa’s proximate lineage. There were many other such Wheel of Time traditions.
Twenty-four variant translations of The Wheel of Time Tantra itself are known. Among them, the Ra, Dro, Chak, and great Scholar Vibhutichandra’s traditions contained the complete doctrines of empowerments, teachings, and pith instructions.

Omniscient Rangjung Dorjé received most of those traditions from Nyédo Kunga Döndrup and then transmitted them, and they became widespread. Rangjung Dorjé composed A Compilation of All Astrology, the subject of [The Wheel of Time Tantra’s] chapter on the realms; The Profound Inner Meaning, the subject of the inner certainty chapter; an empowerment text and a practice text, the subjects of the empowerment and practice chapters; and The Clear Essence of the Three Contemplative Practices, the subject of the wisdom chapter. The stream of the reading transmission for pointing-out instructions, and the stream of instruction in the six branches of the completion phase continue uninterrupted. Thus, the stream of the ultimate teaching of The Wheel of Time Tantra continues to the present day.

Nevertheless, the main Wheel of Time traditions are the Dro tradition, heirs to the practice of experiential cultivation; and the Ra tradition, heirs of the tantra’s teaching. The Dro practice tradition appears to be transmitted through the Jonang lineage; the Ra teaching tradition, through the Zhalu lineage. The lord of the Jonang teachings, the great omniscient master [Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen], diligently taught and disseminated the tantra’s teaching system, and most of his fourteen disciples who had the same [degree of attainment] as himself held this transmission, yet today it is no longer extant. Butön Rinpoché received the Ra tradition’s stream of teaching and taught the tantra thirty-two times. Butön Rinchen Drup composed such works on the Wheel of Time as Kyo Rawa Dönyö Pal’s edition of Butön’s notes on the tantra; The Cherished Jeweled Key to the Teaching Method; The Ripened Stalks of the Definitive Meaning; Illuminating Light Rays: The Essence of the Profound Meaning Explained; A Table of Contents, an Adornment for “Stainless Light”; the astrology treatise The Joy of the Learned, and its ancillary texts; and Memorandum of Translator Tuksé. Based on these texts, Zhalu Monastery’s own Wheel of Time stream of teaching continues to the present day. The lord precious master [Tsongkapa] received these teachings from a disciple of Butön Rinpoché, Gangsumpa Déchen Chökyi Palwa. Tsongkapa transmitted these teachings only once. At that time, countless persons who preserved the collections of the Buddha’s teachings gathered to receive them. Three among these masters wrote major commentaries, one of whom was Kédrup Gélek Palwa [i.e., Kédrup Jé]. Zhang Zhungpa Chöwang Drakpa added a supplementary postface to Kédrup Jé’s commentary, from which a stream of teaching continues to the present day. All the doctrinal empowerments and profound and vast pith instructions of both the Jonang and Zhalu lineages continue as unbroken transmissions.

Explanation of Wheel of Time Tantra
In teaching this sovereign of tantras, three subjects provide a general presentation: the meaning of what must be taught, the words used in teaching, and how the teaching is given. This last has two parts: the branches of the teaching method and the act of teaching. The first [the branches of the teaching method] has four parts: how the teacher, the Buddha, appeared; how the Buddha taught the Buddhist ways in general and the Wheel of Time specifically; the story of the source of the lineage; and how it is taught and learned. The second [the act of teaching] has three parts: the master who teaches, the disciple who listens, and how the teaching is given and received.
Following that preliminary [general presentation], the main part of the tantra’s major commentary, the words used in the teaching, has five parts—the five chapters on the purity of all phenomena. [These chapters comprise] eighty-one points, the pure signs of physical perfection.
First, Chapter One, “World Systems,” gives a teaching through ten summaries, the pure form of the powerful ten-letter mantra. The first six present teachings that cover the tantra in general; the remaining four teach what is covered, the tantra’s meaning as the external Wheel of Time. Chapter Two, “Inner Certainty,” teaches the inner Wheel of Time through seven summaries, the pure seven elements—the four elements [earth, fire, water, air], the sun, the moon, and Rahu. Chapter Three, “Empowerment,” teaches six summaries, the pure essence of the six sense constituents as the six wisdom families’ chief buddhas. Chapter Four, “The Means of Practice,” teaches five summaries, the pure aspect of the five families’ chief buddhas. Chapter Five, “Wisdom,” teaches four major summaries, the pure aspect of the four vajras. Among these, summaries from the third chapter teach the alternative Wheel of Time as the nature of suchness. The final summary teaches in full detail the purification of the buddhas’ realms, acts for beings’ benefit, and the conclusion, prayers of dedication and aspiration.

In relation to the [eighty-one] points [“the pure signs of physical perfection”], Chapter One has twenty-four points—the pure aspects of the twelve links of interdependent causation in unfolding and reverse sequences. Chapter Two has eighteen points: the pure aspects of the six senses, six sense objects, and six natures. Chapter Three has twelve points: the pure aspects of the twelve empowerments of entering as a child. Chapter Four has seven points: the pure aspects of the seven birthplaces. Chapter Five has twenty points: the twenty aspects that illustrate awakening.
As to the meaning of “summaries,” just as many small measures are contained in a larger measure, these summaries contain many confluences of words and meanings. As to “points,” just as a large measure contains many small measures, these points contain various separate words and meanings. In brief, the outer, inner, and alternative Wheels of Time are summarized as the subjects to be presented, then taught.

In the early translations of the Ancient secret mantra way, due to the kindness of the great reincarnate translators and scholars of Buddhism’s earlier spread in Tibet, when Lord Atisha inspected the Indian texts stored in Samyé Monastery, he saw many tantras he had never heard of before. In praise, he remarked, “It seems as if secret mantra’s doctrines have not flourished even in India as they have in Tibet.” As that story indicates, countless empowerments, teachings, and pith instructions appeared [during the early period]. Nevertheless, secret mantra was zealously kept secret during that time: monastic colleges stressed the way of philosophical systems, while meditation centers emphasized the secret mantra way. Therefore, it seems that no college curriculums included [any tantras] apart from a few outer tantras, and none of the three inner tantras. From that period until the present day, the doctrines of empowerments and teachings have continued uninterrupted.
Vajrasattva’s Net of Illusion, the Secret Essence, the Sovereign Tantra of Definite Suchness constitutes the eighteen great tantras’ root or general meaning. Many special qualities make it exalted like a victory banner above the crown of the head of all tantras.

The lineage of these sovereign tantras [that make up the cycle of The Secret Essence Tantra] passed from King Ja to his daughter [Princess Gomadevi] and Kukuraja, and from them to Lalitavajra and Buddhaguhya. The former composed the commentary The Precious Design; the latter, An Explanation of Categories. Those two masters passed the teachings to Vimalamitra, who composed a commentary, The Framework Scripture.
Other Indian commentaries are Chandragomi’s The Chinese Knot Commentary, Suryaprabhasingha’s An Extensive Commentary to “The Secret Essence Tantra,” and Padmasambhava’s The Great Explanatory Text.
In Tibet, great Scholar Vimalamitra gave this teaching to Ma Rinchen Chok and Nyak Jnana Kumara. Ma Rinchen Chok translated the tantra into Tibetan. Further, great Master [Padmasambhava] passed this teaching to Nyak Jnana Kumara, who taught it to Sokpo Palgyi Yeshé, who taught Nupchen Sangyé Yeshé. In eastern Tibet, Ma Rinchen Chok taught Tsukru Rinchen Zhönnu and Gyéré Chok-kyong. Those two taught Darjé Paldrak and Zhang Gyalwé Yönten. Zhang Gyalwé Yönten taught Nupchen Sangyé Yeshé. Master Bérotsana translated and taught Suryaprabhasingha’s commentary in the Jamchen Temple of Orru, Kham [eastern Tibet]. The transmission derived from Nupchen Sangyé Yeshé and received by the elder and nephew Zurpa is known as the Zur tradition.

Dampa Déshek of Gyalwa Katok Monastery received the teachings from Dzom Drowé Gönpo, a disciple of Lhajé Dropukpa. In Dampa Déshek’s lineage, there were such masters as Buborpa Yeshé Gyaltsen, who composed a commentary to this tantra. The teaching and practice transmissions of Dampa Déshek’s lineage spread back to central Tibet and later became known as the Kham tradition of The Net of Magical Illusion Tantra.
Rongzom Chökyi Zangpo inherited all the doctrines of such masters as Padmasambhava, Bérotsana, and Vimalamitra. He wrote a commentary to The Secret Essence Tantra entitled The Jewel Commentary; this constitutes the Rong tradition. Omniscient Longchen Rabjam Zangpo wrote the commentary Dispelling Darkness in the Ten Directions, elucidating [this tantra] according to the atiyoga tradition. Rok Sherab Ö gathered many transmissions, such as the So, Zur, and Kyo traditions; his teaching became known as the Rok tradition.
Later, when scholars of the later tantras denied [the validity of The Secret Essence Tantra], Chomden Rikpé Raldri obtained the actual Sanskrit text that had belonged to Master Padmasambhava, and asked Translator Tarpa Nyima Gyaltsen to translate it. Chomden Rikpé Raldri composed Adorning Flowers for “The Secret Essence Tantra” and other texts, and spread this teaching. From then on, even academic logicians could not dispute [this tantra’s validity].

The Zur doctrinal system, especially exalted among all these traditions, later dwindled to became a slender thread. At that time, the great translators Bérotsana and Gyalmo Yudra Nyingpo took intentional rebirth as the two brothers of Mindrol Ling Monastery to rekindle the dying embers of the early translations’ doctrines. [One of the brothers,] Terchen Rinpoché, received with great effort in many ways the cycle of the early translations’ canon, principally those of this sovereign tantra. He composed various outstanding texts for each tantra’s practice techniques and sacred circle rituals. He also wrote a brief, clear practice for the sacred circle of The Net of Magical Illusion of the Peaceful and Wrathful Deities, and established the custom of the regular performance of its practice-offering ritual. [His brother] Lochen Dharmashri composed The General Meaning of the Sovereign Tantra, the Secret Essence: The Lord of Secrets’ Oral Transmission and the word-by-word commentary Adornment of the Lord of Secrets’ Wisdom. These [two brothers] had twenty-one disciples, known as Rabjampa [master of infinite teachings]. One of them, Rabjampa Orgyen Chödrak, wrote a memorandum of instructions called A Garland of Jewels Memorandum. Based on these and other works, an especially exalted teaching transmission has continued until the present, thus restoring the doctrine’s dying embers on its foundation.

The Secret Essence Tantra
The Sovereign Tantra, the Secret Essence, exalted due to eight supreme qualities, is the subject; it is taught by four explanatory tantras—The Ocean-like Exposition Tantra, The Unimpeded Sound Tantra, The Essence of Wisdom Tantra, and The Vajra Mirror Tantra—and by the three sources of authority. How is it taught? In general, this supreme tantra is taught through mahayoga’s seven adornments; and specifically, early masters taught it [in the following three ways]: “The explanation grasps the point, like an arrow.” This is an explanation of how all phenomena, gathered into the basis, path, and result, are found within the title.
[For the second,] “the explanation grasps the middle, like a spear,” Chapter Five [of The Secret Essence Tantra] states:
Long mantras endowed with the characteristics of knowledge
and engagement
Are the cause and contributory conditions that ripen the result.
That which has power
Is known as the realm of awareness holders and victors.
These lines state that the primary “cause” is the characteristic of know-ing—the view; the “contributory conditions” are the characteristics of engagement—meditative states; and the path’s results are the states of the four awareness holders. Thus, this teaching [system] is based upon a synthesis into these three characteristics.
“The explanation grasps the handle, like a sword” is an explanation of the meaning of two four-line verses in the last chapter in terms of four perceptions: the natural perceptions of the basis; deluded perceptions of lack of realization; disciples’ perceptions of the path; and the transcendent buddhas’ perceptions, the result.

The Zur teaching system of the canon’s [tantras] is based upon a fivefold explanation of the nature, the abiding nature of things; of lack of realization, delusion’s perceptions; how omniscient buddhas see things; how compassion arises from love; and how beings are aided.
The present-day method of teaching is as stated in Vimalamitra’s The Framework Scripture:
To the best, present the title; to the medium, the categories;
And to the least, a word-by-word commentary.
Thus, there are three styles: for those with the highest degree of acumen, the teaching of the tantra based on the presentation of the title; for those of a medium degree of acumen, a categorization of the tantra’s general meanings; and for those of the least degree of acumen, a word-by-word commentary. The first has two facets: the title can be presented in three ways, consistent with the tantra [mahayoga], the scriptural transmission [anuyoga], or pith instructions [atiyoga]; and the teaching can be related to the path of means’ upper gateway or to the secret lower gateway.
The second [a categorization of the tantra’s general meanings] has two facets: classification of meanings and classification of words. The first has five parts: the setting, the cause for the appearance of the tantra; the framework story, the conditions; the result, complete understanding of the tantra; the connection between the different purposes of the tantra; and instructions to the retinue and entrusting the doctrine.
Third, the tantra is taught through teaching the essence, definitions, and categories [for each word].

Among extant scholastic traditions mentioned above, I will list here the main best-known ones. In the category of the later translations’ way of philosophical systems, teaching systems for many major and minor scriptures appeared in the past, including those based upon the monastic discipline text The Continual Flower Garland, The Fundamental Verses on Sublime Insight, the additional three works of Maitreya, A Message fr om a Friend, and Entering the Conduct of Enlightenment. Now, only reading transmissions for their root texts and some commentaries still remain, yet it seems that individual masters teach them based on their own powers of explanation.
In the category of secret mantra, explanatory teachings once existed for most tantras. Many teaching systems appeared, including those for Indian scriptures of the type that describe deities, illustrated by the six scriptures of profound instruction in Vajra Sow; and there were what was known as Great Seal’s eight teaching systems.
In the category of the Ancient tradition, teaching transmissions that continued to exist until later times include those based upon The Sovereign All-Creating Mind, the root of the eighteen [tantras] of the later mind section; The Discourse of All-Encompassing Awareness, the root of anuyoga’s scriptural transmission of the four discourses; and The Explanatory Tantra: The Matrix of Wisdom Mind, taught in such texts as The Armor Against Darkness by Nupchen Sangyé Yeshé; The Path’s Array by Buddhaguhya; and Clear Tantric Pledges by Lalitavajra.
Translator Gö Zhönnu Pal states that in his time, teaching transmissions existed for forty-one texts of tantra. Thus, tantric scriptural systems and teaching systems for profound instruction in secret mantra’s later and early traditions are indescribably [numerous].

Teaching Systems of Great Seal
Among them, great seal’s teaching system began with Atisha’s translation and teaching of The Highest Continuity and his teaching at Chimpu of the songs of realization and the cycle of The Net of Magical Illusion Tantra. Later, Lord Marpa Chökyi Lodrö imparted the lineage of the teaching of profound instructions for meditation, which continues without interruption to the present day. Next, Vairochana Rakshita, a great scholar from Kosala, came to Tibet and translated and taught [Saraha’s] trilogy of songs of realization. Then Kor Nirupa gave extensive teachings on the essential meaning.
Next, the Indian Pani, Master Vajrapani, taught the seven categories of accomplishment; the three essential meanings, which are the trilogy of songs of realization—the scripture of The Essence of Accomplishment with its minor parts; and twenty-seven fragments. Among these “fragments,” nine are profound instructions for meditation consistent with the way of philosophical systems, nine are profound instructions consistent with father tantras, and nine are profound instructions consistent with mother tantras. These twenty-seven fragments are bound by the four seals: the seal of activity, the seal of phenomena, great seal, and the seal of the pledges. The twenty-seven fragments have six connections: the view, related to scriptural authority and logic; meditation, related to spiritual experience; conduct, related to circumstance; the result, related to aiding others; the path, related to indications of meditative heat; and empowerments, related to tantric pledges. These teachings are known as the earlier tradition.
Next, Asu of Nepal taught the songs of spiritual realization and other texts, resulting in many tens of thousands of lineage holders. This is known as the later tradition. Then, Lord Réchungpa spread the cycle of the bodiless dakinis’ teachings and Asu’s profound instructions for meditation. Next, Nakpo Sherdé of Ngari received from the Indian master Vajrapani ten doctrines of mental non-engagement, including The Treasury of Wisdom Body, Speech, and Mind. He then translated and taught them, yet only their reading transmission now remains. All these great seal doctrines originate only from Brahmin [Saraha] and his spiritual son [Nagarjuna], and from Lord Victor Métripa.

Most of Buddhism’s sacred teachings in scripture are found in The Collection of the Buddha’s Words in Translation [Tibetan: Kangyur; bka’ ’gyur] and The Collection of Indian Treatises in Translation [Tibetan: Tengyur; bstan ’gyur]. On the subject of those who had the kindness [to preserve] the unbroken reading transmission of most of these collections, in India in later times, Lord Jnanashri and Punyashri (among the three masters at Vajra Seat), and others were famous as masters who preserved many scriptural transmissions. In Tibet, during the doctrine’s later spread, Chomden Rikpé Raldri of Nartang initially compiled the entire Collection of the Buddha’s Words in Translation and The Collection of Indian Treatises in Translation, and wrote a catalogue for them. His disciples, including Upa Losal Sangyé Büm, continued his activity with great diligence, such as writing out the volumes. Further, Butön Rinchen Drup made a very detailed classification and a catalogue [of these collections].
The reading transmission exists due to the kindness of Translator Teng Tsultrim Jungné, Translator Bari Rinchen Drakpa, Upa Losal Sangyé Büm, and others. In particular, the transmission was preserved and spread by masters famed for having many transmissions, including the great treasure trove of teachings Bak-tön Zhönnu Tsultrim, Dorjé Denpa Kunga Namgyal, illustrious Pawo Tsuklak Trengwa, and Gönpo Sönam Chökden.

Initially, (1) Tonmi Sambhota, an emanation of Bodhisattva Gentle Melody, founded the system of writing and grammar. Later, the great translators who were manifestations of enlightenment—(2) Bérotsana,
(3) Kawa Paltsek, (4) Chokro Lu’i Gyaltsen, and (5) the Zhang Nanam monk, Zhang Yeshé-dé — translated every teaching of the discourses and secret mantra, and produced definitive versions with a new vocabulary.
(6) Nupchen Sangyé Yeshé Rinpoché extensively transmitted the teaching transmission of such [tantras] as The Discourse That Gathers Wisdom’s Realization and The Net of Magical Illusion Tantra.
At the outset of the later spread of the teachings, (7) the great Translator Rinchen Zangpo and then (8) Translator Ngok Loden Sherab translated countless tantras and commentarial treatises, and established most systems of teaching transmission. All of these and the entirety of teaching transmissions from other sources were preserved by (9) Lord Sakya Pandit and (10) Butön Rinpoché.
These ten are known as the ten foremost pillars who raised the teaching transmissions. In the dark land of the northern country of Tibet, they were like the sun, able to illuminate the Buddha’s doctrine and thereby further Buddha Shakyamuni’s activity. Their kindness cannot be measured, even by the bounds of space.

From the time that separate orders diverged during the doctrine’s later spread, it could be said that each maintained transmissions of both teaching and meditation practice, yet it seems that the teaching doctrines were mainly inherited by the Sakya and Géden [i.e., Gélukpa] orders, whereas the doctrines of lineages of meditation practice were mainly inherited by the Kagyu and Nyingma orders.
The term the “four doctrines” has been well known since the time of Lord Rendawa. Since the inception of the teaching system of Gyaltsap Darma Rinchen’s ten texts, the term “ten doctrines” entered common usage. The four doctrines are the middle way, the transcendent perfections, monastic discipline, and The Treasury of Observed Phenomena. The ten doctrines are those four with various additions, such as A Commentary on Dignaga’s “Compendium of Logic.” The Sakya order offers an established list of six textual traditions in three pairs: the transcendent perfections and logic, monastic discipline and The Treasury of Observed Phenomena, and middle way and the three vows.
The title Rabjampa [person of infinite learning] has been in use since the time of the great Master Rongtön Shéja Kunzik’s disciple, Jamchen Rabjampa Sangyé Pal.

In the personal tradition of the followers of Lord Marpa’s doctrinal lineage, the doctrines of teaching flowed through three [of Marpa’s disciples]: Métön Sönam Gyaltsen, Ngoktön Chöku Dorjé, and Tsurtön Wang-gi Dorjé. Moreover, these were teaching systems only of the tantras, many of which were later preserved among the Karma Kagyu, Géluk, Jonang, and Zhalu orders. Omniscient Rangjung Gyalwa [the third Karmapa Rangjung Dorjé] appeared in this world, and mainly emphasized the teaching doctrines of The Profound Inner Meaning, The Vajra of Delight Tantra’s Two Chapters, and The Highest Continuity. He did this because the Dakpo Kagyu lineages, known as the four major and eight lesser orders, only transmitted various tantras’ empowerments and doctrinal instruction passed down from Métön Sönam Gyaltsen, Ngoktön Chöku Dorjé, and Tsurtön Wang-gi Dorjé. Apart from that, they did not stress teaching and study based in the way of philosophical systems, since they purely upheld Lord Milarepa’s practice lineage and diligently devoted themselves exclusively to meditation practice. The three texts mentioned above [The Profound Inner Meaning, The Vajra of Delight Tantra’s Two Chapters, and The Highest Continuity] are sufficient in themselves for arriving at a final conclusion in the course of study and contemplation concerning experiential cultivation of what is to be practiced in meditation; these texts are indispensable for that purpose.

The twelve chapters of The Profound Inner Meaning provide a general commentary to the entire range of highest yoga tantras, and they give extensive outlines of the outer, inner, and alternative [levels of the Wheel of Time], and in particular of our physical body’s channels, circulating energies, and vital essences. Therefore, it is improper for practitioners of the [phase of completion’s] six doctrines to not know this text. The Vajra of Delight Tantra’s Two Chapters, sovereign of all highest yoga mother tantras, constitutes the uninterrupted stream of the profound teaching that represents Lord Marpa’s display of mastery. It is vital to know this text at the outset of tantric meditations on the creation and completion phases. ConcerningThe Highest Continuity, Gampopa stated,
The source text for our profound teaching of great seal is the
great way treatise The Highest Continuity by Transcendent
Conqueror Maitreya.
Thus, Déshek Pamodrupa, Kyobpa Jikten Sumgön, and others founded orders of that tradition. Rangjung Gyalwa and the series of omniscient masters [Karmapas] displayed mastery of this text’s intent above all else. Therefore, it is important to know this text for great seal meditation.
These three scriptures are not subjects for academic study or debate; they are teachings to be conjoined with experiential cultivation. There-fore it is vital above all else that holders of the practice lineage preserve the undiminished teaching transmission of these texts.

Previously in this lineage of meditation practice, there were never a great number of monastic colleges for the study of the way of philosophical systems. The sixth lord [Karmapa] Tongwa Dönden studied many scriptural traditions with omniscient Rongtön Shéja Kunzik, who proclaimed this lion’s roar: “I have a buddha for a disciple!” The seventh lord [Karmapa Chödrak Gyatso] composed Valid Cognition, An Ocean of Texts on Logic; many of his disciples held the title Master of Infinite Scriptural Traditions.

In particular, the third master of infinite scriptural traditions at Dakpo, the first Karma Trinlé, [named] Chok Tamché-lé Gyalwé Lha, was a great holder of the collected works of both the Sakya and Kagyu. From him, the eighth lord [Karmapa], the great omniscient master Mikyö Gawa [more commonly Mikyö Dorjé], received countless scriptural traditions. With his omniscient wisdom, and without relying on others’ works, he initiated a new system. He composed such texts as a commentary to the collection on monastic discipline, The Disc of the Sun; a commentary to the collection on observed phenomena, The Sovereign of All Eloquent Speech, Milking the Splendor of Easy Accomplishment; The Lord of Rest, a commentary toThe Ornament of Manifest Realization; The Path of Pleasant Travel, the Chariot of the Dakpo Kagyu Accomplishment, a commentary toEntering the Middle Way; and a commentary to texts on logic. He thus illuminated the path of the major scriptures’ four doctrines; it was as if the doctrinal teachings were inherited exclusively by Mikyö Gyalwa. Monastic colleges such as Dakpo Lekshé Ling gradually appeared. Mikyö Gyalwa and his foremost spiritual sons—Gyalwa Könchok Yenlak, Pawo Tsuklak Trengwa, and the second Karma Trinlé—shone everywhere the sunlight of eloquent teachings. In particular, the ninth Lord [Karmapa Jangchub Dorjé] composed commentaries to The Treasury of Observed Phenomena and Entering the Middle Way; the fifth Garwang composed a commentary to The Ornament of Manifest Realization; and the sixth Garwang, Chökyi Wangchuk, wrote a commentary to the collection on monastic discipline and a condensation of the essential points of the Karmapas’ major commentaries.
In such [monastic colleges] as Zadam Nyinjé Ling, major systems of teaching and debate appeared. The lineage of those commentaries’ teaching and reading transmissions continues. Therefore, although no specific [Karma Kagyu] monastic college exists at the present time, its true scholastic tradition continues unbroken. Thus, the source of these Karma Kagyu teaching systems is mainly found in the Sakya order, and, within that tradition, in the great Rongtön Shéja Kunzik’s teaching system. Nevertheless, it should be understood that the Karma Kagyu later developed its own independent teaching systems.

[The fourth Karmapa] Lord Rolpé Dorjé gave him the name Kunga Nyingpo; he is famous as Lozang Drakpé Pal.
Light of Shakyamuni’s doctrine, he was a second Nagarjuna appearing in the Himalayas. One can know his nature by impartially examining both the account of his life and the continuity of his activity to the present day.

In Tibet there appeared numerous leading historical traditions of lineages, major and minor, of meditation practice. When we synthesize them into their chief groups, there are eight major chariots: the Ancient Tradition (Nyingma) of the early translations, the Buddha’s Word as Instruction (Kadampa), the Path with the Result (Lamdré), Marpa’s Doctrinal Lineage (Marpa Kagyu), the Shangpa Doctrinal Lineage (Shangpa Kagyu), Pacification (Zhijé) with its branch practice, Six Applications (Jorwa Druk), and Approach and Accomplishment of the Three Vajras (Dorjé Sumgyi Nyen-drup).

The Buddhist canon forms the foundation for the teachings or doctrine known as secret mantra’s Ancient Tradition, since its contents are the actual teachings that appeared during the period of the early translations. Thus, this doctrine’s principal pillars are the canon’s The Discourse That Gathers Wisdom’s Realization, The Net of Magical Illusion Tantra, and two traditions of the mind category of instructions. The profound teachings of the eight groups of meditation practices and their ancillary texts serve as ornaments, including [the deities that represents the] wisdom body, Manjushri [Slayer of the Lord of Death]; and wisdom speech, Lotus [Héruka]. Great perfection’s secret essence cycle, now known as the four-part heart essence, comprises the quintessence of the wisdom mind of two masters [Padmasambhava and Vimalamitra], and dwells as the pure essence of the tradition’s life force.

The great instigator who led the dawning sun of the Victor’s doctrine into the Himalayas’ dark continent was Bodhisattva Gentle Melody [incarnate], King Trisong Déutsen. Due to his marvelous altruistic intention and immeasurable kindness, [Guru Rinpoché,] who adorns the crown of all accomplished masters, Lord Buddha Boundless Light risen in the form of a vajra master, the second Buddha whose one body was graced with eight names, such as Padmakara, actually appeared in Tibet.
In common disciples’ perception, [Guru Rinpoché] taught at Samyé Monastery, merely imparting The Pith Instructions, a Garland of Views. For his disciples endowed with uncommon fortune (including the five referred to as “the king, [the king’s three] subjects, and [Guru Rinpoché’s] companion”), he taught mainly at the five major sacred sites for meditation practice, [each] associated with wisdom’s body, speech, mind, qualities, or activity. He bestowed inconceivable profound instructions for spiritual ripening and liberation, including unimaginable peaceful and wrathful means of practice and supplementary activity rituals related to the eight groups of meditation practice, and cycles of profound instructions for meditation on the peaceful and wrathful spiritual master, the quintessential extract of the innermost essence of all sacred teachings, clear light great perfection.

[Guru Rinpoché] saw that there were not the circumstances nor was there the need to transmit most of his profound instructions for meditation during that period and considered the infinite numbers of beings of the future. In the country’s four directions and in its central region, he sealed [his instructions] with seven levels of seals and concealed them in ten million treasure sites with names, illustrated by the five great treasures sites, and innumerable unnamed ones.
At Chimpu, Yerpa, and Chuwori, he founded three major meditation communities. Moreover, in a miraculous display, there is no area anywhere in Tibet, such as central, western and eastern Tibet, so much as the size of a horse’s hoof, which his feet did not touch. He consecrated every cliff as a meditation site. Due to the instructions he granted to fortunate disciples, countless accomplished masters appeared, such as twenty-five supreme accomplished masters at Chimpu, fifty-five realized adepts of Yang Dzong, one hundred and eight persons who attained a body of light both at Yerpa and Chuwori, thirty mantra adepts at Sheldrak, and twenty-five dakinis who departed into a body of light.

The majestic Buddhist King Trisong Déutsen dispatched Bérotsana, Tibet’s first bilingual great translator, to India. Within a nine-storied cave in a forest of cooling sandalwood at Dhanakosha, he met the great awareness holder Sri Singha (in Tibetan: Palgyi Sengé). When Bérotsana asked for an eff ortless spiritual way, [his teacher] revealed his wisdom mind’s essence: he gave such instructions as great perfection’s eighteen sections of the mind category of instruction, all empowerments and pith instructions of sixty tantras, and the white, black, and multicolored cycles of the spatial category of instructions. Fearing a [local] ruler’s punishment if he did not keep complete secrecy, Bérotsana trained in the teachings of the way of philosophical systems during the day and received [these secret teachings] at night, using skillful means and auspicious connections. During his travels he underwent extreme hardships, including confronting fifty life-threatening situations.

Moreover, Bérotsana met twenty-one scholars and, in a large charnel ground, a sacred gathering place, he encountered Garab Dorjé, from whom he received the transmission of the ultimate meaning of great perfection’s six million, four hundred thousand [tantras]. Thus, at that very time, he gained the accomplishment of simultaneous realization and liberation.
Using his power of swift walking, he returned to Tibet, where he taught the king in private and translated the mind category of instructions’ first five [of eighteen] cycles. Due to slander, [he was forced] to journey to Gyalmo Tsawa Rong [in eastern Tibet]. There, he taught Yudra Nyingpo at Gönpo Monastery in Gyalrong Drak, Sangtön Yeshé Lama at Tsarong Taktsé Kar, and Pang-gen Sangyé Gönpo in Red Cliff Gön-dzong at Tongkung Rong. In central Tibet, he taught Nyak Jnana Kumara and Liza Sherab Drönma. These five individuals to whom he taught great perfection’s teachings are known as the five links. Lineages from them, and in particular from Pang-gen Mipam Gönpo, gradually spread: these instructions of the mind and spatial categories produced [realization of] Buddha Ever Excellent’s infinitekingdom.
Among those instructions, the continuity of the mind category exists today in what are known as Nyang’s tradition and Aro’s tradition. The former consists of the transmitted teachings Bérotsana gave Nyak Jnana Kumara, which were passed in stages to masters including Nyang Yeshé Jungné and the Zur clan’s grandfather and grandson. The latter [Aro tradition] consists of the instructions transmitted by the incarnated master Aro Yeshé Jungné of Dokham, who mastered the profound teachings of the lineage of seven Indian and Chinese masters. Teacher Pang-gen Mipam Gönpo transmitted the vajra bridge of the spatial category, the sole instruction through which many generations of masters accomplished a body of light.

Master Vimalamitra, who attained a vajra [i.e., indestructible] rainbow body and crowned the heads of five hundred sublime scholars, traveled to Tibet, where he imparted instructions of great perfection’s pith instruction category to Nyang-ben Tingzin Zangpo, who became endowed with the eyes of clairvoyance. Nyang-ben Tingzin Zangpo departed into light. Yudra Nyingpo served as translator and translated the thirteen remaining sections of the mind category [that Bérotsana had not translated]. Nyangben Tingzin Zangpo bestowed the doctrinal transmission [of this set of teachings] to Bé Lodrö Wangchuk. The textual transmission encoded as a treasure was [later] revealed by Dangma Lhungyal, who also received their doctrinal transmission. He gave these pith instructions to Chétsun Sengé Wangchuk, who also attained liberation in a body of light. These instructions were passed successively to Gyalwa Zhangtön and others, and came to be known asThe Heart Essence of Vimalamitra.
Péma Lédrel retrieved Padmasambhava’s profound instructions, The Heart Essence of the Dakinis, from [concealment as a] treasure, and gave it to the incarnate master Rangjung Dorjé and to Sho’i Gyalsé Lekpa. Of the former of these masters, The Unimpeded Sound Tantra states:
A bodhisattva dwelling on awakening’s stages
Will spread [this teaching] to the ocean’s shores.
As foretold, Rangjung Dorjé performed the act of spreading this teaching throughout the world, and the profound teachings known as Karma Heart Essence arose from the expanse of his wisdom mind.
The latter master [Sho’i Gyalsé Lekpa] gave instruction to the omniscient master Drimé Özer [i.e., Longchenpa], who composed treatises that overflowed from the expanse of Buddha Ever Excellent’s wisdom mind, including the root texts and commentaries of The Innermost Essence of the Spiritual Master, The Profound Innermost Essence, The Innermost Essence of the Dakinis, The Seven Treasures, and The Trilogy on Relaxation. He produced many outstanding disciples as lineage holders. In brief, the Secret Heart Essence doctrines lead to the birth of a body of light from the material body. He who is known as Longchen Rabjam Zangpo, the second Garab Dorjé incarnate, made these teachings spread far and wide.

He received these from the Indian masters Black Héruka and Dharmarajapala, Vasubhasha of Nepal, Master Chétsen Kyé of Gilgit, and others. He transmitted the teachings to four cherished disciples, including So Yeshé Wangchuk. Particularly, his own son, Yönten Gyatso, transmitted these teachings and spread them.

Concerning most of the canonical transmission of the tantras and meditation practices (principally The Net of Magical Illusion Tantra, Yangdak Héruka, and Vajra Dagger), Ma Tok Rinchen [probably Ma Rinchen Chok] initially translated and taught The Secret Essence Tantra. Likewise, many learned, accomplished masters studied this tantra, taught, meditated, and gained accomplishment in it, and thus produced definitiveversions [of its text] and preserved the doctrine.
Moreover, as the saying relates, “The vajra way’s doctrine was first transmitted to Nyak, then to Nup, and finally to Zur.” Four doctrinal transmissions’ streams from the great masters Padmasambhava, Vimalamitra, Bérotsana, and Yudra Nyingpo collected in Nyak Jnana Kumara. [The four streams are] the stream of scriptures of explanatory texts, accompanied by major commentaries and [summaries of] the main points; the stream of profound instructions for meditation from the oral lineage, accompanied by texts on crucial points of instruction and direct guidance; the stream of empowerments’ blessings, accompanied by techniques for their conferral and pointing out instructions; and the stream of the practical instructions for accomplishing activities, accompanied by [rituals for] the doctrine’s guardians and wrathful mantras. Nyak Jnana Kumara’s principal disciples were eight whose name included Pal, among whom Sokpo Palgyi Yeshé imparted every profound instruction to Nupchen Sangyé Yeshé.

Further, Nup Namké Nyingpo traveled to India and requested from the accomplished master Hungkara the complete teaching cycle of Yangdak Héruka; he accomplished the body of nondual wisdom. The lineage through him, the So tradition of Yangdak Héruka’s profound instructions for meditation, is still extant in the present day. So Yeshé Jungné’s disciple, Nyang Sherab Chok, had a disciple Nyang Yeshé Jungné, whose disciple was Lhajé Zurpoché Shakya Jungné. Moreover, among the instructions which the great master [Padmasambhava] imparted to Khön Lu’i Wangpo Sungwa, both Yangdak Héruka and Vajra Dagger were transmitted through the glorious Sakyapas in a lineage which continues in the present day.
Moreover, many of Lhazig Lang’s family descendents, such as Khampa Gocha, Palgyi Sengé the later, Odren Palgyi Wangchuk, Kharchen Palgyi Wangchuk, Drokmi Palgyi Yeshé, Nyen Palyang, and Nanam Dorjé Dujom, were accepted as disciples by the sublime masters [mentioned above]. Most of the sublime individuals who became translators of the later translations were born within the hereditary lines of the Ancient Tradition’s series of accomplished masters and awareness holders. In addition, after those masters, there appeared Gyu Palgyi Zhönnu, Rongzom Chökyi Zangpo, and an infinite lineage of family descendents and disciples famed throughout the world as the Zur grandfather and grandsons: Lhajé Zurpoché Shakya Jungné, Zurchung Sherab Drak, and Sangdak Dropukpa. The Nyo clan’s family line included in later times the major treasure revealer Péma Lingpa and the king of the teachings Terdak Lingpa. This flawless family line continues to the present day. The Chal clan produced Chal Pakpa Pal and the sublime omniscient Menlung Lama. The Rok family line includes Rok Shakya Ö. Members of the [Chim] clan stem from Chim Shakya Prabhava; the Kyo clan, from Ö Jung; and a clan line issues from Yung-tön Dorjé Pal.

The Exalted Discourse on the Meditative State That Gathers All Merits states:
O Stainless Brilliance! For great bodhisattvas who yearn for the teachings, the teachings’ treasures have been placed in mountains, in ravines, and in forests. Long mantras and infinite gateways to the teachings made into volumes will come into their hands.
Again, The Discourse of the River’s Play states:
Conceal the scriptures of my doctrine’s teachings As mind treasures that issue from wisdom mind Or even as the essence of the earth. Why? Non-Buddhists with wild thoughts Will surely adulterate [my teachings’] meanings. Thus, their river’s flow will not be interrupted.
In these and other texts, the Buddha taught this at length.
The great master of Oddiyana foretold the coming of his physical representatives, predestined individuals. He concealed his verbal representatives, eighteen kinds of treasures, illustrated by master treasures and heart treasures. He entrusted his wisdom mind’s intention to his destined spiritual children, such as the trio [known as] the king, [the king’s] subject, and [Guru Rinpoché’s] companion; and sealed their aspirations. Thus, when the appointed time came in later generations, those disciples’ manifestations appeared as sublime beings, emanations of awareness holders. Their succession includes Nyang-ral Nyima Özer and Guru Chökyi Wangchuk, known as the two sublime treasure revealers or the earlier and later treasures; many who bore the name Lingpa, of whom eight were most important—Sangyé Lingpa, Dorjé Lingpa, Rinchen Lingpa, Péma Lingpa, Ratna Lingpa, Kunkyong Lingpa, Do-ngak Lingpa, and Tennyi Lingpa; Rikzin Gökyi Dem-truchen and others who practiced the Northern Treasures; twenty-one known as powerful masters [i.e., “nuden”], the principal of whom was Dudul Nuden Dorjé; and he whose appearance in this nadir of degenerate times was as amazing and marvelous as an udumvara [flower], the magical manifestation of glorious Prince Damzin Chökyi Lodrö, leader of an ocean of treasure revealers—Orgyen Chokgyur Déchen Lingpa.

These masters opened the doors to a supreme trove of profound teachings and of sacred substances that bring liberation by taste and other means, and they spread wondrous activity imbued with the four ways of liberation. The chief masters of their teachings, along with their lineage-holding disciples, preserve the sacred teachings during the darkest of evil times. Even in places where the doctrines of scriptures on monastic discipline no longer exist, the secret mantra vajra way does not vanish into fragments but spreads and flourishes. Its wide-reaching, continual activity liberates every being who is diffi cult to guide.
The scholar Rongzom Chökyi Zangpo taught of secret mantra’s sevenfold transmission—successive transmissions from Master Padma, Nup Namké Nyingpo, Shantingarbha (who is said to have consecrated Samyé Monastery and from whom most of the Slayer of the Lord of Death cycle derives), Bérotsana, Vimalamitra twice, and Nupchen Sangyé Yeshé.

Lord Atisha’s learned, accomplished disciples were extremely numerous in both India and Tibet, yet his first Tibetan disciple who invited him to Tibet was Translator Naktso Tsultrim Gyalwa. He relied on Atisha for nineteen years and received the majority of his instructions. In addition, he relied upon Jnana-akara and other masters; his principal transmission is known as Naktso’s doctrinal lineage. Rongpa Chaksor-wa, a disciple of Dromtön Gyalwé Jungné and other masters, received from Naktso Tsultrim Gyalwa many instructions in secret mantra. Following [Naktso’s] prophetic advice, Rongpa Chaksor-wa built a monastery at Rong Laksor. An outstanding lineage emerged from those known as Rongpa’s four spiritual children, including Ja Duldzin.
During the intermediate [period of this tradition], three [disciples] in western Tibet [referred to as] Gar, Gö, and Yol; and during its final [period], three in central Tibet named Khutön Sherab Tsöndru, Ngok Lekpé Sherab, and Dromtön Gyalwé Jungné became well known. Among them, Ngok Lekpé Sherab founded the monastic college of Sangpu Ne’utok. In such ways, Dipamkara Shrijnana’s activity in turning the wheel of the Dharma was infinite.

Among all those lineages, the principal one is that of Bodhisattva Lord All-Seeing One incarnate, Dromtön Gyalwé Jungné, whose life as a layman who would spread the teachings was foretold in The Flower Ornament Discourse and The White Lotus of Compassion Discourse. This lineage has four especially exalted deities and the teachings’ three collections; it is known as the precious Buddha’s Word as Instruction, custodian of the doctrine endowed with seven deities and teachings [four deities and the three collections]. The Victor Dromtön Gyalwé Jungné’s disciples, known as the three brothers [Potowa Rinchen Sal, Chen-nga Tsultrim Bar, and Pu-chungwa Zhönnu Gyaltsen], received the transmission of the three major doctrinal systems—of scriptures, profound instructions for meditation, and pith instructions. Among those who held these three lineages were great exalted bodhisattvas dwelling upon stages without return, who transmitted and elucidated this excellent, unmistaken path to awakening.
The transmission of scriptures in this lineage has a teaching system of six texts: The Buddha’s Past Lives and Intentional Teachings, scriptures for developing faith; The Stages of Awakening and An Ornament of the Discourses, scriptures for developing meditative states; and A Compendium of Training and Entering the Conduct of Enlightenment, scriptures on conduct. He who upheld this system, Potowa Rinchen Sal, had such disciples as Langri Tangpa and Sharawa Yönten Drak, related like the sun and moon. Among Sharawa’s disciples was Tumtön Lodrö Drak, who founded glorious Nartang Monastery. These individuals mainly preserved the teaching system.

The transmission of profound instructions for meditation constitutes a teaching system that present the four noble truths as profound instructions for meditation. Chen-nga Tsultrim Bar’s disciples, such as Ja Yulwa, produced an especially exalted lineage known as Chen-nga’s doctrinal lineage; it emphasized the transmission of meditation practice. At the present time, it is thought that its doctrines have flowed into the Dakpo Kagyu order.
The transmission of pith instructions—the sixteen drops’ empowerments, instructions, and supportive authorizations, accompanied by precious volumes of teachings—were transmitted to Pu-chungwa Zhönnu Gyaltsen. He gave them to Tap-kawa Rinchen Gyaltsen; after him, they continued as a transmission from one master to a single disciple until Zhönnu Lodrö of Nartang Monastery. The seal of secrecy was then lifted and the transmission was passed in stages to the great Scholar Nyukpa; glorious Tsuklak Trengwa received it from him, and it arrived in the Kamtsang lineage of meditation practice. Gyalwa Gendun Drup received it from the great Translator Tuk-jé Palwa, and its stream arrived in the Géden [tradition].

During that [early] period, spiritual mentors who held this tradition filled the land of Tibet, and their monasteries spread far and wide throughout eastern and central Tibet. As a result, their gradual path’s instructions, such as four thoughts which turn the mind away [from the wheel of life], appear at the beginning of all teaching systems of the later and early traditions, for example, and pervade every spiritual school in the Himalayas. Yet later, when it seemed that institutions that preserved this tradition’s own systems were becoming somewhat eclipsed, there appeared Lord Manjushri’s magical manifestation with irrefutable supreme knowledge and masterful compassion; like a Buddha appearing in this world, he was known as Tsongkapa Lozang Drakpé Pal.
Tsongkapa emphasized the Buddha’s Word as Instruction’s scriptural teaching system. He condensed its three traditions’ profound meanings into pith instructions in The Wide Gradual Path to Awakening. The tradition that holds this as the vital core of its instruction is called the new tradition of the Buddha’s Word as Instruction, known everywhere as the Gédenpa [now more commonly known as Gélukpa].
This holy individual’s great qualities are inconceivable; this is evident in the exchange of questions and replies Master Umapa and the great accomplished master of Lhodrak, Lékyi Dorjé had with [the bodhisattvas] Gentle Splendor and Lord of Secrets. Further, Machik Lapdrön clearly predicted that for as long as Shakyamuni’s doctrine endures, no one will appear comparable to the sovereign Karmapa and this holy individual. His acts, typified by four great deeds, including the establishment of the [yearly] great prayer festival during the miracle month [i.e., the first lunar month] at Lhasa, are unfathomable for ordinary beings. The streams of his activity—his disciples who held the collections of the Buddha’s doctrine, and the over one hundred and forty monasteries they established, are visible to the eye today. In brief, in this end time of the Buddha’s doctrine, the kindness he has shown toward the doctrine of scriptural transmission is unique.
Thus, it is said that the Buddha’s Word as Instruction originated at the time of Lord Atisha; the precious master Dromtön Gyalwé Jungné founded the system; it grew and flourished during the time of the three brothers; and spread widely during the lifetimes of such masters as Langri Tangpa, Sharawa Yönten Drak, and Ja Yulwa.

The lord of yogis, known [in Tibetan] as Jikdral Palden Chökyong or [in Sanskrit] as the great accomplished master Virupa, was given empowerment within a sacred circle emanated by Selfless Goddess. Virupa attained the realization of awakening’s sixth stage. Based on three tantras of Vajra of Delight, he conferred The Vajra Lines to Krishna[charin or Kanha] of the East, and thus founded the cycle of instructions the Path with the Result.
Based on Vajra of Delight’s root tantra, The Vajra of Delight Tantra’s Two Chapters, the great accomplished master Saroruha composed a [teaching] cycle of the path: the phase of creation, the nine profound means, and on the phase of completion, Like the Tip of a Lamp Flame. “Others” in the root text includes Nagarjuna, who composed a cycle of the path, Commentary on the Awakened Mind, based on the Matrix of Mystery tantra; and Dombi Héruka, who composed a cycle of the path, Realizing Coemergence, based on The Vajra of Delight Tantra’s Two Chapters. Indrabodhi composed a cycle of the path, The Complete Path of the Seals, based on The Wisdom Essence Tantra. Kuddala composed a cycle of the path, The Inconceivable, based on The Tantra of Union. Krishnacharin composed a cycle of the path, Olapati, based on the Supreme Bliss tantras. Vakishvara composed a cycle of the path, The Unwritten Great Seal, based on the Matrix of Mystery tantra. Krishna Utsita the Immortal composed a cycle of the path, Straightening the Crooked, based on every mother tantra.

These nine teaching cycles of the path were transmitted to the great master, Translator Drokmi Shakya Yeshé. Drokmi initially trained with Shantipa to become learned in all teachings on monastic discipline, the perfection of sublime insight, and secret mantra. He then received profound instructions for meditation, including [nine] cycles from Gayadhara and Viravajra. [On the subject of the Indian lineage,] Virupa composed a very concise teaching on the tantra and an extensive version of the oral lineage’s pith instructions for experiential cultivation. These he gave to Krishnacharin of the East. Krishnacharin passed the teachings to Damarupa; he to Avadhutipa; and he to Gayadhara, who journeyed three times to Tibet. During his first visit, he bestowed all the profound instructions for meditation to Drokmi Shakya Yeshé. This is known as the tradition of Vajra of Delight’s pith instructions, now well known as the Path with the Result. The eight [cycles of teaching] mentioned above [after the first, Virupa’s] are known as the later lineage of the Path with the Result.

In general, Marpa Chökyi Lodrö, Gö Kukpa Lhétsé, and Drokmi Shakya Yeshé are the three sources of secret mantra vajra way’s later spread [in Tibet]. In particular, both Marpa and Gö initially trained with Drokmi, who was remarkably exalted: for example, it is said that he attained Great Seal’s sublime accomplishment in the intermediate state after death. He received all nine cycles of teaching on the path, which are the ocean-like profound essence of meditation instructions. When he was about to return to Tibet from India, he asked for profound instructions for meditation as a spiritual connection from the scholars of the six gates [at Vikramashila Monastery]: he received instructions for integrating the discourses and tantras; techniques for dispelling three levels of obstacles—external demons, disturbances of the body’s constituent elements, and mental obstacles to meditative states; great seal that dispels three sufferings; and Clear Recollection of the Natural State.
In addition, powerful Lord Virupa gave Dombi Héruka a very extensive teaching on the tantra and taught him a very concise version of the pith instructions. Dombi Héruka taught Alalavajra; [and the lineage passes in turn to] Shavaripa, Garbharipa, Jayashri, Durjayachandra, and Viravajra. In east India, Drokmi Shakya Yeshé requested this from Viravajra, who gave him what is known as the Path with the Result without root verses. This refers to the fact that while previous versions had vajra verses, there were none in this case. This is known as the commentarial tradition to Vajra of Delight tantra.
Drokmi Shakya Yeshé, Gyijo Dawé Özer, and Drom Dépa Tönchung translated The Vajra Lines according to the Indian text. Without having an Indian text, Chagen Wangchuk Gyaltsen and Jonang Kunpang revised the translation by mixing the order [of the topics]. Zungkyi Palwa’s textbook states that Scholar Rahula made a translation; thus there were six initial translations of this text. Moreover, later on, Sachen Kunga Nyingpo received concealed teachings of the path in a direct lineage and Drakpa Gyaltsen [composed] Clarification of the Meaning Through Symbols [based on a vision]. These and the other main profound instructions comprise the sixty texts of the precious speech of the Path with the Result, with its minor pith instructions.

Drokmi Shakya Yeshé had eighteen [outstanding] disciples: seven— three men and four women—who gained accomplishment; seven, such as Khön Könchok Gyalpo and Gyijong Ukar, who held all the scriptures; and four, such as Sé Karchungwa and José Indra, who held all the pith instructions. The traditional lineage of the path with the result flowed from them as follows: [Drokmi Shakya Yeshé’s] own sons Indra and Dorjé, his heart spiritual heir Drom Dépa Tönchung, and Sé Karchungwa propagated three lineages. Subsequently, from the teacher Sé Karchungwa, the Zhangtön brothers received the full transmission; Zhama and his sister received the medium transmission; and Ségom Jangchub Yeshé received the minimal transmission.
Among these, Zhama and his sister, who received the medium transmission, disseminated a male, a female, and a combined lineage. Within the male lineage, two traditions evolved: of the disciples and of the son. The male Zhama was Lord Khön Puwa Chökyi Gyalpo. The lineage passed through disciples including Ségom Drak-gyal. The son lineage was passed from Zhama Dawé Özer to Pang-jé Nyima Drak. The female lineage of Machik Zhama Naljorma grew into three traditions, from her disciples Nyang-gom, Mön Karpa Tön-zhung, and Pönmo Sher-tsul. In the combined lineage, four traditions developed: a combination of the male and female Zhama traditions resulted in Dumbu Kodrakpa’s tradition. A combination of three lineages—the Zhama male and female, and the Sakya—resulted in Chagen Wangchuk Gyaltsen’s tradition. A combination of Drokmi Shakya Yeshé and Gyijo Dawé Özer’s lineages resulted in Jonang Kunpang’s tradition. A combination of three lineages—the path with the result, the six applications, and great perfection—resulted in Latö Wangyal’s tradition.

The Sakya and Zhama traditions spread for a long time.

The particularly exalted holder of the lineage of the full transmission received by Zhangtön Chöbar was the illustrious Sachen Kunga Nyingpo. His two former spiritual heirs, Pakmo Drupa and Chégom founded two traditions. His later spiritual heirs formed the historical and proximate lineages. Mang-lam Zhikpo’s tradition compiled treasuries of cherished teachings from four lineages: two from Drokmi Shakya Yeshé and José Indra, and two from the Zhangtön brothers. The minimal transmission was passed from [Ségom] Jangchub Yeshé to Zhing Pukpa.
Thus, it is said that there are eighteen traditions of the Path with the Result: two lineages of the body and mind heirs; among the Sé lineages, two—disciple and son—in the male Zhama lineage, three in the female [Zhama lineage], and four combined lineages; four Sakya lineages; two lineages of Mang-lam and Zhing Pukpa; and the Jonang tradition, which will be explained later. Among these, the Sakya and Zhama traditions spread for a long time; and even more, the Sakya tradition has spread and flourished widely until the present day.

In particular, on the subject of what is known as the Sakya tradition, Lord Atisha clearly saw seven Dhi letters and one Hung on the white cliffface [at Sakya], and foretold that seven emanations of Gentle Melody and one of Vajra Holder would appear. The first of these was the glorious master of great loving-kindness, Sachen Kunga Nyingpo, who received the three Vajra of Delight tantras from Drokmi Shakya Yeshé, Supreme Bliss from Translator Mal Lodrö Drakpa, yoga tantra and the protector from great Translator Rinchen Zangpo, and The Hundred Meditation Techniques from Bari Rinchen Drakpa. He thus received these and other doctrinal transmissions of profound instructions for meditation from four great translators.
Most significantly, at the age of forty-seven, Sachen Kunga Nyingpo beheld Lord Virupa in a fivefold sacred circle [comprising the masters Virupa, Krishnacharin, Gayadhara, Kotalipa, and Vinapa], bringing teachings. They stayed for one month and conferred on him four profound doctrines that were not to leave the iron fence enclosure [of the main temple at Sakya Monastery]; empowerments, teachings, and pith instructions of seventy-two tantras; and the hidden teachings of the direct lineage of the Path with the Result. As his master foretold, Sachen Kunga Nyingpo had three disciples who gained accomplishment, seven who attained the stage of forbearance, and eight who gained realization. It is said that four arrays of his wisdom body now manifestly dwell in the pure lands of Blissful, Potala, Oddiyana, and the northern Golden Land, where they work for the welfare of fortunate beings.
Kunga Nyingpo taught his sons Lord Sönam Tsémo and Drakpa Gyaltsen: the former traveled to the celestial realms without leaving his body; the latter was endowed with the life of liberation of a great vajra master of Tibet. At the age of fifty-six, Drakpa Gyaltsen beheld Sachen Kunga Nyingpo’s wisdom body; that master bestowedClarification of the Meaning Through Symbols, the very proximate lineage of the Path with the Result. From him, the lineage went successively to such masters as Jamyang Sakya Pandit and Drogön Chögyal Pakpa.

The illustrious spiritual master Sönam Gyaltsen had a disciple, Yarlung Sengé Gyaltsen; his nephew, Sönam Gyalchok, had eight spiritual heirs who preserved his wisdom speech. Among the traditions that grew from them, such as the traditions of Ngor, Dzong, Bodong, and Géden, and various lineages, the chief [are the Explication for the Assembly and the Explication for Disciples of the Path with the Result].
Buddha Vajra Bearer Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo received the Explication for Disciples teachings from the great accomplished master Buddhashri. That teaching’s stream of activity has done prodigious deeds for the benefit of the doctrine and beings; it is widespread, continual, and universally known to the present day. The lineage from the mantra holder Zungkyi Palwa is known as the Dzong tradition of the path with the result. Omniscient Kunga Namgyal appeared from this transmission; he disseminated a separate teaching transmission called Gangkar-wa, which Rikzin Tséwang Norbu and others highly praised in later times.
As for the Explication for the Assembly, Dakchen Lodrö Gyaltsen’s disciple, the great Doring Kunpong-wa, gave [the transmission of] the precious wisdom words to Tsarchen Losal Gyatso. This became the separate tradition called the Tsarchen Explication for the Assembly. [Tsarchen’s] heart spiritual heirs included Jamyang Kyentsé Wangchuk, like the sun; and the erudite Ludrup Gyatso, like the moon. In brief, these great learned, accomplished masters upheld, preserved, and transmitted the Sakya tradition. Thus, the activity of Vajra of Delight’s creation and completion phases swelled during these final times like the waters of a lake in the summer.

It is taught that during great Scholar Gayadhara’s second visit to Tibet, he transmitted the profound instruction of the [precious] wisdom speech to Translator Gö Kukpa Lhétsé; on his third visit, he transmitted it to Gyijo Dawé Özer and to Translator Nyö Jungpo. Gyijo Dawé Özer passed it to his disciples including Zhu Korlo and Zhu Darma Gyaltsen.

Télopa [i.e., Tilopa], lord of accomplished meditators, chained his foot to the west [Indian] Somapuri Temple and practiced meditation for twelve years. After that, he followed the prophetic advice of his spiritual master and wisdom deity and became a prostitute’s servant. Having trained in the path’s realization, he reached a stage of sublime accomplishment. By merely singing vajra songs of realization, he liberated the residents of one million, two hundred thousand cities. It is said that his eight disciples who attained accomplishment worked for beings’ welfare as he had. Télopa received two doctrinal transmissions—one historical and one proximate. Of the first, he stated:
Nagarjuna, [Krishna]charya, Lavapa,
And Subhagini
Are the spiritual masters of my four doctrinal transmissions.
Télopa received the doctrinal transmission of fierce inner heat from [Krishna]charya, illusory body and clear light from Nagarjuna, lucid dreaming from Lavapa, and intermediate state and transference of consciousness from Sukasiddhi. Moreover, from the middle Indrabhuti he received instruction in [union with] the other’s body, sublime insight; and from Matangipa, instructions for entering a corpse. Although many opinions exist concerning to Télopa’s historical lineage, glorious Rangjung Dorjé states:
The true, perfect great Buddha Vajra Bearer taught Lord of Secretsand other bodhisattvas, who passed these teachings to the four doctrinal transmissions’ spiritual masters: Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Chandrakirti, and Matangipa—the southern lineage. Dombi Héruka, Vinapa, Lavapa, and Indrabhuti form the western lineage. Luyipa, Dengipa, Darikapa, and Sukadhari form the northern lineage. Suka Mahasiddhi, Tanglopa, Shinglopa, and Karnaripa form the eastern lineage.
These four directions are given in terms of the regions of India where most of [those masters] originated. Concerning the proximate lineage, [Tilopa] states:
I, Télo, do not have human masters; My master is omniscience.
As stated, he received instruction on secret mantra’s four levels of tantra directly from Buddha Vajra Bearer, and Vajra Yogini entrusted him with the treasury of the oral lineage’s threefold cycle of jewels. He thus gathered the essence of all profound instructions for meditation.

In this lord’s presence, great Scholar Naropa underwent twelve major hardships and then gained full comprehension of all subjects of secret mantra based on symbols and words, and achieved accomplishment. Marpa Chökyi Lodrö of Lhodrak, Dombi Héruka’s magical manifestation, traveled three times to the land of exalted beings. During earlier and later journeys, he relied on Naropa for a total of sixteen years and seven months. He received the empowerments, teachings, and profound instructions of many tantras, principally Vajra of Delight and Matrix of Mystery, as his vajra songs state:
India’s great Scholar Naro And Tibet’s Marpa the Translator Met due to their same previous training and aspiration. I relied upon [Naropa] for sixteen years and seven months...
and,
I met many accomplished spiritual masters, Narotapa chief among them. In general, I received the four classes of tantra’s pith instructions.
When Marpa journeyed [to India] for the last time, Naropa had already departed for the celestial realms, yet due to [Marpa’s] supplications, Naropa manifestly appeared in the north [Indian] Pushpahari Monastery, dwelled there for six months, and imparted to Marpa the entire oral lineage of Supreme Bliss and his consort. Marpa also relied upon many learned, accomplished masters, including Victor Métripa, who had been accepted as a disciple by glorious Shavaripa; Jnanagarbha, a scholar from Dulakshétra in the west; the accomplished master Shantibhadra who lived on an island in a poisonous lake in the south; and Dakini Adorned with Bone Ornaments. From them he received an infinite number of discourses and tantras. In particular, Naropa and Métripa empowered this lord translator as their regent to guide the Himalayan region; he has two major doctrinal traditions: a lineage of teaching and a lineage of meditation practice.

The lord from Lhodrak’s inconceivable array of mystery guided infinite numbers of disciples in the Himalayan region. Among them, many upheld the profound instructions for meditation, including his four heart spiritual heirs, ten leading spiritual mentors, and chiefly, those known as the four pillars who received the doctrinal transmission of teaching and meditation practice. Among the four, Ngoktön Chöku Dorjé of Zhung, Tsurtön Wang-ngé Dorjé of Dolpo, and Métön Tsönpo of Tsang-rong mainly received the doctrinal transmission of teaching, whereas Mila Zhépa Dorjé [i.e., Milarépa] mainly received the doctrinal transmission of meditation practice.
Ngoktön Chöku Dorjé departed to celestial realms without leaving his body. Seven lineage bearers followed Ngoktön, each imbued with wisdom, compassion, capability, and the power to wield the vajra and bell [as vajra master]. Most famous masters in the Himalayan region gathered as their disciples; thus, their activity was very widespread. Nevertheless, the special ornament of Tibetans’ ears, Lord Milarépa, was inseparable with the sovereign accomplished masters of India. In his lifetime, he manifestly attained the culminant state of union, then guided immeasurable numbers of human and nonhuman beings. Among his disciples who gained notoriety were three sublime guides of beings; three men and four women who departed to the celestial realms; and eight supreme cotton-clad adepts. Foremost among them were two especially exalted holders of the oral lineage who were like the sun and moon [Gampopa and Réchungpa].

Réchung Dorjé Drakpa, Milarepa’s moon-like heart spiritual heir, was accepted as a disciple by Machik Drupé Gyalmo and Tépupa Vimalamitra, and given their wisdom minds’ treasure troves of the essence of profound instructions for meditation. This sublime spiritual heir brought to this world the later Teaching Cycle of the Disembodied Dakini. He traveled to the celestial realms without leaving his body and later accepted many fortunate beings as his disciples, including Palden Drukpa. Among his disciples were twelve heart spiritual heirs to whom he directly conferred the instructions; foremost among them was Gyalwa Kyung-tsangpa, to whom he entrusted the oral lineage’s treasury. That master taught Machik Angjo; the teachings passed in a lineage from her until the lord of beings Tsangpa Gyaré, who spread this tradition widely. He gave profound teachings (including one called Lord of the World, Ocean of Victors) to Lama Zangri Répa, who passed the teachings to Drogön Réchen, through whom this doctrinal transmission entered the Kamtsang Kagyu: the sovereign accomplished master Karma Pakshi [the second Karmapa] attained accomplishment mainly through these very teachings.
The Manifold Instruction on the Buddha of Infinite Life That Accomplishes Beings’ Welfare, one of [Réchungpa’s] eighteen manifold profound instructions, has been accepted by all orders, chiefly the Sakya, Karma Kagyu, and Gédenpa. Likewise, this supreme being’s other profound meditation instructions have nurtured all schools in the Himalayan region.

Victor Shakyamuni clearly foretold the life of [Gampopa] Milarepa’s sun-like heart spiritual heir as a monk physician in such scriptures as The Sovereign Meditative State Discourse and The White Lotus of Compassion Discourse; he was also known as incomparable Dakpo Lhajé. To his ordinary disciples, he taught the stages of the path from the tradition of Buddha’s Word as Instruction and the meditative states of the discourse system adorned with the name of great seal. To his uncommon disciples, he taught the extraordinary great seal of secret mantra related to his spiritual master Milarepa’s path of skillful means. His turning of the wheel of the teachings with impressive miracles led infinite numbers of disciples, including five hundred destined persons who were like arhats, to spiritual maturity and liberation. In brief, this great being had qualities similar to the Buddha appearing in the world. Even in the present day, the sight, hearing, thought, or touch of him can bring one’s stream of being to spiritual maturity and liberation: his life is inconceivable.
His chief disciples were the following [four masters]: Barompa Darma Wangchuk, who founded the Barom Kagyu; Pakdru Dorjé Gyalpo, who founded the Pakdru Kagyu; Khampa Usé, otherwise known as Lord Dusum Kyenpa, founder of the Karma Kamtsang; and Zhang Tsalpa Tsöndru Drakpa (disciple of Öngom Tsultrim Nyingpo), founder of the Tsalpa Kagyu. These are known as the four major Kagyu orders.
The main monastic seat at Gampo hosted an uninterrupted succession of masters, including Dakpo Lhajé, his uncle [Dakpo Gomchung], and nephew [Öngom Tsultrim Nyingpo]; Dakpo Duldzin; and, later, the great learned, accomplished master Tashi Namgyal. Thus, with this Dakpo Kagyu order, there are five Kagyu [founding] traditions.

Glorious Pakmo Drupa was either Buddha Destroyer of Cyclic Existence or Buddha King of the Shakyas, showing themselves in the form of a spiritual mentor. Therefore, his life and activity are immeasurable. Moreover, the foremost among his five hundred famous disciples adorned with parasols founded what are known as the eight lesser Kagyu traditions. Kyobpa Jikten Sumgön founded the Drigung Kagyu; Tangpa Tashi Palwa founded the Taklung Kagyu; Drogön Gyaltsa Kuön founded the Dropu Kagyu; Ling Répa Péma Dorjé founded the Ling-ré Kagyu; lord of the teachings, Marpa Drup-tob founded the Martsang Kagyu; Yelpa Yeshé Tsekpa founded the Yelpa Kagyu; Zarawa Yeshé Sengé founded the Yazang Kagyu; and the great Nyipu Gyergom founded the Shukseb Kagyu. These are the renowned four root [listed above] and eight branch Kagyu orders. Each order had teaching transmissions, monastic seats, and enlightened activity—large hives bursting with infinite numbers of learned, accomplished masters.
In particular, a heart spiritual heir of Ling Répa, the lord protector of beings Tsangpa Gyaré had disciples who filled the land as far as a vulture can fly in eighteen days. Chief among them was Gö-tsangpa Gönpo Dorjé, who founded the upper Drukpa Kagyu order, known as the celestial star. Gyalwa Yang-gönpa appeared in his lineage of disciples; in turn, his lineage of disciples included Latö Sherab Gönpo and Barawa Gyaltsen Zangpo. Lo Répa Darma Wangchuk founded the lower Drukpa Kagyu order, [known as] the pride of the earth. Sengé Gu-tsar, head of the monastic seat, founded the middle Drukpa Kagyu order. Such orders [proliferated] in inexpressible numbers. Moreover, glorious Pakmo Drupa’s disciples—Sherab Tartuk Parpuwa, Mé-nyak Gomring, the accomplished master Nyakré Séo, Jor Chökuwa, and others in infinite numbers—sustained their school’s enlightened activity.

The future sixth buddha, Lion’s Roar, in the guise of a bodhisattva, appears as the Karmapas: illustrious Dusum Kyenpa, great adept Karma Pakshi, omniscient Rangjung Dorjé, and the rest, renowned in the world as lions among men. The garland of their lives, like those of second buddhas, now numbers fourteen; in each life, their activity has gathered incalculable numbers of disciples. The Karmapa’s chief disciples are the series of lifetimes of the realized master Drakpa Sengé, Buddha Boundless Light incarnate, sovereign lords of the dance—the ten holders of the red crown [Zhamar]; Goshri Paljor Döndrup’s series of lifetimes, Lord of Secrets— the five Gyaltsab incarnations; great Drogön Réchen’s magical manifestation, [Shakyamuni’s] regent, lord protector Loving-Kindness incarnate, the series of thirteen Situ incarnations; treasure revealer Rinchen Lingpa’s emanated incarnations, the series of nine Pawo incarnations; and Tréchen Chökyi Gyatso’s emanations, the series of Trého incarnations. These masters [Karmapa and his disciples] upheld, preserved, and transmitted the main Kamtsang Kagyu order.

The great accomplished master Télopa placed a vajra seal on his lineage as one-master-to-one-disciple for thirteen generations. He foretold that once the thirteen were complete, he himself would enjoy [those transmissions] like a wealth god. As predicted, the fifth Karmapa Dézhin Shekpa’s heart spiritual heir, Masé Tok-den Lodrö Rinchen, received the doctrinal transmission of the dakinis’ oral lineage of Supreme Bliss. Among his disciples appeared eight realized masters, three joyful adepts, and others. Their series of reincarnations have upheld over time this lineage of teachings and its monastic seat, the Zurmang Kagyu.
A disciple of the tenth lord [Karmapa] Chöying Dorjé and the sixth Garwang, Chökyi Wangchuk, was Great Compassion’s magical manifestation who attained accomplishment: Venerable Karma Chakmé. The tradition that upholds his doctrinal system is the Nédo Kagyu. Thus these three [Kamtsang, Zurmang, and Nédo] Kagyu orders appeared.
Regarding the latter tradition, due to Venerable Nédo Karma Chakmé’s special aspirations and auspicious connections, holders of his lineage of teachings filled most of the lower [eastern Tibetan] regions of Amdo and Kham. These include his main lineage of teachings, Nédo [Kagyu], which emphasizes the Karma Kagyu tradition; and his disciples who emphasize the Nyingma tradition—awareness holder Kunzang Sherab of Palyul Monastery; and Vimalamitra’s magical manifestation, Péma Rikzin of Dzokchen Monastery.

In the past, groups of Kagyu masters filled the breadth of the Land of Jambu and lesser continents, yet later only a semblance of Buddha’s doctrine in general remained, and the doctrine of the precious lineage of meditation practice in particular was setting over the western mountains. At that time, Marpa the Translator, [the wisdom deity] Vajra of Delight incarnate, intentionally arose as a manifestation of wisdom, Karma Tenpé Nyinjé Tsuklak Chökyi Nangwa (commonly known as Tai Situ, omniscient Chökyi Jungné). The great light of his wisdom, love, and power shone forth, nurturing the vitality of the doctrine of meditation practice.

Kyungpo Naljor, endowed with the five culminant practices, received the entire treasure trove of teachings, the essence of wisdom mind, from one hundred and fifty learned, accomplished masters, including thirteen especially exalted masters, four root spiritual masters, and two wisdom dakinis, Niguma and Sukasiddhi, who received teachings directly from Buddha Vajra Bearer.
[In his early life,] the learned, accomplished Kyungpo Naljor gradually received an education and gained accomplishment in the Bön and Nyingma traditions, yet the time came [to realize] aspirations he made [during past lives] when engaging in bodhisattvas’ deeds. Thus, he journeyed to India in search of the discourses’ and tantras’ profound teachings. He accomplished the ability to manifestly display at his fivephysical centers the wisdom bodies of the five tantras’ deities: Vajra of Delight, the culmination of fierce inner heat; Supreme Bliss, the culmination of the action seal; Matrix of Mystery, culmination of clear light and illusory body; Mahamaya, culmination of lucid dreaming; and Fearsome Vajra, culmination of enlightened activities. Kyungpo Naljor dwelled on a level of accomplishment not different from that of masters who achieved a wisdom body, such as venerable Archer [i.e., Sahara]. He established his monastic seat at Zhang Zhong, in Tsang Yéru Shang; thus he became known as Lama Shang and the holders of his lineage, the Shangpa Doctrinal Lineage. He lived for one hundred and fifty years, and employed inconceivable great miracles to turn an infinite wheel of teachings.
His system of the spiritual path can be summarized into a threefold gradual path, of teaching, debate, and meditation practice. His teachings’ gradual path covered the discourses, their treatises of commentary, tantras, and tantric commentaries. He taught correctly the way of philosophical systems’ four major schools, and the vajra way’s four major classes of tantra. In the gradual path of debate, he learned the seven works on logic of latter-day logicians’ systems, yet he mainly followed earlier systems of logic to define the three characteristics with the four major proofs. Valid cognition is classified as direct perception, inference, and belief, after which the subject is definitely ascertained with refutation of objections.

Regarding the gradual path of meditation practice, he taught every form of experiential cultivation of the cause-based way of the perfections and the result-based vajra way encapsulated as pith instructions of how to cultivate experience through the general and special crucial points of the thirty-seven aspects of awakening. Thus, this one teacher who appeared in the Himalayas provided infinite approaches to the teachings and incomparable enlightened activity: he was an inconceivable master.
Among all those teachings, only the essence of his gradual path of meditation practice has lasted to the present day. This is known as five cycles of teachings, the root of which are the golden doctrines of Niguma and Sukasiddhi. The five cycles are those Kyungpo Naljor received from Niguma, Sukasiddhi, Dorje Denpa, Métripa, and Rahula, accompanied by various pith instructions.

The highly accomplished master Kyungpo Naljor brought to spiritual maturity and liberation disciples equal to this great earth’s particles. These included one hundred and eighty thousand spiritual mentors, chief among them his five earlier spiritual heirs and one later one. Of his five elder heirs, Méu Tönpa represented the trunk of the tree of flawless sublime insight; Yorpo Gyamoché, its branches of altruistic motivation; Ngultön Rinwang, the leaves of compassion; Latö Könchok Kar, the flower of loving-kindness; Zhang-gom Chöseng, the sap of clear light; and Kyungpo’s younger heir, Mok-chokpa Rinchen Tsöndru, the ripened fruit of illusory body and lucid dreaming.
Kyungpo Naljor transmitted the doctrine of the single-disciple lineage of Buddha Vajra Bearer’s secret words only to Mok-chok Rinchen Tsöndru. They were then passed successively to Öntön Kyer-gangpa, Sangyé Nyentön, and Drogön Chöjé Tönpa. As predicted by Vajra Bearer and the wisdom dakini [Niguma], the vajra seal of a lineage passed from one master to a single disciple lasted until the seventh jewel, Drogön Chöjé Tönpa, who lifted [the seal]; his accomplished disciples filled the Land of Jambu up to minor adjacent continents. His chief disciples, three learned, accomplished masters—Tsangma Shangtön, Samdingpa Zhönnu Drup, and Jak-chen Gyaltsen Büm—upheld the independent Shangpa lineage and wrote down its profound instructions.
Shangtön’s disciple Kyungpo Tsulgön and others formed a marvelous lineage known as the later seven jewels. Countless lineages of disciples appeared at the monastic seats of Jak-chen Gyaltsen Büm and Samding Zhönnu Drup. Moreover, infinite lineages developed from Drogön Chöjé Tönpa’s direct disciple, Serlingpa Tashi Pal; and from Latö Nénying’s [temple] family line, endowed with ten great qualities, in which it was predicted that eighty-eight magical manifestations of Bodhisattva All-Seeing One would appear and work for the good of the doctrine and beings. The first generation of that line, Latö Könchok Kar, had a monastic seat which produced lineages from its leaders and disciples.

Omniscient Dolpo Sangyé’s later rebirth, the accomplished master Tsöndru Zangpo, or one person with five names, including Tangtong Gyalpo, received from Jang-sem Jinpa Zangpo the oral transmissions known as the Rigong Tö lineage that had passed from Muchen Gyaltsen Palzang, disciple of the historical lineage bearer, the learned, accomplished master Tsangma Shangtön. Tangtong Gyalpo cultivated his experience and thus the wisdom dakini accepted him as her disciple—he received a recent lineage from her on three occasions. First, at Riwoché in Tsang, Niguma manifestly appeared to him and gave him her six doctrines, great seal, integration on the spiritual path, instructions for deathlessness, and the spiritual master and the protector inseparable. Second, at the foot of a juniper tree at Dokmé Sin-dzong, Niguma gave him those practices’ empowerments. Third, Niguma’s instructions for the celestial dakinis arose as symbols without words. These three, an early, later, and middle transmission, were passed from Mang Karwa Lodrö Gyaltsen and others to separate lines whose doctrinal lineages continue without interruption to the present day.

Over one hundred times, Jamgön Drupé Pawo Palden Kunga Drolchok received instruction in [a total of] twenty-five systems [of the Shangpa Doctrinal] Lineage: twice, Vajra Queen Nigupta revealed herself to him in visions and bestowed special profound instructions for meditation; this was the recent lineage. In all, there were twenty-four historical lineages, such as those from Jak-chen Gyaltsen Büm, Samding Zhönnu Drup, and Tangtong Gyalpo. Kunga Drolchok bestowed this instruction system over one hundred times, leading many fortunate disciples to states of accomplishment. Thus, Shangpa doctrinal transmissions included both historical and recent lineages, along with the marvelous more recent lineage that resulted from the wisdom dakini’s acceptance of venerable Kunga Drolchok. Together, this constituted the entirety of the root Shangpa oral lineage’s golden doctrines, adorned with the recent lineage’s sharp, fresh profound meditation instructions carrying the dakini’s warm breath—the exceptional doctrinal system of Lord of Secrets Drolwé Gönpo [i.e., Taranata], including [his work on Niguma’s six doctrines,] The Profound Meaning That Covers the Plains. In the present day, his mode of instruction is especially exalted in many respects compared to any other.

If we take for example only the teaching cycle of Swift Acting Wisdom Protector, in past times the upper tradition was commonly prevalent. Later, the lower tradition, the Rigong lineage, became widespread, passing from the holders of its monastic seat to fill the Pakdru Kagyu, Kamtsang Kagyu, and the four assemblies. [This teaching cycle] spread from Sam-ding Zhönnu Drup to each of the lineage holders of the southern Severance tradition. From Jak-chen Gyaltsen Büm, three lineages—upper, lower, and middle—emerged; in particular, Lord Tsongkapa received this teaching from Jak-chen Jampa Pal, and the lord of reasoning Gélek Palwa received it from Muchen Namka Naljor: this teaching cycle thus filled central, western, and eastern Tibet, China, and Mongolia.
Among the “others” referred to in the root text are practices from later lineage holders, such as Kyer-gangpa’s meditation on Great Compassionate One and the secret practice of Horse Neck; and Sangyé Nyentön’s physical exercises of deathlessness, which are accepted by most schools. The Shangpa Doctrinal Lineage’s enlightened activity is boundless.

Venerable Kamalashila relied upon fifty-four male and female accomplished masters, and attained the eight common powers, such as extracting the essence [of matter]; he thus lived for five hundred and seventy years. He saw as many buddhas as stars in the heavens, including the twelve joyful buddhas who were his meditation deities, and he saw thirty-six masters of marvelous celestial realms. Having received their blessings and the essence of their profound instructions for meditation, he attained sublime accomplishment.
Well known in India and Tibet by the name of Padampa Sangyé, he traveled five times to Tibet. On his first visit, he arrived at Tsari from Dring Tangla, and his footsteps covered all parts of Amdo and Kham [eastern Tibet], where he predicted the doctrine would flourish. On his second visit, he arrived at Ngari through Kashmir. He accepted as disciples Zhang Zhung Lingkawa and Bönpo Dro-tsang Druklha. On his third visit, he arrived in western Tibet from Nepal and bestowed profound instructions for meditation to Yarlung Mara Serpo and Kyotön Sönam Lama. On his fourth visit, he arrived in Nyal from Sha-uk Takgo. He purified his consort’s obstacles and proceeded to central Tibet, where he aided Ma Chökyi Sherab, So-chung Gendün Bar, and Kam Yeshé Gyaltsen. On his fifth visit, he traveled to China, where he lived for twelve years, then returned to Dingri [in Tibet].

During these visits, Padampa Sangyé saw each individual’s exact character and capabilities, and to each he gave corresponding profound meditation instructions that led to liberation. Although his teaching did not belong to one specific scripture or system, it was based mainly on The Great River Tantra of Ali Kali and The Tantra of the Great Seal’s Symbol. His teaching brought liberation through the skillful techniques themselves; it was endowed with the three levels of vows; the path was followed with hardships; and the result was three forms of conduct for others’ benefit. Thus he drew destined beings, as many as the number of stars in the heavens, to the state of enlightenment.
His teaching became known under a separate general name, Sacred Teachings to Pacify Suffering. In other systems, [suffering’s] causes, the afflictive emotions, are initially purified, which naturally prevents suffering. In this case, the result, suffering, is directly purified, which naturally uproots the afflictive emotions; this is a very profound technique. It is thought that this system’s name is given based on the following passage [from The Discourse of the Heart of the Perfection of Sublime Insight]:
The mantra that entirely pacifies all sufferings...

The principal middle transmissions are known as the transmissions to Ma Chökyi Sherab, So-chung Gendün Bar, and Kam Yeshé Gyaltsen. To Ma Chökyi Sherab, Padampa Sangyé gave the verbal lineage of awakening mind in disparate universally recognized directives, and the lineage of the meaning in sixteen practical guidelines.
To So-chung Gendun Bar, he gave both the verbal and meaning lineages—meditation instructions from fifty-four male and female accomplished masters, and other approaches to the teachings. The verbal transmission is twofold, a full lineage of the fifty-four masters and a lesser lineage of thirty-two sections. The lineage of the meaning is twofold, partial and impartial. The former comprises a lineage of meaning from each of the fifty-four accomplished masters, thirty-two lamas, and seventeen holy teachers. The impartial meaning lineage comprises The Two Cycles of Teachings of the Dakini Who Opens Eyes. The first cycle is known as the four children and four mothers; the second is known as Master So-chung Gendun Bar’s cycle of the four great heads. The teaching that is like the essential root of these is the meaning lineage of the Lion of Speech, which uses terminology consistent with the tantras; and a meaning lineage that is lesser known, a fourth lineage with terminology inconsistent with Buddhist usage. In brief, these are So-chung Gendün Bar’s four oral lineages of direct access to awareness.

Padampa Sangyé gave Kam Yeshé Gyaltsen profound instruction on the perfection of sublime insight; two lineages ensued, an upper and a lower. The former has the scripture’s first chapter, the four truths as meditation instructions, and miscellaneous practical instructions. The latter has two introductions [to awareness] based on the essential meaning or manifest realization, addressed separately to those who progress gradually or to those of sudden realization. Following this, the entire range of discourses is taught in terms of four movements of interdependent arising. This is known as the lower lineage of profound instructions given directly in meditation.
Three lesser lineage traditions arose in this middle period. [First,] Padampa Sangyé gave Geshé Drakpa The Cycle of Nine Lamps of the Pacification of Suffering. [Second,] he gave Ché Chandrakirti profound instructions that join the discourses and tantras, interrelatingThe Concise Discourse on the Perfection of Sublime Insight with The Full Litany of the Names of Manjushri; and fifty-eight accomplished masters’ pith instructions. [Third,] he gave Jang Kadampa wordless profound instruction in the perfection of sublime insight. All these lineages were transmitted to Rok Sherab Ö.
The diverse lineages were those that Padampa Sangyé gave Drogom— The Golden Needle of the Litany of Manjushri’s Names; those he gave Bugom, profound instruction on action seal; and those he gave Machik Lapdrön—profound instruction on Severance. It is said that Padampa Sangyé gave as many as fifteen diverse minor profound instructions for meditation. These diverse minor lineages are included within the middle transmission’s cycle of teachings.

The final transmission originated when Padampa Sangyé returned to Tibet from China and lived at Dingri. His disciples included twenty-six destroyers of delusion, such as Chokro Nyönpa, who first saw Padampa Sangyé; twenty-four female practitioners, including Jomo Sangyé; and twelve adepts who occupied seats [of honor]. Among them all, the foremost were known as the four authorized adepts. In the east, Dampa Jarchen compiled and composed the cycle that integrates discourses and meditation [instructions]; in the south, Vajra Kroda compiled and composed the cycle that collects the precious meanings; in the west, Jarchung compiled and composed the cycle of brief guidelines; in the north, Jangchub Sempa Kunga collected and composed the cycle on bka’ cho lu [?]. Every single oral instruction Padampa Sangyé gave other disciples was written down; thus, the streams of his systems of profound instructions for spiritual ripening and liberation were as numerous as stars in the sky.

The most exalted among all those lineages, due to its having every aspect of the path of spiritual ripening and liberation, is the system of the tradition of Jangchub Sempa Kunga, of whom Padampa Sangyé stated, “Only Kunga is my equal.” During five lifetimes, Padampa Sangyé accepted Jangchub Sempa Kunga as his disciple who equaled him in realization. His cycle of teaching has two sections, common and extraordinary.
The common section contains discourses and tantras, with their practical applications; the doctrinal transmission, with an oral lineage; the “immaculate,” with the jewel drops [of instructions]; and the “strainer,” along with one hundred thousand teachings. The first set includes a general discourse, The Discourse of the River’s Play; a specific discourse, The Discourse of the Heart of the Perfection of Sublime Insight; a general tantra, Elucidating the Teachings’ Collections; and a specific tantra, The Great River Tantra of Ali Kali. The practical applications are the large and middle sacred circles for empowerment, and the threefold gradual path, major and minor. The doctrinal transmission and its oral lineage comprise four doctrinal transmissions and four oral lineages for having them arise as the path. Concerning the “immaculate” and the jewel drops, the “immaculate” has six cycles, including the root upon which the teachings are established. The jewel drops consist of profound instructions by Jangchub Sempa Kunga in answer to Patsab Gompa’s questions concerning hindrances caused by unhappiness. Concerning the “strainer” and one hundred thousand teachings, the “strainer” consists of eight teachings, such as The Strainer Cycle of the Nectar of Oral Instructions, which are talks by Patsab Gompa transcribed by Gyalwa Tené. The hundred thousand teachings contain teachings by such masters as Gyalwa Tené, Zhikpo, and Nyé-dowa.

The extraordinary section of teachings consists of the tantra with its main points; the empowerment, accompanied by the spiritual path and guidelines; and three secret troves, five cycles on the path, and eight volumes [of collected pith instructions].
Padampa Sangyé and Jangchub Sempa Kunga gave all these profound instructions to learned, venerable Patsab Gompa, who passed them to Gyalwa Tené, from whom the great joyful buddha Rok Sherab Ö received Pacification of Suffering’s entire doctrinal transmission. The teachings passed in succession through omniscient Master Rok Sherab Ö and others, and flourished greatly. In later times, as this lineage’s thread became increasingly thin, the patterns [of a former life as] the omniscient master Rok Sherab Ö awakened in the great translator of Mindrol Ling Monastery, Dharmashri. With great diligence, he received the streams of this lineage’s [empowerments for] spiritual ripening and [its instructions for] liberation, and composed texts and rituals for its empowerments and practical guidelines. Due to his kindness in teaching and spreading this lineage, even today, a bridge rope to this tradition continues unbroken.

The sacred teaching of severing demons is a branch that belongs to Pacification of Suffering. It consists of the wisdom of such masters as Brahmin Aryadeva and Lord Métripa; its essence is the perfection of sublime insight; and it follows the tantras’ teachings. In this practice, the four demons that bind us to the wheel of life are severed only upon the mind’s egoistic thoughts and self-clinging. Just as you must identify the ground as the place to cut trees, the place where the demons of egoistic thoughts are severed is the perfection of sublime insight. The profound instructions for meditation related to that domain are called Severance.

After Padampa Sangyé arrived in Tibet, four black birds, miraculous manifestations of dakinis, flew toward him. When he saw them, they became four dakinis: Yé Lapdrön, Majo Jangchub of Nyaltö, Zhangmo Gyalting from Tsang, and Lhasa Nyönma.
When Machik Lapdrön read the discourses of the perfection of sublime insight, the view of emptiness arose within her. Padampa Sangyé gave her a single piece of personal heart advice, which liberated her stream of being and she became a natural yogini. Machik Lapdrön opened wide a system born from her wisdom mind’s meditative experience. This is known as the place of Severance, the teachings she realized—the intended meaning of the perfection of sublime insight. She composed texts of inconceivable, profound instructions for meditation, among which there are The Great Collection of Teachings; The Essential Collection in Twenty-five Chapters; and eight chapters of common, extraordinary, and special teachings— twenty-four in all. Their stream of transmission continues to the present day and constitutes the female system of Severance.
This tradition is divided into four doctrinal transmissions: the father doctrinal transmission, skillful means; the mother doctrinal transmission, sublime insight; the nondual doctrinal transmission, the meaning; and the doctrinal transmissions of the dakinis’ meditative experience. Alternatively, [it can be considered to comprise lineages from Machik Lapdrön’s] sixteen spiritual children: her four heart-sons—her son Gyalwa Döndrup; Ngak-gi Wangchuk, leader of a thousand lineage holders; her heart-son Droldé Gyalwa Jungné; and Kugom Chökyi Sengé; her four daughters—Droktsa Gyen, Palden Gyen, Sönam Gyen, and Rinchen Gyen; and eight disciples who equaled her—Kyémé Gayen, Po-nyön Sengé, Nyönpa Rangnang, Dolpa Zangtal, Zhikpo Hurtön, Kalden Sengé, Gyagom Hartön, and Jétsun Zilnön. These were the foremost among her many groups of disciples, including one hundred and eight female and male accomplished masters, who filled the land of Tibet. Among them, the holder of the lineage of the discourses, her son Lang-lungpa Gyalwa Döndrup’s eldest son Tséwang, had three sons. The middle one, known as Tönyön Samdrup, was an unequaled accomplished master and holder of the secret mantra lineage. He had twenty-one male and female disciples, and eighteen spiritual daughters who were accomplished masters. From this point, a special Severance lineage appeared, known as Gangpa.

The lineage of union was constituted solely of accomplished masters, from its holder Kugom Chökyi Sengé until Drogön Sangyé Tönpa and Samding Zhönnu Drup; after them, the lineage was transmitted widely. Lord Rangjung Dorjé received this lineage from Namtso-wa Mikyö Dorjé; he composed texts, which became the Rupa Severance lineage. Later, the Zurmang lineage emerged, from which emerged a secondary stream of Severance, Kyab-ché, founded by Nédo and Kyasé Tokden. This illustrates how each lineage has increased boundlessly.

Further, the historical lineage passed from Machik Lapdrön’s daughter Lacham to others in stages. Samten Özer of Gyal-tang received the historical lineages of peaceful Severance, wrathful Severance, and the integrated system of peaceful and wrathful Severance, then traveled to a hundred wild, secluded places. At Ocho-lhatsé in upper Tsang, he met Machik in person; through her blessings, he composed The Profound Meaning, the Essence of Wisdom Mind. This is known as Gyaltang’s direct lineage. He did not spread it to disciples but concealed various profound teachings as treasures. Later, the incarnation of Kugom Chökyi Sengé, Kunpang Tsöndru; and Machik Lapdrön’s magical manifestation Ladu Dorjé Drönma retrieved them from their places of treasure concealment. Among these cycles of profound and vast teachings of Severance, the former [historical] transmission—the Gyatön Severance lineage—has continued unbroken to the present day. Since Severance is a profound technique, its enlightened activity in these and other ways is amazing: it has become widespread, filling the entire Himalayan region. Until the present, all spiritual masters regardless of their original tradition cultivate its experience, and it continues to be indispensable for subduing external and internal conditions that are difficult to subdue by other means.
In general, this doctrinal system’s own terminology states:
The four pair and eight discrete lineages create the framework,
and six illustrative examples express its superb qualities.
First, based on the individuals who requested specific transmissions, there are male and female lineages. Based on the essence, there are [lineages] associated with systematic texts and those with diverse texts. Based on well-known histories, there are earlier and later periods of propagation. Based on the teachings’ sources, there are canonical lineages and treasure lineages. These are the four pairs or eight discrete lineages that appeared.
Some present Severance in eight pairs or sixteen single [lineages]: male and female Severance, canonical and treasure Severance, Indian and Tibetan Severance, discourse and tantra traditions, the spiritual children’s lineages and the lineage of the meaning, heaven and earth teachings, systematic and unsystematic teachings, and diverse and minor lineages.

The six illustrative examples are as follows: Severance is like a white glacier: when snow falls on a glacier, it is white, but a glacier stays white even when snow doesn’t fall. Likewise, it is good if a Severance adept has knowledge acquired from education, but fine if not. Severance is like a lion: intimidating to a crowd yet fearless alone. Likewise, an adept is fine befriending the public, but fine traveling alone. Severance is like a large drum’s sound: a large drum’s beat can be accompanied by other instruments, but can be played alone. Likewise, there is no difference whether or not this practice is accompanied by other virtuous activities. Severance is like a spring of accomplishment: water of accomplishment flows in quantity equal to the number of people [present to drink it]. Likewise, in this tradition, the training suits an individual’s mental acumen. Severance is like a broken piece of a turquoise or gold: if large, it will be valuable, and even if small, it will have value according [to its size]. Likewise, countless good qualities ensue from knowing a great deal about the Severance cycle, but even a little knowledge is helpful to oneself and others. Severance is like a stallion’s hair. A stallion’s color has no bearing on its fine gait. Likewise, individuals who have perfected Severance, be they high or low, have blessings superior to those who practice other traditions.

Vajra Yoga has an excellent source: it was passed orally, and from mind to mind, among the seven Buddhist kings [of Shambhala], including Suchandra, and the vajra lineage bearers, including Manjushriyashas. It arrived in India at an early time, but he who made it known publicly was the greater Kalachakrapada, the initiator of this system. Therefore, we mark his as the first of this tradition’s systems. Many systems appeared after him, including those of Kalachakrapada the lesser; a recent lineage given by the accomplished master Shavaripa; Anupamarakshita, directly accepted as disciple by [the wisdom deity] Wheel of Time; his follower, Ravishrijnana; Kalachakrapada’s disciple, the great Scholar Naropa; Shakyashribhadra, the great scholar from Kashmir; and, later, Shantigupta, lord of accomplished masters.
“From” in the root text indicates [the kings and lineage bearers as] the sources of the latter traditions.

[The lineages of this teaching are the following:] the great translator Gyijo Dawé Özer’s pith instructions of the six applications and the short tantra specific to the six applications and its commentary; Translator Ma Géwé Lodrö’s six applications tradition; Translator Trom Péma Özer’s six applications; the six applications that glorious Lord Atisha received from Lama Krishnabhijna; the six applications transmitted by Chandranata to the great Kashmiri scholar [Somanata], known as the Dro tradition; the six applications Translator Ra Chörab received from Scholar Samantashri; the tradition of The Garland of Six Applications, composed by Translator Tsami Sangyé Drak and transmitted through Translator Sé Zhönnu Tsultrim and Nyötön Öma, known as the Tsami tradition; and the six applications that Réchung Dorjé Drak received from Amoghavajra.
Although three lineages transmitted through glorious Translator Ga Namgyal Dorjé passed through Translator Tsami Sangyé Drak, they are different from The Garland of Six Applications. Translator Ga Namgyal Dorjé gave the six applications of the Wheel of Time’s own tradition to Zhang Tsalpa; six applications of the mother tantra Vajra of Delight to Sachen Kunga Nyingpo; and six applications of the father tantra Matrix of Mystery to the spiritual mentor Kyura A-kyab. Translator Ga Namgyal Dorjé received these from Tsami Sangyé Drak, yet they are counted as separate traditions because the two traditions of The Garland of Six Applications and those from Translator Ga Namgyal Dorjé have significant differences in their modes of presenting the profound instructions for meditation.

Furthermore, the great scholar from Kashmir [Shakyashri] gave Translator Chal Chökyi Zangpo a transmission, and the teaching of Naropa’s The Great Commentary on Vajra of Delight in the form of pith instructions; Chal Chökyi Zangpo also possessed a text known as Naropa’s Treasure Box. The [Kashmiri] Scholar [Shakyashri] gave the lord of the teachings Sakya Pandit an oral lineage distinguished by six vajra verses. These are the two traditions passed through the Kashmiri Scholar [Shakyashri]. Scholar Vibhutichandra received the accomplished master Anupamarakshita’s tradition of the six applications from master Ratnarakshita: this is known as Vibhutichandra’s historical lineage. Later, at the Stam Vihar in Nepal, Shavaripa revealed his face directly [in a vision] to [Vibhutichandra]; what he gave on this occasion constitutes the six applications’ proximate lineage. These are Vibhutichandra’s two traditions. Further, Translator Chak Chöjé Pal received pith instructions from a Nepalese guru, the great Scholar Ravindrarakshita; and from an Indian sublime being Rahulashribhadra.
[Finally,] a master known as Menlung Guru (the accomplished master Punyashri, known in India as the accomplished master Dipamkara) achieved the immortal vajra body and now dwells on Potala Mountain. He first meditated on the Ra and Dro traditions’ unified pith instructions, mainly Dro’s tradition, yet when he achieved accomplishment, he did not have to rely on other lineages. In any event, he composed The Six Applications of the Litany of Names.
These seventeen transmissions were received by an emanation of the lineage bearers [of Shambhala], the lord of the teachings, great Kunpang Zhang Tukjé Tsöndru, who united these lineages into a single stream. He also received Vibhutichandra’s proximate lineage from four of that master’s direct disciples; if these are counted, there are a total of twenty lineages.

In addition, Kodrak Sönam Gyaltsen invited Vibhutichandra from Nepal in order to request his proximate lineage of the six applications; this is the Kodrak tradition passed through the great accomplished master Golung Zhönnu Pal. The separate tradition of Rong came from such masters as the son of Translator Rongpa Ga, Sherab Sengé; and Dorjé Gyaltsen. Bodong Rinchen Tsémo, one of Nyalpa Zhikpo Jampal Dorjé’s nine spiritual sons, requested the tantra’s profound instructions for meditation from the accomplished master Sémo Chéwa. The Bodong tradition passes from him to Tak-déwa Sengé Gyaltsen, Translator Shong Dorjé Gyaltsen, Translator Pang Loten, the great Translator Jang-tsé, and Translator Drakpa Gyaltsen, until the omniscient Jikdral Chenpo. A major system of study and practice originated with his disciples, including the great scholar Jampa Lingpa and Jangdak Namgyal Drak-zang.
Further, great Kunpang Zhang Tukjé Tsöndru had four disciples known as Kunpang’s four children; among them were Latö Wangchuk Gyaltsen and Sönpa Kun-gyalwa, from whom a distinct system arose. Many other major and minor traditions emerged, such as the Gökar’s tradition and that of Kok. Later, when Vanaratna, a great learned master from eastern India, journeyed to Tibet, he bestowed on disciples, including Translator Gö Zhönnu Pal and Chen-nga Chökyi Drakpa, the entire profound instructions of accomplished master Anupamarakshita’s historical lineage and Shavaripa’s recent lineage. Even later, Buddhagupta-nata, disciple of the great accomplished master Shantigupta, gave Shantigupta’s extraordinary oral lineage of the six applications to the great lord of Jonang [Taranata]. These were the lineages that appeared [in Tibet].

The most exalted of all these systems is that of the omniscient lord of the teachings, Sherab Gyaltsen Pal Zangpo [Dolpo Sangyé], whose life was foretold in such scriptures asThe Great Drum Discourse as the monk with the name “Capable One.” An emanation of the lineage bearers [of Shambhala], this great master from Dolpo was endowed with the ultimate four reliances regarding the Victor’s teachings. Lord Drolwé Gönpo [Taranata], who took intentional rebirth during the depths of the age of conflict as a sovereign displaying the conduct of great accomplished masters, attained the state of a second Buddha Vajra Bearer in the subjects of profound mysteries. The tradition pioneered by these two masters [Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen and Taranata], the two lineage bearers’ oral transmission, is superior to others and is the chief repository of this lineage of practice.

The bases of purification are the three vajras of wisdom body, speech, and mind, which are continuous throughout the circumstances of the basis, path, and result, and thereby have the characteristic of inseparability. The objects of purification are incidental clinging of delusion in relation to body, speech, and mind, along with the habitual patterns of life’s four circumstances, which create obscurations. The agents of purification are the three branches of [this path]: withdrawal of the senses, the branch of familiarization; effort in circulating energy, the branch of practice; and mindful meditative states, the branch of supreme practice. The result of purification is, for those endowed with a high degree of acumen and diligence, actualization of enlightenment’s three bodies in a single lifetime.
The mother of the victors, Vajra Yogini, directly bestowed the pith instructions, her wisdom mind’s fundamental essence, to the great accomplished master Orgyen Rinchen Pal. This accomplished master had reached consummation in training in both discourses and secret mantra. He received Wheel of Time’s tantra and commentaries, along with the pith instructions, from Sangyé Dorjé, a Wheel of Time specialist who held the Rong tradition’s lineage; Orgyen Rinchen Pal became outstanding in his erudition and achieved ultimate realization based on Gyalwa Gö-tsangpa’s teaching.

He journeyed to many sacred places and regions in India, such as Jalandhara; in particular, he went to Oddiyana in western India, overcoming with the brilliance of his view and conduct of tantric discipline every obstacle, danger, and miraculous appearance. In the central region of Dhumatala’s four directions, dakinis of the four wisdom families blessed him. Emanating as beautiful women, they foretold that in the city of Kaboka, Vajra Yogini would first reveal herself to him as a prostitute. As predicted, she gave him food and drink, and the pleasure of touch, thus liberating all his channels’ knots. In the midst of impressive signs, such as sounds and earthquakes, Vajra Yogini appeared to him directly [in her own form] and bestowed these complete profound instructions for meditation. The four dakinis mentioned before and a fifth, Lion-Faced Dakini, each gave him some instructions. Thus, he came to abide at the level of sublime accomplishment. As the dakinis foretold, when he returned to Tibet, he wrote down the teachings in response to the entreaty of Ya Zangpa and Rinpoché Kar-chuwa, a nephew of Nup Dulwa Dzinpa.

Rinpoché Kar-chuwa offered a mandala of a measure of gold for each topic [of the instructions] and wrote a concise memorandum on them. The realized master Dawa Sengé, custodian of the teaching, collected the pith instructions into volumes. Even later masters emphasized this system of teaching.
Golung Zhönnu Pal asked questions of that lord [Dawa Sengé] and recorded the answers he received. I have not heard clearly whether Butrapa Kétsun Sönam Özer wrote any text book. What are called the four great commentaries are the following: [Zhönnu Pal’s writing,] a major commentary by Zur-pukpa Rinchen Pal, and books of the complete explanation of the vajra verses by Scholar Shang-tön and by Nyédo Kunga Döndrup.
From Butrapa Kétsun Sönam Özer, the lineage passed to Chöjé Gangpa, until the glorious spiritual master Sönam Gyaltsen. A lineage also spread from the spiritual brothers of Nyédo [Monastery]. Thus, these and many systems appeared. Lord of the teachings, the second Victor, omniscient Rangjung Dorjé, received the complete profound instructions for meditation from the accomplished master Orgyenpa Rinchen Pal. He untied the vajra verses’ knots and illuminated better than other masters the profound instructions’ vital points in an exalted, excellent path. Lord Rolpé Dorjé [the fourth Karmapa] and his other incarnations, along with their disciples’ successive lineages, transmitted these teachings far and wide.

Translator Tropu Jampa Pal invited to Tibet the accomplished master Mitrayogi, who possessed eighteen marvelous teachings. Asked for profound instructions for meditation, Mitrayogi gave a common cycle of teaching that presents the branches of knowledge; a cycle on specific forms of experiential cultivation that presents inner techniques of meditation practice; and a special cycle of teachings that presents the secret gateway of blessings. These teachings passed in a lineage from Tropu Jampa Pal. Further, on Dönmo Mountain, Mitrayogi gave the great Master Tsenden Trul-zhik the profound instructions Saraha had given him: The Great Seal That Ends the Turning of the Wheel of Life. Master Tsenden Trul-zhik gave them to the realized Master Drakpa Sengé. Further, a master called Belré disguised himself as a yogin and gave Drakpa Sengé the approach and practice of the Celestial Dakini. The realized Master Kachö Wangpo composed a text on the two teachings just mentioned. Further, Mitrayogi conferred what are called the six guiding instructions to Scholar Shariputra, who passed them to Minyak Drak-rin and Kuchor Tokden; the vajra garland’s hundred empowerments were passed to the great Scholar Dönyö Dorjé. These and other lineages appeared [in Tibet from Mitrayogi’s teachings].

Further, the incarnate Master Latö Marpo received from the elder Dorjé Denpa a cycle of teachings on the Great Compassionate One and a cycle of profound instructions for meditation given by the five kinds of dakinis at Cool Grove.
Tsang Karak Gom-chung Lodrö Wangchuk merged teachings on the mind [of awakening] from Aro with the doctrinal transmission of mind training from Lord Atisha and composed a treatise, Training in the Awakening Mind. This was later called Karak’s three cycles, spread widely by such masters as Lhopa Dharma Kyab and the three Jang-gom brothers.
“Including” in the root text indicates infinite minor lineages that did not become doctrinal systems of separate lineages of meditation practice. These include various profound instructions for meditation, such as four types of direct guidance in [meditation on] Bodhisattva All-Seeing One, threefold space teachings passed from the elder and younger Kalachakrapada to the Nepalese Kayashri and others; a cycle on great seal’s vital essence; and Menlung-pa’sThe Stages of Meditation: Knowledge of One That Liberates All; and empowerments and techniques of meditation practice, such as Abhayakaragupta’s The Vajra Garland and The Hundred Meditation Techniques, and Darpana Acharya’s A Compendium of Activities.
This concludes the commentary to Chapter Three, “The History of the Lineages of Meditation Practice.”

What are known as fields of culture, studied and learned by non-Buddhists and Buddhists of all philosophical persuasions alike, are of two kinds: major and minor. From the Buddhist perspective, the former are said to be the five major fields of culture, the first of which is the study of Sanskrit grammar.
In Heaven of the Thirty-three, a god called All-Knowing God composed the first great treatise on grammar. It is said that Indra studied with him and composed his own treatise, Indra’s Grammar. The seer Brihaspati studied this treatise under Indra, became proficient, and served as teacher to the gods. Venerated as “guru of the gods,” strong pride swelled within him, at which Indra remarked,
Knowledge of grammar in its entirety Is boundless, like an ocean;
My own knowledge is like a full vase,
Your knowledge amounts to just a single drop!
This shattered Brihaspati’s pride: disheartened, he vowed never to speak of grammar again, but Indra commanded him, “Nevertheless, you must teach whatever you know.” Since Brihaspati had made his vow, he observed the practice of not speaking on four restricted days, but he taught at other times. This account is found in ancient Tibetan histories.
On the four restricted days, Indians proscribed not only learning grammar but study in general. Swift Realization, a text belonging to the later translations, lists five restricted days:
On the eighth [lunar day], the teacher is vanquished.
On the fourteenth, the students are vanquished.
On the thirtieth, both are vanquished.
On the fifteenth, everyone is vanquished.
The action of reading on the first [day of the lunar month],
Diminishes one’s very intelligence,
Just as when Gangaja’s arrows
Struck Yudhishtira’s army.

His life foretold by the Buddha in The Journey to Lanka Discourse,which refers to “the grammarian Panini,” and in The Root Tantra of Manjushri, Brahmin Panini was born in Bhiruka Grove in west India. He consulted a palmist to ascertain whether or not he could learn grammar. When the palmist predicted that he could not, Panini took a small knife and cut the missing lines on his palm, then studied with every grammarian in the world. He acquired an excellent knowledge of grammar but was leftdissatisfied. He practiced [Bodhisattva] Lord of the World’s awareness mantra and saw the exalted bodhisattva, who asked, “What is it you wish?” Panini said, “Bestow upon me the knowledge of grammar.” The bodhisattva then recited the [Sanskrit] alphabet: “A, I, U,... ,” etc. Through the exalted bodhisattva’s blessing, that act alone gave Panini understanding of all grammars in the three worlds.

Panini then composed the thousand-verse Panini’s Grammar and the thousand-verse Discourse That Distinguishes Particularities. Until that time, except for the various grammar texts found in non-Buddhist traditions (such as Indra’s Grammar that Shariputra is said to have studied for twelve years), no treatise in the Buddhist tradition combined every application of grammar. Therefore, these two texts by Panini are like the source text or ancestor of all works on grammar.
To help King Udayana learn grammar, Brahmin Vararuchi used the power of an awareness mantra to summon naga King Shesha and compel him to teach a hundred-thousand-verse commentary to Panini’s Grammar. The naga, behind a curtain, dictated while Vararuchi transcribed his words. Once, Vararuchi wondered, “What does [Shesha’s] body look like?” He lifted the curtain and saw a great rearing serpent. The naga fled in embarrassment. At that point, only twenty-five thousand verses had been written. Vararuchi composed the rest of the text, another twelve thousand verses; it was called The Mahabhasha (Great Speech). Teaching and study of Panini’s works with this commentary have not declined but continue in India to the present day.
Grammar texts that follow Panini’s tradition include Bhasha (Speech), a root text by Purushottama of about nine hundred verses, accompanied by an autocommentary; Moonlight of Analysis by Ramachandra; An Introduction to Form: A Commentary to the Meaning of Panini by illustrious Dharmakirti; Shakatayana, a text included as a part of Panini’s Grammar; and the writings of Katyayana.
It is said that Translator Darpa later translated just the root text of Panini’s Grammar, but this was not a literal translation.

His life foretold in The Latter Tantra of the Wheel of Time, Master Chandragomi was born in Varendra in east India. He knew all the general fields of culture, such as grammar and logic, without having studied them. From the age of seven, he was able to refute non-Buddhists’ doctrinal challenges. Chandragomi received scriptural transmission from Master Ashoka, attained accomplishment in the practice of the awareness mantras of All-Seeing One and Tara, and became a great scholar. Encouraged by exalted Bodhisattva All-Seeing One, Chandragomi adhered to the discipline of “gomi,” or layperson. The marvelous story of Chandragomi’s life is inconceivable; he is alive even now, residing in Potala pure land.
He composed one hundred and eight praises, Buddhist treatises, non-Buddhist treatises, and treatises on the arts, a total of four hundred and thirty-two different texts on various subjects. In Dakshina, Chandragomi read The Mahabhasha, the commentary composed by [the Naga king] Shesha. He criticized it with these words:
A commentary should contain few words and many meanings; it should be without repetition and be complete. The Naga, very dull of mind, [composed a commentary] that has many words and little meaning, is repetitive and incomplete.
Chandragomi then composed Chandra’s Grammar, which has seven hundred verses [divided into] twenty-four chapters. This commentary provides a perfect summary of the meaning of Panini’s Grammar and has the qualities of being concise, clear, and complete. He also wrote such ancillary texts asA Discourse on Letters. In Nalanda, however, Chandragomi read The Ever-Excellent Grammar Discourse, written by Chandrakirti. “This has been composed with perfect wording,” Chandragomi thought. “My work is not as good as this.” Feeling his grammar would not help beings, he threw the volume of Chandra’s Grammar down a well. However, Tara appeared to him and said, “You wrote with the noble intention of aiding others. Therefore, in the future your text will be immensely useful for beings. Chandrakirti wrote out of pride in his scholarship, so his work will prove to be of little use to others. Therefore, retrieve your text from the well.”

Heeding her prophetic instruction, he retrieved it. Such is the exalted quality of this text that it was said that just drinking that well’s water imparted great knowledge.
Chandragomi’s maternal uncle, Dharmadéva, wrote a commentary to his work; Ratnamati wrote a commentary to Dharmadéva’s text, and Purnachandra composed a commentary to Ratnamati’s commentary. [This tradition includes] many other texts, both those by Chandragomi himself, such asA Discourse on Unadi, etc. along with its autocommentary and A Discourse on Verbal Roots,as well as texts composed by others.
Translator Shong Dorjé Gyaltsen translated this tradition’s principal source text [Chandra’s Grammar]. Since that time, its teaching transmission has continued uninterruptedly in Tibet. A number of Tibetan commentaries have also been written, such as those by great Translator Tuk-jé Palwa and Zhalu Chökyong Zangpo. A major commentary [in this tradition] later composed by all-knowing Dharmakara is a great treasure of eloquence free from errors, indistinguishable [in quality] from Indian texts.

Further, during Chandranapala’s reign, Indra taught Brahmin Indradhruva the definite points of grammar; his instruction resulted in the twenty-five thousand verse Indravyakarana or Indra’s Grammar. Not long afterward, to gain understanding of this grammar, Brahmin Saptavarman followed King Udayana’s command and practiced meditation on Six-Faced Youth [Indra]. When he gained accomplishment, [the deity] asked, “What is it you wish?” Saptavarman requested knowledge of Indra’s Grammar. By the deity’s mere enunciation, “Siddho varna samamnayah,” Saptavarman acquired full knowledge of grammar, then composed The Kalapa Grammar. As this belongs to the tradition of Indra’s Grammar, a large number of both Buddhist and non-Buddhist commentaries on it have appeared.
In Tibet as well, many have studied The Kalapa Grammar. Translator Shong Dorjé Gyaltsen first translated the principal text. Then, over time, Translator Pang Loten and others translated such Kalapa Grammar commentaries as The Durga Singha Commentary, Syadanta, and Tyadyanta. A number of both good and poor-quality commentaries on The Kalapa Grammar have been written in Tibetan.

During the lifetimes of the six learned gate guardians [of Vikramashila Monastery], exalted Sarasvati taught Sarasvati’s Grammar directly to Master Anubhuti, a brahmin from Maharashtra in southern India. This grammar became widely studied throughout the land of exalted beings.
In Tibet, the lord of Jonang, Drolwé Gönpo [Taranata] studied Sarasvati’s Grammar with the scholars Krishna and Palabhadra, then made the first Tibetan translation of the text and its commentary, and also composed his own commentary. It is thought that Translator Darpa revised Taranata’s translation of the main text and made a new translation of the commentary. It is possible that Darpa’s translation of some of the text’s chapters were well done, yet when one compares his Tibetan version of the commentary to the Sanskrit original, they are usually different. It seems that his work must be classified as original rather than as a translation. Nevertheless, a lineage of teaching spread based on this text.
Omniscient Chökyi Nangwa, having first questioned Brahmin Vishnupati of Nepal, gained a perfect understanding of the diffi cult points of Sarasvati’s Grammar. He then made a new translation of The Clear Distinction, Master Anubhuti’s own commentary to [Sarasvati’s Grammar]. It seems that in India, both Buddhist and Hindu scholars wrote
many commentaries [to Sarasvati’s Grammar], such as Punjaraja: The Long Commentary.

Many [texts on logic] by non-Buddhistteachers, such as Seer Dvaipayana’s Treatise of Logical Analysis and Brahmin Akshapada’s Treatise That Presents the Eight Aspects of the Words and Meanings of Logical Analysis appeared before Buddhist texts on logic, yet are faulty, invalid treatises dedicated purely to the process of debate itself. Therefore, I will not endorse them here. Logic is known as a field of culture common [to Buddhists and non-Buddhists], but since [non-Buddhist logic] is formulated merely for debate, its premises differ [from Buddhist logic] and significant differences separate the two.

The Victor’s excellent speech clearly presents direct valid cognition, whereas inferential valid cognition is not denied and can be known through axioms’ implications. The Discourse of the Definite Elucidation of the Wisdom Mind presents an outline of the four bases of reasoning:
The nature of reality, dependence, function,
And rationality are the four bases of reasoning.
It is taught that these four also appeared in the past, during the time of the doctrine of [the previous buddha,] Kashyapa, when the human life span was twenty thousand years. In our teacher’s doctrine, the first Buddhist text on logic is Establishing Debate. Some assert that its author was Master Vasubandhu, but in the autocommentary to A Compendium of All Discourses on Logic, this opinion is clearly refuted at length: the Vasubandhu [commonly referred to as] the “younger brother” [of Asanga] clearly did not write it. Early Tibetan masters think that the text was composed by another master also named Vasubandhu, such as Vridhacharya Vasubandhu.

He also wrote four ancillary “branch” treatises: Analysis of Relations, A Drop of Reasons, Reasoning for Debate, and Establishing Other Continuums. In this way, he initiated a major tradition known as the seven treatises of logic.

Dharmakirti instructed his principal disciple Devendrabuddhi to write a commentary to his Ascertainment of Dignaga’s “Compendium of Logic.” Devendrabuddhi’s commentary continued from where Dharmakirti’s own commentary to the first chapter ended. Old histories relate that Devendrabuddhi wrote two commentaries [that Dharmakirti] burned and washed with water. He accepted the third commentary, saying, “Only the evident meaning is taught in this text.” Devendrabuddhi’s commentary and Dharmakirti’s own commentary are collectively known asTwelve Thousand Verses on Logic.
Devendrabuddhi’s disciple Shakyamati wrote a commentary to Twelve Thousand Verses on Logic. It is said that Master Vinitadéva wrote commentaries to all seven treatises of Dharmakirti. The illustrious Scholar Alamkara Prajnakara wrote An Elaboration on Logic in Three and a Half Thousand Verses, explaining Dharmakirti’s Commentary on Dignaga’s “Compendium of Logic.” In a supplementary section, he composed an extended explanatory commentary to the third chapter establishing logic; he explained its intent in terms of the middle way school. This is known as Eighteen Thousand Verses on Logic. Many other commentaries, such as those by Brahmin Shankarananda, have also appeared. Followers of the illustrious scholar Alamkara Prajnakara—Master Jina; the Kashmiri Jamari, who is also known as Yamari the logician; and Suryagupta— taught extensively.

Master Dharmottara composed the twelve-thousand verse Great Validity, a commentary to Ascertainment of Dignaga’s “Compendium of Logic.” He also wrote Helping Disciples, a commentary to A Drop of Reasoning. Trijayadhaka (“triple victory drum”) beat a drum of victory three times after defeating non-Buddhists in debate, then was known by that name. He composed many minor texts on logic to explain Dharmakirti’s philosophy. The illustrious scholar [Alamkara Prajnakara] and both [Dharmottara and Trijayadhaka] were known for their extremely great skill in the analysis of logic. Master Shantarakshita composed A Compilation on Thatness, synthesizing the meaning of all earlier texts on logic. Kamalashila explained Shantarakshita’s philosophy in what is known as The Great Commentary on Logic.

In Tibet, during the doctrine’s early propagation, Kawa Paltsek and Drenpa Namka translated a few texts on logic, such as the root text and commentaries of A Drop of Reasoning and Analysis of Relations, the last of Dharmakirti’s seven treatises. During the later propagation, Zhama Sengé Gyaltsen translated such works as Dignaga’s Compendium of Logic. Ma Géwé Lodrö initially translated Dharmakirti’s extensive treatise, A Commentary on Dignaga’s “Compendium of Logic,” The Twelve Thousand Verses on Logic, and other texts; Kyungpo Draksé and others taught them. This is known as the early school of logic, which spread only slightly.
Translator Ngok Loden Sherab revised these translations and produced completely new translations of the Ascertainment of Dignaga’s “Compendium of Logic,” A Drop of Reasoning, and other texts. This new school of logic spread, primarily derived from the systems of Scholar Alamkara Prajnakara and Dharmottara. A holder of this lineage, Chapa Chökyi Sengé, composed a pair of long and short summaries for the middle way and other subjects. In particular, he composed A Summary of Logic: Eliminating the Mind’s Darkness and established a college, thus founding the “summary” tradition. The meaning of the name “summary” is as stated:
The learned give [this tradition] the name “summary”
Because it summarizes every intention
Contained within the Victor’s canon and the treatises of
commentary.
Later, Kashmiri Pandit Shakyashri and Sakya Pandit Kunga Gyaltsen reviewed the translations of Dharmakirti’s Commentary on Dignaga’s “Compendium of Logic” and produced a definitive edition. Although many who translated logic texts appeared, I hold the teaching systems of Sakya Pandit and Translator Ngok Loden Sherab as supreme.

Of the three masters mentioned (Ma Géwé Lodrö, Translator Ngok Loden Sherab, and Sakya Pandit), the latter, [Bodhisattva] Gentle Melody [incarnate] Sakya Pandit, lived twenty-five successive lifetimes as a scholar. The force of such propensity gave him inconceivable wisdom and freed within him a great treasure of fearless confidence. He was especially famed as a sublime influential scholar of logic. He composed the root text Logic: A Treasure of Reason together with a commentary, which contain the essence of [Dharmakirti’s] seven treatises and discourses on logic. He had countless disciples throughout India and Tibet. Among those who held his lineage of realization, his principal disciples were Tsok, Drup, and Ön; among those who held the pith instruction lineage, his principal disciples were Lhopa Kunkyen Rinchen Pal and Mar Chökyi Gyalpo. Among these and others, the holders of the teaching lineage of logic were two brothers, Sharpa Sherab Jungné and Dorjé Özer. They and Nupa Uyuk-pa Rikpé Sengé, and Gungpa Kyotön Drimé spread the tradition widely, so that many exalted masters of logic appeared. Nupa Uyuk-pa Rikpé Sengé’s nephew, Nyi-tokpa Sangyé Kun-mön, had four disciples known as the three pillars (Khang-tön Özer Gyaltsen, Nyen Darma Sengé, Zhang Dodé-pal), with an addition (Zur-kangpa Kar Shakya Drakpa), of whom the last was foremost. Omniscient Lhopa Rinchen Pal also composed various works [on logic].

Nupa Uyuk-pa Rikpé Sengé and these masters taught for a long time; within their teaching transmissions, Jamyang Kyapo, great Translator Nya, Chöjé Lama Dampa, and Nya-ön Kunga Pal appeared at various periods, early and late. The last, Nya-ön Kunga Pal, was especially learned in this field, so that a saying circulated, “Logic has reached the fish (nya)!” Nya-ön Kunga Pal’s disciple Yak Mipham Chökyi Lama was followed by a succession of many lords of eloquence, such as Rongtön Shéja Kunzik, Jamchen Rabjampa Sangyé Pel, and Gorampa Sönam Sengé. Rongtön Shéja Kunzik’s disciple was Lord Dönyö Palwa; in brief, from him there appeared lions of speech like a string of pearls, including the great Scholar Shakya Chok-den. Chöjé Lama Dampa’s disciple was great Translator Jang-tsé; from him there developed a separate tradition of logic named the logic of manifest reason. This developed through a successive transmission from Jang-tsé, through Lochen Drakpa, to the omniscient master Bo-dong Jikdral Chenpo. Another transmission passed from Zhang Dodé-pal through the learned Norzang Pal, Nyak-ön, Rendawa Zhönnu Lodrö, Lord Tsongkapa, and from him to Gyaltsap Darma Rinchen, Kédrup Gélék Palwa, and others. This teaching system, unbroken to the present, is a tradition of logic that resounds like a lion’s roar.

As described, many scholars elucidated the path of logic without distortion. Later however, those with inferior merit and intelligence squandered the textual traditions of the lords of logic with false semblances of analysis. Thus, to fully elucidate past masters’ systems without error, Lord of the World, Bodhisattva All-Seeing One took rebirth as the supreme Victor, the all-knowing seventh [Karmapa] Chödrak Gyatso. Propensities from his earlier life as Dharmakirti awakened: wisdom speech arose in his mind and he dictated it to a scribe without any effort such as making preparatory notes, or reading and contemplating existing texts. The result, his work known as Valid Cognition: An Ocean of Texts on Logic has many wonderful, exalted qualities and was compiled to nurture intelligent readers. Thus all streams of Dharmakirti’s thought are contained in this vast all-inclusive reservoir.

Lord Tsongkapa and others considered that these texts of logic reject wrong views, and that they are treatises that present an outline of the four truths without mistakes. Sublime Scholar Ngawang Chödrak states, “We must call these texts treatises of complete inner knowledge. Their essence is application to external knowledge, because they are treatises of the knowledge of logic.” From the point of view of the established subject matter, there are three Tibetan modes of commentary on logic. Great Translator Ngok Loden Sherab explains them according to middle way essencelessness; those of the Sakya tradition, the yogacharin middle way; while most others, the middle way that uses conventional consensus. Further, omniscient Sönam Sengé states:
In the textual tradition of the two crown jewels of logic,
Among these three modes of teaching in this Himalayan region,
[In one,] the former and latter seven collections on logic are
combined and taught;
[In another,] what is excellent within the Indian commentaries is
synthesized and taught;
And [in the last,] teaching is given based on the teacher’s own
concepts.
The Sakya mode of instruction is considered best,
Since [Sakya Pandit] was familiar with the path of logic over many
lifetimes
And received a faultless lineage of pith instructions—
He mastered the wisdom of Gentle Melody’s mind.
As stated, Sakya Pandit combined diverse fragments of the content of former and later texts—the logic discourses, Dharmakirti’s seven treatises, and his autocommentary to the first chapter—into a coherent whole, upon which he based his teaching. Most other Tibetan teachers based their teaching on compilations of the excellent parts of commentaries by Devendrabuddhi, Shakyamati, Alamkara Prajnakara, and Dharmottara. Gyaltsap Jé and Kédrup Jé both taught primarily by way of their own understanding. These are considered to be the three modes of teaching logic.

All fields of art can be gathered into physical, verbal, or mental arts. What I will describe here is principally art produced physically and, among all artistic endeavors, that which provides both immediate and long-term inexhaustible aid and pleasure: representations of wisdom form, wisdom speech, and wisdom mind related to the three jewels.
The first among this doctrine’s three sacred supports to appear was the sacred support of wisdom mind, the body of ultimate enlightenment. After our teacher’s birth in the Lumbini Grove, King Shuddhodana and others erected Lotus Mound Stupa. Subsequently, the second such support was the stupa of awakening and others known collectively as the eight stupas. Faithful persons, such as King Bimbisara, gradually built many other stupas, sacred supports of the Buddha (i.e., those that held his hair or nails, for example), or stupas dedicated to pious attendant arhats [after their passing into transcendence].

Painted images antedate sculpted images. The Proclamation of Brahma: Characteristics of Painting, written by Seer Atreya, states that in the past during the first eon, when the human life span decreased from one hundred thousand years, a human monarch called Subduer of Fear appeared. He ruled this world according to spiritual principles; thus the life span increased again to one hundred thousand years and great happiness prevailed. The king practiced disciplines of asceticism and attained Ishvara’s eight qualities. Brahma gave him the supreme boon of understanding all treatises and made a promise that the gods’ armies and weapons would not intrude into the human world. Then, when a brahmin’s beloved young child died suddenly, the brahmin said to the king,
Because you do not rule your kingdom according to spiritual principles, premature death has befallen your subject: my son has died! If you do not raise my son [from death], I will kill myself here.
The king led the brahmin into the presence of the King of the Lord of Death, blazingly resplendent as the sun. He prostrated and asked that the brahmin’s son be returned. The Lord of Death replied, “I did not take him: his own karma was exhausted!” The king demanded, “Give him back!” The Lord of Death repeated again and again that it was not right, until finally they prepared for battle, and poured a deluge of weapons upon one another. The king’s downpour of weapons from the gods defeated all the Lord of Death’s followers. The Lord of Death raised his club [to attack] and the king hoisted a club bearing Brahma’s head [to parry]: the whole world shrank in terror. At this point, Brahma appeared and said,
As [the child’s] individual karma was exhausted, the Lord of Death has done no wrong. Nevertheless, paint a painting of the brahmin’s son.

Accordingly, the king produced the painting, which Brahma brought to life and gave to the brahmin. It is said, “As starving spirits [i.e., including the Lord of Death] are called ‘the naked,’ it is good to subdue them.” Therefore, the king was called Subduer of the Naked. As he was the first to fashion a formal painting, he was also called First Artist. Brahma ordered the king to offer prostrations and gifts to the Lord of Death, and everyone was pleased [at the outcome]. The king then went to the world of Brahma, and asked how to paint. He heard such eulogies as,
Supreme among mountains is Mount Meru;
Of those born from an egg,
The greatest is the garuda;
Chief among humans are the rulers of the land;
Likewise, painting is the chief craft.
And,
O King, likewise all crafts
Fully depend upon the art of painting...
Then following the god’s prophetic advice, he studied with his teacher Vishvakarma, who emphasized the proportions of an image of a wheel monarch, such as the faults of [a painting] lacking correct proportions, and the benefits of having them. He also taught him the requisites of beauty:
If the body’s beauty is incomplete,
What is the point of having the proportions?
From that time forth, human artists with the ability to create illusions, makers of wondrous works of art, have always appeared. As the scriptures on discipline clearly relate, until Buddha Lord of the Sages’ transcendence of sorrow, forms in paintings could create the illusion of reality. Many such paintings appeared during the hundred years that followed our teacher’s transcendence of sorrow.

The paintings sent to Udrayana and Muktikakhatti, known as “Drawn from Water” and “Light Rays,” are said to be the earliest sacred supports of the wisdom body during this Buddha’s doctrine.
King Bimbisara of Magadha and King Udrayana of Ravana sent one another gifts and became friends without having met. Udrayana sent Bimbisara the gift of a suit of armor of priceless jewels; in reply, Bimbisara ordered a painting of the Buddha’s body to be made on cotton and sent it [to Udrayana]. Our teacher’s brilliant splendor was unendurable; the artist was unable to paint him. The Buddha sat at the edge of a bathing pool and his likeness reflected on the water was painted on cotton. Above and below [the central figure of the Buddha], the artist painted the links of interdependent causation, in unfolding and reverse order, and the five bases of training in refuge, together with their benefits. When this was sent to Udrayana, he perceived the truth. It is said that this painting was known as “The Sage Drawn from Water.”
When the Transcendent Conqueror proclaimed the teachings in Kapilavastu, the wife of Mahanaman sent a maidservant named Rohita to fetch a garland. On the way, a cow about to give birth gored her, and she died. As she had faith in the Buddha, she immediately entered the womb of the queen of Sri Lanka. At her birth, it rained pearls: she was given the name Muktiki (“Pearl”), or Muktikakhatti (“Pearl Throne”). She heard stories of the Buddha from a merchant from central India and was moved to faith, then sent the Buddha a letter. In reply, the Buddha sent a painting an artist made on cotton, depicting how our teacher had shone light rays onto it, together with a metrical line of instruction. On seeing it, Muktikakhatti perceived the truth. This painting was known as “Light Rays Sage.” As this painting came from a pure source, religious artists of India and eastern countries all developed [their style] from it.

When faithful householder patrons invited the monastic community for noonday meals and the Buddha did not attend, his seat of honor was seen to lack majesty. Thus, Anatapindata requested, “If you the teacher allow it, we will make images and place them [on the seat of honor].” In reply, the Buddha gave him permission, and many sculptures of precious materials were made.
During the Transcendent Conqueror’s absence while he visited the heavens, the King of Kashi (Benares) built a sandalwood statue as an object of veneration. When the teacher descended from the heavens, that statue took sixty steps forward to greet him. When the Buddha exhorted it, “To promote virtue in China, go there,” it flew through the sky to China, where it still dwells. It is known as the “Sandalwood Lord,” and many silk embroidery hangings were made as copies of it. These were the first sculpted images.

Lord of gods Shakra began making images of our teacher from various jewels—five kinds of jewels of gods and humans, and five hundred and
one quartz stones. Vishvakarma undertook to measure the Buddha, tying a thread to our teacher’s little toe, but before he completed his task, he arrived in the presence of Buddha Joyous Splendor in the world Joyful Glowing Light. That buddha said, “Set aside thoughts of the Buddha’s size; instead, bring your teacher to mind.” As soon as Vishvakarma did this, he arrived in the teacher’s presence. With various miraculous acts, he produced statues of the Buddha at the ages of eight and twelve, with measurements provided by the Buddha’s former nursemaids; and a statue of the Buddha at the age of twenty-five, with measurements corresponding to common perception. Our teacher’s face shone and gathered light to bless the statues.
Shakra invited the latter of these statues (the one the size of his body at the age of twenty-five) to the heavens. For many years, the other two statues dwelled in the heavens, Oddiyana, the nagas’ lands, and at Vajra Seat. Then, during King Dévapala’s reign, the statue of the Buddha at twelve years of age was invited to China; the statue of the Buddha at eight years of age, to Nepal. Eventually, both arrived in Tibet: these statues are those that sit [in Lhasa] in the Temple of Magical Manifestation [i.e., the Jokang] and Ramoché Temple. Since the Buddha manifestly blessed them, they have the same blessing as our teacher himself.

After our teacher’s transcendence of sorrow, hardly any human artists had magical powers [of creation]. Thus, many divine artists emanated as humans and helped in the building of especially exalted sacred supports.
During the time of Venerable Upagupta, nearly eighty years after our teacher’s passing, three brahmin brothers appeared in Magadha. In Varanasi, the eldest built a temple and a statue made of precious stones. In Rajgir, the middle brother built a temple and a statue made from the earth of eight sacred places. At Vajra Seat, the youngest brother built an excellent structure, outwardly in the shape of a stupa, and containing a gandhola shrine room. Within this, he built a statue of the Buddha at the age of thirty-five made from a mixture of gaushirsha sandalwood and powdered precious substances. Its eyes are emeralds, and the marks and signs of physical perfection adorn it. This image lacks the tongue that can cover the face, clothes suspended four finger-widths away from contact with the body, an aura that extends one arm-span, and the three forms of conduct; the statue’s hair is blue and its hair between the eyebrows is indistinct. Apart from eight such differences, this statue, called Mahabodhi (“Great Awakening”), is said to be similar to the actual Buddha.
Later, various patrons gradually sponsored many statues, such as Drumbeat Gentle Splendor and the other eight wondrous sacred supports of Magadha.

During King Ashoka’s reign, noxious spirit artists built such structures as stupas at the eight major sacred places and at Vajra Seat’s inner enclosure. During Nagarjuna’s lifetime, naga artists produced many works of art. For many years after their construction, the noxious spirits’ and nagas’ artistic work could create the illusion of being real. Later, even though they ceased to be like this due to [declining] time, their creations remained special works of art that no one knew [how to replicate].
Then, over a long period, various talents were responsible for many different lines of artistic creation, but no coherent systems were established.

After that period, [the following artists] gradually appeared, their work modeled upon the art of gods, noxious spirits, and nagas:
During King Buddhapaksha’s reign, [an artist] named Bimbasara appeared in Magadha. During King Shila’s reign, Srigdhari (meaning “Garland Holder”) appeared in the land of Maru. During Dévapala’s reign, Dhiman appeared in Varendra; his son, Bitpalo, lived in Bengal. These were great masters of painting, sculpture, metal casting, and carving. The many holders of their traditions eventually became known respectively as “central artists,” “artists of the old western tradition,” and “eastern artists.” The eastern artists were followers of the father, and became identifiedas eastern painting. Followers of the son spread in Magadha; [their work] was identified as central painting.

In Nepal, the earlier artistic tradition was similar to the old western style. The middle period’s painting and bell-metal casting was Nepal’s indigenous tradition, although it mainly resembled the eastern [Indian tradition]. No distinct tradition is found in the later period.
In Kashmir, artists first copied the central and old western traditions. Later, an artist named Hasuraja created a new tradition of both painting and sculpture, currently called the Kashmiri school. Where the Buddha’s teachings lasted, there lived masters of religious art. Where Muslims dominated, the art of image making ceased; where Hinduism flourished, unskilled religious artists thrived. Thus, very little of the traditions mentioned above remains today in those [non-Buddhist] regions.
In later times an established tradition of sculpture spread in Pukkan and Dakshina, although it is clear that their artistic traditions did not reach Tibet in the past. It is said that in those lands live very many followers of three masters—Jaya (“Victory”), Parajaya (“Victory over Others”), and Vijaya (“Complete Victory”).

In Tibet during the reign of the emanated King Songtsen Gampo, it is said that the main sacred supports in the Tradruk [temples] were only self-arisen statues and such images as the self-arisen [statue] of Bodhisattva Great Compassion at Rasa. During Trisong Déutsen’s reign, Tibet’s earliest paintings and sculpted images were those at Samyé Monastery, which portrayed the three turnings of the wheel of the teachings, principally the great awakening.
Translator Taktsang relates that “The Sage Drawn from Water,” Tibet’s earliest model of a painted image, came from [the statue of] great awakening at Vajra Seat having been sprinkled with saffron water, then covered with moist clean cotton. When the cloth was lifted away, the two arms directly appeared upon the cloth due to the statue’s blessing. A style of painting was transmitted using this model. Though others concur with [another] account mentioned above, I think this later story is accurate, since on examination one sees [in examples of this style] a short throat, great width, etc. Therefore this style’s works are not proportional and their appearing aspect is somewhat unattractive. Nevertheless, all known traditions accept it as a valid model.

At first, Nepalese- [Tibetan: Béri-] style painting was the only widespread system. Then [Bodhisattva] Gentle Melody took birth in human form as Venerable Menla Döndrup in [Tibet, at] Mentang, Lhodrak. He originated the use of that area’s vermilion. Because of his wife, he lefthis homeland and moved to Tsang, where he studied painting under Dopa Tashi Gyalpo. He remembered a previous lifetime in China during which he had seen paintings made of embroidered silk. He then constantly created wonderful paintings, including the great Mentang painting. He inspired lines of both father-son and master-disciple lineages. Further, a tradition known as Kyentsé Chenmo appeared in Gongkar Gangtö, an artistic tradition derived from the earlier one. These two, the Menri and Kyenri, became two distinct, original systems, as famous in the Himalayas as the sun and moon.
An artist known as Tulku Chiu traveled tirelessly for the sake of [mastering] this field of art. Endowed with unsurpassable talent, he created an artistic lineage [the Chiuri], that differed from the earlier two [the Menri and Kyenri], and excelled in coloring and shading. Later, Chöying Gyatso of Tsang founded the New Menri tradition. This and many other artistic lineages appeared, but they mainly belong within the previous systems.
In Yartö, an artist known as Tulku Namka Tashi appeared. Venerable Lord Mikyö Dorjé affirmed that artist was one of his own emanations, and foretold that he would spread the [Karmapa’s] physical enlightened activity. As Zhamar Könchok Yenlak and Gyaltsap Drakpa Döndrup instructed, Tulku Namka Tashi learned the Menri tradition from Kalden Sharchokpa Könchok Pendé of Ené, known as an emanation of the Chinese princess [Wencheng]. He then developed the painting tradition known as Gardri, in which he used Indian bronze casting and the Men-tang school styles of facial and physical depiction as a basic framework, and followed the Ming dynasty style of silk embroidered hangings for such details as landscape, and for coloring and shading. After him, an artist known as Chö Tashi, and later, Karshö Karma Tashi continued this unrivalled system of painting which still exists today. In brief, the three artists named Tashi [Tulku Namka Tashi, Chö Tashi, and Karshö Karma Tashi] founded the widespread Gardri school.

Similarly, the foremost masters of sculpture were Tulku Léu-chungpa and Péma Karpa. Later, a Gardri tradition master, an offi cial of Dakpo Gopa Monastery known as Kundün Karma Sidral, or Go-nyön, had unequaled intelligence and was known as a physical emanation of the eighth Lord [Karmapa]. They, Karma Rinchen, and many others master sculptors appeared, but no lineages from them can be found today.
During the time of the great fifth [Dalai Lama], there was a sculptor known as Épa Kukpa, or Hordar; and Tulku Baptro, known as an emanated artist. Their lineages definitely led in the later times to such artistic lineages as the Döpal style, which is outstanding in sculpture.

Especially exalted when compared to all these was the master of art, Lord of the World, glorious [tenth] Karmapa Chöying Dorjé, who studied painting under the Menri master Chu-kyer Tulku Tsering of Lhodrak. In his early life, he worked in the Menri tradition, and with that as a basis, his later art was in the style of silk-embroidered hangings and the Kashmiri tradition. His paintings, sculptures, and silk embroideries can still be viewed today. There also exist the more recent paintings and sculptures born from the genius of omniscient Tsuklak Chökyi Nangwa. All their works are compositions of great miraculous power that transcend the limits of ordinary beings’ rational mind. Even now, their creations are directly perceivable nectar for the eyes of ordinary beings. This superiority is evident in An Account of the Paintings to Accompany “The Wish- Fulfilling Vine, the Buddha’s Past Lives,” written by the omniscient master [Tsuklak Chökyi Nangwa] himself.

Writing follows language and speech. Therefore, even within any country, many slight variations in spoken and written language arise that cannot fit into a single framework.
Hindus believe in twenty-four creators, among whom they believe the creator of letters to be the god Always Peaceful, Maheshvara. Many families of Indian scripts and other written words appeared in India in each region; earlier forms fall into disuse and are replaced by new ones, and so on. While Buddhism lasted in India, such scripts as Lancha, Vartula, and Nagara predominated, whereas after the doctrine’s decline, only the Arabic script was widespread.
In China during the reign of the five Dhi [emperors] and others, carved and impressed letters originated; later, written letters were devised by the high official Li Tse while at war. He used a rabbit’s tail as a brush and smoke of pinewood as ink. Such accounts [of the origins of the Chinese characters] are extremely numerous.
The first volume of the sacred support of wisdom speech was one from the middle cycle of teachings [The Perfection of Sublime Insight], written by [the god] Shakra on pages of gold using liquefied beryl as ink. He also wrote out the text of The Manifold Adornment of the Victory Banner’s Tip, which he attached to the top of a victory banner and used to repel the demi-gods’ attack.
The scriptures on monastic discipline forbid the sale of volumes of the teacher’s canon but permit the sale of non-Buddhist texts. This proves that written texts existed [during the Buddha’s lifetime]. During the teachings’ compilation, the compilers wrote scriptures out in their own regions in their own languages and gradually transmitted them in that form.

The Stainless Light Commentary to the Concise Tantra of the Wheel of Time
makes such [predictions] as, “In Tibet, the three Buddhist ways will be written in Tibetan.” At first, no proper system of letters, or of [written] representation [of language], existed in Tibet. Tonmi Sambhota, an emanation of [Bodhisattva] Gentle Melody, was Buddhist King Songtsen Gampo’s prime minister. Commanded by the Buddhist bodhisattva king and propelled by the timely awakening of his own special aspirations to engage in the conduct of awakening, he journeyed to India with a retinue of sixteen people. He studied Sanskrit grammar and [Indian] written language perfectly from scholars such as Pandit Dévavidyasingha and Brahmin Livikara, and returned to Tibet, where he pleased the king with poetic compositions of praises in intricate structure.
In [Lhasa’s] Maru Palace, Tonmi Sambhota created a new Tibetan script based on the [Deva]nagara script, omitting the [Sanskrit] vowels and consonants unnecessary for the Tibetan language, and adding six necessary letters [not in the Sanskrit alphabet]. He thus founded the written language tradition known as “the thirty mother letters and the six child letters.” He is said to have composed eight grammar texts, including The Thirty Letters and Tibetan Grammar; however, it is said that the six others apart from these two were lost during King Lang Darma’s reign. The lineage of this script was gradually transmitted: Kyungpo Yutri, Sumpa Nöjin, and others gave Tibetan calligraphy its definitive form and disseminated it widely.

In fact, Buddhist tantric texts widely refute the Vedas’ lasting validity. Nevertheless, in this chapter dealing with the common subjects of culture, I accept the view of Shura and other Buddhist masters, and present unchanged what is known in the Vedas’ source texts.
In the past, during [the eon of] perfection, the unlimited life spans of gods and humans decreased slightly and death occurred. The gods then conferred on ways to attain immortality. The textMoonlight of the Words’ Meanings states that naturally occurring sounds Om, Ah, and Ta emerged effortlessly from Brahma’s cheeks; some Vedic texts state that they flowed naturally from his mouth. In any case, it is said that immediately thereafter, the four Vedas arose from his four mouths. As is stated:
Brahma’s central mouth
Spoke The Life Veda;
The other mouths
Spoke the Songs, the Hymns, and the Sacrifices.
Therefore, The Life Veda first emerged from Brahma’s central mouth: thus, knowledge of medicine had naturally come into his mind. The other Vedas appeared successively thereafter. All four are believed to possess three qualities: they are permanent since no one created them; they are self-occurring since no effort contaminated them; and they are valid since they describe everything.

Following [Brahma’s proclamation of the Vedas], when [the gods] sought the nectar [of deathlessness] from the ocean, they used Mandara [Mountain] as a churning rod and [the naga] Vasuki as the rope to turn it. Brahma added the world’s medicines and vital essences to the ocean and churned it vigorously. First, a heap of darkness was produced; Brahma threatened it with [the syllable] Hung so that it merged into the animate and inanimate, becoming what is called poison. Then in succession such riches appeared as [the goddess] Shridévi, the supreme horse, the elephant, the sun, and the moon. When what is called alcohol emerged, those who were too frightened to drink it were known as non-gods [or demi-gods]; those able to drink it, gods. Finally nectar arose, filling eight great vessels.
The demi-gods carried these off, but Vishnu and Indra repossessed them, stealing them back using deception. It is said that because the gods drank the nectar, they became immortal.
The major text One Hundred Thousand Verses on Healing Treatments arose; Brahma taught it to his own son Dasha Prajapati. It was taught and transmitted in succession: Dasha Prajapati taught the gods’ physicians, Ashvini’s twin sons; they taught Indra. He taught Atreya, Dhanvantari, Kanyi Chö, Nemindhara, Gopurarakshita, and Sholdro Kyé. The first of these, Atreya, composed the major text A Summary of Brahma’s Teaching.

The great seers just mentioned taught Agnivesha, Bhela, Jatukarna, Parashara, Ksharapani, and other gods, who composed a variety of generalized and specific texts. This teaching was eventually passed on from those divine seers to a human lineage. Establishing the Essentials of Medicine states:
Brahma taught this Veda of Preserving Life in the higher
realms. Eventually, the King of Kashi taught it to humans.
This text thus teaches that medical treatment first appeared [in this world] in the land of Kashi in India, then gradually spread. A great number of texts were written by many healers, including the holder of an ocean of medical Vedas, Seer Zhung-la Kyékyi-bu, Surya, Chandragarbha, Shalihotra, Agastih, Vasistha, and King Maharishi and Shri Mapayanti, who wrote Diagnosis. The lord of all Vedas, Seer Harichandra, also known as Very Venerable Charaka, composed the medical treatment treatise entitled Charaka. In his family lineage appeared the great physicians Shri Krishna, Lalita, Mukachandra, Ratnakara, and Avatara, who all had the name Shri. Shri Krishna’s son was Brahma; his son was Maheshvara, famed as the greatest scholar under the sun. He composed The Clear Variety of Synonyms.
Further, erudite seers composed many medical treatment texts; it is said that among their great number, the eight best known texts include A Summary of Brahma’s Teaching by Atreya, Specific Treatments by Sushruta, and A Compilation of Essentials by Very Venerable Shri Vardhana.

In our teacher Lord of Shakyas’ first cycle of teachings, in the medicine section of the third volume of The Scripture on Monastic Discipline, he taught just a few remedies, including the use of medicine and anal infusions. His teaching consists primarily of instructions on the four types of medicine permissible for fully ordained individuals. Medicines include broths, which can be kept only during appropriate times [for eating] (i.e., before noon); drinks consisting of fruit juice or yoghurt, which can be kept for one period of time (i.e., one whole day); molasses or clarified butter, which can be kept for a week; and herbal medicines, which can be kept for a lifetime. The text also contains a supplementary general account of the physician Jivakumara.
When the Buddha taught The Sacred Golden Light Discourse, he said that in the past, during the time of Buddha Jeweled Crown’s doctrine, he himself was a merchant’s son Chubep. At that time he questioned his father Jatadhari, who was a great doctor, on how to become learned in the elements. Jatadhari recited nine verses, which begin,
Know three months to be summer,
Three months to be autumn...
The Chinese translation of the longer form of this discourse describes this in a little more detail with the words,
There I studied the illness-healing treatments Of seers of the past...
Thus, this translation has the Buddha’s former father, the merchant Jatadhari, repeat the words according to the tradition of seers.
In The Ocean of Dakas Tantra, [the Buddha] taught extracting the essence with such words as,
Therefore, to aid all beings,
I gathered together the essence of everything...
[This tantra also teaches] the origin of mercury, along with methods for its preparation, with such words as,
In past times, such as the previously occurring
First eon of great bliss...
[The tantra also] includes rough outlines of such subjects as each of the six kinds of flavors, good and bad sources of various herbs and precious substances, and rough descriptions of the formation, manifestation, and subsiding of illnesses during the four seasons, in such words as,
When it is very cold and very cloudy,
And particularly in the pre-monsoon month...
The Wheel of Time Tantra teaches how the body forms with such words as,
Within this body, all mental formations come from eating and
drinking foods of the six flavors...

The same tantra teaches how to take external and internal medicines with such words as,
The salty and sour fully cure ailments of circulating energy.
The sweet and bitter are the enemies of bile...
The same tantra teaches such subjects as protection from smallpox, etc.; methods of healing; extraction of essences; exercises and other means to enable a pregnant woman to give birth easily; and the change of location of the inner spirit, in such words as,
Truly defeating Kandara, the demon that brings the fear of
death...
These teachings concur with the Vedas, such asThe Life Veda and A Treatise on Desire. Further, tantras such asThe Red Slayer of the Lord of Death Tantra teach how to cure minor diseases and give information on many disparate subjects, such as extracting essences.
During the Buddha’s lifetime, there lived Atreya, the court physician of King Padmagarbha of Taxila. His student was Jivakumara, a supreme physician who exceeded human limits; they and others are not known to have written any books on medicine. It seems that some believe a passage inThe Great Treasury of Detailed Exposition that begins, “Four years in the Forest of Medicine...” to refer to [the Buddha] teaching the four medical tantras and other [instructions on medicine] while living there.

After the Victor appeared in our world, the physician Suryapala, who came from a family of horse breeders in west India, composed the text Establishing the Essentials of Medicine. However, since the eight branches [of medicine] are not effectively complete [in this work], knowledge of it does not make one a doctor, just as knowledge of The Kalapa Grammar does not make one a grammarian. A Treasury of Verse states:
A grammarian who knows few tantras,
A physician who knows Establishing the Essentials of Medicine,
And a swordsman who wields a stick—
The world ridicules these three.
The exalted master Nagarjuna composed The Hundred Prescriptions on the basis of the seers’ texts. The “other medical texts” [in the root text] refers to The Discourse on Healing, in Verse; Ava Herb Preparation; The Series of Important Medicines; The Jewel Garland of Mercury Prescriptions; Transmutation into Gold; and Aroma Prescriptions.
In the histories of Translator Ga Namgyal Dorjé’s tradition of Four-Armed Protector, it is taught that the exalted master [Nagarjuna] drew forth Black Slayer of the Lord of Death Tantra, together withThe Knowledge of Healing Tantra and other texts, from the naturally arisen stupa of Dharmabhadramegha’s inner fortress in the land of Ashoka in east India.

Superior to all other medical texts is a treatise in one hundred and twenty chapters entitled The Eight Branches. It contains the essence of all the excellent passages of treatises by Brahma and many seers. Eighteen excellent, virtuous miraculous omens on the three planes of existence accompanied its composition: three marvelous portents appeared in the naga realm below, three in the gods’ realm above, and twelve in the intermediate realm of human beings. The author was known by many appellations, such as Son of Doctor Sanghaguhya, Vase of Medicine, and in honor of his father, Vagbhata. Scholars question whether or not he is identical with Master Shura. Whatever the case, he is renowned, as in this verse,
The lord of wealth is Captain All-Protecting,
The lord of war is Kanishkani,
The goddess of groves is Beautiful Brilliance,
The lord of healing is glorious Vagbhata.
He composed both a commentary and a supplementary text to his own work.
His student, Chandranandana, the ultimate physician Pushpam, came from Kashmir in the family line of Shri Kushala. He composed an extensive commentary, Moonlight of the Words’ Meanings, and The Definitive Use of Terms: A Compilation of the Names of Medicines. According to the illustrious physician Drangti, his lineage is as follows:
Shura, Chandranandana, Gajé Dampa,
Yul-nying Kun-tso, Ring-zhön Ngépar-nyé,
Trim-jom Sogé, Bagen Tsojé Drup,
Tu-chen Tokden, Bunja Tséten,
Upaya Kusala, supreme Janadhana,
The great Translator Rinchen Zangpo, and the successive lineage
from him.
Cherjé Zhangtön Zhikpo presents the lineage differently, with Bagen Tsojé Drup meeting Chandranandana, and so on.

New translations of historical accounts by learned Chinese physicians contain detailed descriptions of how in China, following the end of the age of perfection, emanated kings and officials composed a series of medical texts. Here I will sketch a mere outline of this subject.
The first of the five Dhi Dynasty emperors, Fu Hsi, invented the eight trigram symbols. He also devised the first ideograms by making representations of them with knots in string. He taught his people things they did not know: the causes of illness. Later, Emperor Shen Nung originated medical treatments by investigating the flavors of trees and plants. Later, Emperor Huang Ti lauded the official Kyé Pa [Chi Po?], a master of pulse diagnosis, with the title Divine Doctor; he composed The Discourse on Pulse Diagnosis. Then, as the emperor had commanded, Wui Kung mastered medicine and composed The Twelve Chapter Discourse and extensive writings on blood-letting and moxibustion. Later, the very skilled Divine Doctor Wui Ti composed a twenty-one chapter commentary to that discourse, entitled The Natural Liberation of Doubts.
Two famous physicians, Chung Chung and Hua To, lived during the reign of Emperor Hwan [the Han emperors?]. Many other learned physicians appeared, and major and minor medical texts were written throughout Chinese history. In later times, the fourth Ching Dynasty Emperor Kyen Nong composed a major medical treatise which apparently came into the hands of the great omniscient master [Chökyi Jungné].

During Songtsen Gampo’s reign, Princess Wencheng brought [from China] astrological and medical texts translated by a Chinese monk Mahadéva and by Dharmakosha. Three doctors were invited to Tibet: Bharadhvaja from India, Han Wang Hwang from China, and Galenus from Persia. They translated ’Bu shag ma bu che chung, Miscellaneous Chinese Treatments, A Brief Introduction to Medicine, and other works. The three doctors worked together to produce The Weapon of Fearlessness, known as the text of the three major traditions. From Galenus originated the family lineage of physicians named Dzoro.
During Mé Atsom’s reign, texts on medicine and astrology brought by his Chinese bride, Princess Kimsheng, were translated by a Chinese monk Mahakyinda, Kyungpo Tsitsi, Do-tsuk Jatruk Garken, Chola Mönbar, and others. The skilled physician Viji Champa Shilaha was summoned from Persia and was honored as “Divine Doctor.” He composed such works as an extensive cycle calledThree Mothers, Fourteen Sons, and Four Exceptional Secret Sons; a medium-length cycle of The Purple Collection: A Quintessential Drop; and a brief cycle, The Small Red Notebook. He translated various Chinese texts. It is also known that he wrote many other works, and there originated a family line of physicians named Viji. Many skilled physicians, such as the Chinese monk Mahakyinda and Kyungpo Tsitsi, worked together and extracted the essential meaning of the new medical translations to compose a major text entitledSomaraja.
All these earlier and later books were gathered together and placed in a brocade container, and became a collection known as Discourses on Healing, Texts Concerning the Treatment of the Life Essence.

When Buddhist King Trisong Déutsen’s rule began, three great physicians known as the three emanated sons met in Tibet: Dharmaraja from India, Mahakyinda from China, and Viji Champa Shilaha from Ferghana or Persia. They worked together to compose a major text, a medical treatise that conforms with their kingdoms’ traditions; its root text was entitled A Cluster of Jewels; its commentary, Wheels of the Sun and Moon. When Champa Shilaha was about to return to his homeland, he gave his son a cycle of instructions entitled The Yellow Manuscript of Miji. Since it was offered to the king, it is also called Blazing Radiance: The King’s Master Copy.
The Chinese monk Mahatseta translated A Compendium of the King, Offi cials, and Subjects, comprising a root text, The Five Treasuries of Jewels, and a branch work, The Great and Medium Treasures. The commentary on its general meaning constitutes outer advice to the subjects; inner advice to officials; and secret advice to the king, accompanied by methods to dispel obstacles.
The account of nine royal physicians from Tibet’s four frontiers coming to Tibet during the last part of the king’s life lacks substance. What occurred is that a beloved horse of the king fell ill, so that the king ordered, “Find and bring me nine physicians who are skilled healers.” Thus, five [physicians] were brought to Tibet and cured the horse: Trugu Ze’uto from China, Khulö Muken of Zhang Zhung, Mugen Trizik of Mongolia, Choro Mangpozi of Tibet, and Tana Chukyé of Azha. At the king’s command, these five masters composed a text uniting the essential medical instructions of all five kingdoms. This was offered to the king and its tradition was thereby established.
Towards the end of Trisong Déutsen’s life, an illness struck him. Once again, physicians were summoned from the kingdom’s four frontiers. However, except for Tongsum Gangwa from China, no others came. While on his journey, he composed White Healing: The Torch of the Path, which he presented to the king as a gift, and cured him of his illness. As one man had accomplished the task [given to doctors] of the four frontiers, he was given the name Tongsum Gangwa of the Four Frontiers (“Filling the Cosmos’ Four Frontiers”). His lineage was passed on through Sacha Jaga of Yertö; members of that line became [known as] doctors of the four frontiers.

Learned and wise scholars refute what is asserted by others who quote as reliable some treasure texts’ accounts, such as “The great translator Bérotsana translated a mixture of Buddhist and Bön medicine and astrologies,” and that many accessible Tibetan texts were Bérotsana’s translations from Indian texts. Likewise, accounts that the “nine master physicians of Tibet” lived during the reign of the Buddhist kings are also very mistaken, since these physicians lived mostly at the time of Buddhism’s later spread. It is the three mentioned above—Dzoro, Viji, and the four frontier doctors—who belong without mistake to lineages of the Buddhist kings’ royal physicians.

During the period of Buddhism’s later spread in Tibet, during the early life of the ordained King Yeshe Ö, there were many (such as Translator Nyéwor Yikgi Rinchen) who translated and transmitted earlier and later Indian texts, includingThe Condensed Essence of the Eight Branches with its autocommentary, and Establishing the Essentials of Medicine. The chief figure, however, was the sublime being Rinchen Zangpo, who offered a hundred measures of gold [one sang measure equals two troy ounces] to the Kashmiri Scholar Janardhana and studied The Condensed Essence of the Eight Branches with him. Rinchen Zangpo had many students whose translations and teachings transmitted such texts as Moonlight of the Words’ Meanings, Horse Treatments, and Shalihotra. Principal among these students were those known as the four Pu-hrong physicians: Nyangdé Sengé Dra, Shaktri Yeshé Jungné, Ong-men Alé, and Mang-lo Mentsun. Among them, Mang-lo Men-tsun was the most skilled and had the greatest impact: most physicians of central and western Tibet sought him out. In particular, he taught the complete texts and commentaries to Cherjé Tipa.
The fourth successor in [Cherjé Tipa’s] family lineage was Cherjé Zhangtön Zhikpo, who wrote medical overviews, text outlines, instruction collections, commentaries, practical instructions, etc. Among his students, Darma Gönpo of upper Tsang wrote The Grasped Quintessence and The Innermost Quintessence. The lineage continued through the Bodong tradition.
Another student of the great Translator Rinchen Zangpo was Zhang Zhung Sherab Ö, who taught Gyatön Drakpa Sherab. He taught Yutok Gyagar Dorjé, who clarified medical writings. The lineage continued through Yutok Jipo and Yutok Kyungpo to Yutok Yönten Gönpo. Another lineage passed from Zhang Zhung Sherab Ö to Dok-jang Men, Yungdrung Ö, and Yutok Drak-sé to Yutok Yönten Gönpo.
In brief, it is due to the great Translator Rinchen Zangpo’s kindness that Tibetan physicians, “those able to help others,” first proliferated.

They all followed the transmission of the great Translator Rinchen Zangpo’s teachings. The earlier and later writings composed by these and other skilled Tibetan physicians are beyond enumeration.

They became skilled physicians through studying The Eight Branches; Zhangtön Ziji Barwa composed such texts as Stainless Brilliance and a commentary, The Moon’s Radiance. His five students produced an uninterrupted lineage of skilled physicians. Tötön Könchok Kyab composed The Jewel Garland of the Summary of Treatments and Notes to the Main Text. He taught this to Yutok Yönten Gönpo, and his activity thus flourished.

The transmission of every teaching system of The Eight Branches converged in Yutok Yönten Gönpo. Outwardly, he was an outstanding scholar who mastered the fivefields of Buddhist culture; inwardly, he was an outstanding vajra holder dwelling on awakening’s exalted stages; and secretly, he was Transcendent Conqueror Medicine Buddha incarnate in a physician’s form to guide the beings of Tibet. Even on a merely apparent level, he traveled with miraculous powers throughout the Land of Jambu; in particular, he journeyed to India six times. Oddiyana’s principal dakini, Shrimala, entrusted him with her secret trove of instructions, including The Eight Branches and The Tantra of Black Tresses. He also directly met [in visions] many gods and great human seers, who granted him their instructions for medical treatments. He extracted the pith instructions in medicine from all lands of Jambu and its islands, including Sri Lanka, and he received the essence of learned, accomplished masters’ profound instructions.
During his early life, he composed A Synthesis of the Eight Branches’ Essence and a commentary to its first chapter. During the latter part of his life, he manifested inconceivable miracles in turning the wheel of the teachings, composing The Essence of Nectar: The Four Great Tantras of the Eight Branches’ Secret Pith Instructions, a synthesis of the meaning of all medical texts. He also wrote A Vase of Nectar: A Short Medical Tantra, together with some [ancillary] texts. He taught common students medical treatments; and in particular, for Sumtön Yeshé Zung, his disciple with supreme good fortune, he turned the wheel of The Secret Heart Essence teachings. He sealed his instruction on The Four Medical Tantras and The Secret Heart Essence for twelve years, and finally, without leaving his body behind, he departed to Medicine Buddha’s pure realm.

On the subject of The Four Medical Tantras, different beliefs have arisen, such as belief that they belong to either the canon or the treatises, that they are both, or that they constitute a treatise. Nevertheless, such masters as Lord Tenpé Nyinjé and his spiritual heirs consider that externally The Four Medical Tantras are the Victor’s canon; internally, they constitute a treasure transmission; and secretly, they are the words of Yutok Yönten Gönpo himself. This belief is correct. The first is proved by scriptures, as inThe Concise Discourse on the Perfection of Sublime Insight, which states,
Whatever doctrine the Victor’s pious attendants teach... , etc.
The Highest Continuity states:
The one who [teaches] solely the Victor’s teaching... , etc.
It is also [proven by the fact] that nothing else has appeared in this land of snow mountains [Tibet] to equal the textual tradition of the glorious Four Medical Tantras, which are self-contained and can benefit every individual, high or low.
The second [statement that The Four Medical Tantras constitute a treasure transmission is true] because Drapa Ngönshé discovered just the root text [of The Four Medical Tantras] concealed as a treasure by Bérotsana; he entrusted it to Yutok Yönten Gönpo. This does not contradict [the above statement], but shows the connection [between the early tantras and treasure tradition].
The third [statement that The Four Medical Tantras are Yutok’s own words is proven] by the fact that this is directly stated in Leading to Certainty, the history of The Heart Essence. Not only that, examination of The Four Medical Tantras proves this to be correct.

Throughout the early, middle, and later parts of Yutok Yönten Gönpo’s life, a nest of physicians overflowed: like the stars of the heavens and particles of earth, lineage holders beyond number and measure appeared. Chiefly, eleven doctors, including Dzamen Lebpo and Jang-men Palé, were the most famous. Among them, Sum-tön Yeshé Zung received the entirety of all [Yutok’s] instructions and was the designated heir of The Four Medical Tantras, The Secret Heart Essence, and ancillary texts. Yutok Bümseng, Viji Lekden Gönpo, Drangti Palden Tsojé, and many others in earlier and later times composed commentaries to The Four Medical Tantras.
In particular, in later times, the father Jangpa Rikden Chenpo Namgyal Drak-zang, and his sons Mi’i Nyima, Lhatsun Tashi Palzang, and Sönam Yeshé Gyaltsen composed many commentaries to the medical tantras, medical overviews, and supplementary texts; they thereby established what is known as the Jang tradition.
Zurkar Kuwo Nyam-nyi Dorjé received direct authorization from Yutok Yönten Gönpo and then composed many medical texts, including a revised edition of The Four Medical Tantras, a supplementary practice of the spiritual master, and Ten Million Relics. Among his many disciples, such as the eight blessed ones, a transmission arose with four perfect characteristics in the field of medicine: pith instructions, activity, practical instructions, and teaching. It produced many skilled doctors who wrote extensively, including Kongmé Kyenpa Lata Tséwang, Tsomé Kenchen, and Jarpo Penchen. In particular, the uncle [presumably Zurkar Kuwo Nyam-nyi Dorjé] lord of the teachings’ nephew, Zurkar Lodrö Gyalpo (also known as Karma Lekshé Tsol), followed Lord Mikyö Dorjé’s prophetic advice and taught and spread medicine’s textual tradition with great enthusiasm. He wrote many books, such as The Testament of Our Ancestors. This transmission is known as the Zurkar tradition.
Among the holders of the Jang and Zurkar historical systems that continued without interruption, the most famous in later times was Dési Sangyé Gyatso, who followed primarily the Jang system. He wrote Blue Beryl: The Medical Tantra Commentary; a supplementary text, The Sword That Severs the Noose of Premature Death; and other texts, which are still widely used. He also founded a medical school.

Further, all-seeing Chökyi Jungné became an exceptionally skilled physician, his mastery of medicine overflowing as though his training in previous lifetimes had reawakened. From Pön-tsang Yeshé of the later Zurkar’s lineage of training, the doctor Étrosé of Malava in west India, and skilled doctors from China, he received teaching transmissions and came to definitive conclusions based on his questions concerning diffi cult points. He attained the state of a second Medicine Buddha. He had many skilled students, and their transmission of teaching and practical instructions continues unimpaired to the present day, so that the holders of this lineage are widely renowned to be superior to all other physicians.
In brief, by elucidating medical knowledge, master physicians such as these cared for the entire land of Tibet.

Nga-bong, Garga, and other seers created a system of astrology based on the planets’ and constellations’ movements. It describes frameworks of time and predicts positive and negative results. Among non-Buddhists, there were many proponents of their treatises. Nevertheless, during the time when the ninth lineage-bearing monarch [of Shambhala], Gyatso Namgyal Sengé, assumed the throne, in the region of Mecca to the west of India, the Muslims’ seventh teacher Mohammed the Dark One concealed esoteric astrology and taught [a simplified] practical astrology that resulted in the planets, stars, etc., no longer being understood. The lineage-bearer Gyalka then established the basis of astrology by making the explicit teaching of the summarized Wheel of Time Tantra into an applicable practical astrology.
Later, in the Fire Hare year [1027], when The Wheel of Time became known throughout India, and both non-Buddhist [simplified] practical astrology and esoteric astrology had declined as that tantra foretold, its pure astrological system began. [The years] from the emergence of the Muslims [624] until this point [1027] are collectively known as the “fire space ocean years.”8 That specific Fire Hare year [1027] should be known as the starting point of the first sixty-year cycle.

Our teacher’s teachings in the discourses include what is known as “particle calculation” inThe Flower Ornament Discourse, and various instructions in The Vast Enjoyment Discourse concerning the knowledge of numbers and astrological calculation, beginning with his demonstration [as a young man] of training in calculation. Further, in most tantras (primarily An Ocean of Dakas Supreme Bliss Tantra) and in particular The Glorious Wheel of Time Tantra’s worldly realms chapter, his clear presentation provides a basis for learned masters to devise various methods for practical astrological applications.
In Tibet, omniscient Butön Rinchen Drup and all-knowing Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen elucidated in detail the three aspects of the Wheel of Time: outer, inner, and alternative. Butön wrote the astrological treatise The Joy of the Learned and its branch texts; Dolpopa, The Mother and Child Application of the Summary of the Five. In particular, the second
8. The “fire space ocean years”: fire represents 3, space 0, and ocean 4; reversed, this produces 403, the numbers of the years from 624–1026, inclusive.
Victor, Venerable Rangjung Dorjé, extracted the meaning of the words of The Concise Tantra of the Wheel of Time’s chapter on the worldly realms, making it easy to understand and accessible in lines of seven syllables. He also added some requisite astrologies not refuted by the tantras and composed a text entitled A Compilation of All Astrology. These were the first Tibetan astrological texts.

Later [in 1447], Kéwang Norzang Gyatso and Pukpa Lhundrup Gyatso composed the mother and child Precepts of Pundarika, spread by Samgyalwa and others, creating what is known as the Pukpa tradition. The great lineage bearer of Jang correctly elucidated another system using his own analysis of The Wheel of Time Tantra. Jamyang Chenpo Döndrup Özer from Tsurpu [Monastery], a follower of the Victor Rangjung Dorjé’s astrological system, composed a major astrological text. Trinlépa Choklé Namgyal and the illustrious Tsuklak Trengwa both composed major commentaries to A Compilation of All Astrology. This formed what is known as the Tsurpu tradition.
From these [initial] transmissions, masters such as Dési Sangyé Gyatso (who composed White Beryl) and Minling Lochen Dharmashri (who composed The Sun’s Illumination) further developed in later times the Pukpa tradition of applied astrology. The greatly learned Lord Ön Ngélek Tenzin (who composed The Excellent Vase of Requisites) and other authors further developed the Tsurpu tradition of applied astrology. In this way two distinct traditions of astrology have developed [in Tibet].

For those attracted to Hinduism, Transcendent Conqueror Lord of the World manifested in the form of the great god Ishvara. In previous times, during a war between the gods and demi-gods, he taught in answer to Indra’s questioning; later he spoke in a dialogue with his consort Uma. These teachings became The Glorious Tantra of Complete Victory in War.
Karma Siddha Utpala first transmitted this tantra in the human world. Dzumlang Scholar Jayananda and Translator Lowo Sherab Rinchen translated it into Tibetan. Texts such as Elucidating Hidden Pith Instructions and An Ocean of Jewels also appeared. The first Tibetan commentary to this tantra was Supreme Delight by Pukpa Lhundrup Gyatso. In that master’s family lineage through nephews, glorious Lord Trinlépa’s disciple Durampa Chimé Déwa wrote The Jewel Garland of Practice, also known asThe Hundred Light Rays. Pékar Yi-zhin Wangpo wrote The Wonderful Adorning Flame. Bodong Yönten Lodrö wrote a root text, The Concise Essence, and its commentary. Many such writings appeared, yet due to the fact that the vital pith instructions were kept very secret from the beginning, [this teaching] strayed into fabricated theory. These days, it exists in Tibet in name only, whereas it seems prevalent, together with its pith instructions, among Hindus in India and Nepal.

Element calculation, or what is known as “Chinese astrology,” originated in China. The first Chinese emperor, Fu Hsi of the Dhi Dynasty, was given a gold-colored turtle by one of his subjects from the far ocean’s shore. Gazing upon and examining it, the eight trigram symbols dawned in his mind for the first time. Based on them, he created the astrology of hexagrams, [the nine] astrological numbers, and the year cycles. Successive emanated learned emperors and officials composed texts; in particular, Kong Pu Tsi (an emanation of Gentle Melody, known in Tibet as the Emanated Emperor Kong-tsé) established a system with countless texts of astrology and practices to avert misfortune. Very many texts appeared later.
Here in Tibet, this system was first introduced with Chinese astrology texts brought by the earlier and later Chinese princesses [who married Tibetan kings]. During Buddhism’s later spread, Translator Khampa Tramo, Scholar Krishnachandra, Kyung-nak Shakya Dargyé, and others translated and taught many texts, such as The Illuminating Torch. Kyungnak Shakya Dargyé and others discovered many element calculation treasure texts and founded a great and famous system. Nevertheless, the early translations, including the later Chinese bride’s translation of cycles of astrological application and other works, were extremely adulterated. Due to the feeble merit of Tibetans and the deviousness of the Chinese (who concealed the most essential cycles of astrological application), astrology was taken to be what it was not, pride was taken in personal fabrications as though they were gold, and the teaching became meaningless chatter with many leaves but no essential fruit. Consequently, no texts existed that corresponded with the Chinese originals.
Later, the omniscient lord of the teachings Dharmakara [Chökyi Jungné] made new, definitely reliable translations of Chinese astrology based on the primary cause of his recollection of previous lifetimes, and the favorable conditions of the monasteries of Nan Chao, with their traditions of learned masters such as Yuan Wan Ling. In these new translations, many subjects appear in the textual cycle entitled The Magical Mirror of Existence, such as geomancy; life span calculations; calculations of times for funerals, for marriages, and for avoiding misfortune; and calculations of helpful results.

Proponents of Hindu tenets wrote the most famous poetic treatises of literary embellishment. It is said that in the past, when the life span of beings was twenty thousand years, Seer Vyasa composed the famous treatise The Bharata, a text with over a hundred thousand verses; Ganesh served as his scribe. Seers wrote many treatises it is said, such as The Qualities of Meditation and Poetics by Agnivesha’s daughter, Ramanaya by Valmiki, Ashtadashapura by Markendeya, and Raghuvamsha by Ramashrama, yet these were not translated into Tibetan. Many well-known texts appeared in later times, as illustrated by the treatises of Kalidasa, including The Eight Messengers (Cloud Messenger, etc.), and his Kumarasambhava.
One text gathered the best aspects of all the earlier texts—the treatise of literary embellishment, The Mirror of Poetics, written by the outwardly Hindu master Dandi (“who carried a cane”), who was learned in both Hindu and Buddhist philosophy. Many Hindu and Buddhist commentaries were made to this text in India. In later times, Indian copies of the major commentaries by Ratnashri and Vakishvarakirti came into the possession of Lord Dharmakara.
In earlier and later times there have been many Tibetan commentaries [to The Mirror of Poetics], such as those by Translator Pang Loten, Jamyang Kaché, grammarian Sanghashri, Rinpung-pa, and the Tibetan scholar Mipam Namgyal. Superior to them all is Eloquent Playful Sea of Speech, the speech of the great all-knowing master, the precious Khampa, Tenzin Chökyi Nyima.

The study of metrical composition teaches how to write well in metrical verse. Seer Valmiki first taught it, it is said. A naga wrote a prastara9 in the sand of a beach when a garuda came to eat him. The naga said, “Do not eat me until you have memorized this.” The garuda did so, and understood its meaning. He realized that the naga had become his teacher, asked for forgiveness, and took the naga wherever he wished. The naga is
9. Prastara (“spread out”): a representation of all the possible combinations of a certain number of short and long syllables in meter.
known as Naga King Shesa or Orange Seer. To [Valmiki’s] text, Jinadeva wrote a commentary and spread its teaching, but his writing was devoid of eight qualities:
Verse [should have] these eight qualities:
It is concise and in clear meter,
It should be a discourse and contain metaphors,
It should have a distinct progression, be easy to recite, have
pauses, and be organized.
The text which makes this distinction and has six wonderful applications [of metric composition] is the root text The Source of Jewels Metrical Composition and its commentary, composed by the all-knowing master of the age conflict, Ratnakarashanti. Master Shri Jnana wrote Metaphors. Among Tibetan works, there exist many commentaries and texts on metaphor, such as those by the eighth Lord [Karmapa Mikyö Dorjé] and the great translator of Minling Monastery, Dharmashri. In later times, a commentary written by Jamgön Lama Gyurmé Tenzin Pelgyé is clear and excellent. Further, Muni Krishnamishra composed a root text, Metrical Composition That Satisfies on Being Heard, and its commentary, a previously unknown [Indian] textual tradition newly translated by all-knowing Tenpé Nyinjé.

Many treatises on lexicography existed in India, such as Medinikara, Pandit Shri Dharasena’s Elucidating a Variety of Points, Haravali, and The Composition of Rudra Kapyari. The best, however, is The Treasury of Immortality, composed by great Master Amarasingha, whom Tara taught. In India, two commentaries to his work were composed following Panini’s grammatical system: The Nectar of Explanation and The Moon of Words. Indian copies of these came into the hands of the all-knowing lord [Dharmakara]. Subhutichandra’s commentary Fulfillment of Desire applied Chandragomi’s grammatical system. Some other commentaries exist, but it is this latter work, Fulfillment of Desire, that Translator Yar, Zhalu Chökyong Zangpo, and others translated inexactly. Therefore, the all-knowing lord revised the root text’s translation and made an entirely new translation of the commentary. His translation is entitled The Key That Opens a Hundred Doors: A Commentary to the Treasury of the Gathering of Words and Meanings.
The above has been a complete listing of the texts of the first four of the minor fields of Buddhist culture.
Since theater was not useful in Tibet, its treatises were not translated. However, earlier Tibetans included within this field Master Chandragomi’s The Play That Delights the Whole World and Shri Harshadéva’s The Play That Delights All Nagas.

The minor fields of knowledge of poetry, [metrical composition, and lexicography] did not exist in Tibet before Sakya Pandit. Thinking that their subjects were too difficult for Tibetans to understand, he wrote three treatises that encapsulated the content found in the Indian texts: The Gateway to Scholarship, concerned with poetics; A Bouquet of Flowers, on metrical composition; and A Treasury of Words, on lexicography.
Indian texts on poetry, etc., were first translated by Translator Shong Dorjé Gyaltsen and Translator Pang Loten. These [translations] were the result of the kindness of Drogön Chögyal Pakpa, who ordered the work from Pandit Lakshmikara and Translator Shong, and provided them with conducive circumstances.
In later times, the teaching transmissions declined and intelligence and diligence weakened, thus very few persons understood these subjects accurately. It was all-knowing Tenpé Nyinjé alone who, directly and through his disciples, elucidated all ten fields of Buddhist culture, and grammar and medicine in particular.

These fields of culture do not actually belong within the teachings’ three cycles. The principal activity through which the Buddhas establish their disciples in freedom and omniscience is the sequential teaching of the three ways and the four tantras. They turn the amazing, exceptional wheel of teachings that do not share [the values of] worldly individuals, and they do not emphasize worldly treatises in their doctrine. Therefore, the victors taught none of the basic texts of these fields of culture. Nevertheless, there is not the slightest thing the buddhas do not see or know; therefore, when the time has come to train a being through one of these fields of culture, they do so by giving a teaching (describing the subject’s causes, examples, nature, and semantics), the meaning of which no one else would be capable of knowing. This is a special quality of a Buddha.
Since most of the Buddha’s excellent speech exists in Sanskrit, one should have a good knowledge of Sanskrit grammar to understand it without error. Likewise, understanding these branches of culture is indispensable. Therefore, the learned have greatly elaborated upon them.

In the fifth of the major countries, Shambhala to the north, Lord of Secrets King Suchandra collected all tantras in general, and in particular he composed a sixty-thousand-verse major commentary to The Root Tantra of the Wheel of Time. He gave empowerments and taught the tantra to the fortunate inhabitants of ninety-six million towns and villages. In Malaya Park, to the south of the city of Kalapa, he constructed a great sacred circle comprising all aspects of the Wheel of Time’s wisdom body, speech, and mind. At the enthronement of his son Devendrasingha, Suchandra empowered him to present the teachings. Bodhisattva Vajra Essence composed a commentary to the Vajra of Delight [tantra] and taught it to the princes. Devendrasingha taught The Root Tantra of the Wheel of Time for a hundred years and empowered [his son] Prabhava.
This succession continued in the same way until the seventh Buddhist king. Then came one renowned as an emanation of Manjushri, [named Manjushrikirti]. He made the four families into one definitive supreme secret vajra family. He granted empowerment to all of Shambhala’s inhabitants (including three and a half million brahmin seers, such as the seer Suryarata) in a single sacred circle, and he taught them the tantra. From that time, the kings were known as lineage bearers. Upon Suryarata’s request, Manjushrikirti compiled The Concise Tantra of the Wheel of Time from The Root Tantra of the Wheel of Time.
Subsequently, the lineage-bearing monarch Pundarika composed such texts as The Stainless Light Commentary to the Concise Tantra of the Wheel of Time, an extensive commentary to The Concise Tantra of the Wheel of Time; and Familiarization with the Ultimate. Then, successive lineage bearers, each reigning on the vajra throne for a definite period of one hundred years, continuously turn the wheel of the doctrine of the unsurpassable way, beginning with the definitive secrets of glorious Wheel of Time. The gold-turbaned rulers of [Shambhala’s] ninety-six provinces and their inhabitants thus possess the good fortune of practicing the great way’s secret mantra teachings.

One hundred and ten years after our teacher’s transcendence of sorrow, Emperor Ming-ti of the Han dynasty reigned in greater China. In the past, the [fourth] Chou [emperor] Chao Wang had a dream omen inscribed on a stone column. As predicted, pandits Tara and Jvala from India, who had perceived the truth, brought upon a white horse fifty-two texts from the lesser way collection and a painting of Shakyamuni made by Udayana. They introduced the doctrine, building the first temple, named Saiwai Si. The two pandits attained the state of arhat, and subdued the elements. Many persons renounced home life in faith, and the monastic community spread widely.
In later times, Scholar Kumara was invited to China, and he further spread the doctrine. During the Tang Dynasty, Tang Hsuan Tsang became a disciple of Master Vasubandhu and translated countless teachings of the lesser and great ways. It is said that before him, there had been two hundred Chinese translators with the ability to translate the teachings. Since they had translated numerous scriptures, the doctrine became widely propagated and many arhats appeared.
Between the ascension of the Minyak [Hsi Hsia] and Mongolian [Yuan] dynasties, there were many generations of [Han] Chinese emperors. During that time, and up to the present, the doctrine continues to exist in China. The Hsi Hsia Emperor Tai Hu sent an invitation to the Lord of the Teachings, [the first Karmapa] Dusum Kyenpa, who did not travel himself [to China], but sent Tsang Powa, from whom the ruler received religious instruction.
In Mongolia, during the reign of Emperor Ghenghis Khan, Tsangwa Dungkur-wa (a disciple of Zhang Tsalpa Tsöndru Drakpa) traveled to Mongolia and merely encouraged the development of faith [in Buddhism] among the shamans. Later, Minyak was taken over by the Mongols. Subsequently, Emperor Godan extended an invitation to Sakya Pandit. Following that, the precious lord of the teachings Chögyal Pakpa elucidated the doctrine by giving empowerments, and so on, to Prince Kublai Khan. Also, Mogor Khan extended an invitation to Karma Pakshi. In this and other ways, Tibet’s doctrines came to receive all manner of patronage.

During the later Chinese empire, Emperor Tai Ju [Hung Wu?] of the Ming dynasty invited Virupa and the sixteen elders to his court, and Tai Ming Yunglo invited lord of the teachings [the fifth Karmapa] Dézhin Shekpa. Thus, there appeared only emperors who, through their veneration, became patrons of Buddhism. During this present Ching dynasty [Kongtrul wrote this in 1862–1864], Emperor Shin Tsi invited all-knowing Ngawang Lozang Gyatso [the fifth Dalai Lama, to the Chinese court]. Thus, Buddhism continues to be venerated and patronized in the present day.
Nevertheless, although Chögyal Pakpa granted Emperor Kublai Khan empowerment within the sacred circle of Vajra of Delight, and Dézhin Shekpa granted the Tai Ming emperor [Yunglo] the empowerment and instructions of Great Compassion Ocean of Victors, and it was possible that one or two fortunate individuals practiced secret mantra, it seems that the secret mantra doctrine did not spread to everyone as it has in Tibet. Accordingly, the Chinese collection of the Buddha’s excellent speech does not contain the main tantras of the secret mantra way, apart from a few minor long mantras from action tantras. As such, among the discourses, primarily those of the great way spread, and among those, principally the discourses of the last cycle of teachings. Concerning the collection on monastic discipline, it is known that for the most part, the majority order begun by noble Kashyapa is practiced. Various Tibetan traditions have spread in China: most significantly, the Sakyapas were venerated during the Mongolian [Yuan] dynasty; the Karma Kagyu, during the reign of the Mongols, Lamin, and Tai Ming; and, since the time of the Ta Chin Dynasty, only the Gélukpa.

Khotan [Li, in Tibetan], one of the six lands [of Jambu], borders Tibet and China. There, the queen of Ashoka, the Buddhist king of India, had a son named Vasanu, who took control of the land. A long time thereafter, during King Vijaya Sambhava’s reign, the monk Vairochana and others spread the doctrine, and many stupas and temples were built. Later, during King Vijaya Virya’s reign, four arhats came from India who identified the stupa of Buddha Kashyapa and built the Ghéu-dohan temple.
Thus, many pious attendant arhats and bodhisattvas traveled [to this country], converted disciples, and so spread both the lesser and great way doctrines. This country filled with temples and monastic communities, yet it is said that now the genuine teachings are not present there, merely the empty image of their reflection. This country is also considered by some to be the land called Jang.

The island known as Dravida is situated in the ocean directly south of India. The great master Padmakara went there and subdued malevolent tramenma [human-form demons] and bound them under oath three times. Finally, he also converted the humans and built three temples named Vidha, Ardha, and Sudhu. A few masters of the collections of the Buddha’s teachings were invited from India. The master himself taught the tantras to six fortunate disciples, who attained states of sublime accomplishment. It is said the master remained there for twelve years, finally leaving for the island of ogres.
Afterwards, Dipamkarabhadra also went to Dravida. From that time, for one hundred years, many vajra holders from Magadha, Oddiyana, Kashmir, etc., visited and caused the secret mantra way to markedly flourish. Many tantras previously concealed at the time of King Dharmapala and no longer extant in India, or which had been brought from Oddiyana and do not exist in India, can still be found there.
It is taught that even now the teaching of the four classes of secret mantra tantras are widespread there in a genuine form as in earlier times, and there are also a few scriptural traditions of monastic discipline, observed phenomena, and the perfection of sublime insight.

The Victor’s doctrine also appeared in early times on the islands of Sri Lanka, Dhanashri, Payigu, Tamra, and Java; “others” includes Sumatra. In Sri Lanka, various kinds of teachings of the great way [reached the country, but it maintains] primarily the pious attendants’ teachings. The great way exists a little in Dhanashri and Payigu. In all the other lands I’ve mentioned, only the pious attendants’ lesser way spread widely and continues to exist without decline to the present.
