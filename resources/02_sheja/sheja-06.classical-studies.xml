In order that persons who have become well grounded in the higher ethical disciplines that form the basis of all those virtuous teachings [discussed in Book Five] might understand without error the spiritual paths that lead to freedom [from cyclic existence] and to omniscience (sarvajñatā, thams cad mkhyen pa), it will be necessary to investigate the discriminative awareness that arises through studying the [various] fields of knowledge, which are as vast as an ocean in their extent.

Therefore, this sixth book [of The Treasury of Knowledge], which is a graduated exposition of the [fields of classical learning], is divided into the following four parts:
(1) a systematic presentation of the ordinary classical sciences and mundane spiritual paths;
(2) a systematic presentation of phenomenological structures common to both the Greater Vehicle and the Lesser Vehicle;
(3) a systematic presentation of the vehicles that emphasize causal characteristics;
(4) a systematic presentation of the vehicles that emphasize the [fruitional] indestructible reality according to the way of secret mantra.[5]

In addition to maintaining a foundation in pure ethical discipline,[6] the study of all the fields of knowledge in general, and particularly of the multiple approaches of the sūtras and the way of [secret] mantra, which expound the sacred teachings [of Buddhism], is the basis of all enlightened attributes.[7] It is said in the Scriptural Compilation of the Bodhisattvas:
Through study, all things are known.
Through study, negative actions are reversed.
Through study, pointless pursuits are abandoned.
Through study, nirvana is attained.
These four steps are explained sequentially in the Rational System of Exposition. That is to say, it is through knowledge of non-Buddhist and Buddhist philosophical and spiritual systems that one will come to discern those things that should be adopted and those things that should be renounced. Then, after one has studied the training of ethical discipline, negative actions will be reversed. After studying the training of the mind [through meditation], pointless desires will be completely abandoned; and after studying the training of discriminative awareness, the state of nirvana that is actually free from corruption will be attained.[8]
In the transmission [entitled] Analysis [of Monastic Discipline], it is said that an erudite person has five advantages;[9] and elsewhere, it is said in various sūtras and treatises that the enlightened attributes of erudition are limitless.[10] It is for this reason that, at the outset, studies should be thoroughly pursued in an impartial manner.

Whenever bodhisattvas who are in pursuit of the sacred teachings engage in any investigation, it is actually the knowledge of the scriptural compilations (pitaka, sde snod), the treatises (śāstra, bstan bcos), the mundane fine arts (śilpa, bzo), and the status of past actions (karma, las) that they are investigating.
The “scriptural compilation” [of the Buddhist canon] includes the scriptures of the bodhisattvas and the scriptures of the pious attendants.[12] Among the so-called twelve branches of the scriptures, the category of extensive teachings (mahāvaipulya) is said to comprise the former, while the remaining eleven branches comprise the scriptures of the pious attendants.[13] Together, these form the [canonical] subject matter of the Buddhist treatises or Buddhist studies.
“Treatises,” when abbreviated in this context, comprise three categories, namely, commentaries on logic, grammar, and medicine;[14] but these may also be designated as non-Buddhist on account of their allegiance to two [or more] teachers [and not only Śākyamuni].[15]
Third, as for the “arts,” the commentaries on the thirty designated arts (bzor btags pa sum cu)[16] and so forth are established as fields of mundane science, and for this reason are not [formally] categorized as treatises.
When [bodhisattvas] investigate [the sciences] accordingly, those who know that seeds are conducive to their [appropriate] fruits should conduct their research, aided by humility that never slackens and perseverance that is never interrupted, until the objective of their studies is conclusively comprehended. If you ask why they should conduct their investigations in this way, it says in the Sūtra of the Ascertainment of the Characteristics of Phenomena:[17]
Mañjusśrī! One who knows the essence and defining characteristics of all teachings attains genuine analytic knowledge of their meaning. One who knows their various distinctions and their systematic presentations attains the genuine analytic knowledge of intellectual brilliance. One who knows the range of various synonyms attains the genuine analytic knowledge of the teaching.
One who knows etymological definitions attains the genuine analytic knowledge of etymological definition.[18] Therefore, Mañjusśrī, if one strives after omniscience, one should initially cultivate the discriminative awareness that arises from study and reflection.[19] This is because she is the mother of all the buddhas!

Also it is said in the Discourse on Designations:[20]
The genuine analytic knowledge of the teaching will be attained through scholarship with regard to names, [syntactically bound] phrases, and syllables. The genuine analytic knowledge of meaning will be attained through scholarship with regard to their meaning.
The genuine analytic knowledge of etymological definition will be attained through scholarship with regard to words and designations. The genuine analytic knowledge of intellectual brilliance will be attained through unimpeded mastery of all these topics, and so forth.
The explanation given in the Commentary on the Treasury of Phenomenology is in conformity with these citations.[21]

The Sutra of [Great] Skillful Means Repaying [the Buddha] with Gratitude, in particular, refers extensively to the necessity of learning the five classical sciences. The following summary, derived from that work, is relevant in the context of bodhisattvas who investigate the empirical teachings:[22]
In this regard, if you ask why bodhisattvas continue to pursue these studies, bodhisattvas continue to investigate thoroughly the teachings of the Buddha because they are obliged to master earnestly and authentically all doctrines that are in conformity with the sacred teaching and because they impart those doctrines extensively and authentically to others.
Bodhisattvas continue to investigate the science of logic because they have to thoroughly and qualitatively understand the eloquence and solecism found in the treatises themselves, because they are obliged to refute the critiques of others, because they have to convince those lacking faith in this teaching [of Buddhism], and because they have to reinvigorate those who already have faith.
Bodhisattvas continue to investigate the science of grammar because, while constructing refined Sanskrit syntax with fine words or syllables and an elegant use of etymological definitions, they inspire confidence in those wishing them to speak, and because they have to employ terminology in conformity with diverse etymological nuances, even though their meaning may be identical.
Bodhisattvas continue to investigate the science of medicine because they are obliged to alleviate the various ailments that afflict sentient beings, and because they can benefit the great mass of living creatures.
Bodhisattvas continue to investigate the aspects of knowledge concerning the status of mundane past actions because they acquire resources without difficulty for the sake of sentient beings, and because they are obliged to cherish all sentient beings.

The same text concludes that:[23]
The five ordinary sciences cultivated by bodhisattvas are also to be investigated because bodhisattvas are obliged to perfect the great provision of pristine cognition (jñānasambhāra, ye shes kyi tshogs) of unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment.[24] If they do not study all those subjects, they will not in due course attain the unobscured all-knowing pristine cognition.
When these extensive comments are abbreviated, [bodhisattvas] are obliged to persevere for the sake of their objective—the causal basis of the provisions through which the all-knowing pristine cognition is attained.

Articulation of syllables (yi ge'i sbyor ba) is the basis of all knowledge because the techniques of training enunciated by the Buddha are maintained with reference to it, because it is also the causal basis of [those teachings that] propound the Four Vedas of the non-Buddhists,[25] and because all linguistic expressions throughout the world commonly depend on [articulated] syllables. Therefore, at the outset, it is important that the articulation of syllables should be studied and skillfully comprehended. As Tonmi Sambhoṭa himself has said [in his Thirty Verses]:[26]
It should be explained that articulation of syllables
Is the basis of all [higher] spiritual trainings,[27]
As well as being a causal basis for exponents of the Vedas;
And it is the foundation of all forms of linguistic expression.
Although the number of different languages in the world and the scripts that have been intellectually devised to represent them may be limitless and indefinable, the [common] foundation of all languages and scripts comprises vowels and consonants, including both phonemes and their character representations.
Among these, it is said that the basic element of sound—the phoneme (śabdadhātu, sgra'i khams)—is not produced from a ripening cause (vipākahetu, rnam smin gyi rgyu), because it arises whenever its articulation is desired and does not arise when this condition is absent. By contrast, [results] produced from a ripening [cause] may not arise voluntarily but do arise involuntarily. For this reason sound is held by the Vaibhasikas to be produced either [as a result] in conformity with its own cause (niṣyandaphala, rgyu mthun), or from a causal basis of homogeneity (sabhāgahetu, skal mnyam), or else through the four cumulative experiences (caturaupacāyika, rgyas byung bzhi). The four cumulative experiences are enumerated as eating, sleeping, good conduct, and meditative stability.[28]

The essential nature of the syllables is simply vocal pulsation (skad kyi gdangs). It is said in the Exposition of Valid Cognition:[29]
Having understood the motility of articulation,
Sound is produced by one who knows how to produce it.
The air-stream of vital energy (vāyu, rlung) is activated voluntarily, and the pulsation of the syllables arises from that. Depending on whether a pulsation endures for one, two, or three blinks of the eye, it is conventionally termed short, long, or diphthong in its duration. As the previous source also states:[30]
The full extent of a syllable
May be measured in the blinking of an eye.
Now, each fraction of a syllable is equivalent to an instant or indivisible time moment (kṣana, skad cig), and a series or continuum is formed when the other [fractions] are gathered along with it. The Treasury of Phenomenology explains that among the [identifiable] phenomenological categories, [syllables] are held by both the Vaibhasikas and Sautrantikas to belong to the category of formative predispositions that are disassociated from mind (cittaviprayuktasaṃskāra).[31]

The etymological definitions (nirukta, nges tshig) of the term yi ge (“syllable”) include the following: In Sanskrit, the tri-syllabic a-kṣa-ra [which is rendered in English as “syllable”] means “unchanging.” Even when translated into different languages, the nature of the vowels and consonants is unchanging—for example, a single character, such as [the vowel] A or [the consonant] ka, does not transform into a syllable with another phonetic value.
The Sanskrit term vyañjana (“consonant”) means “elucidator” in the sense that the consonants elucidate or specify all nouns and words. The Sanskrit term varṇa (“letter” or “syllable”) means “signifier” in the sense that [the syllables] signify all meanings.

While there are many systematic presentations of phonological analysis found in the traditions derived from each of the [eight renowned] grammatical treatises[33] and also in the uncommon tantra texts, the one that is commonly made refers to the four major classical languages of India,[34] of which the foremost is known as Sanskrit.
The Sanskrit language includes both vowels and consonants. The vowels comprise the ten simple vowels (samānākṣara, mtshungs pa'i yi ge), from A and Ā
to Ḷ, and Ḹ, as well as the four diphthongs (saṃdbyakṣara, mtshams sbyor gyi yi ge) E, AI, O, and AU—sixteen altogether.[35] The consonants comprise five phonetic sets (pañcavarga, sdepa lnga) [of stops/ sparśa], including the [velar/ kaṇṭha] set beginning with ka, as well as the four semi-vowels (antaḥsthā, mthar gnas), ya, ra, la and va, and the four spirants (ūṣmān, dro ba'i yi ge), śa and so forth. Thus there are said to be thirty-three consonants. These are the basic syllables.[36]

Derived from this analysis, the Grammar of Candragomin classifies each of the four vowels A, I, U and Ṛ as threefold—short (hrasva), long (dīrgha), and extra long (pluta), each of which has three distinct accents or tones—acute or high (udātta), grave or low (anudātta), and circumflex or middle (svarita), making thirty-six variations.[37] These, in turn, are subdivided into two further categories, depending on whether they accept nasalization (anunāsika, rjes su sna ldan can) or not, making seventy-two.[38]
Each of the four diphthongs is subdivided into long and extra-long forms, there being no short forms, while L has no long form and is subdivided into short and extra-long forms. Each of these five also may have the three tones, high, low, or middle, making thirty, and these are doubled to sixty when a distinction is made between those that accept nasalization and those that do not. Added to the aforementioned category, the vowels now number one hundred and thirty-two.[39]
The consonants, meanwhile, include the basic thirty-three, along with Ḥ (visarga, rnam gcad), AṂ (anusvāra, nga ro), Ḥka (jihvāmūlīya, lce rtsa can), and Ḥpa (upadhmānīya, mchu can), making thirty-seven.[40] Then, each of the basic thirty-three consonants, including ka, may take each of the hundred and thirty-two vowels, making a total of four thousand three hundred and fifty-six combinations.[41]
All these consonants arise dependent on their appropriate places of articulation, articulators, and processes of articulation. Among them, concerning the places of articulation (vacanāvasthā, rtsol ba'i gnas), it is said:[42]

The chest, the throat, the head,
And similarly the tip of the tongue, the teeth,
The nose, the lips, and the palate
Comprise the eight places of syllabic [articulation].

The syllable A, the stops of the velar phonetic set (kaṇṭhavarga) beginning with ka,[43] and the spirant syllable ha all have their place of articulation in the velum or the throat.[44] The vowels I, E, and ai are produced by contact with the throat and the palate; and the vowels U, O, and au by contact between the throat and the lips.[45]
The vowel Ṛ, the stops of the retroflex phonetic set (mūrdhanyavarga) beginning with Ṭa,[46] the semi-vowel ra,[47] and the spirant syllable Ṣa have their place of articulation in the head.[48] The jihvāmūlīya has its place of articulation at the root of the palate.
The vowel L, the stops of the dental phonetic set (dantyavarga) beginning with ta,[49] the semi-vowel la, and the spirant syllable SA all have their place of articulation in the teeth.[50]
The anusvāra (aṂ) has its place of articulation in the nose. The nasal syllables Ṅa, Ña, Ṇa, NA, and MA all have their place of articulation in the nose, consequent on their respective contact with the velum, and so forth.[51]
The vowel I, along with the stops of the palatal phonetic set (tālavyavarga) beginning with CA,[52] the semi-vowel YA, and the spirant syllable ŚA all have their place of articulation in the palate.[53]
The vowel U, the stops of the labial phonetic set (oṣṭhyavarga) beginning with PA,[54] and the upadhmānīya (Ḥpa) have their place of articulation in the lips. The semi-vowel VA is formed by contact with the teeth and the lips.[55]
[Incidentally], the chest or trunk is said to be included here [among the places of articulation] because the velar or guttural syllables are produced with reference to it [as chest pulses], and the other syllables also inevitably have some association with the throat and thereby with the chest.
With regard to the articulators [of the syllables] (karaṇa, byed pa), the articulator of the jihvāmūlīya (Ḥka) is the root of the tongue. The articulator of the palatal syllables is the blade of the tongue. The articulator of the retroflex or cacuminal syllables is the tip of the tongue in proximity [with the upper incisors]. The articulator of the dental syllables is the tip of the tongue. The remaining syllables all have articulators corresponding to their places of articulation.[56]

The actual process of articulation (rtsol ba) includes both inner and outer aspects.[57] There are four inner modes of articulation: closure or occlusion of the vocal tract (saṃvāra, btsums pa), opening of the vocal tract (vivāra, phye ba), contact or plosion (spṛṣṭa, phrad pa), and partial contact (īṣatspṛṣṭa, cung zad phrad pa).[58] Among these, the syllable A is articulated in coincidence with occlusion, while the other vowels and the spirants are articulated in coincidence with the opening of the vocal tract. In this context, the spirants (ūṣmān, dro ba'i yi ge) accord with the explanation that is given below [in the next paragraph]. Contact characterizes the inner articulation of the [stop consonants, i. e., the syllables of the various] phonetic sets, which are emitted energetically and loudly expressed. Partial contact characterizes the inner articulation of the semi-vowels.
There are five modes of outer articulation: unvoiced surds (aghoṣa, sgra med), non-aspirates (alpapāṇa, srog chung), aspirates (mahāpāṇa, srog chen), voiced sonants (ghoṣavant, sgra ldan), and spirants (ūṣmān, dro ba).[59] Among them, the unvoiced surds comprise the first and second syllables of each phonetic set, along with spirants Śa, Ṣa, SA, the jihvāmūlīya (Ḥka), and the upadhmānīya (Ḥpa). The non-aspirates comprise the first, third, and fifth syllables of each phonetic set, along with the semi-vowels. The aspirates comprise the second and fourth syllables of each phonetic set, along with the spirants ŚA, Ṣa, SA, and ha. The voiced sonants comprise the third, fourth, and fifth syllables of each phonetic set, along with the anusvāra, the semi-vowels, and the syllable ha. The spirants comprise the second and fourth syllables of each set, along with the [true] spirant syllables Śa, Ṣa, sa, and ha.[60] However, we should note that in other [grammatical] texts, only the syllables ŚA, ṢA, sa, and ha are included among the spirants.[61]
At this juncture it would be useful to include [an explanation of] the methods of reciting [Sanskrit syllables] according to the way of [secret] mantra (sngags kyi bklag thabs), but owing to my inability to present these points succinctly, in few words, this is a subject that should be solely understood from the compositions of the authentic [teachers] of the past.[62]

The syllables of which the Tibetan language is composed include the basic vowels and consonants, known as the garland of vowels (a phreng) and the garland of consonants (ka phreng).[63]
The vowels that are clearly represented [in Tibetan] are four in number:[1] (gi gu), u (zhabs kyu), E ('dreng bu) and o (nga ro). These are combined with the syllable A because they cannot be expressed in isolation. The thirty basic consonants, commencing with ka and ending with A, are analyzed as follows. There are five—ga, da, ba, ma and A—which may also occur as prefixes (sngon 'jug lnga) ; and ten—GA, NGA, DA, NA, ba, ma, 'a, ra, la, and SA—which may also occur as suffixes (rjes 'jug bcu); the remaining twenty consonants can only occur as radicals (ming gzhi). The prefixes precede the radical, while the suffixes follow the radical. The radicals themselves are the basis of affixation and cannot, as such, be attached to any prefix or suffix.[64]
When these syllables are formed into words, they may occur as isolates (rkyang pa), as in the example ka ba (meaning “pillar”); in conjunction with prefixes (sngon 'jug gis 'phul ba), as exemplified by mgo bo (“head”); with subscripts ('dogs 'phul), as in the example dbye ba (“analysis”); or in stacks (brtsegs 'phul), as in the example bsgrub bya (“probandum”). There are three syllables that can appear in superscript form (mgo can)—RA, LA, and SA—as in the example sgra (“sound”), and four that can appear in subscript form ('dogs bzhi) — YA, RA, LA, and VA.[65]

When nouns (nāman, ming) are formed into [syntactically bound] phrases (pada, tshig), phrases that disclose meaning and nuances of meaning may be formed by the addition of [variable] particles and case endings that will change contingent on the preceding suffix. [In Tibetan, ] the latter include the reduplicated particles [that mark the end of a sentence; slar bsdu], the oblique case particles (la don), and the genitive and instrumental case particles (i ldan);[66] as well as the six non-variable particles (phrad gzhan dbang can), including the thematic particle ni that demarcates or emphasizes a subject.[67]
The various combinations of prefixes and suffixes are then applied, distinguishing agentives and objectives (bdag gzhan), the three tenses (dus gsum), and verbal categories (bya byed).[68]
Nouns are formed from multiple combinations of syllables, and [syntactically bound] phrases are formed from multiple combinations of nouns. Concerning the functionality [of nouns, phrases, and syllables], the master [Pang] Lodro Tenpa [1276-1342] has said [in his Clarification of the Three Clusters],[69]
Nouns signify the essential nature of their meaning.
[Syntactically bound] phrases convey their particular nuances;
And syllables convey nothing at all.
Take, for example, the nouns “vase” (bum pa) and “ox” (ba lang). These do convey the essential nature of their meanings, whereas [the relevant syntactically bound] phrases convey particular nuances—[a vase being] “something compounded and impermanent” ('dus byas mi rtag), and [an ox] “something endowed with corrupt [psycho-physical aggregates] and subject to suffering” (zag bcas sdug bsngal). On the other hand, [a string of] syllables, such as A, A, ka, KHA, GA, gha, and ṄA will convey nothing at all.

The particular nuances of meaning cannot be fully conveyed unless the appropriate inflections and particles are attached to the stems of [the relevant] words and phrases. Among these, inflections (vibhakti, rnam dbye; lit. “differentiators”) are so called because they differentiate cases—accusative, instrumental, and so forth—and number—singular, dual, and plural. With regard to the relationship between inflections and nominal stems, in Sanskrit the words buddha, dharma (“teaching”), deva (“deity”), and ātman (“self”) are not differentiated in themselves, apart from conveying the bare essential nature of their [respective] meanings, but they become differentiated when their appropriate first case [nominative or substantive, prathamā] inflections are affixed.[70] In Tibetan, on the other hand, no such distinction is made between the first case inflection (rnam dbye dang po) and the noun isolate (ming rkyang).
With regard to [the distinctions of number], let us take for example, the noun “buddha” (sangs rgyas). One may say “one buddha” (buddhaḥ, sangs rgyas) in the singular, “two buddhas” (buddhau, sangs rgyas dag) in the dual, and “buddhas” (buddhāḥ, sangs rgyas rnams) in the plural. Such [inflections] can be applied to the other examples listed here, in turn.[71]
The second or accusative case (dvitīyā, las su bya ba) may be illustrated by the expressions “homage to the buddha” (sangs rgyas la phyag 'tshal lo), or “going to India” (rgya gar du 'gro), where the object is identified by the particles la and du.
The third or instrumental case (tṛtīyā, byed sgra) may be illustrated by the expressions “the teachings spoken by the buddha” (sangs rgyas kyis chos gsungs) and “the actions I have to do” (bdag gis las bya), where the agent or instrument is identified respectively by the particles kyis and gis.
The fourth or dative case (caturthā, dgos ched du bya ba) may be illustrated by the expressions “offering food to a beggar” (slong mo la zas sbyin) and “irrigating the fields” (zhing la chu 'dren), where the indirect object of benefit is identified by the particle la.

The fifth or ablative case (pañcamā, 'byung khungs) may be illustrated by the expressions “teachings derived from the buddha” (sangs rgyas las chos) and “gemstones from the ocean” (rgya mtsho nas rin po che), where the source is identified respectively by the particles las and nas.
The sixth or genitive case (ṣaṣṭhī, 'brel sgra) may be illustrated by the expressions “body of the buddha” (sangs rgyas kyi sku) and “realm of sentient beings” (sems can gyi khams), where the possessive relationship is identified respectively by the particles kyi and gyi.
The seventh or locative case (saptamā, gnas gzhi) may be illustrated by the expressions “he remained seated in steadfastness” (brtan par bzhugs) and “man in the house” (khyim du mi), where the spatio-temporal location or locus is identified respectively by the [terminal] -r and the particle du.[72]
Among these cases, the second (accusative), the fourth (dative) and the seventh (locative) all employ the six variants of the oblique particle la (la don gyi sgra drug) as their case indicator. These are la, na, tu, du, su, and ru. The [third or] instrumental case employs the five variant forms kyis, gyis, gis, yis, and -'i.

[Variable Particles That Cannot Stand Alone]
Apart from these, there are some particles which may stand alone, without functioning as inflections, and others [which cannot meaningfully stand alone]. The latter include the particles of reduplication (slar bsdu), go, ngo, and so forth [which demarcate the end of a sentence] and assume [variable forms] depending on the final letters to which they are attached.[74]
The [mnemonic] verses cited in the following paragraph [and translated in the endnotes] illustrate [those variable particles that cannot meaningfully stand alone. They include (1) the oblique particle la; (1) the locative particle na; (3-6) the genitive particles kyi, gyi, gi, and yi; (7-17) the final particles of reduplication go, ngo, do, no, bo, mo, -'o, ro, lo, so, and to; (18-20) the possessive particles (bdag sgra) pa, po, and bo; (21-22) the negative particles (dgag sgra) ma and mi; (23) the possessive particle can; (24) the emphatic or thematic particle ni; (25) the causal particle phyir; (26-27) the vocative particles ('bod pa'i sgra) kye and kva; (28-30) the conjunctive particles cing, zhing, and shing; (31-33) the indirect speech particles ces, zhes, and shes; (34-36) the indefinite or imperative particles cig, zhig, and shig; (37-39) the final speech particles ce'o, zhe'o, and she'o; (40-42) the conditional particles ce na, zhe na, and she na; (43) the optative particle gu; (43-45) the conjunctive modifying particles (rgyan sdud kyi sgra) kyang, -'ang, and yang; (46-55) the disjunctive-adjunctive connecting particles ('byed sdud kyi sgra) gam, ngam, dam, nam, bam, mam, -'am, ram, lam, and sam; (56-57) the dual and plural particles dag and rnams; (58-60) the connecting particles (lhag bcas) te, ste, and de; (61) the quantitative pronoun (spyi sgra) snyed; (62) the conjunctive particle (dang sgra) dang; and (63) the auxiliary particle lo]:[75]

[[76]The first part of these mnemonic verses may be translated as follows:]
Even though one may excel in accuracy and clarity,
O ne should become learned in [elementary] discourses
Associated w ith entry into the Buddhist teaching,
A nd then consider ethical discipline.
A noble action should be well designed.
It should be conceived. It should be accomplished. It should be considered.
It should be executed. It should be demonstrated. May the gods be victorious!
It should be examined. It should be demonstrated!
Practicing B uddhists— whether accom plished or neophyte—
[Should be] endow ed w ith virtue, w ithout pollution or degeneration.
Now then, what is the reason for this, O Children! O Friends!
It is because they are continuing to traverse [the path]!
I’ve heard that this is both happy and joyful.
There is a report that this is bright and that it is beautiful.
It s said that a discussion should som etim e be held.
If you ask, “Who is there? If you ask, “What is it?”
If you say, "I didn’t do it,” then let it be done!

[[77]The last part of the mnem onic could be translated as follows:]
Though [dioughts] may be setded, though they may move, though they may recall,
Whether they are running, or setting out, or standing still,
Whether they are in front, or behind, or well conceived,
Whether they are actualized, or planned, or over-elaborated,
Or whether they are vast,
One should know, explain, and fully comprehend
That all of them are resources [indicative of] wealth.
As many as they are, they are all capable of possessing happiness.

[Nonvariable Particles That Can Stand Alone]
On the other hand, the particles which do convey meaning when they stand alone, and have no variable forms due to affixation, include single-syllable particles (phrad rkyang pa) such as (1) gang (“what”), (2) ci (“what”), (3) de (“that”), (4) di (“this”), (5) su (“who”), (6) yang (“again”), (7) nam (“ever”), (8) slar (“again”), (9) 'o na (“but”), (10) la la (“some”), and (11) ji (“how”); as well as the many disyllabic or trisyllabic particles and so forth, such as (12) gang dag (“which two”), (13) de dag (“those two”), (14) gang rnams (“which”), (15) de rnams (“those”), (16) ji snyed (“however many”), (17) de snyed (“so many”), and (18) ci nas kyang (“by all means”).[78]

When verbal action is analyzed, with regard to those [transitive] verbs which establish a subject-object relationship (byed po gzhan dang dngos su 'brel ba), [the following semantic distinction is made]: the instrument by which the subject effects an action upon the object (byed pa po'i dngos po) and the verbal action occurring in the present tense (byed pa) are collectively known as the agentive (bdag), while the object of the action that is to be achieved (bsgrub bya'i yul gyi dngos po) and the action occurring in the future tense (bya ba) are collectively known as the objective (gzhan).[79]
Whether verbs establish or do not establish a subject-object relationship, the completed action occurs in the past tense (dus das pa), the action that is yet to be completed occurs in the future tense (dus ma 'ongs pa), and the action that is presently being completed occurs in the present tense (dus da lta ba).
Although verbs are classified elsewhere according to the action of the subject (byed pa'i las) and the action of the object (bya ba'i las), these distinctions are subsumed, from the standpoint of the three tenses, by assigning the action of the subject to the present tense and the action of the object to the future tense; or from the standpoint of the agentive-objective distinction, a present action that establishes a [transitive] subject-object relationship is classed as agentive and a future action that does so is classed as objective, as has just been explained. Therefore, the distinction between the three tenses is found universally in sentence construction pertaining to the action of the subject, and the distinction between agentive and objective, though not quite as allembracing, is made alongside [the distinction of tense] because sentences include constructions expressive of both the subject and the object.[80]

<d e="2">
Examples of constructions expressing the agentive or subject include [nominal forms such as] sgrub pa po (“achiever”), ston pa po (“teacher”), sgrub byed (“means of achievement,” “practice”), and ston byed (“means of teaching,” “instruction”); and verbal forms such as gsal bar byed pa (“is clarifying”), sgrub par byed pa (“is achieving”), ston par byed pa (“is teaching”), sgrub bo (“is achieving”), and ston to (“is teaching”).
Examples of constructions expressing the objective include [nominal forms such as] sgrub par by a ba (“object to be achieved,” “goal”), bstan par by a ba (“object to be taught,” “student”), bsgrub bya (“goal”), and bstan bya (“teaching”), as well as their verbal forms — sgrub par bya (“is to be achieved”), bstan par bya (“is to be taught”), brgrub bo (“will be achieved”), and bstan no (“will be taught”).[81]
As for the distinctive forms of the three tenses, which are not subsumed in that [agentive-objective] classification, there are many examples. Those illustrating the past tense include bsgrubs (“achieved”), bstan (“taught”), and grub (“been attained”). Examples of the present tense include sgrub bzhin pa (“is achieving”), ston bzhin pa (“is teaching”), 'grub par byed (“is being attained”), and chad par byed (“is being explained”). Examples of the future tense include 'grub par 'gyur (“will be achieved”), chad par 'gyur (“will be explained”), 'grub bo (“will be attained”), 'chad do (“will teach”), 'grub par bya (“will be attained”), and 'chad par bya (“will be explained”).[82]
An example of a [transitive] construction that establishes a relationship with the subject (byed pa po dang dngos su 'brel ba) is lcags gser du bsgyur (“he transformed iron into gold”), and an example of a [non-transitive] construction that that does not establish a relationship with the subject is lcags gser du 'gyur (“iron turned into gold”).[83]

Now, with regard to the sequential steps of training [in pronunciation], at first one should practice [traditional Tibetan] phonics (nga ro). Since sound is conveyed by phonemes, one should perfect the pronunciation of each syllable, ensuring that the individual syllables conform to their respective places of articulation, and that even the vowels have their own distinctive modes of phonetic production.
Then, after acquiring experience [in phonetic diction], one should practice spelling aloud, which entails the composition, in a single syllabic stack, of prefixes, suffixes, and radical letters.[84]
As stated above in the section on Sanskrit phonetics, these [syllables] are produced and expressed in conformity with their own distinctive places of articulation, articulators, and inner and outer modes of articulation. For more detail [on the phonetic diction of Tibetan], readers should refer to the writings of the venerable Sonam Tsemo, and others.[85]
Having mastered spelling, one should then study the excellent works of Tonmi Sambhota—the Thirty Verses and the Introduction to Gender, in which the definitive rules concerning affixation are presented in detail.[86] These determine which [radicals] may take prefixes and suffixes, which prefixes and suffixes may be attached to a given radical, the actual techniques of affixation, and the need for affixation. Tonmi Sambhota's texts, which are the oldest or most fundamental of all the Tibetan treatises on language, were composed through the enlightened activity of the buddhas, and they cannot simply be examined through the intelligence of ordinary persons.[87]

Communicative symbols (saṃketa, brda) partake of a [shared] moment of comprehension and verbalization that occurs once names have been imputed, in order to associate a given conventional term with a given meaning. Conventional terms (vyavahāra, tha snyad) embody semantic usage, which naturally partakes of three [successive] phases: cognition, signification, and semantic application or engagement (shes brjod 'jug gsum). Among these, the imputative cognition (btags pa'i shes pa) is the consciousness that thinks [for example], “This is a pillar.” From this there follows signification—the verbalization of the word “pillar”—and application, which is [the understanding that] since there is a pillar, building work may be undertaken.
Although universal (spyi) do not exist in reality, they are superimposed in order that [terms] might be meaningfully applied, just as, for example, a “piece of wood that supports a beam” is imputed to be a “pillar.”[91]
Regarding these [semantic distinctions], names have the function of signifying the bare essential nature (ngo bo tsam) of a given object. Attributes [of form and color] have the function of illustrating a given object. Communicative symbols are applied because they are held to arise spontaneously and without precedent in order to facilitate [a given] conventional term. Conventional terms are verbalized in order that a given [term] might be meaningfully applied.

Syntactically bound words or phrases (pada, tshig), according to the tradition of Buddhist phenomenology, are composed of names, which then come to signify or denote particular nuances of meaning, as in the expression, “compounded things are impermanent.” However, according to the tradition of the grammarians, it is by suffixing the inflections tiṄ (indicating verbal desinence) and sUP (indicating nominal desinence),[92] as appropriate, that the essential nature of an object and its particular nuances are suitably signified. Meanings (don) are inherent, being analogous to the abiding nature of all phenomena (chos rnams kyi gnas lugs).

Now, with respect to these eight elements of linguistic application, when syllables are conjoined in an appropriate manner, there is a convergence of sound and meaning; and the usage then takes effect owing to the apprehending intellect.
Furthermore, with regard to the arising of this intelligence, at the moment when communication takes place, the intellect necessarily experiences five [successive] factors that distinguish this [cognition] from other cognitions. These are objective reference (don la dmigs pa), sound generation (sgra la byung ba), shared ideation (mthun par snang ba), universality or commonality (thun mongs du grags pa), and adhesion (mngon par zhen pa).
These [five factors] have their own distinctive functions: Objective reference generates the functionality of object-universals (don spyi). The production of sound generates the representations of sound-universals (sgra spyi).[93] Shared ideation and commonality give rise to adhesion and facilitate comprehension in others. Adhesion generates an association between names and denoted meanings (ming can). It is therefore by experiencing these sequentially arising factors that [the intelligence of] names and so forth arises. The phase of adhesion itself has four distinct sub-phases.[94]
For details concerning such distinctions, readers should understand [the discussion] contained in the Root Verses and Commentary on the Eight Elements of Linguistic Application, and so forth.[95]

When [bodhisattva] sons of the Conqueror, entering the path of the Greater Vehicle, seek the [sacred] teachings, there exist no branches of knowledge at all, including the five classical sciences (pañcavidyā, rig gnas lnga), which should remain unstudied. This is because, when the level of omniscience (sarvajñātā, thams cad mkhyen pa nyid) is attained, results will emerge that are in conformity with their causes. So it is said in the Introduction to the Conduct of a Bodhisattva:[96]
There is nothing at all which is not to be studied
By the sons of the Conqueror.
For one who has such learning,
Nothing at all will be without merit.
Nagarjuna has also said [in his Eulogy to the Expanse of Actual Reality]:
From all such seeds fruits will emerge that resemble their causes.
Which learned one can prove that fruits come into being without seeds!
The principal that similar classes of results are derived from similar classes of cause is one that conforms to the norms of worldly folk. Therefore it is accepted that [bodhisattvas] should train their minds in all aspects of knowledge. On this point, too, Nagarjuna says at the outset [in his Fundamental Stanzas of Madhyamaka]:[97]

Without relying on conventional terms,
Ultimate reality cannot be demonstrated.
Without realizing the ultimate reality,
Nirvana will not be attained.

So, even to realize the abiding nature of ultimate reality (don dam pa'i gnas lugs), it is necessary to rely upon conventional terminology.
When the fields [of knowledge] are subsumed, they can be classified according to the ten classical sciences, but there are actually only five main classical sciences, since the five minor sciences (rigs gnas chung ba lnga) are all considered to be branches of Sanskrit grammar [and medicine]. Among the [five major sciences], grammar and logic eradicate wrong understandings of word and meaning. Fine arts and medicine bring into the fold students [seeking] both general and particular [skills]. The inner science [of Buddhism] brings about an understanding of all aspects of the path to omniscience. Therefore, the classical sciences may also be grouped in three categories: those that eradicate [wrong understandings], those that bring [seekers] into the fold, and the one that attains omniscience.[98]
These then are [the fields of knowledge] that are to be studied. It is said in the Sūtra of [Great] Skillful Means, Repaying the Buddha with Gratitude:[99]
If a bodhisattva does not study the five sciences, he can never obtain all-knowing pristine cognition in the unsurpassed, genuine, and perfect enlightenment. This being the case, in order to obtain unsurpassed enlightenment, the five sciences should be studied.
And the regent Maitreya has said [in the Ornament of the Sūtras of the Greater Vehicle]:[100]
If one does not persevere with regard to the five classical sciences,
Even a supremely sublime being will not attain omniscience. Therefore, one should persevere in these [studies]
In order to eradicate [wrong understandings], bring [others] into the fold,
And understand all natures.

Primary bases are the stems upon which [words] are to be formed by affixation. They comprise both genuine (dngos) and imputed or conventional (btags) bases, among which the primary element or the verbal root is considered to be the genuine basis of word formation.[103]
When verbal roots are analyzed, they partake of the following six[104] categories:
(1) [primary] verbal roots that have been listed or formally conjugated (paripaṭhitadbātu, yongs su bklags pa'i byings) in the nine chapters of the Paradigms of Verbal Roots, commencing with [chapter one, which concerns the Class One] verbs bhū (“become”), and cit (“think of”);[105]
(2) verbal roots that have not been listed or formally conjugated (viparipāṭhitadhātu, yongs su ma bklags pa'i byings) in any of the Commentaries on Verbal Roots (mDo 'grel), including [derivative Class Ten] forms such as adolayati (“raises up”), which have acquired wide conventional usage;[106]
(3) verbal roots that have both been and not been listed or formally conjugated (gnyis ldan), which are mentioned incidentally in the paradigms and Indian commentaries, such as the verbal root of jū (“hasten,” dzu mdo'i byings) and the verbal root of skambhu (“impede,” skambhu'i byings), but have not been formally listed or conjugated in any table of verbal roots (dhātupaṭha, byings kyi tshogs);[107]
(4) denominative verbal roots (nāmadhātu, ming gi byings), including twenty that are formed from nouns such as kaṇḍū (“itching”) by affixing -ya (yaK)[108] from among the desiderative and related suffixes (saN) to the nominal stem, thereby making a denominative verbal root [kaṇḍūyati];[109]
(5) affixed verbal roots (pratyayadhātu, rkyen gyi byings), including those formed by affixing any of the twelve desiderative and related suffixes (saN la sogs pa) to a verbal root as appropriate, so that its ending also becomes a derivative verbal root;[110]
(6) verbal roots that can be both denominative and affixed (gnyis ka), since. their void terminations, formed by a zero suffix -v (KvIP la sogs pa)[111] may be classed as nouns or affixes, in order that a conjugated verbal root may take the form of a noun, or vice versa, and then be reconstituted as a verbal root, in accordance with the applied rules of verbal morphology (ākhyāta, kun bshad).

When these [six categories of verbal roots] are subsumed, they comprise transitive verbs [of the active voice] (sakarmaka, las bcas) and intransitive or reflexive verbs [of the middle voice] (akarmaka, las med).[112] With regard to the former, it says in Puñjarājas commentary:[113]
When one “conceives,” “knows,” or “sees,” “Eats,” or “quarrels,”
“Makes,” “sells,” “holds,” or “steals,”
“Gives,” “offers,” “desires,” or “touches,”
“Pays homage,” “eulogizes,” “likes,” or “tolerates,”
“Nourishes,” “considers,” or “impedes,” and so forth,
“Speaks” or “kills,” and so forth—
All such verbs are known as transitive.
This is because they take a direct object.
Thus, any verbal root such as these which takes a direct object (karman, bya ba'i yul), including, for example, the verbs to “conceive,” to “know,” to “see,” and to “hear,” and those which are [classed as] agentive (kartṛ, byed pa) because they are required to attach a second case accusative inflection to the direct object, are considered to be transitive.
With regard to the latter, it says in the Analysis of the Grammar of Sārasvata:[114]
When one is “embarrassed,” “sitting,” or “keeping watch,”
“Waxing,” “waning,” “decaying,” “living,” or “dying,”
“Lying down,” “playing,” or “shining,”
These categories of verbal roots are explained to be intransitive.
Since verbal roots such as siN (“to lie down”) accomplish their action of their own accord, without requiring a direct object in the accusative, they are classed as intransitive or reflexive.[115]

To illustrate [the forming of derivatives from verbal roots], here [in Tibet], for the sake of those who have not studied Sanskrit grammar, the verbal root does not in itself signify anything, just like the Tibetan syllable ka. However, just as when prefixes and suffixes are added to ka making bka' (“Buddhist teachings”), so the Sanskrit verbal root bhū (to “become,” to “be”) through moderate vowel strengthening (guṇa, aC) may assume the form bhava (“existence”) and through extreme vowel strengthening (vṛddhi, GHaÑ) assumes the form bhāva (“object”).[116] In ways such as these, verbal roots assume the form of nouns.
On the subject of derivation (vikāra, rnam 'gyur), just as in Tibetan the subscript letters la, ya and ra assume other forms [when subscripted], so in Sanskrit also, the verbal root bhū assumes a great number of other character representations, such as bhava, through the application of moderate vowel strengthening. In Sanskrit there are two types of inflected endings: verbal suffixes (tiṄ, indicating verbal desinence) and nominal suffixes (sUP, indicating nominal desinence),[117] whereas in Tibetan there is only one. This distinction has already been mentioned above.[118]

With regard to nominal stems, which are the imputed stems to which nominal suffixes are added as inflections (indicated by sUP), in general such stems will have masculine, feminine or neuter endings, as appropriate. When these are analyzed, they comprise the so-called six stems indicative of gender (rtags drug), which are enumerated as follows:[119]
(1) stems of specific gender (dag pa'i rtags), including masculine stems as in vṛkṣaḥ (“tree”), feminine stems as in khaṅḍā (“bed”), and neuter stems as in kuṇṭaṃ (“stove”), which are so called because their gender-based terminations cannot be applied to [nouns of] other genders;
(2.) stems of mixed gender ('dres pa'i rtags), including some nouns indicating male and female, such as puruṣa (“man”) and puruṣī (“woman”), which can be declined as both masculine and feminine, or those such as ghṛtaḥ and ghṛtaṃ (“butter”), which may be declined as masculine and neuter;
(3) stems of obscure gender (gtibs pa'i rtags), including those single nouns which can partake of all three genders, such as pātraḥ, patrī, and patraṃ (“bowl”);
(4) stems of congruent gender (nye bar sgrub pa'i rtags), which assume adjectival forms, indicating color, attributes, and so forth, rather than nouns, as in the examples śuklaḥ, śuklā, and śuklaṃ (“white”) or paṭuḥ, paṭīḥ, and paṭu (“learned”);
(5) stems of universally applicable gender (kun tu 'jug pa'i rtags), including words such as prakṛti, which have multiple homonyms, and on which, according to the Wish-fulfilling Commentary (Amaraṭīkākāmadhenu), Vyāḍi says:[120]
Prakṛtiḥ can mean “citizen,” “minister,” and so forth,
Or “pattern,” “nature,” and “womb,”
As well as the natural equilibrium of lightness, motility and dullness.[121]
Other synonyms are also enumerated:[122]
When meaning “worldly path” or “orifice of sexual delight”
Prakṛtiḥ assumes a feminine form.
These lists [of synonyms] are found in the Addendum to Part Three [of the Amarakośakāmadhenu ] (sKabs gsum gyi lhag ma).[123]

Since single words such as prakṛti, may partake of many meanings, it is in the context of the versification that the gender applicable to a given word should be determined. Thus, when it assumes the masculine form, prakṛtiḥ may mean “nature” or “citizen,” “wine seller,” “potter,” and so forth, and when it assumes the feminine form. prakṛti should be understood to mean “womb.”
(6) stems of indeterminate gender (mi gsal ba'i rtags), including many words that are derived from an indeclinable class (avyayībhāvavarga, mi zad pa'i sde tshan), such as ucchi (“high”) which have no variant forms because all their inflections are elided.[124]
These are the six types of nominal stem.

Although there are a great many types of affixation that enable verbal roots to be formed as [syntactically] denoting words or phrases, when these are subsumed, they are classed according to the following seven types:
(1) desiderative and related suffixes (saN la sogs pa),[125] which are attached externally to the termination of the verbal root, enabling verbal roots to be reformed as [other] verbal roots;
(2) the eighteen suffixes of verbal conjugation (tiṄ'i rnam dbye bco brgyad),[126] which alter tense and mood (l-akāra)[127] without the need for an intervening vowel, enabling verbal roots to be formed as phrases.[128] These [syntactically] denote the agent (karaṇa), the verbal action (bhāva) and the direct object (karman), and in [Sarvadhara's] verbal morphology section (akhyāta) of the Kalāpa Grammar, they are known as the hundred and eighty personal verb inflections (tyādi, ti la sogs pa'i rnam dbye brgya dang brgyad cu).[129]

(3) primary nominal suffixes (kṛṭ), enabling verbal roots to be formed as substantives. As described in the first half of the third pāda of the first chapter of the Grammar of Candragomin[130] and extensively explained in the fifth chapter of the Kalāpa Grammar,[131] these are attached exclusively to verbal roots.[132]
(4) the denominative suffix -ya (KyaC), along with -kāmya (kāmyaT), among its subsidiary forms, and causative-forming suffixes such as -i (NiC la sogs pa) that are attached to nominal stems, enabling nouns themselves to be formed as denominative verbs;[133]
(5) feminine-forming suffixes (strīliṅgapratyaya, bud med rkyen sbyar), such as i-stems (DiŚ), and ā-stems (TāP and CāP),[134] that are added to nominal stems, enabling [nouns of one] gender to be formed as [nouns of another] gender;
(6) secondary nominal suffixes (taddhita, de la phan pa) which are attached principally to nominal stems and in some cases to phrases, enabling nouns to be formed as [other] nouns, and in some cases to resemble phrases, even though they do not actually include inflections that would enable phrases to be formed. These are elucidated at great length through some nine pādas (rkang pa dgu tsam gyis) in the Grammar of Candragomin.[135]
(7) the twenty-one nominal case suffixes (sUB-vibhakti, sUP'i rnam dbye nyer gcig), divided into three groups of seven, denoting the genitive (ṣaṣṭhīvibhakti) and the other [six] cases, [in singular, dual, and plural forms], which may be attached to the three gender terminations, enabling nouns to be formed as phrases.[136]

Although there are many exegeses concerning the formation of words from verbal roots by means of affixation, when these are subsumed, the exegesis expounded by master Vararuci who was of the miśra caste,[137] categorizes words as belonging to one of four types: nouns, such as puruṣaḥ (“man”), gauḥ (“ox”), and aśvaḥ (“horse”); adjectives, such as nīlaḥ (“blue”) and śuklaḥ (“white”); verbs, such as pacati (“is cooking”) and paṭhati (“is reading”); and pronouns (yuṣmad. ji lta bu'i sgra), which pertain to substantives alone and do not convey any particular action. Alternatively, all words can be considered in terms of the [threefold] classification, denoting agents (karaṇa, byed pa), verbal actions (bhāva, dngos po), and objects (karman, las).[138]

Concerning the former, the substitution of initial [retroflex] s of a verbal root for dental s (ṣatva), the substitution of initial [retroflex] ṇ [of a verbal root] for n (ṇatva),[140] and the various classifications of the technical markers (anubandha, rjes su 'brel ba) are the essential elements of derivation.
Concerning the classifications [of the technical markers]:[141]
(1) Technical markers may be attached directly to verbal roots (dhātvanubandha, byings kyi rjes su 'brel ba), in which case they may take the form of [following] vowels, such as -A, [preceding] consonants such as [the nominal derivation markers] Ṭu- and Ḍu-, or combined [vowels and consonants] such as [the following] -IR.[142]
(2) Technical markers may be attached to affixes (pratyayānubandha, rkyen gyi rjes su 'brel ba), in which case they may take the form of consonants such as the -Nin saN and the -Ñin GHaÑ,[143] or of vowels and consonants combined, such as the -AṬ in lAṬ, or the Ṅ and / in ṄasI.[144]
(3) Technical markers may be attached to long or short gender terminations (dīrghahrasvaliṅgānubandha, ring thung rtags kyi rjes su 'brel ba), in which case they take the form of a [following] -T (takāra, t-yig).[145]
(4) Technical markers may be attached to augments (āgamānubandha, glo bur gyi rkyen gyi rjes su 'brel ba), in which case they may be exemplified by the -M in nUM.[146]
(5) Moreover, there are certain technical markers that may be attached to indeclinable words (avyayībhāvānbandha, mi zad pa'i sde tshan gyi rjes su 'brel ba), as well as to [permitted] final letters (padānta, tshig mtha')[147] The latter entail elision (dbyi ba) which occurs in the following circumstances:
(a) [Certain final vowels] such as -A have the function of facilitating the pronunciation of a given sound that would otherwise lack a vowel and be unpronounceable, even though they can only occur in conjunction with a consonantal syllable, such as KA, when denoting the actual object to which a [given] sound refers. These should be elided, for example, when the vowel A attached to K- comes into contact with other affixes.[148]
(b) Some [final letters] denote peculiarities [of inflection] (khyad don), arid these should be elided once the [corresponding] peculiarities [of inflection] have been applied.[149]
(c) Some [final letters] are merely technical markers denoting the function of a substantive or primary base, and should be elided once the rules they prescribe have been implemented.[150]

There are twenty verbal prepositions (upasarga) that can modify both the meaning and the form [of a word].[151] For example, when the verbal preposition pra- is placed before the root nī (meaning “control”),[152] it forms pranī (meaning “lead”); or when the same verbal preposition pra- is placed before māna, it forms pramāṇa (meaning “valid cognition”); whereas when anu- is placed before māna, it forms the word anumāna (meaning “inference”). Similarly, there are a great many such combinations [that can be formed by this and the other verbal prepositions], e. g., upamā (“simile”), pratimā (“image”), and abhimā (“arrogance”).
Also there is the class of augments (āgama'i rkyen) which are indefinite with regard to their placement, as initial prefixes, medial infixes, or final suffixes, as when the augment -s (saK)[153] is inserted between aya- and -kāra, forming the word ayaskāra (“iron”). These are classed among the ancillary aspects of derivation.
Then, with regard to derivations that are due to affixation (nipātavikāra, phrad pa'i rnam gyur), these occur when verbal roots make contact with affixes, so that consequently
(1) the syllables undergo transformation, as when sthā becomes tiṣṭha, or pṛśya becomes paśya, and subsidiary [syllabic] transformations occur through the strengthening gradations of guṇa (yon tan) and vṛddhi ('phel ba), and so forth;[154]
(2) the affixes undergo transformation, as when the primary nominal suffix -yu is transformed into -ana, and -vu is transformed into -aka,[155] or when the secondary nominal suffix final -ch is transformed into -īya;[156] and
(3) the inflections undergo transformation, as when the eighteen verbal inflections (tiṄ sogs) derived from the paradigms of verbal morphology or conjugation, modify mood and tense (l) without the need for an intervening vowel,[157] or when the nominal inflections (su sogs) undergo transformation, as when Ṭā is transformed into -ina,[158] and Ṅe is transformed into -ya.[159]
In short, all three categories—syllables, affixes, and inflections—can undergo an infinite number of morphological transformations, including the [elaborate] transformations brought about by the euphonic conjunction (sandhi) of vowels and consonants.[160] These are exemplified by the formation of long A through the combination of A and A, E through the combination of A and I, and O through the combination of A and U.[161]

The second part of the detailed explanation on derivation concerns the changes that occur in the formation of nominal compounds (samāsa, tshig sdud). Nominal compounds combine two or multiple nouns, thereby forming a phrase, with a final nominal suffix (su sogs) attached, indicating name or gender. There are six [main] types of nominal compound:[162]
(1) descriptive determinative compounds (karmadhāraya, las 'dzin pa), the function of which is to combine an appositional noun or adjective with its object for descriptive purposes;
(2) dual compounds (dvigu, ba gnyis pa) in which the [main word of] the compound is preceded by a numeral—“two,” for example;
(3) adverbial compounds (upakumbha, nye ba'i bum pa) which principally form an indeclinable phrase (avyayībhāva);
(4) dependent determinative compounds (tatpuruṣa, de'i skyes bu) in which the first member of the compound forms one of twenty-one possible oblique relations [i. e., seven cases times three genders] with the main part, exemplified by the term tatpuruṣa [lit. “his man”], which entails a genitive relation;
(5) exocentric compounds (bahuvṛhi, 'bru, mang po) in which the subject with which the compound forms a possessive relation is external to the compound;
(6) coordinative compounds (dvandva, zlas dbye ba) in which pairs [of nouns or adjectives] are conjoined.
All these types of compound are capable of subsuming many meanings in a single point, and they may also combine many expressions and multiple case inflections in a single [phrase, with a single inflection]. The purpose of nominal compounding is to facilitate the construction of complicated expressions in few words. In general, they number six types, but in fact there are explained to be twenty-eight sub categories altogether.[163]

When substantial objects are analyzed in terms of their essential nature, they comprise both material phenomena (rūpa, bem po) and cognitive phenomena (vidyā, rig pa). The defining characteristic of material phenomena is that they are composed of atomic particles, while the defining characteristic of cognitive phenomena is that the object is cognitive.[168]
Material phenomena, when analyzed, comprise both outer material phenomena and inner material phenomena. Their defining characteristics are respectively that the former are composed of external atomic particles and the latter of internal atomic particles. External matter (phyi don bem po), when analyzed, comprises the five objects of visual form, sound, smell, taste, and touch. Their defining characteristics are that external matter comprises the substantial objects of visual, auditory, and olfactory consciousness, and so forth. Internal matter (nang don bem po), when analyzed, comprises the five physical sense organs of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body—their defining characteristics being that they are capable of functioning as the predominant condition (adhipatipratyaya, bdag rkyen) [prerequisite] for visual consciousness and so forth.[169]
When substantial objects are analyzed in terms of their efficiency (kāraṇa, byed pa), they include both causes (hetu, rgyu) and results (phala, 'bras bu). The defining characteristic is whether or not x, the given property, assumes a subsequent existence as a distinct object, either through positive logical concomitance (anvaya, rjes 'gro) or through negative logical concomitance (vyatireka, ldog byed).[170]

When causes are analyzed in terms of their essential nature, there are both direct causes (sākṣātkāraṇa, dngos rgyu) and indirect causes (avedhahetu, brgyud rgyu). The defining characteristics of these are respectively that in the case of the [direct] cause of a given property x, there are no [extraneous factors intervening] between the cause of the property x and its result y, as in the example of a seed and a shoot; whereas [in the case of an indirect cause], there are [extraneous intervening factors] between the cause of the given property x and its result y, just as a shoot is sequentially produced from a seed and finally [ripens] as a fruit.[171]
Causes have many subdivisions, when analyzed in terms of primary and ordinary [causes], or when analyzed in terms of their four secondary conditions, and so forth.[172]
Incidentally, with regard to the three tenses and so forth, the defining characteristic of the past is that it has elapsed, the defining characteristic of the future is that it has not yet arrived, [and the defining characteristic of the present is that it is here], just like one edge of the atom that appears before one here and now.[173] The defining characteristic of the continuum of time (santāna, rgyun) is something that has many sequential temporal moments (kṣaṇa, skad cig) which serve to establish its identity, like “year,” for example. The defining characteristic of an indivisible time moment (nivirbhāgakṣaṇika, skad cig cha med) is something that is without a sequential series of time-moments that serve to establish its identity, like, for example, the first of the sixty time-moments that constitute a fraction of a syllable.[174]

The defining characteristic of apprehended objects is that they appear and are then apperceived, as is, for example, an “object-universal” (arthasāmānya, don spyi).[175] The defining characteristic of conceived objects is that they are conceived and then apperceived, just as, for example, the [imagined] seated posture of a man dwelling in another house. The defining characteristic of applied objects is that when they are utilized either as objects to be accepted or rejected, they are [consistently] unfailing (avisaṃvādi, mi slu ba) [in their results], as, for example, when a farmer has a [productive] field that has absorbed seeds, water, fertilizer, heat, and humidity. These three categories also have many subdivisions.[176]

</d>
<d e="2">
When objects to be appraised (prameya, gzhal bya) are analyzed in terms of the processes of understanding, they are said to include both specifically characterized phenomena (svalakṣaṇa, rang mtshan) and generally characterized phenomena (sāmānyalakṣaṇa, spyi mtshan). Alternatively, they fall into three [categories]—appraisable objects that are directly evident (abhimukhī, mngon gyur), those that are indirectly evident (parokṣa, lkog gyur), and those that are indirectly evident to an extreme degree (atyantaparokṣa, shin tu lkog gyur).[177]
Now, the defining characteristic of specifically characterized phenomena is that ultimately they are causally effective, as, for example, the color blue. The defining characteristic of generally characterized phenomena is that ultimately they are not causally effective, inasmuch as they are objects that appear conceptually but are indeterminate with regard to place and time, just as, for example, the image [of a vase] as something bulbous in the middle and narrow at the base.[178]
The defining characteristic of appraisable objects that are directly evident is that they are to be understood through the valid cognition of direct perception (pratyakṣapramāṇa, mngon sum tshad ma), like, for example, the color blue. The defining characteristic of appraisable objects that are indirectly evident is that they are to be understood through the valid cognition of inference (anumānapramāṇa, rjes dpag tshad ma), as for example, when the color blue is inferred to be impermanent. Alternatively, the distinguishing characteristics of those two is that [in the valid cognition of direct perception] superimpositions (adhyāropa, sgro 'dogs) are to be eliminated through the power of experience (anubhava, myong stobs), while [in the valid cognition of inference], superimpositions are to be eliminated through the power of logical evidence (liṅga, rtags).[179]

</d>
<d e="2">
The defining characteristic of appraisable objects that are indirectly evident to an extreme degree is that they are to be understood by reliance on scriptural authority (āgama, lung), the purity of which is established by means of the three types of scrutiny (dpyad pa gsum),[180] just as, for example, the meaning demonstrated in the following [sacred] verse [from Nāgārjunas Precious Garland] is deemed to be infallible: “resources ensue through generosity, and comfort ensues through ethical discipline.”[181]
The defining characteristic of signified [phenomena] (vācya, brjod bya) is that they are to be understood through symbols (saṃketa, brda). This includes both phenomena that are termed the “conceived signified” (zhen pa'i brjod bya) and the “directly evident signified” (dngos kyi brjod bya).[182] Alternatively, there is a distinction made between theoretically signified (chad dus kyi brjod bya) and practically signified [phenomena] ('jug dus kyi brjod bya).[183] These have all been established as supplementary definitions of the term “object.”

When signifiers (vācaka, brjod byed) are analyzed in terms of their essential nature, they include nouns (nāman, ming), [syntactically bound] phrases (pada, tshig), and statements (vāk, ngag).
The defining characteristic of nouns is that they signify or express the bare essential nature of an object (yul gyi ngo bo tsam), exemplified, for example, by the term “vase.”
The defining characteristic of phrases is that they signify or express the essential nature of an object, conjoined with its attributes as well, exemplified by the expression “small vase.”
The defining characteristic of statements is that they signify, in addition to such descriptive attributes, an [illustrative] base upon which meaning may be applied or predicated,[187] as exemplified, for instance, in the sentence, “Pour water from the small vase!”

When signifiers are analyzed in terms of the signified, they include both words that signify types (rigs brjod kyi sgra) and words that signify sets (tshogs brjod kyi sgra). The defining characteristic of the former is that words are [designated as] “type-universals” (jātisāmānya, rigs spyi) when x is the signified concept that they apprehend, as in, for example, the word “form” [which has multiple instances].[188]
The defining characteristic of words that signify sets is that they are [designated as] a “conglomerate of the eight atomic substances” (aṣṭāṇudravya, rdul rdzas brgyad)[189] when x is the signified concept that they apprehend, as in, for example, the expression, “snow mountain.”

The defining characteristic of the former [a predicate-oriented expression] is that the comprehension of the signified ensues from having eliminated, with regard to its own signifying statement, other [possible] attributes of the signified concept that it apprehends, as exemplified in the statement, “an ox is explicitly the state of not being a horse” (ba lang rta min pa nyid yin no).

When signifiers are analyzed in terms of preclusion (vyavaccheda, rnam gcod), they includes three subcategories: statements expressing preclusion without a predicate (mi ldan rnam gcod kyi sgra), statements expressing preclusion with an extraneous [predicate] (gzhan ldan rnam gcod), and statements expressing preclusion of the impossible (mi srid rnam gcod).
Their defining characteristics are respectively that, [in the case of statements expressing preclusion without a predicate, ] the statement is made by appending the enclitic grammatical particle [indicating preclusion] directly after the attribute (khyad chos), that [in the case of statements expressing preclusion with an extraneous predicate] the statement is made by appending [the enclitic particle indicating preclusion] directly after the subject of the attribute (khyad gzhi), and that [in the case of words expressing preclusion of the impossible] the statement is made by appending [the enclitic particle indicating preclusion] directly to the verb “to be possible” These three categories may be illustrated respectively as follows: The first is exemplified by the statement “Citrā, the skilled archer alone,..” (nag pa 'phongs skyen pa kho na..); the second by the statement “Arjuna alone is a skilled archer” (srid sgrub kho na 'phongs skyen..); and the third by the statement “a lotus can only be blue” (mtsho skyes la sngon po srid pa kho na...).[191]

When the conceived signifier is analyzed, it includes both the directly evident conceived signifier (dngos kyi zhen pa'i brjod byed) and the implicitly conceived signifier (shugs kyi zhen pa'i brjod byed).[192] These may be exemplified respectively in the context of the following statement: “A vase is permanent insofar as the impermanence of the vase that is directly [conceived] and the impermanence of the vase that is implicitly [conceived] are both implicatively negated.”

As an addendum [to this discussion on the subject, let us consider], both syllables (varṇa, yi ge) and individual persons (pudgala, gang zag):
The defining characteristic of syllables is that though individually they are not causally effective, when they form a set comprising anything from one and a half [syllables] upwards, the words that they form are an amalgam of many indivisible time moments and can be causally effective.

The terms “intellect” (buddhi, blo), “awareness” (vidyā, rig pa), and “consciousness” (jñāna, shes pa) are all coextensive. When analyzed, [this cognizance] comprises ten aspects, namely, valid or reliable forms of cognition (pramāṇa, tshad ma), non-valid or unreliable forms of cognition (apramāṇa, tshad min), conceptual cognition (kalpanā, rtog pa), non-conceptual cognition (nirvikalpanā, rtog med), mistaken cognition (bhrānti, 'khrul pa), unmistaken cognition (abhrānti, ma 'khrul), intrinsic or reflexive awareness (svasaṃvedana, rang rig), and extraneous awareness (anyasaṃvid, gzhan rig), along with mind (citta, sems) and mental states (caitta, sems byung).
Among them, the defining characteristic of valid cognition is that the intellect understands its own objects as they newly arise. The defining characteristic of non-valid cognition is that the intellect does not understand its own objects as they newly arise.[194]
The defining characteristic of conceptual cognition is that, if it has its own apparent object, then that must be a generally characterized phenomenon (sāmānyalakṣaṇa, spyi mtshan).[195] The defining characteristic of non-conceptual cognition is that if the given consciousness has its own apparent object, then that must be without any specifically characterized phenomenon or any established basis whatsoever.[196]
The defining characteristic of mistaken consciousness is that it apprehends x although x does not exist, while the defining characteristic of unmistaken consciousness is that it cognizes the real nature of its object.
The defining characteristic of intrinsic or reflexive awareness is that it is the apprehending consciousness ('dzin pa'i rnam shes), while the defining characteristic of extraneous awareness is that it is consciousness of the apprehended (gzung ba'i rnam shes).[197]
The defining characteristic of mind is that, with regard to the object and the attributes of an object, it cognizes only the object. When analyzed, the mind comprises the six or eight modes of consciousness (rnam shes tshogs drug gam brgyad).[198] The defining characteristic of mental states is that they cognize the particular attributes of an object. When analyzed, they comprise the fifty-one mental states (sems byung lnga bcu rtsa gcig).[199]
Although these aforementioned [aspects of the cognizing subject] have a great many subcategories, I will not digress further at this point.

[The Conclusions of Valid Cognition]
It is explained that the conclusions of valid cognition (pramāṇaphala, tshad 'bras) should also be understood on the basis of the following incidental comments that relate to these [categories of direct perception and inference].
Although there are many systematic presentations [that could be made], briefly stated, the successful conclusion (grub 'bras) of a given presentation is achieved with reference to its causal basis. [Therefore, in the case of direct perception, ] let us take, for example, the unmistaken apprehension of the color “blue” as an illustration (mtshan gzhi). The defining characteristic is that consciousness arises in conformity with its object. The conclusion of the valid cognition is that the term [blue] on the basis of which the material object in question is understood can then be applied.
Similarly, in the case of inference, let us take the statement that “sound is impermanent” as the object of appraisal. An image of sound being impermanent arises from the understanding of the proof that sound is impermanent, in which all the three criteria are fully present. Valid cognition then refers to the consciousness which is infallible with regard to the statement “sound is impermanent” whenever it newly arises. The conclusion of this inference is that sound is directly understood to be impermanent.

For example, taking “gold” and “vase” respectively as the particular and the phenomenon, there is a relation of essential identity between “vase” and “gold,” but there are also established to be many other particulars, such as “copper vase,” “clay vase,” and so forth, which are identified with the phenomenon “vase” and are not the [particular] “golden vase.”

The defining characteristic of a defined object or definiendum is that the three properties of conventional terminology (tha snyad chos gsum) are fully present, whereas the defining characteristic of the absence of a defined object is that the three properties of conventional terminology are not fully present. The three properties of conventional terminology are cognition, signification, and application or engagement (shes brjod 'jug gsum).[219] Incidentally, the defining characteristic of the term “illustration” (mtshan gzhi) is that it is the basis upon which a defined object is defined to be in accordance with its defining characteristic.[220]
When the defects of a definition are analyzed, there are said to be three such defects, namely, the defect of a definition that has no logical entailment (vyāptiy khyab pa), the defect of a definition that has excessive logical entailment, and the defect of a definition that is not present in its [proposed] illustration. These [defects] are exemplified respectively as follows:
(1) When “stripes, including the hump” are presented as the definition of an ox, the expression “stripes including the hump” has no logical entailment in respect of an ox.
(2) When “cephalic” is presented as the definition of an ox, the expression “cephalic” has excessive logical entailment in respect of an ox.
(3) When “humped and so forth” is presented as the definition of a horse and an ox, the [proposed] illustration “humped and so forth” is not present in respect of the [definiendum] horse.
Alternatively, the term “definition” can be analyzed in terms of the so-called eight ostensible factors (ltar snang brgyad).[221]

The defining characteristic of counter logical entailment is that the reason or evidence x is ascertained [by valid cognition] to be absent exclusively in the non-analogous term or incompatible factor (vipakṣa, mi mthun phyogs), in accordance with the logical proof that is presented.[224]
These three criteria may be exemplified as follows: “When sound is presented or stated to be impermanent, sound, the subject for discussion, is impermanent because it has been created. Just like a vase, for example, so has sound also been created.” Here, sound is the subject for discussion, the basis for the debate (adhikaraṇa, rtsod gzhi). “Impermanent” is the property of the probandum (sādhyadharma, bsgrub bya'i chos). “Sound is impermanent” is the probandum (sādhya, bsgrub bya). “Created” is the evidence (linga, rtags) or reason (hetu, gtan tshigs); and “vase” is the analogous example (sādharmyadṛṣṭānta, mthun dpe). Now, the criterion of “sound” (x), presented [here] as the subject for discussion, the basis for the debate, being “created” (y), which is presented as the evidence, requires an acceptance (mthung snang) in the mind of both the [antagonist] who presents the statement of proof and [the respondent or protagonist] who is the focus of this presentation. The correct formulation of this [criterion] is the property of the thesis that is to be established through valid cognition. [The second criterion,] forward logical entailment, is represented [in this example] by the words “is created,” and [the third criterion,] inverse or negative logical entailment, is represented by the [implied] statement, “permanent things are uncreated.”[225]

When genuine reason or evidence is quantifiably analyzed, there are said to be three kinds of [genuine] evidence, namely, the [genuine] evidence associated with the axiom of the result (kāryahetu, 'bras bu'i gtan tshigs), the axiom of identity (svabhāvahetu, rang bzhin gyi gtan tshigs), and the axiom of the absence of the objective referent (anupalabdhihetu, ma dmigs pa'i gtan tshigs).[226]
When analyzed in terms of its objectives, [genuine reason] may be applied both for one's own sake (rang don gyi rtags) and for the sake of others (gzhan don gyi rtags).

The defining characteristic of ostensible examples is that they start out as the definitive basis for logical entailment with regard to a definitive probandum, but they are incapable of being definitive. Moreover, although there are many other defective types of evidence and examples, they may be illustrated by the aforementioned.[230] These should all be determined and then rejected.

[Purpose of the Collected Topics]
The [reasoning of the] Collected Topics, [summarized above, ] is valuable because it facilitates the education of newcomers (lit. those of fresh intelligence) with regard to objects of knowledge. By presenting an uncommon subject for discussion, the basis for the debate should be recognized as directly evident. Once this recognition has dawned, the essential points of negation and proof should be applied. These will arise in the mind and it is through them that one's own thesis can be presented. If a respondent engages, one can then ensure that his evidence is not proven, that his argument is without logical entailment, and that he will categorically accept your position three times.[135] Thereby, the intellectual brilliance of the other party will be eclipsed, and the other party will conclusively accept your logical concomitance, entailments, and observations with regard to scriptural authority and logical reasoning.
This merely partial exegesis [of the Collected Topics] leaves unchanged the special technical terms that are employed in the tradition of logical reasoning that is prestigious nowadays in modern circles.[236]
The particle ste at the end of this verse is a connecting particle (lhag bcas kyi sgra).

There are also different traditions, including the one known as the ancients' tradition of valid cognition (tshad ma snga rabs pa'i lugs), which was widely propagated by [Kadampa masters] such as the great Ngok Lotsāwa and Chapa Choseng, which are similar in their treatment of universal distinguishing counterparts of the signified object (brjod bya'i spyi ldog) but slightly dissimilar in their defense of standpoints concerning the signifier (brjod byed khas len skyong tshul).[239]
[This last mentioned system] includes, for example, the following summarization [of the terminology of logical reasoning] in eighteen collected topics (bsdus tshan bco brgyad):[240]
O monks of Kyetshal! [The topics] are (1) the colors white and red (kha dog dkar dmar); (2) substance phenomena and distinguishing counterpart phenomena (rdzas chos ldog chos gnyis); (3) contradictions and non-contradictions ('gal dang mi 'gal); (4) universals and particulars (spyi dang bye brag gnyis); (5) relation and non-relation ('brel dang mi 'brel); (6) difference and non-difference (tha dad dang tha min gnyis); (7) positive and negative concomitance (rjes su 'gro ldog); (8) cause and result (rgyu dang 'bras bu gnyis); (9) cogency of the antagonist, mediator, and respondent (snga btsan bar btsan phyi btsan);[241] (10) definition and definiendum (mtshan mtshon gnyis); (11) multi-faceted evidence and multi-faceted elimination (rtags mang bsal mang); (12) the two procedures for adding negation (dgag pa phar tshul gnyis); (13) direct contradiction and indirect contradiction (dngos 'gal brgyud 'gal); (14) the two aspects of logical congruence (khyab mnyam rnam pa gnyis); (15) presence and absence (yin gyur min gyur), and (16) their opposites (yin log min log gnyis); (17) understanding of existence and understanding of non-existence (yod rtogs med rtogs); and (18) explicit understanding and evidential understanding (dngos rtogs rtags rtogs gnyis).
Although there are many such [categorizations of the terminologies of logical reasoning], they can be principally subsumed under these [eighteen topics].[242]

Directly evident objects of appraisal include
(1) the five sensory activity fields (pañcāyatana, skye mched lnga) comprising visible, audible, olfactory, gustatory, and tangible forms, which can eliminate superimposition through the experiential power of direct perception, an extraneous or non-apperceptive awareness of external objects that refers to the immediately visible [world];[243]
(2) the sensory activity fields of the six modes of consciousness (ṣadvijñāna, rnam shes tshogs drug),[244] which are experienced through the valid cognition of intrinsic or reflexive awareness[245] and only with reference to objects of experience (myong bya) based on the consciousness that can eliminate superimpositions through logical reasoning;
(3) the aspects of experiential awareness associated with mental states that relate collectively to the sensory activity field of phenomena (dharmāyatana, chos kyi skye mched).[246]
Although there are realists (dngos por smra ba rnams) who [additionally] hold that, in the case of a sublime being, the abiding nature of selflessness including the sixteen aspects of the four truths (ṣodaśākāravisāritacaturārya satya, bden chung bcu drug), beginning with impermanence (anitya, mi rtag pa),[247] and in the case of a buddha, all quantifiable objects of knowledge[248] are directly evident, Dharmakīrti has said that the processes of cognition that a buddha experiences are inconceivable.[249] Therefore, direct perception, as a means of appraising the [range of] objects that are to be appraised, is said to comprise the four following categories: direct perception of the sense organs, direct perception of mental consciousness, direct perception of intrinsic awareness, and direct perception of yoga.

Indirectly evident objects of appraisal include the physical sense faculties (dbang po gzugs can); the sixteen aspects of the four truths, such as impermanence, the suffering of change (vipariṇāmaduḥkhatā, 'gyur ba'i sdug bsngal), the emptiness of self ātmaśūnyatā, bdag gi bas stong pa), and selflessness (anātmaka, bdag med);[250] the selflessness of the individual person (pudgalanairātmya, gang zag gi bdag med), exemplified by these [aspects of the four truths], and the selflessness of phenomena (dharmanairātmya, chos kyi bdag med);[251] as well as [the concepts of] identical nature (ekātman, bdag gcig) and relation of identical nature (tadātmyasaḥbandha, de byung gi 'brel ba),[252] primary causes (hetu, rgyu) or potentialities (śakti, nus pa), the seeds of dissonant and purified mental states (sems kyi steng gi kun byang),[253] the activities associated with renunciation and antidotes (spang gnyen),[254] and so forth. These are all indirectly evident—the second category of objects of appraisal—because they have to be established exclusively through logical axioms proceeding from the cogent power of facts (vastubalapravṛrttahetu, dngos po stobs zhugs kyi gtan tshigs).
There are also objects of appraisal that cannot be established through the direct perception of an individual person and require reference to pure [authoritative] sources [see below].[255]
There are three kinds of logical axiom dependent on inference, which appraise and establish these [indirectly evident] objects of appraisal through the cogent power of facts. These are termed the axiom of the result, the axiom of identity, and the axiom of the absence of the objective referent.[256]

Objects that are indirectly evident to an extreme degree include those such as virtuous and non-virtuous actions which cannot be established by either direct perception or the axioms of the cogent power of facts, and therefore have to be understood on the basis of scriptural authority alone. For this reason, scriptures of which the purity is not established by three kinds of scrutiny only obstruct or impede certainty because they demonstrate or represent heretical [views]. On the other hand, [scriptures] of which purity can be established by the three kinds of scrutiny contain words of definitive meaning (nītārtha, nges don), without resorting to terms that express a flawed conviction, the need for a [concealed] intention, and so forth.[257]
The diverse technical language employed in logical reasoning exclusively derives from these basic categories.
As far as the three kinds of scrutiny are concerned, [reasoning based on scriptural authority] is not contradicted by direct perception with regard to directly evident objects, nor by inference through the cogent power of facts with regard to indirectly evident objects, nor by contradictions inherent in the sequence of [authoritative] utterances with regard to objects that are indirectly evident to an extreme degree.

[Concerning the fifth modality, the correct view, the text] continues:
Moreover, according to the logical reasoning of the Collected Topics, Upon scrutiny, neither beginning nor end will be found,
Nor will there be any abiding in a middle position.
All standpoints will be destroyed.
When one is without beginning or end,
Without referring to a middle [position],
Without standpoints, and without philosophical systems,
That is the Great Madhyamaka.[261]
Those verses therefore refer to the conclusion of valid cognition, the direct determination that all things are without self (anātmaka, bdag med) and free from conceptual elaboration (niḥprapañca, spros bral).[262] This is the view that offers an introduction to the Middle Way, as summarized systematically by mighty lords of logical reasoning, great beings endowed with the precious [teachings of] sadhana and tantra (sgrub rgyud), such as [Zhamar VI] Gar-wang Chokyi Wangchuk.[263]

Since [at this juncture,] it would be inappropriate not to establish the points of the textual traditions through the scrutiny of logical reasoning, if I may incidentally make some ad-hoc comments concerning preliminary engagement in the logical techniques, according to the Collected Topics, this will have two parts: The first concerns the modes of recognizing evidence and specific predicates (rtags gsal gyi ngos 'dzin) and the second concerns the rejoinders made by the respondent to the antagonist (snga rgol la phyi rgol gyis lan brjod tshul).

The former requires a definitive logical axiom, [presented] through valid cognition in which the three criteria are fully present. Let us take, for example, the statement, “It follows that the vase, the subject for discussion, is impermanent, because it has been created.” For the antagonist who accepts this statement:
(1) the criterion of the property of the thesis (phyogs chos kyi tshul) is certain because the given evidence “created” (x) is applicable to the subject of discussion, the “vase”;
(2) the criterion of positive concomitance is certain because the given evidence “created” (x) is not contradicted by either the property of the probandum or the specific predicate (gsal) “impermanent”; and
(3) the criterion of the distinguishing counterpart is certain because, in respect of the given evidence “created” (x), there is no absence of certainty with regard to the specific predicate “impermanent.”
If a given [proposition] in which these three criteria are fully present is to be determined through valid cognition, the respondent is required to answer.

Among these [invalid forms], first, concerning non-establishment with regard to the proof of the thesis, the defining characteristic of the term “unestablished” (ma grub pa) is illustrated, for example, by the statement, “It follows that the vase, the subject for discussion, is impermanent, because it has not been created.” Here, the given evidence “not been created” (x) does not apply to the subject for discussion, the “vase.” Also, in the statement, “It follows that the vase, the subject for discussion, is permanent, because it has not been created,” both the evidence and the specific predicate are inapplicable to the subject for discussion, the “vase.”
Again, in the statement, “Taking ‘in many places over here’ as the subject for discussion, it follows that there are peacocks, because the sound of the peacock is heard,” in this case, the evidence is not established because there is room for doubt with regard to the subject of the discussion.
Also, in the statement, “Taking ‘this ground over there’ as the subject for discussion, it follows that there is fire, because there is some kind of smoky vapor,” here the evidence is not established because there is room for doubt with regard to the evidence.
Also, in the statement, “Taking the children of a barren woman as the subject for discussion, it follows that they are noble because they are of a good family,” in this case the evidence is not established on account of the non-existence of the subject for discussion. In all these cases, the respondent should say, “The evidence is unestablished!”[265]

Second, contradictory reasoning ('gal ba'i gtan tshigs) is that in which the probandum is established by a contradictory proof.

This may be illustrated, for example, by the statement, “It follows that the color of a ruby, the subject for discussion, is red, because it is a color” Here, the given evidence “color” (x) is compatible with the red of ruby, but because it may also be applied to other properties of the thesis, such as a white conch, it is incompatible or contradictory.

(2) If the specific predicate of the probandum is contradictory, logical entailment is contradicted.
(3) [Even] though the specific predicate of the probandum is certain, the logical entailment may be unascertained.
If the evidence x does not at all apply to the subject under discussion, even though there is some uncertainty with regard to contradiction of the specific predicate, one may respond that the evidence is not established.

Moreover, when the eight approaches to logical entailment (khyab pa sgo brgyad) are considered:
(1) [Positive] forward logical entailment (anvayavyāpti, rjes khyab) takes the form, “If x is the evidence, it is logically entailed that the specific predicate is y.”
(2) [Positive] contrary entailment (viruddhavyāpti, 'gal khyab) takes the form, “If x is the evidence,[268] it is logically entailed that the distinctive predicate is not y.”
(3) [Positive] backward entailment (heṣṭhavyāpti, thur khyab)[269] takes the form, “Ify is the specific predicate, it is logically entailed that the evidence is x.”
(4) [Positive] counter entailment (vyatirekavyāpti, ldog khyab) takes the form, “If y is not the specific predicate, it is logically entailed that the evidence is not x.”
In brief, one should know also that, in the case of four kinds [of logical entailment]—comp rising forward and contrary positive entailment and their negative forms — the specific predicate arises from the evidence, whereas in the case of the other four kinds [of logical entailment] — comprising backward and counter positive entailment and their negative forms—the evidence arises from the specific predicate, and so forth.

[Conclusion]
In general, with regard to the reasons for engaging in debate, innate discriminative awareness will be enhanced, the mind will be trained in Sanskrit grammar and logic, and the mind will be trained in one's own [Buddhist] textual traditions and in those of others.
As for the graceful trappings or finery associated with debate, [debate will engender] a clear complexion; pleasant and gentle speech, refraining from verbal assaults that would humiliate an opponent; clarity and sharpness with regard to scriptural authority and logical reasoning; avoidance of idleness and arrogance; avoidance of deception, attachment, and aversion that forsake the path of logical reasoning; and dedication to the well-being of oneself and others, along with the Buddhist teaching.
With regard to the similes that illustrate the term “debate,” “debate” is purposefully said to resemble a wheel that cuts off one's own delusions and those of others, or to resemble a mountain that cannot be shaken by the winds of refutation, or else to resemble a child of Munīndra, undeluded with regard to words and their meanings.
Then, as for the result of engaging in debate, one's own mind will be satisfied by the increasing understanding that is contingent on the reasons for engaging in debate, as well as by its fine trappings, [stimulating] ideas, and excellently constructed syllogisms (sbyor ba). [In addition, ] good reputation will permeate all directions, and one will become a king of the sacred teachings, intent on protecting the Buddhist teaching. It is for such ends that [debate] should be studied.

With regard to the arts, which may be earnestly pursued for all intents and purposes, it is said in the Transmissions on Monastic Discipline:[270]
The [construction of] monastic campuses (ārāma),
The [building of] great temples (vihāra),
The [making of] mattresses,
The prolonging of life,
The nursing of those who suddenly fall ill,
Acts of charity [undertaken] in places and times of destitution: These are the so-called “seven merits derived from material things”[271] Among them, the first, second, and fourth generate pure merit.
It is also said that the building of stūpas containing essential relics in places where they did not previously exist, the construction of monastic campuses endowed with [appropriate] resources, the act of reconciling monastic disputes, and the engagement, during periods [of meditative absorption], in the fourfold meditation of the four immeasurable aspirations (caturaprameya)— loving-kindness (maitrī), and so forth—which are foremost among the [diverse] modes of spiritual practice,[272] all have the same ripening effect, generating pure merit.
[Furthermore, ] all [material] things that are deemed necessary for the Buddhist teachings and mundane activities cannot be created or achieved without relying on this science [of fine arts]; and it has even been suggested that disrespect for the arts is a philosophical tenet associated [not with the Buddhists but] with the Nirgrantha Jains.[273] Therefore, it is most important to understand this subject.
Although the [diverse] artistic traditions are infinite, all aspects of knowledge—not only the arts—can be categorized in terms of the “fine arts of the three media” [body, speech, and mind], for which reason scholars have formulated the systematic presentation, outlined here:
(1) While mental activity precedes all [forms of artistic expression], the arts of the body (lus bzo) are so called because they emphasize physicality, motivated by [mind]. They may be exemplified by the first two items in the series “dancing, drawing, and singing.”
(2) The arts of speech (ngag bzo) are so called because they emphasize verbal and vocal forms of expression, exemplified by the third item in that same series.
(3) The arts of the mind (yid bzo) [by contrast] are those that are achieved by means of mental activity [alone], without emphasizing either body or speech, and they may be exemplified by the extraordinary knowledge (rig shes) associated with processes of thought.[274]

The artists who create these representations [of buddha body] potentially possess both faults and virtues. Firstly, as to their [possible] faults, the following verses are found in the Ocean of Wealth:[275]
Poorly trained and arrogant,
Unsociable but desirous of veneration,
Scornful [of newly offered commissions] in the short term But over-interested in the long term,
Satiated with donations while demanding extravagant fees,
Unsatisfied even by that and pilfering materials,
Stopping work for mere trifles,
Menacing people and seeking [solace] in dark wine,
They transform virtuous actions into negative acts.
Faults such as these should not be acquired.
[Conversely, the virtues of an artist] are mentioned in the following verses from the Tantra of Embrace:[276]
They should be disciplined, pious, and in the prime of life,
Endowed with lucid sense-faculties and free from doubt,
Without anger, avoiding secretive behavior and procrastination,
But highly skilled and jovial,
Patient, and compassionate.

And in the Ocean of Wealth:[277]
Not over-ambitious but honorable,
They should be skilled, humble, and obedient,
Respectful of the deities, and well-behaved.
When one who is naturally endowed with these defining characteristics of an artist and possessed of skilled attributes begins working, he or she should perform rites of ablution and cleanliness and assume the observances of the one-day vows (upavāsa) in the presence of an image [of a deity] that is not in sexual union, and in accordance with the outer [vehicles] of the way of secret mantra.[278] He or she should also have received the empowerments (abhiṣeka) of the deities, according to the inner [vehicles] of the way of secret mantra, and while maintaining the [relevant] commitments (saṃvara) and deity yoga in an isolated retreat, unseen by ordinary people, should have repeatedly presented offering tormas (mchod gtor) and sacraments (dam rdzas).[279]
It is also said that all artists should generate [the visualization of] themselves as Vairocana or Vighnāntaka, and even visualize their materials and tools as Vairocana.[280] The marking threads and colors should be consecrated or blessed through a rite derived from the [appropriate] maṇḍala ritual (maṇḍalavidhi).[281] [Similarly, ] scribes or writers (yig mkhan) should also generate [the visualization] of themselves as Amitābha, and the method of consecrating their pens and ink is explained to resemble [the consecration of] a rosary and so forth.[282] It is important that these procedures are unequivocally implemented when commencing work for the first time.

Incidentally, the [potential] faults and virtues of the patrons who commission sacred images are also outlined. The former are described as follows in the Ocean of Wealth:[283]
Not avoiding negative actions, and poorly motivated,
Neglectful of benefits and lacking conviction,
Ambitious for fame in this life
Whether having or lacking the will to achieve [the task in hand],
Broad-minded in inappropriate circumstances,
Short-tempered, fickle, and intolerant,
Cursing the deities and the artists,
While interrupting [their projects] out of regret.
It is essential that a [patron] should never possess these faults. As for the latter, [their potential virtues, ] the same text says:[284]
They should be endowed with insight that discerns advantages, Endowed with one-pointed concentration,
Endowed with perseverance that is stable and joyful,
Unmoved by hardships, and tolerant,
Slow-tempered, gentle in speech, and ethically disciplined, Undeceitful and endowed with generosity,
Full of faith and respect for the deities and the artists,
And they should joyfully meditate in an orderly manner.[285]
It also says in the Tantra of Acala:
One who commissions an authentic painting Should offer whatever fee is requested.
And in the Tantra of Consecration:
The being of pristine cognition (jñānasattva) will not enter [The image of] a deity fashioned by an artist who is displeased.[286] At the start of the consecration, the artist should be pleased.
In many sūtras and tantras such as these the commitment of the patron to satisfy the artist is emphasized. Since to criticize the artist is tantamount to criticizing the deity [he has recreated], it is important that faith and respect should be awarded the artist, like that directed towards a deity, or as if attending upon a [revered] spiritual advisor. Nowadays, though representations of buddha body, speech, and mind are bought and sold, the outcome might still be positive when the artists and their patrons bravely assess the value [of their works], determining the price appropriate in [particular] places and times. However, I would incidentally comment that the kind of salesman s talk in which Newars and Tibetans currently indulge is, by contrast, a causal basis giving rise to serious criminality in respect of both parties.[287]

Painted icons (bris sku) representing [the visualized deities of] meditative commitment (dam tshig), which accord with the texts of their respective tantras, are the best of all images. In chapter six of the second part of the Tantra of Hevajra this is explained from the standpoint of the unsurpassed [tantras], in the following verses:[288]
In this [Hevajra tradition], the painter who maintains the commitments,
And also the practitioner who maintains the commitments,
Should create this fearsome icon [of Hevajra].
Unsurpassed paintings should be created With the five colors reposing in a human skull,
And a brush made from the hair of a corpse.
Those [assistants] who spin the threads and those who weave the canvases
Should certainly maintain the same commitments![289] In this way, a yogin who maintains the commitments And has received the [appropriate] blessings [Should proceed] to an isolated place At midday on the fourteenth day of the waning moon,
And in a ferocious state of mind,
Having consumed a little wine,
He should visualize the body
Adorned with human bone ornaments (niraṃśuka)
And having removed his clothes,
He should consume the sacraments,
However foul and impure they are,
Having placed to the left side his own female medium (mudrā),
She who is of fine complexion, compassionate,
Youthful and auspicious,
Adorned with flowers, and loved by the practitioner.
It is also said that paintings should be executed in accordance with the eloquent explanations given in the Root Tantra of Mañjuśrī concerning the very extensive ritual procedures that pertain to the size of the canvases and the painting, as well as to their limitless advantages and benefits.[290]
Furthermore, it is said in the Tantra of the Emergence of Cakrasaṃvara:
Novice mantrins should fashion images and so forth.
If they make paintings, they will swiftly Attain extensive spiritual accomplishments!

It should be one hundred and twenty.
The [Tantra of the] Four [Indestructible] Seats is similar [to the latter],
While the [Tantras of Red and Black [Yamāri] calculate eight face-length measures.
The Sūtra [Requested by Śāriputra] and [other ancient] Indic texts Are [generally] in conformity with those [works],
And there are [contemporary] traditions that follow them as well.

In this regard, it is said in the Wheel of Time, king of tantras:[292]
As for [the standing image of the Buddha, ] lord among conquerors, [the vertical measurement] from the protuberance on the crown of the head (uṣṇīsa) to the hair ringlet between the eyebrows (ūrṇākeśa) should be twelve and a half relative finger-widths (sārdhasūrya, phyed dang bcas pa nyi ma'i sor).[293]
Then, from that point to the lotus of his throat, and similarly from that point to the heart, and from that point to the lotus of his navel and from there to the genitalia, the measurements are each the same [i. e., 12. 5 finger-widths].[294]
The soles of the feet are fourteen (manu) fingerwidths [in length and four and a half in height],[295] while the calves, the thighs, the hips and also [the knees][296] are respectively twenty-five (tattva), twenty-five (tattva), four (veda), [and four finger-widths].[297]
[As for the horizontal measurements, ] each half of the chest is twelve and a half [finger-widths], while the upper arm, the forearm, [the elbow and wrist] and the hand are respectively twenty (khākṣi), sixteen (rāja), [two] and twelve (arka) [finger-widths].[298]
These one hundred and twenty-five [finger-widths][299] correspond to the mundane [physical] dimensions of human beings of diverse times. However, [the vertical measurements of the Buddhas head are distinctive]: From the protuberance on the crown of his head downwards, as far as the the glorious forehead and nose of the lord among conquerors, and from the nose down to the point of the chin and from there to the center of the lotus at the base of the throat, the measurements are respectively four finger-widths [for the protuberance], four and a half [skull to hairline],[300] four (jalanidhi)[301] [hairline to ūrṇākeśa], four [ūrṇākeśa to the tip of the nose], four and a half [tip of the nose to the point of the chin], and four [point of the chin to the throat].[302]
The iconometric measurements made in respect of [the Buddha], lord of men, from the throat to the heart, navel, and genitalia, in succession, are each twelve and a half finger-widths.
With these words, [the Tantra of the Wheel of Time] clearly mentions only the [overall iconometric scale] of one hundred and twenty-five finger-widths, an interpretation which is found extensively also in the outer and inner virtuous practices (phyi nang gi dge sbyor) associated with the maṇḍala [rites of the Wheel of Time] , and so forth.[303]

By contrast, in Chapter Thirty of the [Tantra of] the Emergence of Cakrasaṃvara, which is an exegetical tantra pertaining to [the cycle of] Cakrasaṃvara, it is said:
There are measurements and defining characteristics of form [prescribed],
In respect of the drawn [or painted] images of a deity.[304]
Before the axial Brahmā lines are formed,[305]
Five units are [reserved] for the plinth [of the image],
And the body [of the icon] has three sections...
This passage clearly goes on to mention [the scales] of twelve, ten, and nine relative palm-length measures (tāla, thal mo) and so forth, which are all based on [an overall iconometric scale comprising] one hundred and twenty finger-widths.[306]
The explanation given in the Exegetical Tantra of the Four Indestructible Seats: Mantra Section is mostly similar to this, except for [a few] distinctive variations, and it omits any reference to the scale of nine face-length measures (zhal tshad)[307] However, master Ratnarakṣita's “evasive exegesis” (kyog bshad) [on iconometry], contained in his Lotus Commentary on the Tantra of the Emergence of Cakrasaṃvara, is incapable of grasping the meaning of that tantra text because his presentation failed to examine [the work of] renowned contemporary Magadhan and Newar artists.[308]

Moreover, the [iconometric scales] suggested in the Sūtra Requested by Śāriputra, certainly in its [earlier] translation based on the Newar manuscript, and also in its later translation, largely conform with those given in the [Tantra of the] Wheel of Time.[310] The Compendium of Rituals[311] also quotes various passages from this same sūtra text.
[It should be pointed out that] there are some citations well known from Indic texts that were prevalent in ancient times, which are in conformity with the aforementioned sources; and where there are slight discrepancies, these are even now discernible in the [contemporary artistic] traditions that follow those [distinctive] tantra texts. It is utterly pointless, therefore, for later scholars [of the present day] to seek to refute any of these [traditions]. For this reason, the venerable Jonang Jetsun Chenpo [Tāranātha] has said:[312]
The fine arts, the compounding of medicines,
The rites of the [way of secret] mantra and the profound reality— These are not [subjects] to be intellectually scrutinized by sophistry.
It is right to abandon egotistical assertions and pride.

With regard to the particular terminology of [anthropometric] measurement, twelve and a half or twelve finger-widths (aṅgulī, rang sor) are equivalent to one face-length measure (mukha, zhal tshad); and [one should know that] the face-length measure itself has five other synonymous terms, including the mid-finger span (vitasti, mtho),[313] the palm-length measure (tāla, thal mo), the palm or sole measure (tāla, mthil), and the large unit (cha chen). Different sizes of face-length measure may be applied, according to the circumstances of the two [aforementioned] tantra traditions [those of the Wheel of Time and the Emergence of Cakrasaṃvara].
A single relative finger-width is also known as a small unit (plava, cha chung), one fourth of a [small unit] is known as a quarter (pada, rkang pa), and one eighth [of a small unit] is known as a barley grain (java, nas)?[314]
There are five basic [anthropometric] scales which are to be applied. The first is the measurement [of icons] scaled at one hundred and twenty-five finger-widths and the second is the scale of one hundred and twenty finger-widths, which correspond respectively to the [aforementioned] traditions of the Wheel of Time and the Emergence of Cakrasaṃvara. The third and fourth are the measurements [of icons] scaled respectively at nine and eight palm-lengths. All these four [anthropometric] scales appropriate for deity icons are actually presented in the sūtras and the tantras; and since these [sources] are uncorrupted with regard to the artistic heritage of the learned, intelligent persons should make painstaking efforts [to master them].[315]

The first three of these iconometric scales [respectively comprising 125, 120, and 108 finger-widths] are applied, in the appropriate manner, when drawing male and female tathāgatas, male and female bodhisattvas, and male and female wrathful deities who preside over a maṇḍala, as well as the forms of the supreme buddha body of emanation (nirmāṇakāya), which are depicted without consort, and so forth.[316] The fourth category [comprising ninety-six finger-widths] should be applied in respect of extremely wrathful deities, such as Yamāntaka and Vajrapāṇi.[317]
The fifth category represents an [indigenous] tradition associated with the learned and accomplished masters of Tibet that later emerged.[318] It includes the exegetical tradition according to which [protector deities], such as Mahākāla, who assume the forms of intermediaries (pho nya) and ogres (srin po) are drawn against a scale of [seventy-two relative finger-widths or] six palm-length measures, and another exegetical tradition according to which Mahākāla may also be drawn against a [smaller] scale of three face-length measures.[319] Ratnarakṣita and certain Newar scholars also explain that Gaṇapati and related figures [should be drawn] against a scale of [sixty finger-widths or] five face-length measures.[320]
Since there is no space here to detail the practical application of these [anthropometric scales], those who wish to understand the subject should consult the Origin of Happiness: A Description of Iconometric Proportions, which is among the Collected Works of Jetsun [Tāranātha] Rinpoche, and surpasses even ordinary Indic texts.[321]

Concerning the application of the [first] four of these scales, this text says:[322]
There is a similarity between the male and female tathāgatas depicted in union,
And the male and female bodhisattvas depicted in union.
Since [the latter] are the offspring of the conquerors,
Born into the buddha family,
The bodhisattvas and buddhas are similar.
Therefore, the [first] three iconometric scales
Are applicable when all the buddhas and bodhisattvas are depicted in union.
If one wishes to differentiate between them,
Since there is a distinction between the slender and stocky [physiques],
Appropriate for the peaceful and wrathful deities respectively,
The scale of one hundred and twenty-five [finger-widths]
Applies in the case of peaceful buddhas,
And the scale of one hundred and twenty [finger-widths]
Applies in the case of the [wrathful] herukas,
But there are also certain distinctive features of the glorious bodies of the herukas
That may require them [to be drawn]
Utilizing the scale of eight palm-lengths.[323]
[Female] forms such as Buddhalocanā and Tara are similar to the peaceful [deities],
While [wrathful female forms such as] Vajravārāhī are similar to the herukas.[324]
Even though these [female forms] lack the crown protuberance (uṣṇīṣa),.
It is not wrong to include a crown jewel as a substitute.
All female deities should have [the following attributes]
Because they typify the feminine form:
No crown protuberance, but breasts and pudendum,
A slender waist, tapering torso, fullness of the hips and lower body, Tapering brows, wide sidelong-glancing eyes, and so forth.
The male consorts should be depicted oppositely.
The remainder [of the deities] should be [drawn] along those lines, And the great bodhisattvas [of the tenth level] are similar,[325] Whereas the scale of nine mid-finger spans applies to ordinary bodhisattvas,
Mundane peaceful deities such as Śakra,[326] Emanational wrathful figures [apart from the herukas],
And female deities, conforming to their respective families.[327] If these [icons] are to be drawn correctly and according to scale,
By following this categorization, the drawing will turn out well.

With regard to the iconometric scale used for depicting human figures which is mentioned in the Wheel of Time, although it is applicable for the drawing of pious attendants (śrāvaka), it is not included among the categories of iconometric scale appropriate for representing deity [icons].[328] However, since the hermit buddhas (pratyekabuddha) are more sublime on account of their [small] crown protuberances, and so forth, they are said to be included among [figures drawn] according to the scale of nine relative palm-lengths.[329] [The same source] continues:[330]
There are also some individual images which should be depicted
According to their own idiosyncratic forms,
Without the need for conformity in their iconometric proportions.
Iconometric scales are established so as to prevent [the execution of] poor art,
But when works are created by saintly beings
Who have excellently refined their magical skill with respect to the essentials of art,
[The need for such scales] is uncertain.

(4) wrathful buddhas or herukas, including Cakrasaṃvara, Hevajra and Kālacakra;[331]
(5) wrathful deities drawn against a scale of nine palm-lengths, including the ordinary emanational wrathful forms (rol pa'i khro bo) or the wrathful aspects of bodhisattvas,[332] and the kings among wrathful deities (khro bo'i rgyal po), such as Black Yamāri, Red Yamāri, Vajrabhairava, and Hayagrīva;[333]
(6) supreme bodhisattvas, such as the “eight closest sons” (nye sras brgyad), including Mañjughoṣa, Avalokiteśvara, and Samantabhadra,[334] along with their particular retinues—the peaceful male and female icons that comprise common bodhisattvas (byang sems phal pa), servants (phyag brnyan), and intermediaries (pho nya), including [the protectors of the sacred teachings] Mahākāla and the goddess Rematī.[335]
The term “hermit sage” (drang srong) is [in this context] a synonym or epithet of buddha, and therefore denotes a “wrathful buddha” Although Tibetans hold that the other [lesser] wrathful figures, including wrathful yakṣas (gnod sbyin khros pa), wrathful ogres (rākṣasa, srinpo khros pa), and wrathful acolytes of Yama (gshin rje khros pa),[336] should all have different demeanors according to their respective classifications, it is said that [traditionally] this is not certain.[337]

However, among well-known contemporary [traditions], [Including] those that identify eleven distinct iconometric scales, All of them concur that the axial lines of Brahmā are drawn first. Then, [as for the elevenfold classification, ] this comprises [Renunciant buddhas] without a consort,
And the buddha body of perfect resource,
Which are scaled at one hundred and twenty-five finger-widths; Bodhisattvas scaled at one hundred and twenty [finger-widths]; Wrathful hermit sages scaled at twelve palm-lengths;
Female consorts scaled at nine palm-lengths;
Acolytes of Yama and yakṣas scaled at eight [palm-lengths]; Ogre-like wrathful deities scaled at six, five, or three [palm-lengths];
Pious attendants and hermit buddhas who are similar in scale to human figures;
[Mundane protectors] such as Brahmā, scaled at nine large units; And human beings of the four continents,
Scaled at seven mid-finger spans in length, and eight in width.
All such measurements are said to depend
On the degree to which the vital energy of past actions is impeded.

Although there are some standard but obsolete [iconometric] techniques which were once widespread [in Tibet], nowadays all practical styles of painting and sculpture reflect two [surviving contemporary] traditions—the Encampment style (sgar lugs) and the Menri style (sman gyi lugs).[338]
The former holds, in accordance with the venerable lord of the teachings [Buton] Rinchendrub [1190-1364] and others, that there are eleven categories of iconometric scale (cha tshad bcu grig), while the latter is well known for the classification known as the eight great iconometric scales (thig chen brgyad).[339] All sources, however, concur that the vertical and horizontal axial lines of Brahmā (tshangs thig) should first be drawn.[340]

Then, as for the eleven [iconometric] scales [of the Encampment style]:
(1) The first includes the [renunciant and emanational] forms of the Buddha, depicted without a consort.
(1) The second includes the buddha bodies of perfect resource, comprising the [buddhas of] the five enlightened families. These two classes are drawn against a scale of one hundred and twenty-five finger-widths.[341]
(3) The third category includes peaceful bodhisattvas who are [drawn against a scale] of one hundred and twenty finger-widths.[342]
(4) The fourth includes hermit sages of wrathful demeanor, including Kālacakra, which are [drawn against a scale] of twelve palm-lengths [i. e., 12. 5 finger-widths].[343]
(5) The fifth includes the queens presiding over the maṇḍala, such as the various female consorts [of the five buddhas], as well as female consorts associated with the families [in the four directions of the maṇḍala], exemplified by the deity Tara, which are all attractively [drawn against a scale] of nine palm-lengths [i. e., 108 finger-widths].[344]
(6) The sixth includes the wrathful acolytes of Yama, headed by Yamāntaka.
(7) The seventh includes the wrathful yakṣas, headed by Vajrapāṇi. These last two classes are both to be drawn against a scale of eight palm-lengths [i. e., 96 finger-widths].[345]
(8) The eighth includes the ogre-like wrathful deities, which have three subdivisions. Among them, [the first] refers to this tradition [of ours] which holds that [the protectors] such as Bhagavān Mahākāla are scaled at six palm-lengths [i. e., 72 finger-widths],[346] as explained in the commentaries on Black Yamāri.
[The second] refers to dwarf-like figures such as Gaṇapati, which are [drawn against a scale] of five mid-finger-spans [i. e., 60 finger-widths].[347]
The third refers to the most wrathful of deities, such as those that are based upon the vision of Dorje Berchen, which have a scale of three face-length measures [i. e., 36 finger-widths].[348]
(9) The ninth category includes pious attendants and hermit buddhas, which are [drawn] similar [in scale] to the humans of this continent [i. e., 96 finger-widths].[349]
(10) The tenth includes mundane protectors (laukikadharmapāla, 'jig rten skyong ba), such as Brahmā and Śakra, which are [drawn against a scale] of nine large units [i. e., 108 finger-widths].[350]

<d e="2">
(11) [Finally], the eleventh category [of iconometric proportion] includes the dimensions of the human figures of the four continents who, according to the Wheel of Time and the master Sura, are said to be drawn on a scale of seven mid-finger spans [i. e., 84 finger-widths] in height and eight mid-finger spans [i. e., 96 finger-widths] in width because their height and width are unequal.[351]
There are some who hold the opposite view, asserting that [human figures] are of equal height and width, and that the spiritual teachers (guru, bla ma) who have assumed human form should be depicted as if they were [divine] images, corresponding to their own physiognomy. However, it is certainly ascertained from the indestructible buddha speech of Kyopa Jigten Sumgon [of Drigung ] [1143-1117] that the physical form of an authentic root spiritual teacher (mūlaguru, rtsa ba'i bla ma) which is introduced to [the practitioner s] own mind as the buddha, should be drawn in accordance with the iconometric proportions of the body of a perfect buddha.[352]
It should be understood in detail from the Mirror of Great Sunlight composed by the venerable [Karmapa] VIII[353] and other sources that the iconometric proportions of all sculptures ('bur sku) are generally identical to those of painted icons (bris sku) but that additional calculations are to be made in respect of the figures forming the retinue, to the front and the rear [of the central statue].[354]

The second [contemporary] tradition is the systematic presentation subsumed in the eight great iconometric scales, the techniques of which accord with the Wish-fulfilling Jewel of Iconometry, composed by Menla Dondrub [fl. late fifteenth century].[355] Since the Removal of the Tarnish [of Deluded Appearances] and the other works which include incidental instructions on many distinctive points derived from that system are detailed and extensive, I will not digress here.[356]
It is also said that the [actual] measurement of the relative palm-length and finger-width can be distinguished by degrees, depending on whether the vital energy of past actions (karmavāyu, las rlung) is impeded within the central channel (avadhūti, dbu ma) of the subtle body or not.[357]

Among all these [aforementioned] categories of icon, the aspects of the buddha body of perfect resource and the buddha body of emanation should all be clearly and perfectly drawn, explicitly on the basis of the thirty-two major marks (dvātriṃśanmahāpuruṣalakṣaṇa, mtshan bzangso gnyis) and the eighty minor marks (asītyānuvyañjana, dpe byad brgyad cu) that characterize them.[358] The tathāgatas and so forth should be peaceful and endowed with a smiling radiance. The female deities should, for the most part, be amorous and youthful. The wrathful deities should be awesome and unpleasant.
[In particular, ] the emanational wrathful deities (rol pa'i khro bo) and so forth should have a demeanor that is [simultaneously] wrathful, smiling, and graceful. Furthermore, they should also be depicted expressing the nine dramatic airs (navanāṭyarasa, gar gyi nyams dgu), that is to say, they should be (1) graceful (śṛṅgāra, sgeg pa) on account of their ornaments and radiance; (2) heroic (vīra, dpa' ba) on account of their display of dignity; (3) ugly (bībhatsa, mi sdug pa) on account of their menacing stares and frowns; (4) jovial (hāsya, dgod pa) on account of their smiles and bursts of laughter (ha ha'i sgra); (5) fierce (raudra, drag shul) on account of their thunderous exclamation of hi hi and hŪṂ phaṬ; (6) fearsome (bhayānaka, 'jigs su rung ba) on account of the gnashing of their teeth, the bowing of their heads, and the brandishing of their weapons; (7) compassionate (karuṇā, snying rje) on account of the blinking of their red eyes and their youthfulness; (8) awesome (adbhūta, rngam pa) on account of the radiance of their faces and their clicking of the palate; and (9) peaceful (śānta, zhi ba) on account of their supple, slender, and gentle eyes that are focused on the tip of the nose.
All the [emanational wrathful deities] should be depicted by the artist on the basis of these nine dramatic airs.[359]

Moreover, it is said:[360]
There are four sorts of facial physiognomy:
[The faces] of saintly male figures and female deities
Respectively have the shape of a hen's egg and a sesame seed.
And:
As for the [facial] moods or physiognomy of the wrathful deities,
They are round and square.[361]
The facial physiognomy (zhal dbyibs) [of these categories of deities] will differ accordingly.[362]
Then, with regard to the different shapes of their eyes, it is said:[363]
The eyes of the buddha figure, seated in meditative equipoise,
Have the shape of a bow, a cowrie shell, or the shape of a lotus petal.
Like a lily are the eyes of a semi-wrathful deity.
The eyes of a peaceful female deity resemble a fish's stomach,
While the eyes of a courtesan resemble a bamboo bow,
And the eyes of an extremely wrathful deity are round or square.[364]

Then, with regard to the distinctive postures of their legs and so forth, it is said:[365]
The posture of indestructible reality (vajraparyaṅka, rdo rje skyil krung)
That is universally known
Requires the left calf to be folded over the right,
The legs below the knees then assume the lotus position,
With the ankles crossed,
While it is also said that [in certain instances]
The tips of the big toes may even touch.
When the right leg is in the posture of indestructible reality And the left leg is folded under the right thigh,
This is called the posture of the bodhisattvas (sattvaparyaṅka, sems dpa'i skyil krung).
When the toes of the [contracted] left leg, facing upwards,
Almost but do not quite touch the right thigh,
And the right leg is haughtily extended,
This is called the semi cross-legged posture (ardhaparyaṅka, skyil krung phyed pa).

When the left leg is extended,
With the ball of the foot supported on the ground,
And the sole of the right foot positioned at the left thigh,
This is the dancing posture of standing on one leg
(ardhaparyaṅkapratyālīḍha, bzhengs pa'i phyed skyil gar stabs).
When the calf of the left leg is contracted,
And the right leg assumes an [outstretched] elegant dancing step, This is the extended right leg posture (ālīḍha, gYas brkyang),
And the opposite is the extended left leg posture (pratyālīḍha, gYon brkyang).
When the body is standing upright,
With the thighs and calves extending one cubit and two finger-widths,
As far as the heels, with the toes pointing outwards,
This is the [nativity] posture of Vaiśākha (vaiśākhapada, sa ga'i stabs).
When, on that basis, the lower limbs of the body [bend] two cubits, As far as the knees, so as to resemble the wings of a swan,
This is called the squatting posture (parimaṇḍala, logs su brkyangs pa zlum po).
When the body is standing upright With the ten toes aligned together, in front,
This is the posture of balance (sampada, mnyam pa'i stabs).
When both legs extend down from the [teaching] throne,
With the toes pointing outwards,
This is the auspicious seated posture [of Maitreya] (bhadrapada, bzang po'i stabs).
When the soles of the feet are touching together firmly (bde legs can), And the two legs assume a seated position,
A full palm-width [above the ground],
This is the crouching posture (tsog bu'i stabs).
When the toes of the right foot are in the semi cross-legged posture, And pressing against the ankle of the [extended] left foot,
This is the left-sided [posture] of royal ease (rājalalita, gYon rol),
And the right-sided posture of royal ease (ardhaparyaṅkalalita, gYas rol) is the opposite.
These [terms] can also be applied when standing upright.
When the left leg is in the semi cross-legged position,
And the extended knee of the right leg almost touches it,
This is called the hero's posture (vīralīla, dpa' bo'i sdug stangs).

Icons representing the buddha body of emanation, which is [renunciant and] without a consort, are depicted wearing the three kinds of religious robe (chos gos gsum) [i. e., the upper and lower robes and saṅghāṭī of a Buddhist monk].
Those representing the buddha body of perfect resource wear the eight ornaments made of precious gemstones (rin po che'i rgyan brgyad), namely, the crown (dbu rgyan), earrings (snyan rgyan), neck-band (mgul rgyan), shoulder-straps (dpung rgyan), mid-length necklace (do shat), long necklace (se mo do), bracelets (gdu bu), and girdle (ska rags) or its tassles ('og pag), which are also called the primary ornaments (rtsa ba'i rgyan) [of the buddha body of perfect resource]. In addition, there are the lily-shaped earrings (snyan gong utpala), anklets (rkang gdub), small tinkling bells (gYer kha) and so forth, which are known as the subsidiary ornaments (nye ba'i rgyan).[367]
[Elsewhere] it has been said:[368]
With regard to these [ornaments], the scholars of the past hold That the earrings, the neck-band, and the bracelets Should be of similar weight,
While the crown, shoulder-straps, anklets, and girdle (sked)
Should also be of a similar [weight].
Concerning the two kinds of silken garment (dar gos gnyis), these comprise the upper robe or jacket (stod gYogs) and the lower robe or skirt (smad sham), whereas in the transmitted oral teachings (bka' ma) of the Nyingma school,[369] the enumeration of five silken garments (dar gyi chas gos lnga) is well known. These comprise the [patterned] silken scarf (zi ldir), the [five-colored] silken crown-pendants (cod pan), the long silken dance sleeves (gar gyi phu rung), the silken undergarment (gsang khebs), and the silken skirt (tshi gu'i smad dkris).[370]
Then, according to the class of tantra texts that emphasize the [approach of] the Mother Tantras (ma rgyud), the male deities are endowed with the so-called six seals (phyag rgya drug), namely, a bone wheel (rus pa'i 'khor lo) with a half-vajra crest on the crown of their heads, earrings, neck-band, bracelets, girdle, and the thread of Brahmā (tshangs skud) or thread of sacrificial investiture (yajñopavīta, mchod phyir thogs).[371] Similarly, the female deities should be adorned with five of these seals, excluding the thread of Brahmā.[372]
The dimensions and [prerequisite] purity of these [ornaments] are also mentioned in the Tantra of the Habitual Practice of the Yoginī and the [Tantra of] the Indestructible Sky-farers.

In general the wrathful deities are endowed with the eight accoutrements of the charnel ground (dur khrod kyi chas brgyad).[373] These comprise the three garments to be worn (bgo ba'i gos gsum), namely, a flayed human hide (mi Ipags kyi gYang gzhi), the fresh hide of an elephant (glang chen gyi ko rlon), and a skirt of tiger skin (stag Ipags kyi sham thabs),[374] as well as the two ornaments to be affixed (gdags pa'i rgyan gnyis), namely, snakes (sbrul) and skulls (thod pa). Among them, [the snakes] form a white-spotted crown ornament symbolizing the kingly class (kṣatrīyavarṇa, rgyal rigs), yellow-spotted earrings symbolizing the mercantile class (vaiśyavarṇa, rje'u rigs), a red-spotted neckband symbolizing the priestly class (brāhmaṇavarṇa, bram ze'i rigs), and a black-spotted girdle symbolizing the laboring class (śudravarṇa, dmangs rigs). They also form green-spotted bracelets and anklets symbolizing the outcastes (caṇḍāla, gdol rigs).[375] Crown ornaments are also formed of dry human skulls, side-bands (se ral kha) of fresh human skulls, and bandoleers of [human skull ] fragments.[376] Lastly, there are the three sacraments to be smeared upon [the body, byug pa'i rdzas gsum]: the eyebrows are smeared with pinches of human ashes (thal chen), the cheeks are smeared with drops ofhuman blood (rakta), and the throat is smeared with markings of human fat (zhag).[377]

The eight glorious accoutrements (dpal gyi chas brgyad), which are known within the Nyingma tradition, are enumerated as follows:[378]
The accoutrement of a glorious sea-monster hide,
Blazing with magnificence;
The accoutrements of sun and moon discs,
Union of skillful means and discriminative awareness;
The accoutrement of the fire of pristine cognition,
Incinerating venomous beings;
The accoutrements of their crescent-shaped fangs,
Eradicating birth and death;
The accoutrements of their indestructible wings,
Pervasive and fulfilling aspirations;
The accoutrement of their indestructible garments,[379] Perfecting all dominion;
The accoutrement of their rhino-hide armor,
With power to reach the buddha level;
And the accoutrement of their iron discus Averting harmful and venomous spirits.[380]
This enumeration expands to the ten glorious accoutrements (dpal gyi chas bcu) with the addition of two insignia [that are drawn] on the lower robe, namely, the half-vajra crown emblem (spyi gtsug rdo rje phyed pa) indicative of the unchanging [reality], and the ritual spike (phur bu) that pulverizes venomous spirits. The former [enumeration of eight] is mentioned in the Tantra of the Flash of the Splendor [of Pristine Cognition] and the latter is emphasized in the Eight Transmitted Teachings. Between these [descriptions], therefore, there are some slight discrepancies.

There are many explanations that seek to classify the hand-held emblems associated with the multi-armed central deities, in maṇḍalas such as the [ Tantra of the] Ocean of Sky-farers, but when these are somewhat abridged, for illustrative purposes, with respect to the vajra (rdo rje), the khaṭvāṅga, and so forth, which are the primary hand emblems of the central [Heruka], it is said:[381]
As for the vajra which is the foremost of the symbolic hand-held emblems,
The four side-prongs of the reddish [bronze] vajra,
That is associated with wrathful deities,
Are splayed out in the four directions,
Not quite touching the central [axial prong].[382]
The khaṭvāṅga staff has a vajra, [surmounting] three human heads, [Below which are] a vase, a crossed vajra, and the handle,
Its length equaling that of the body [of the deity];
Silken streamers, a bell, and a hand-drum are suspended from it.[383]
The club (ga da'i dbyug pa) and the fox-skin bow (va gzhu)
With its far-reaching arrow (dpag chen mda') are similarly [ornate].[384]
The ritual dart (bhindipāla) and the sharp-pointed spear (mdung) Have a handle [decorated] with a plume of peacock feathers.[385]
The five-pointed vajra (rdo rje rtse lnga) has closed side-prongs,[386] The ekasūcikavajra and the short harpoon (kaṇaya) both have singlepointed vajras.[387]
The hand-held skull-drum (ḍamaru),
Fashioned of the upper portions of [two human] skulls,
May have or lack hanging valances.[388]
[Other hand-held emblems] include the sword (ral gri), the sharp knife (chu gri),
The spear-flag (peṭaka), the curved knife (gri gug),
The battle-axe (dgra ste), and the wooden pestle (gtun shing),[389] The long spear, the pike, and the shield[390]—these three,
The copper trumpet (bho kang),[391] the kettledrum (rdza rnga),
The round drum (rnga zlum), the large drum (rnga chen),
The ḍāka drum, the paṭaha drum,[392] The vajra and bell,[393] and so forth.

With regard to the teaching-throne (gdan khri) and its backrest (rgyab yol), as explained in the Tantra That Completely Apprehends the Attributes of a Spiritual Teacher, there are seven aspects to the construction of a teaching-throne or palanquin (khri 'gyogs), namely, the throne seat (khri gdan), the throne front (khri gdong), the throne legs (khri rkang), the two throne supports (khri rmang), the pedestal (ba gam), and the railings (lan kan).[394]
[More specifically], the supporting [animal figurines]—(1) lion, (2) elephant, (3) peacock, and (4) cīvaṃcīvaka—along with the (5) sun, (6) moon, and (7) lotus cushions are imbued respectively with (1) the ten powers (stobs bcu), (2) the ten dominions (dbang bcu), (3) the [four higher transcendental perfections] from aspiration (smon lam) to pristine cognition (ye shes), (4) the branches of enlightenment (byang chub kyi phyogs), (5) the ultimate reality (don dam e), (6) relative appearances (kun rdzob vaṃ), and (7) the enlightened attributes that are untainted by the three obscurations (sgrib gsum gyis ma gos pa'i yon tan).[395]
The essential nature of the six transcendental perfections (phyin drug) is symbolized by the six ornaments of the backrest (khri rgyab rgyan drug). These comprise (1) the garuda (mkha' lding), (2) the sea monsters (chu srin), (3) the children (byi spa), (4) the elephants (glang po che), (5) Śarabha (bse kha sgo) [the eight-footed king of deer],[396] and (6) the youthful serpentine water spirits (klu phrug), which are imbued respectively with the six transcendental perfections (pha rol du phyin pa drug), in reverse order, namely, (1) discriminative awareness (shes rab), (2) meditative concentration (bsam gtan), (3) perseverance (brtson 'grus), (4) patience (bzod pa), (5) ethical discipline (tshul khrims), and (6) generosity (sbyin pa).[397]

The expression “and so forth” (sogs) here refers to more elaborate [constructions], including thrones with twenty-one tiers.
There are also many categories of backrest—elaborate, middling, and simple. These include the elaborate form when the lower part [of the backrest] is woven in an [oval] shield-like design (phub la zhol btags pa), the middling form [of backrest] that resembles a lotus petal, and the simplest form which [may have an oblong shape] resembling the best sheet metal (Icags rtse ma), or a [semi-circular shape] resembling a hedgehog (sgang gzugs ma), and so forth. The middling sort is detailed in Taktsang Lotsāwa's Ocean of Wealth.[398]
Although in recent times the throne and its backrest are seldom depicted in either painted icons or sculpture, when they are represented, they are a source of great merit.
Many Tibetan scholars hold that this design of the throne with six [figurines] was [originally] an ornamental feature of the gateway to an [ancient] Indian temple, and that it was erroneously transposed upon the backrest of the deity's [throne], and that this tradition [subsequently] became prevalent only in Tibet but lacks authenticity. They also assert that all the three tantras [translated] by Tsami [Sangye Drakpa], including the [aforementioned] Tantra That Completely Apprehends the Attributes of a Spiritual Teacher, are not authentic tantras. However, the omniscient Dharmākara [Situ Chokyi Jungne] has said that we [Kagyupas] should hold these [texts] to be valid, (1) because one can see in certain definitive [sources] that such ornamental features of the throne and its backrest are found within the scope of Indian art, and (2.) because [Karmapa III] Rangjung [Dorje] asserted these original tantra texts to be genuine tantras.[399]

It says in the Tantra of the Emergence of Cakrasaṃvara:
The three long [lines] that may be flawed
Are those representing the chin, throat, and calves.
The three short [lines] that may be defective Are those representing the nose, ears, and fingers.
The three thick [lines] that may be defective Are those representing the calves, feet, and cheeks.
The three thin [lines] that may be defective Are those representing the jaw, chest, and ribs.
The three curving [lines] that may be defective Are those representing the breasts, ears, and forehead.
The three thin [lines] that may be defective
Are [also] those representing the thighs, hips, and neck muscles.
Each of these flaws [in draftsmanship] gives rise to its own particular defect or transgression. The same text continues:
In this context, if mistakes are made
With regard to the curves of the eyes and so forth,
Or in respect of the hand gestures and hand-held emblems,
One will be afflicted by sorrow and suffering,
And the icons [one has made] will be characterized as flawed and so forth.
Therefore, defects should be inspected and rectified.
Lesser though still serious defects may also be associated
With [the draftsmanship of] the backrest, the parasol, and the seat.
[If these are poorly executed, ] friends will say unpleasant things,
And one's prestige [as an artist] will fade.
These therefore are the major defects
Which skilled [artists] should carefully scrutinize.
For this reason, it is most important that [the work of an artist] should be free from defects.
Furthermore, it is said that the actual being of pristine cognition (jñānasattva, ye shes sems dpa') will not enter into a [visualized or created] deity image that is [iconographically] below standard.[400] In such cases, only negativity will ensue; and even good deeds carried out in a locality where a defective icon has been installed will diminish. Such places are to be abandoned in favor of pure locations.

As for the application of color, the five basic colors (rtsa ba'i tshon) are white, yellow, red, blue, and green.[401] The intermediate or secondary colors (yan lag gi tshon) comprise[402]
The trio of minium orange (li khri), flesh pink (sha kha), and dark pink (na ros);
The trio of pale mauve (mon kha), smoke grey (dud kha), and earthen brown (sa kha);[403]
The trio of brown (smug po), bone ivory (rus kha), and turquoise blue-green (gYu kha).
These all have many subdivisions. Indeed it has also been said:[404]
The elaborate [index] of the thirty-two secondary [colors] comprises
White, yellowish white (dkar ser), reddish white (dkar dmar), and crystal (chu shel),
Yellow, pale yellow (ser skya), reddish yellow (dmar ser), and minium orange (li khri),
Red, pale red (dmar skya), reddish brown (dmar smug), and shellac (rgya skag),
Blue, pale blue (sngo skya), azure (mthing nag), and turquoise (gYu kha),
Green, yellowish green (ljang ser), pale green (Ijang skya), and dark green (Ijang nag),
Flesh pink (sha kha), tea brown (ja kha), pale mauve (mon kha), and ash grey (thal kha),
Brown (smug po), dark brown (smug nag), dark pink (na ros), and lung purple (glo ba kha),
Smoke grey (dud kha), birch (re kha), bone ivory (rus kha), and gloomy black (mun ldog).
These are the well-known combinations, but the distinctions of color, over and above these, are limitless. It is explained that color combinations are of good quality when they are rich, bright, and lustrous.
With regard to shading (mdangs), granular shading (btsag mdangs) resembles mustard seeds fading out gradually [across the canvas], fiery shading ('bar mdangs) resembles blades of kusa grass, and lineal shading (bshal mdangs) resembles fading bands of rainbow light. Along with outlining (bcad k. yi tshul), each of these [techniques] should be mastered individually.[405]

There are many distinctions of form (gzugs) and style (rnam gyur) that are dissimilar, exemplified by the eight [distinctive] patterns of basic design (patra rigs brgyad)[406] and the three types of flames (me ris rigs gsurn).[407]
In particular, stylistic features should accord with the [artistic] traditions prevalent in different countries—India, China, Tibet, and the like. As has been said:[408]
Mansions, and so forth, the Tree of Enlightenment,
Various types of flowers, and offering clouds,
Auspicious designs, gemstone garlands,
Individual motifs that are not intermingled—
These are the distinctive features of Indian art.
Beautiful designs, golden imprints (mdangs ldan par),
Auspicious forms, silken threads,
Thrones and wondrous details—
These are the distinctive features of Chinese art.
Aquatic creatures, lakes and pools,
Fragrant forests, sacraments of the nāgas,
Medicinal incense, pulsating lines—
These are the distinctive features of Kashmiri art.
Designs of the four elements, rainbows and clouds,
Forested glades, gemstones and ornaments with a thread design (snal ris rgyan),
Arial creatures, sacraments of the gods—
These are the distinctive features of Newar art.
Cliffs and grassy hills, wild ungulates,
Canopies, bouquets, drapes, and beauteous ornaments,
Diverse images, and snow mountain ranges—
These are the distinctive features of Tibetan art.
The [various] stylistic features, such as those described in this passage should be practically applied.

</d>
<d e="2">
With regard to the celestial palace (gzhal yas khang), which is the receptacle of [those] divine icons, the [corresponding Sanskrit] term vimāna conveys the sense of “immeasurable” (gzhal du med pa). For example, in the [Tantra of the] Ocean of Sky-farers, the celestial palace is explained to take the form of a lotus flower;[409] while in the Sūtra of Final Nirvāṇa, among the sūtras of the Greater Vehicle, the array of the palace is explained to be limitless.
Among the [various descriptions of maṇḍalas] in the tantra texts that are to be applied in practice, there are passages that exclusively describe the palatial mansion (khang bzang), which is endowed with four corners, four gates, and arched pediments in order to symbolize that it is imbued with the purity of the thirty-seven aspects of enlightenment (byang phyogs so bdun).[410] Such palaces may be either three-dimensional (blos bslang) or two-dimensional (bri cha) in structure. However, if one wishes to understand [the techniques of] draftsmanship [in relation to the celestial palace] in detail, one should [first] understand the general plan [of the maṇḍala] rather than the particular features of relief and the upright structures that are applicable in threedimensional [constructions].

In general, it is said that there are two kinds of maṇḍala—those that have precise measurements (tshad bcas) and those that lack precise measurements (tshad ma nges pa). As to the former, when precise measurements are laid down on the basis of [the various families of] the deities, it says in the [Tantra of the Indestructible] Tent:[411]
The [maṇḍala] of the Vajra [family] should measure three cubits,
The maṇḍala of the Buddha [family] should measure four cubits,
The [maṇḍala] of the [Ratna family],
That of Bhāskara (snang byed), should measure five cubits,
The [maṇḍala] of the [Padma family],
That of Naṭeśvara, should measure six cubits,
And the [maṇḍala] of the [Karma family],
That of the Lord of Horses (Kubera), should measure seven cubits.
This passage indicates that the dimensions of the maṇḍalas of [the five enlightened families]—Aksobhya, Vairocana, Ratnasambhava, Amitābha, and Amoghasiddhi—respectively range from three to seven cubits.[412]
Then, in chapter four of the Tantra of the [Secret] Assembly, it says that the maṇḍala of buddha mind (thugs dkyil) should measure twelve cubits, while in chapter sixteen it adds that the maṇḍala of buddha body (sku dkyil) should measure sixteen cubits and the maṇḍala of buddha speech (gsung dkyil) twenty cubits. These measurements are all with reference to the four sides of the base line (rtsa thig).[413]

When precise measurements are prescribed on the basis of the [different sorts of] patrons [who commission these maṇḍalas], it says in an authoritative passage from a tantra text quoted in the [Indestructible] Garland:[414]
A lord of Jambudvīpa, or universal monarch,
Should draw an external maṇḍala,
Extending in its dimensions from infinity to one yojana.[415]

Elsewhere, Jayasena mentions in [his Commentary on] the Tantra of the Ocean of Sky-farers that [the size of such maṇḍalas] should be estimated in accordance with the particular wealth of the patron:
[In this context] it is held that the maṇḍala should measure eight cubits,
But otherwise, it is said that, in the case of kings,
It should measure one hundred cubits,
Half of that in the case of [arhats] in their final birth,[416] And, in the case of important persons, half of that again.
Those commissioned by merchants should measure twelve cubits,
And those commissioned by practitioners should measure six cubits.
Secondly, with regard to maṇḍalas that have no precise measurement, it says in the Four Hundred and Fifty Verse [Maṇḍala Rite ofthe Secret Assembly]:[417]
Although precise measurements and so forth can be made On the basis of the aspirations of sentient beings,
With regard to the spiritual accomplishments
Which derive from skillful means and discriminative awareness,
How can measurements and the like be made precisely!
Therefore [the maṇḍala] should measure [whatever is appropriate], Starting from a single cubit,
And [possibly] extending as far as one thousand cubits.
The lines should be marked accordingly in respect of this [maṇḍala] wheel.
The Indestructible Garland and other sources also offer similar explanations.

With regard to the contemporary construction techniques employed in respect of those [maṇḍalas] that do have precise measurements, two different traditions are well known, based on the tantras—those of Abhayā[karagupta] and Śraddhākara[varman]—and among them, [the tradition of the former, who authored] the Indestructible Garland, has many adherents. Accordingly, it has been said:[418]
The terms “gate-width” (sgo tshad)
And “large unit” (cha chen) are synonymous.
Each large unit comprises four small units,
And half of one of these is known as a quarter unit.[419]
The longer [line demarcating the top of the palace wall],
Which is mentioned in the Indestructible Garland,
Measures twenty-four large units or ninety-six small units,
Extending from [one end of] the parapet To [the other end of] the parapet,
And this should be twice the length of the maṇḍala and its surrounding area.[420]
The shorter [line demarcating the bottom of the palace wall],
Which is mentioned by Śraddhākaravarman,
Measures sixteen large units or sixty-four small units,
Extending from [one end of] the base line To [the other end of] the base line,
And this should be twice the length of the actual basic maṇḍala.[421]
Since the base line demarcates the actual [basic] maṇḍala,
It is known to be stated in the ordinary tantras
That the gate-width measure should be one eighth of the base line.[422]
However, according to the Four Indestructible Seats and the Emergence of Cakrasaṃvara,
It should be one fifth;
According to the Victory over the Three Worlds, it should be one ninth;
And according to the maṇḍala array [of the Indestructible Peak], it should be one tenth.[423]

The gates are also explained to be of three types—
One in which [the four parts of the gate][424] form two pairs of equal measure,[425]
One in which [the four parts of the gate] form one pair of equal measure
And another pair of unequal measure,[426]
And one in which all four [parts] are of equal measure.[427]

As for the tiered pediments [above the gates],[428]
They may be precise or imprecise in their measurement,
Or else they may have a combination [of precise and imprecise measurements].
Although the size [of the pediments] maybe uncertain,
As the second [of these options] suggests,
Even so, painted scrolls [depicting maṇḍalas]
Have all sorts [of measurements inscribed] on their reverse sides.[429]
Ratnākara[śānti] holds, in accordance with the last [of these options],
In his Illuminator of the World
That the width [of the pediment] should be three gate-width measures,
But that its height is imprecise.[430]

Then, according to the first option,
The ancient learned and accomplished masters of India and Tibet
Mostly hold that the [small] pediment with four beams (snam bu)
Should be one gate-width in height.[431]
There are also four [different] pediment designs
According to the [Indestructible] Garland,
And another according to the Wheel of Time,
Prescribing eleven beams.[432]
The beams themselves may be arranged in three distinctive ways:
When the pediment is three gate-widths [in height],
It may take the form of two beams of equal width
Combined with nine beams of equal width;
Or else it may take the form of five beams of equal width,
Combined with two sets of three beams of equal width.[433]
In the case of a pediment that is one gate-width in height,
It may resemble the last [design],
Forming three equal beams [and one unequal beam],
But there are [different] extant traditions.[434]
There are also many [tantras prescribing]
Whether the crossed-vajra emblem (sna tshogs rdo rje)
[Drawn around the four gateways] should be included or not.[435]
Skilled persons, [after attending to] the six features of the gates,
May thereafter construct the seats [of the deities], with precision.[436]
With regard to four [features]—the roof, its stūpas, battlements,
And tented spire, symbolizing the peak of Rājagṛha[437]—
There are many skillful techniques
Contingent on the longer [parapet] line and shorter [base] line measurements,
And the line measurements [prescribed] in the [various] esoteric instructions.[438]
This will suffice as a brief description of the traditions common to both painted and sculpted maṇḍalas.

When color pigments (tshon rtsi) are applied to maṇḍalas that have been drawn, it is said in the tantras that the best should be prepared from the powders of the most excellent gemstones and precious metals—sapphire, ruby, and so forth. The mediocre [pigments] include dyes made from the powders of various grains, the inferior sort include those prepared from powders derived from flowers or red earth, and the unsurpassed sort, with which [maṇḍalas] are to be painted, are powders derived from the charcoal and bones of a charnel ground, and so forth.
As far as contemporary usage is concerned, there are indeed many artistic techniques for applying colored powders, corresponding to the [distinctions of] place and time, so it will be necessary to follow different technical traditions, without being restricted to one facile approach.[439]
It says in the [Indestructible] Garland:
Within the circumference [of the maṇḍala],
The lines [of colored sand] should be correctly laid,
Corresponding to the twenty elements that comprise [each of] the gates.[440]
The lines should be even and straight, without break,
And [laid] in the appropriate manner,
With the spaces between them being only the width of a barley grain.
The lower and upper parts [of the maṇḍala] should also be appropriately decorated.
If [the colored lines] are laid too thickly, one will fall ill,
And if they are too thin, wealth will diminish,
If they are crooked, enmity will arise, and
If they are broken, a spiritual teacher or student will die.
If they are not laid out clockwise,
The colors should be pierced with a ritual spike.
Since the disadvantages of defective draftsmanship have been precisely indicated in these verses, one should earnestly concentrate and draw [the lines] with care.

With regard to the ways in which the symbols representing the deities contained [within the palace] are arrayed, there are some who hold that the body [of the deity] alone should be represented; and, in general, it is held that a pinch or drop of color alone will suffice by way of representation. However, it is said in the Great [Commentary] on the Wheel of Time [entitled Taintless Light]:[441]
In this context, at all times, three aspects should be arrayed upon the sun and moon cushions in the maṇḍala of colored powders because there are gross, subtle, and extraneous categories to be symbolically represented. Among these, the extraneous category (gzhan gyi dbye ba) refers to the arrayal of the mantra seed-syllables (sngags kyi sa bon). The subtle category (phra ba'i dbye ba) refers to the arrayal of the symbolic hand-held emblems such as the vajra which are manifested from the mantra seed-syllables; and the gross category (rags pa'i dbye ba) refers to the arrayal of the images or icons of the deities which are manifested from the symbolic [handheld emblems] such as the vajra.
Nāgabodhi also said [in his Twenty Rituals of the Maṇḍala of the Secret Assembly]:[442]
In accordance with one's ability,
The seed syllables should be arrayed within the maṇḍala,
Or else the [corresponding] symbolic [hand-held] emblems,
Or the [actual] deity icons should be arrayed,
Either fashioned of cast metal, or in a composite form.
Similar passages are found in the Tantra of Embrace and in the Cornucopia of Esoteric Instructions.[443]

Also in the [Secret] Tantra of General [Rites], it says:[444]
An intelligent person, without having [prior] training,
Should array the [symbolic] emblems.
Even one who has prior training will have difficulty Perfectly representing all the distinct subsidiary [symbols of the maṇḍala],
But if the subsidiary [emblems] are perfectly fashioned, in detail,
They should be held in place for the duration of the rite.
Even if the [corresponding] icons are well sculpted,
[The maṇḍala] will not hold a great many [of them].
[In short], it has been well explained that
There will be no blessings if the subsidiary [emblems] are reduced,
Nor will spiritual accomplishments be attained.
So it is that skilled persons should array the deities In the form of their [respective] emblems.
[The point here is that] if the forms of the deities are to be drawn perfectly and completely, it will be time-consuming, and the ritual will not be completed [for lack of time]. [Similarly, ] if the subsidiary [emblems representing] the deities are reduced, no blessings will accrue. For these reasons, the drawing of the hand-held emblems will be highly esteemed.
With regard to the techniques employed by contemporary skilled [artists] who are of the appropriate standard, it will turn out well and be most satisfactory if the main deity is arrayed as a statue, the retinue in the form of their corresponding symbolic hand-held emblems, and the gatekeepers and other peripheral figures in the form of their corresponding seed-syllables. In this regard, it also says in the [Indestructible] Garland:
If the circumstances are inauspicious
The symbols and the hand-held emblems should be correctly drawn. But if the circumstances are not inauspicious,
The icons of the [various] deities should be drawn,
And these painted icons should be positioned [in the maṇḍala],
Or else sculpted images which have been well crafted by an artist
Should be placed [therein].

In the Cornucopia of Esoteric Instructions it is also explained that the icon of a deity in union with a female consort should not be drawn in places where they could be seen by those such as the eternalistic extremists who lack faith [in the Buddhist teachings].[445] Also, according to the Empowerment of Vajrapāṇi, a hand-held emblem should be laid out in the place of the central deity, but only drops [of colored powder] should be arrayed in the sectors occupied by the figures forming the retinue.[446]
Furthermore, it says in the Supreme Tantra of Manifest Expression:[447]
Painters should adorn the forms [within the maṇḍala],
Either with paint, or by using brushes.
Therefore, when seed-syllables and so forth are arrayed within a maṇḍala, they may indeed be painted or drawn with a brush or a pen.

According to the transmitted teachings (bka' ma) and treasures (gter ma) of the ancient translation school of secret mantra, such as the [Tantra of the] Magical Net of Vajrasattva, there are also other distinctions of symbolism and meaning with regard to the layout of the celestial palace which are slightly dissimilar to the prevailing description of the Unsurpassed [Yoga Tantras].[448] These may be exemplified by [the account of the celestial palace in] the [Tantra of the] Secret Nucleus, which the Short Commentary analyzes in terms of the following eleven aspects:
The celestial palace, its ground, its extent, and its material basis,
Its shape, projecting bays, and spire,
Its ornaments, gate passageways, and tiered pediments,
And the forms assumed by the seats within it,
Which have their own defining characteristics...
Among these aspects, it is explained that, below the [vajra] finial (tog), the spire (rtse mo) [of the celestial palace] is encircled by a round vase-shaped structure—a particular feature of the tradition of the Magical Net.[449]
As for the ornaments (rgyan) [of the celestial palace], seven types are enumerated: lower ornaments, side ornaments, upper ornaments, gateway ornaments, external ornaments, ornaments indicative of the essential nature, and ornaments possessed by the lord [of the maṇḍala].
Then, as for the tiered pediments (rta babs), the causal pediments (rgyu'i rta babs) are known to resemble a rider's dismounting platform and to have eight aspects, since the outer and inner roofs (sgo phub) of the gatehouse each have four steps. By contrast, the fruitional pediments ('bras bu'i rta babs) are explained to have eight [stacked] beams (snam bu brgyad).[450] There are many such classifications.

Among these, Rañjanā derives from the Brāhmī script, and it has two forms: the hollow-bodied script (khog seng) and the full-bodied script (sha chen).[453] There are also, in conformity with that [prototype Guptan script], the five versions of the Dharika script (dharika'i yig rigs lnga), as well as six different versions of the Nāgarī script (naga ra la rigs mi 'dra ba drug) in which the heads [of the letters] are [similarly] raised.[454] In addition there is the Vartula script of the nāgas in which the heads [of the letters] are curled downwards.[455]
Furthermore, there are those [scripts employed in more remote lands] at the extremities of the oceans, and those which are not included within the [aforementioned] list of the sixty-four scripts, such as the three different [scripts] of Kashmir,[456] the Gauḍa [script of Bengal/Orissa],[457] the Ghahura script,[458] the Sindhu script,[459] the two kinds of Ghaula script,[460] the Magadhā script,[461] the Kamata script,[462] Puṅkka,[463] the script of Markkola, the script of Tāmaralipti,[464] and the script of the rākṣasas (srin po),[465] all of which once had stylized calligraphic transmissions, even in Tibet.[466]
Exemplified by these, there is a [seemingly] limitless number of different scripts or writing systems prevalent in each different country, but supreme among them all are the two scripts [known as] Rañjanā and Vartula. For among all these [scripts] if one knows how to write these two, one will have no difficulty with the [contemporary] Nāgarī scripts, and so forth.

[Rañjanā Calligraphy]
Those who have not learned how to apply the calligraphic measurements (bris thig) in detail [should know that] the rough guidelines for [Rañjanā] calligraphy are as follows: Longwise, there are [approximately] two grid squares (kha do) allocated for the pen strokes representing the head and the neck [of each letter] and three grid squares (kha gsum) for those representing the body [of each letter]. Collectively these are known as the “five vertical grid squares for pen strokes” (dpang smyug khams lnga).[467]
Then, the letters that lack the long tail [ring cha, of the a shad] and the extended backhand stroke of the letter pha (pha'i rgyab lag) [and so forth][468] generally have three horizontal grid squares (zheng la rang khams gsum) [allocated for pen strokes].[469] These [strokes] are generally drawn in a downwards movement, starting from the body of the letter, and the head is subsequently drawn.[470]

The block-letter script (gzab ma), also known as the headed script (dbu can), which is [regarded as] the best of the Tibetan fonts, was originally modeled on the calligraphy of Tonmi Sambhoṭa [during the reign of King Songtsen Gampo], and is said to have resembled the “spreading out of black frogs in a swamp” (sbal nag na la rgyangs pa).[472] Subsequently, [during the reign of King Mangsong Mangtsen], one Changar[473] Rinchen Bar employed a style of calligraphy that resembled a “shattered brick” (so phag gshibs pa). Later still, [during the reign of Dusong Mangpoje], Chabkar Beutse employed a style of calligraphy that resembled a “male finch” (bya pho 'jol ba). After that, [during the reign of King Tride Tsukten], Tsang Genyen [Konchok] Wang developed the style that resembled “dark barley grains spread out” (nas nag bkram pa).[474]
Subsequently [during the reign of King Trisong Detsen], one Dre-o Trom [engraved the inscription of the Samye obelisk] and thereby developed the style that resembled a “string of pearls” (mu tig bstar la brgyus pa).[475] After that [during the reign of King Mune Tsenpo], Tsepong Jangchub developed a style that resembled the “spreading out of dung beetles” (sbur nag bgrad pa). Thereafter [during the reign of King Mutik Tsenpo], one Te Yonten developed the style that resembled a “fish brought out of the water” (nya chu nas phyungs pa).[476] Subsequently [during the reign of King Relpachen], the two known as Dra and Go developed the style that resembles a “lion leaping through the air” (seng ge gnam du mthong pa).[477] All these [methods of writing] are collectively known as the “ancient styles” (snga ma).[478]

Later, during the lifetimes of Dro Nyashari and Tongwar Dorje, master and students, at the start of the later dissemination of the [Buddhist] teachings (phyi dar), the rectangular style of writing (grub bzhi) known as the “new style” (gsar sleb) was introduced.[479] [In this way] the evolution of Tibetan writing can be traced through nine successive [generations].[480]
Later still, there was one Khyungpo Yutri Bar who composed a treatise on measurements, bamboo pens, paper-making, calligraphy (smyu gu shog chag 'bri lugs), and so forth, modeled on the iconometric measurements of a maṇḍala, which divided [the paper] into grids of large and small units (cha chen cha chung), and so forth.[481] He educated an inconceivable number of students, including those who diverged into two streams—some following the so-called “frog tradition” (sbal lugs) [of Tonmi Sambhoṭa] and others following the “popular tradition” (mang lugs) [of Changar Rinchen Bar], which is reported to have survived down to the present day [i. e., the lifetime of Jamgon Kongtrul], in Phenyul and Ngor.[482]

With regard to all these traditions [associated with the writing of the block-letter Tibetan scripts] in general, there are eight [strokes] on which [the scribe's] attention should be focused (gces brgyad). As has been said:[483]
When drawing letters [such as CHa] with a curved line (snag lam zlum),
One should pay attention to the [convex] “lip” stroke (gong chags):[484] When drawing letters [such as NGa]
Which occupy a single [unit] (gcig pur skyes),[485] One should pay attention to the short “shoulder “stroke (dpung thung).[486]
When drawing subjoined letters [such as ya] (gdags pa can),
One should pay attention to the corner grid-line (zur thig).[487] When drawing letters [such as NYa] with an upper “shield-like” curve (stod phub can),[488]
One should pay attention to the “abdominal” stroke (sbo).[489] When drawing letters [such as ta] with a lower “shield-like” curve (smad phub can),[490]
One should pay attention to the delineation of the “body” stroke (khog 'dren).[491]
When drawing letters [such as ka] with a “leg” [or tail] line (rkang
pa),[492]
One should pay attention to delineating the final stroke, as if riding a horse.[493]
When drawing letters [such as pa] with an upright stroke (yar phul) Or [za] with a thick-ended (mthar rgyas) stroke,[494] One should pay attention when exerting calligraphic pressure (sgros gnon).
When drawing letters [such as na] with eyes (mig can dag),[495] One should pay attention to the correct drawing of the “neck“ stroke (ske gtsang).

The best resembles a round rope that has been cut [diagonally at both ends] by a knife (thag zlum gris bcad pa); the average sort resembles the bow-shaped [capital of a pillar, which is cut diagonally at one end]; and the worst resembles the head of a punctuation mark (tsheg mgo),[500] [which is slender and pointed at both ends but short and thick in the middle].
(4-6) There are three kinds of “shoulder” stroke (dpung gsum). The best resembles a vajra held at the heart (thugs kar rdo rje 'dzin pa) [drawn at an angle, curving from left to right, starting thin and increasing in thickness]; the average sort resembles an arrow in flight (mda' 'phen) [drawn straight downwards]; and the worst resembles a broken arm, limply lying sideways (lag chag 'phrod nyal) [drawn directly from left to right].
(7-9) There are three kinds of “abdominal” stroke (sbo gsum). The best resembles the back of a lip-shaped knife (sgros chags gri ltag) [or a crescent moon, thick in the middle and thin at both curved ends]; the average sort resembles a taut rope of hair (spu thag sgrim); and the worst resembles an ant's waist (grog sked) [or a saddle that is thin in the middle and thick at both ends].
(10-12) There are three kinds of “tapering lip” stroke (zags mchu gsum). The best takes the form of a short and finely pointed intersection of angled strokes (gsegs sbyor thung mo) [where the “abdominal” stroke and the “upright” stroke join together]. The average sort resembles an indented [and thick] pigs snout ('gye'o phag sna), and the worst resembles a crooked elephant's trunk (sgur po glang sna).

The average sort resembles [an arm] brandishing a drum or a pole (rnga dbyug 'phyar) [which sways crookedly towards the top], and the worst resembles a decapitated arm (lag mgo bcad) [where the stroke is drawn straight but without a head],
(16-18) There are three kinds of “downward tail” [or “leg”] stroke (mar 'then gsum). The best resembles the stem of a key (sgo leags rkang) [becoming increasingly slender]. The average sort resembles the tail of a puppy (khyi gu'i mjug) [which curls slightly at the upper end], and the worst resembles the tail of an insect or the legs of a bee ('bu mjug sbrang rkang) [with many crooked lines].
(19-21) Finally, there are three kinds of curving “eye” stroke (mig gsum). The best resembles the eye of a fish (nya mig) [which is completely round]. The average sort resembles a grain of barley (nas) [which is oval shaped], and the worst resembles the triangular-shaped eye of a wrathful deity (zur gsum khro mig) [which is almost rounded at the top and thin or flat at the bottom].

For those who wish to know how the square gridlines are formed according to the [traditional] techniques, [once the twelve vertical and eight horizontal gridlines have been drawn, they are divided into upper, middle, and lower sectors]. [In the middle sector, which has six vertical units and is reserved for the main letters, ][504] the “shield-like” convex curves (phub) and “shoulder” strokes (dpung) occupy [only] one unit, the “tapering lip” strokes (zags mchu) occupy two units, and the “leg” strokes (rkang pa) occupy three units. Therefore, if CA, CHA, RA, and A [which have convex curves or shoulder strokes] are too long, they will be defective. If da, na, and zha [which have tapering strokes] are too long or too short, they will be defective. If ka, ga, and SHA [which have leg strokes] are too short, they will be defective. The subjoined letters [of the lower sector] occupy four units and the superscripts (steng gi yan lag) [of the upper sector] occupy two units.
Therefore, [all potential] defects can be avoided when a ruler is used to measure [the middle sector of] six units [in which the main letters are inscribed]. This is but a rough explanation [of how the block-letter script] is to be drawn. One will still have to learn the practical techniques in detail.[505]

With regard to the headless thick-stroked italic script ('bru chen), which is the best of the cursive Tibetan scripts (bod yig gshar ma), the letters are drawn against a large grid (thig tshad che ba), either in accordance with the Li calligraphic tradition (li lugs), which has long been extinct, or the Den calligraphic tradition (ldan lugs). The latter is so-called either because it was the tradition of Denma Tsemang, or because it “possesses” (ldan pa) an authoritative calligraphic standard.[506]
Then there is the headless thin-stroked italic script ('bru chung), in which the letters have a similar form but are drawn against a small grid (thig tshad chung ba). These headless italic scripts ('bru tsha rnams) which [originally] had only eighteen distinct letters (jig 'bru), formed the earliest basic transmission of calligraphy [in Tibet], and it was from them that the “punctuated script” (tsheg bris), in which letters forming syllables aligned in squares, separated by punctuation marks, [subsequently] evolved.[507]

The “gentle rounded script” ('jam pa zlum bris) developed out of the italic scripts, and it had variant forms known as the “tailed script” (sug po) and the derivative Baho script ('ba' ho), in which elongated tails are accentuated. The latter gave rise to the “short-tailed script” (sug thung), and that in turn to the “finely executed style” (mnyen gra ris), in which the letters of the “tailed script” were contracted by one-third. That in turn gave rise to the “finely rounded tailed script” (mnyen pa sug skor), and that to the [contemporary] “easy and common letter-writing script” (bde ba phrin yig dkyus ma).

Before one starts to write, it is important to study the calligraphic proportions (cha tshad) and shapes (dbyibs) of the letters. In this regard, it is explained that scribes who voluminously copy the sacred scriptures (gsung rab) esteem the block-letter script (dbu can), as well as the headless italic scripts ('bru ma), the “punctuated script” (tsheg sgrig), and the “rounded script” (zlum ris). Scholar monks (dge ba'i bshes gnyen) esteem the “short-tailed script” (sug thung) and the finely executed script (gra ris). Administrators (sde dpon) esteem the “long-tailed” script ('ba' ho) and the “finely rounded tailed script” (sug skor), while other persons esteem the common letter-writing script ('phrin yig). Therefore, individuals should perfect and refine the [scripts] that are particularly useful for their own needs.
After mastering [the appropriate scripts], when one begins to write, one should [initially] study the techniques [for making] paper, the writing surface ('bri gzhi), as well as vermilion and black ink (mtshal snag), and bamboo pens (smyu gu), until one has become proficient in accordance with the ancient treatises and the authentic practical traditions derived from them. Then, by earnest practical application, one should seek to emulate the contributions of past masters.
There are indeed [many] long and short compositions [on these techniques] based on the treatises of past generations, and an infinite number of distinctive practical traditions [of calligraphy], but among them, if I may offer a partial explanation, subsuming and evoking those that are still practiced at the present day:[509]
[Let us examine] the writing surface (bris gzhi),
As well as the utensils and the substances used for writing.

Writing surfaces may be made from superior, average, and inferior materials.
The best [writing surface] is paper made from
Stellera chamaejasme with conch-shaped leaves (shog ldum dung lo ma),[510]
Which grows well where the soil is dark, there are juniper trees [nearby],
And the ground is free from slate and rock.
The yellow-colored variety that grows in red sandy soil and slate
Is difficult to prepare and [rather] hard.
Bark that is thick and harboring insects is inferior.
After collecting [the bark] in the proper way,
Small particles of earth should be washed away,
The outer bark should be scraped and rubbed, and the pith extracted.
Alkaline pebbles (bya rdo) are then heated,
Immersed in ice-cold water, and shaken.
When the consistency of this solution has become like whey,
A good test will be if it pricks the tongue, like salt ammoniac (rgya tshva).
Without completing this process, there will be no potency.
Once the [desired] potency has been reached and impurities removed,
The stellera [pith] should be cooked in this solution.
However if it is cooked in an ashy solution, there will be some blemishes.
When [the fibers] have been cooked,
They should be crushed firmly in a stone mortar,
And once the pulp has taken on the consistency of paste,
It should be divided, proportionate to the dimensions
Of the [requisite] sheets [of paper],
And [each batch] should be stirred in a container,
With an equal quantity of water.
This pulpy solution should then be poured into a paper-making tray (sbog bre),
And it should be left standing in a clear and unsullied film of water,
Without being stirred, [until it dries out].
Due to this [superior] ingredient,
However thick or thin the [desired] paper may be,
The outcome will be successful.
The average sort of [writing surface] is made
From the bark of Daphne anrantica.[511]
After peeling off the green shoots,
The inner bark should be cooked for a while,
And the initial liquid then strained off.
The procedures for cooking, grinding,
Sieving, and pouring [the pulpy fibers]
Resemble those already described.

This [ingredient] is particularly well suited for thick paper used in [writing] books.
The worst [writing surfaces] are made
From the roots of common Stellera chamaejasme,[512]
Which are to be unearthed.
The inner bark (bar shun), the pith clearly visible inside the outer layer,
Should be cooked in an alkaline solution.
[In this regard,] the fibers will become soft, like wool,
When cooked in an ashy solution (thal khu).
A dose of myrobalan is then added to draw out the poison.
This ingredient is best when [the plant] is growing in soft and sandy soil,
And in places where soft dark soil predominates.
It produces a hard paper which is good for writing letters
But not very suitable for books.
Since the various qualities of paper
Originating from different countries
Have their [distinctive] materials and manufacturing techniques,
One could digress much [on this subject],
But despite the usefulness [of this approach],
I am bereft [of further knowledge].
Then, [after these preparations, the writing surface] should be rubbed
And polished with a soft, white [pumice] stone
That is used for cutting hairs, and [removing] other residual impurities,
And in this way any holes should be erased.
If the paper is clean, it should be beaten and then rubbed,
So that any traces of earth and stone are removed.
When it retains a whiteness of color,
It is explained to be excellent.
Then, wheat that has not been damaged by frost
Should be washed in water from a hot spring,
Pulverised and stirred in water, until it has the consistency of milk.
Any bubbles that appear should be popped and dissolved.
This size solution should then be filtered for a short while [before use],
But if it is left standing for too long a time,
There is a risk that it will become thin and weak.
If the size has been left standing for more than twenty days
It should be thrown away because it will be old
And its adhesive quality will have diminished.[513]

The pure essence [of the size] should be divided into two parts,
One part should be boiled until it is cooked,
And then it should be mixed with the other part.
Then, in a sunny and humid place where there is no wind,
The paper should be dipped [in the size] and left out to dry.
Alternatively, the size should be mixed in a pan
With one quarter of whey, strained free of butter,
And [the paper] should then be dipped [in this solution] for a while.
If [the solution] is too hot, the paper will be torn,
And if it is too cold, the adhesive quality will be weak
And [the paper surface] will be stained by the size.
Once [the sheets of paper] have definitely dried,
Any [remaining] particles of earth should be removed.
Then, even if it is said that [the paper] is free from green shoots or sand,
Because there could still be some blemishes,
A wet [sheet of paper] that has been dipped in water
Should be inserted between every sheath of ten dry sheets,
And [the whole bundle] should be compressed.
The sheets should be left like this for one day at the most,
Or, at the very least, for the duration of a tea-break.
However long they are bound together,
The dampness should evenly permeate [the whole sheath].
Then, [the sheath] should be placed upon a smooth liver-shaped stone,
And it should be beaten and rubbed with a yak horn
That is free from dark stains.
If these utensils are not available, there will be no fault
If [the sheath] is beaten and rubbed using a wooden board and pestle.
It is said that if there is too much size,
The size will smear [the paper surface],
But if there is too little, the glue will adhere to the edges.
If [the sheath] is too dry, it will be somewhat difficult to iron,
But if it is slightly damp, it will be easy [to iron],
And the outcome will be excellent.
The ironing board (dbur gdan) should be steady, without wobbling.
If the [ironing stone, dbur rdo] is made of conch,
[The paper surface] will turn bluish,
And if it is made of agate,[514] It will have many lines or marks.
The best [ironing stones] are made of fine gold or banded chalcedony
But if these are not available, even the dark and oily horn
Of a wild yak will suffice.[515]
[Once the paper is ready for writing, one should employ]
A measuring ruler (thig shing) that is straight and even.
The horizontal calligraphic lines (byang chub rgyun lam)
[Should be drawn or plucked]
With a fragrant solution of turmeric and barberry bark,
While the outer and inner margin lines (phyi nang thig skor)
Should be drawn or plucked with vermilion.[516]
[These lines] should correspond in their dimensions
To those of the [intended] volume.
Erasures and uneven or crooked [lines] are defects [to be avoided].

Then, with regard to the Chinese bamboo pen (rgya smyug) used for writing,
Those that are made from tall, thick, and heavy bamboo canes,
Yellow in color, untwisted, and without a [large] hole,
With tips that are soft [and lustrous],
And [a hard exterior] that causes the teeth to slip when biting down on it[517]
Are praiseworthy for all kinds of writing—in ink, gold, [and so forth].[518]
The Naxi bamboo pen ('jang smyug) which is black in color
And hollow, is well-suited for shorthand letter-writing scripts,[519]
The metal-nib pen (Icags smyug) is best For [copying] large scriptures,
While the “southern” pen (lho smyug)
And the “ravine” pen (rong smyug) are also acceptable.[520]
[When making a bamboo pen],[521]
The bamboo [stalks] should be secured [and fumigated]
Within a chimney [or a smoky place] for a long time,
And then smeared, at best, with the old marrow of a cow,
Or, if that is not available, with [some other kind of old] marrow.
They should then be inserted within a pile of [freshly] roasted grain,
And gently polished until they become as hard as bone.
Then one should get a knife of a quality suitable for making [bamboo pens].
Those made of various types of iron are good,
And the metal should be smelted and refined.
The [ideal] knife, combining sharpness, suppleness, and strong temper,
Should have its point and blade sharpened until they feel cold [to the touch],[522]
While the back [of the knife] should be straight and [the blade] flat.[523]
The blade should be sharpened on a whetstone (bdar rdo)
Of suitable size, flat, and supple:
The outer edge only once and the inner edge six times.[524]
In this way, the sharpness of the blade should be capable of splitting a hair.
However, if the blade is sharpened too much, it will turn into iron filings,
So if it is sharpened somewhat less,[525]
The blade will be [suitably] thick and sharp.
The length of a bamboo pen should not exceed one span,
And it should be no shorter than the index finger,
While it should also be of suitable thickness,
And it should be planed down until it comfortably fits
Between the thumb and the fingers.[526]
Then, at a place measured at one and a half relative “finger-widths”
From the tip of the pen ([smyug] rtse),
[The two tines of the nib-point should be planed down,][527]
Allocating two thirds for the nib (smyug rdzing)
And one third for the actual point (mchu)
A small cleft (gas chung) [should be made in the point]
If one wishes to write the block-letter script (gzab),
Or a larger cleft if one wishes to write quickly.
It is said that “[the size of] the vent hole (smyu gyur)
Should correspond to [the size of] the actual nib.”[528]

When looking [at a pen] from the rear,
The left and right [tines of the nib] should be symmetrical,
And the point of the nib (rdzing mchu) should not be too flat.
Rather, the surface [of the point] that is cut should be cut at an angle.[529]
It is said that if one is skilled [in cutting] bamboo nibs
Which are said to be “endowed with the [requisite] three [parts]
And replete with the five [attributes],”[530]
One will become skillful in calligraphy.
With dexterity that [distinguishes] good and bad calligraphy,
Dependent on one's proficiency in [writing] speed,
[One should overcome] hesitation
And master refinement with regard to spelling.
With suitable pressure and balance of the thumb and fingers,
And suitable [attention to] flow and pause,
Understanding verbosity, but endowed with brevity,[531]
The best [calligraphy] is that which combines elegance With accuracy of spelling and dexterity.[532]

The substances used for writing comprise both ink-black and vermilion.
First, with regard to the materials used for making [black] ink,
The best are accumulated flakes of lampblack soot or pinewood,
While the average sort includes the bark of the cherry tree—[533]
These last two should be stripped and peeled.
Birch bark (gro ga) is also somewhat similar to the latter.
The worst is pine resin (tkang tshil), which resembles fat—
If it is too old it will resemble [congealed] blood
And if it is too fresh it will not be adhesive.
Having accumulated a large quantity [of these appropriate ingredients],
A clay pot with five to seven holes in its base should be raised
Upon a [specially] constructed circular hearth
Or upon a stove for roasting grain,
And when the wood is burned in the stove,
The soot from within the upper parts of the pot should be gathered—
Grime from the lower parts is inferior and should be thrown away.
In case it should be hard to collect or if it should spill down,
This should be undertaken with care, and in an isolated place.
Then [the soot] should be placed in a metal pot, along with clear glue,[534]
And simmered for a while, under fire.
When the glue has melted,
The solution should be poured [into a bag] and kneaded.
[It is said that] one dry measure per day should be ground,
And that when the grinding emits a crackling sound,
It will reach the required consistency.
However, the grinding should continue until the [desired] potency is obtained,
And the longer it takes, the better the outcome.
Repeated kneading until [the ink] has dried
Is held to be the best technique for making vermilion and [black] ink.[535]

Then, when the [dry ink] is brought to a paste-like consistency,
If it sticks to the hand, its adhesiveness will be weak,
Or if it is hard and solid, these will be the greatest faults.
If it leaves an-imprint on the skin but does not stick,
It is held to have suitable adhesiveness.
Moreover, it is mentioned in an ancient treatise that
With [an infusion of] elecampane (manuratha, Inula helenium),
[The ink] will become soft and freckled.
With an infusion of sandalwood, it will be held by the pen.[536]
Shellac (rgya skyegs) will add a reddish lustre,
And with an infusion of musk (gla rtsi), the fragrance [of the ink] will linger.
With an infusion of orchid (dbang lag) and campion (sug pa),[537]
The lustre and richness [of the ink] will be unsurpassed.
With an infusion of saussurea (spyi bzhur),[538]
[The ink] will flow well.
With a solution of camphor (ga bur), it will not spoil in summer.
With a solution of galangal and long pepper (Piper longum).
It will not solidify in winter, and so forth.
Although there are many other techniques for mixing [herbs],
Including solutions of old pine resin (thang khrag),
Wheat, barley, parched grain, and the like,
They are mostly defective,
With the exception of some of [the aforementioned] infusions,
Such as campion and saussurea.
Those are not good [techniques] because they entail too much compounding.
It is essential to understand the essential properties
Of the appropriate materials [for mixing with soot].
If one can only make a small amount,
It will be best if the kneading is undertaken [vigorously]
By the hand of a younger person.

The best quality of vermilion (mtshal) resembles crushed and lustrous crystal,
The average sort has a bright red hue,
And the worst is reddish brown.
It should be ground finely in a smooth, white mortar,
And then a clear solution of myrobalan should be poured in,
Causing the vermilion to sink.
The [yellow] surface water should be drained off, up to three times.
[During the grinding] one should take care to slightly rotate the pestle.[539]
Then, when this refining has gone on for a long time,
One should pour in some binder—
The best is Chinese glue (rgya spyin), but if that is not available,
A clear solution of some solid glue will do.
For a quick result, the vermilion powder should be compounded
In the glue solution,
And kneaded slowly, in a container that is without rust,
So that it takes on a strong dark color.
This is an essential technique that will prevent the vermilion from aging.
In whatever ways [the powder] is compounded,
When the time comes to write,
If one wishes to add a decoction
Of “cubeb and long pepper six” (ka pi drug sbyor),
In a clean container that is free from rust and stains,
Pour about one third of cubeb and long pepper mixture and glue
Into two thirds of vermilion,
And expose it to the sun for a while.
Or, when adding a decoction of salt ammoniac,
A measure of curd, borax, and
A little sal wood ash (spos dkar thal, Shorea robusta)
Should also be included with the salt.
The attributes of these respectively are that
[The first] adds luster, [the second] improves adhesiveness,
And [the third] eliminates traces of moisture.
To enhance the redness [of the vermilion],
It should be [kneaded until] it dries out.
If it flows with difficulty [being too viscous] and is yellowish,
Pour in some clean water.
If it is pale brown in color, add some cubeb and long pepper mixture.
Now, as for the method of compounding cubeb and long pepper,
One should thoroughly clean some campion (lug sug)
That has been unearthed in spring or at the end of autumn,
And cook it in a non-metallic container, until it dissolves.
When it has been strained,
Add the aforementioned ingredients to the decoction,
And stir it slowly and gently while it simmers on a fire.
To this triple compounded decoction of vermilion, cubeb, and long pepper,
One should add a little sugar (rgyal mo ka ra).
With regard to this technique for enhancing the color quality,
The compound of vermilion and glue is easily made,
But, in any event, one should take care not to burn it in the fire.
Moreover, there are those who would add [other ingredients],
Including a compound of egg albumen and clear serum.
Although these techniques do have short-term positive results,
They will be defective [in the long term],
For which reason they should be rejected.[540]

The best of ingredients for writing books
Are vermilion and carbon black inks which are bright, shiny, and lustrous.
Even after many years have passed, their color will not fade,
And even though they may get wet, they will not stick or smudge.
If, diverging from this authentic transmission,
A scribe does not care for the ink, paper, and bamboo pen,
Even though he wishes to write carefully, he will make mistakes.
Since this is the case, one should take care of one's [writing] materials and utensils, and greatly cherish all the major and minor characteristics of calligraphy, which are [encapsulated in] the following three defining characteristics:
(1) the ink strokes (snag lam) should be neat; (2) the body of the letters ('bru khog) should be elegant; and (3) the spelling should be accurate, without omissions, additions, or errors.
It is best to follow the ancient tradition of calligraphy in which the hierarchy [of the scripts], based on the greatness [of their content] is not contravened. Thus, the block-letter script (gzab chen) and its headless variant (gzab chung) should be used for copying the great scriptures [of the buddhas], the large format italic script ('bru chen) should be used for copying the textual commentaries of learned Indian masters, and the small format italic script ('bru chung) should be used for copying texts of the Tibetan commentarial traditions.
I cannot digress here to consider the other kinds of calligraphy, exemplified by the new scripts (yig gsar),[541] the symbolic script [of the ḍākinīs] (brda' yig), and the scripts used in transcribing revealed teachings (gter yig) because they are limitless in number.[542]

With regard to [stūpas that are spontaneously present by nature], it is said in the Tantra of the Indestructible Array:[545]
The supreme bone relics [of the buddhas] (sku gdung chen po)
Are always present
In [the form of] mighty Mount [Sumeru]
Within the world-system of desire,
As an exalted tiered throne Within the world-system of form,
And as a dome-shaped receptacle and plinth Within the world-system of formlessness.[546]
The Supreme Transmission of Monastic Discipline also explains [the distinction between] the aspects of the offering receptacles (stūpa) of the outer container world (phyi snod) and its inner contents (nang bcud); while the Tantra of the Wheel of Time clearly explains that the four maṇḍalas (dkyil 'khor bzhi po) [of the four elements—earth, water, fire, and wind] are respectively visualized in the forms of (1) the tiers [of the stūpa] (vedī, bang rim); (2) the dome [symbolic] of Mount Sumeru (sumerukumbha, ri rab bum pa);
(3) the section from the high pavilion (harmikā droṇa, 'bre) downwards, [which symbolizes] the neck and face of Mount Sumeru; and (4) the rain gutter (varṣasthālī, char khebs), along with the [stacked] rings of the sacred teachings (chos 'khor), above [the high pavilion, which symbolize] the hair [of Mount Sumeru].[547]

With regard to [stūpas that are consecrated by blessings], in a well-known passage from the Tantra of the Emergence of Cakrasaṃvara, it is said:
The bone relics consecrated by blessing Appeared in eight parts on the four continents.
And in its commentary,[550] the following explanation is given:
In the eastern continent of Videha, there are two stūpas known as the “treasure of resplendent equanimity” (byin ldan snyoms gter) and the “svāstika crest with its well-fashioned arms” (mthar legs gYung drung tog). In the southern continent of Jambudvīpa, there are two stūpas known as the “emanation of compassionate spirituality” (thugs rje sprul pa) and the “wish-fulfilling spontaneous presence” (yid bzhin lhun grub). In the western continent of Aparagodanīya, there are two stūpas known as “the peerless and inconceivable [reality]” (dpe med bsam 'das) and the “wondrous and renowned expanse of reality” (rmad grags chos dbyings). Then, in the northern continent of Uttarakuru, there are two stūpas known as the “gemstone mountain of enlightened attributes” (yon tan rin chen brtsegs pa) and the “lamp of extensive bliss” (bde rgyas sgron me).[551]

With regard to [stūpas that arise through spiritual accomplishments], in the Tantra of Supreme Nectar it is said:[552]
The Eight Mātaraḥ are established As the great protectresses of corpses,
While the eight stūpas are also established As their great power places.
The [commentary] on this text explains that “In ancient times, when Rudra was disciplined by Heruka, eight stūpas arose through spiritual accomplishment as the receptacles of the eight Mataraḥ in the charnel grounds of eight [distinct] lands.[553] These included the Śaṅkara [Stūpa] in Magadha, the Mount Potala [Stūpa] in Siṅghala, the Bodhnath (bya khri kha shor) [Stūpa] in Nepal, the Geudosha[554] [Stūpa] in Siṃhadvīpa, the Gandha [Stūpa] at Gomasa in Khotan (li yul go ma sa la gan dha), the Kanaka [Stūpa] in Kashmir, and the Sukhakumāra (bde skyi dgzhon nu)[555] Stūpa in Sahor.[556]

With regard to [stūpas corresponding to the different vehicles], there are three sorts: those constructed in accordance with the vehicle of pious attendants (śrāvakayāna), the vehicle of hermit buddhas (pratyekabuddhayāna) and the greater vehicle (mahāyāna).[557] Among them, the first type resembles a monk s staff fixed upon an upturned begging bowl, resting upon a monastic robe folded in four (chos gos bzhi bltabs). The second resembles a cube, resting upon a square foundation, surmounted by twelve round tiers and an eight-spoke wheel. The third is said by the master Nagarjuna to include eight [distinct] stūpa [designs]—one that is round as a bimpa berry, resembling an upturned begging bowl; one that is shaped like a small house; one that resembles a victory banner (dhvaja); and so forth.[558]
Then, with reference to the different classes of the tantras, the stūpas of the Action and Conduct Tantras are said to have tiers that are internally cut short and externally projecting, or else projecting at the center with the two sides truncated, and surmounted by twelve [stacked] wheels and so forth. [By contrast, ] the stūpas of the Yoga Tantras include the aforementioned Vajra Mountain type, while those of the Unsurpassed Yoga Tantras (Yoganirut-taratantra) include those described in the Tantra of the Wheel of Time, and so forth.[559]

Now, it is said in the transmissions of monastic discipline ('dul ba lung) that, for holding the relics of an ordinary person, [stūpas] should be bare, without an umbrella spire (catrāvalī). For pious attendants, they should have umbrella spires, the number [of rings] corresponding to the degree of their fruitional [realization]. For hermit buddhas, stūpas should have an umbrella spire with seven [rings]; and for buddhas they should have an umbrella spire with thirteen [rings].[560] All of them should have a rain gutter (varṣasthālī, char khebs) and a [gemstone] crest (ketu, tog).
In this context, the term “umbrella spire” should be recognized as referring to the [stacked] “rings” or “wheels symbolizing the sacred teachings” (dhar-macakra), while the term “rain gutter” is synonymous here with “umbrella veil” (gdugs).

It is said in the esoteric instructions of particular lineages that since all stupas contain within them relics of the sacred teachings, they are all [to be identified as] offering receptacles of the buddha body of reality (chos sku'i mchod rten). Therefore, all types of stūpa emblematic of the conquerors (rgyal ba'i mchod rten) are conscientiously made at the present day, so that there exist [stūpas of] many different shapes and aspects constructed by living [masters], some of which contain relics of the transcendent lord [Śākyamuni Buddha] and can be classed as offering receptacles for his teeth, hair, nails, small bone relics (ring bsrel), and so forth, and others which do not. With regard to the foremost among them all, it is said in the Sūtra That Expresses the Goals of Activity:[561]
The bone relics should be placed within eight stūpas,
Which correspond respectively to the deeds of an emanational [buddha],
Once they have been revealed!
Therefore, when the extraordinary [eight] principal deeds of the Teacher [Śākyamuni Buddha] had been fully revealed [in the human world], the people of different lands constructed stūpas [to commemorate these enlightened acts], establishing the traditions of their [respective] festivals. Among them, the [following series of] eight stūpas accords with the systematic presentation found in the glorious master Nāgārjuna's Eulogy to the Stūpas of the Eight Supreme Sacred Places, and it is universally esteemed, conforming as it does to the generally accepted norm.[562]

In general, the measurements and the shapes of stūpas are indefinite. According to the sūtras it is said that the area covered by a stūpa containing relics of the Buddha may be [as large as] one yojana.[572] But it is also explained in the Sūtra of the Stacked Mansion House that a stūpa could be as small as a grain of emblic myrobalan, the umbrella spire as small as a leaf of Indian juniper, and the life-supporting pole or axis (yūpa, srog shing) [within it] as small as a needle.[573] Therefore, [the size of a stūpa] should be measured in accordance with the mental capacity of each individual and their particular degree of wealth. That said, the practical techniques for the proportional measurement [of stūpas] are important, so that constructional defects can be avoided.
Tibetan scholars generally attest to the method of [proportional measurement] that is documented in the Commentary on the Taintless Crown Protuberance, which was [originally] a renowned Chinese text, while there are also [indigenous] treatises [on this subject] composed by Buton [Rinchendrub], Taktsang Lotsāwa, Tulku Trengkheb Palden Zangpo, and others.[574] The proportional measurements of the regent Sangye Gyatso which combine the best aspects of all these [systems] have great currency throughout [Tibet] at the present day.[575]
According to the tradition of the Taintless [ Crown Protuberance], sixteen large units (cha chen) should be measured from the “virtuous foundation” slab (rmang dge ba) [of a stūpa] to its crest (uṣṇīṣa, tog), but according to the other [indigenous Tibetan sources], it is prescribed that the actual [height of the stūpa] should measure twelve large units, from the “small capping” slab (bad chung) upwards. Since decorative features are permissible from the “lion throne” podium (nemī, seng khri) upwards, there appear to be many [different] traditions [of measurement].[576] These measurements all refer to the height [of a stūpa]. The width [of the stūpa] is said to be half the height, or slightly more than half the height.

The venerable Eighth [Karmapa] elucidated the particularly sublime measurement grids (thig tshad) appropriate for the eight stūpas, basing his appraisal on the measurements given in the Chapter on Pristine Cognition (jñānapaṭala, ye shes le'u) from the Tantra of the Wheel of Time.[577] These can be examined in his Mirror of Great Sunlight.[578]
Therein, with regard to the particular symbolism which it is essential [to know], it is said:[579]
Upon the podium base (gdan gyi sa 'dzin) there are three steps (them skad gsum),
Above which are [successively] the “lion throne” podium,
And the “small capping” slab, which acts as a base for the gridlines (thig gdan).
Above these [in succession] are the [decorative] frieze of retentive mantra (gzungs sa),
The “large capping” slab (bad chen),[580]
And the “virtuous foundation” slab (rmang dge ba).
Above these in general there are the four tiers (caturvedī, bam rim bzhi),
Followed [in succession] by the “dome plinth” (bum rten),[581]
The actual dome (kumbha, bum pa) and the “high pavilion plinth” ('bre gdan),
And then by the high pavilion (harmikā, 'bre),
The [lotus] support of the umbrella spire (padmamūla, gdugs 'degs),
And the thirteen [stacked] rings
With their protruding “male” rims and truncated “female” rims,[582] Forming a garland of lotus light rays.
Above these is [the finial known as]
The “cross-beam containing sūtras and retentive mantra Of great compassion” (thugs rje mdo gzungs zhu gya gram).
This in turn supports the umbrella veil,
Surmounted [in succession] by a rain gutter,
A crescent moon, a solar disc, and a gemstone crest.

Concerning the natural purities that these represent, the meaning is elucidated as follows, based on the Differentiation of the Parts of a Stūpa, composed by the master Śāntigarbha:[583]
The “small capping” slab and the “frieze of retentive mantra”
Symbolize the six recollections.
The Targe capping” slab and the “tenfold virtuous foundation” slab
Symbolize the [four] immeasurable aspirations.
Alternatively, it is also said that these last two are reversed.
The four tiers respectively symbolize
The [four] foundations of mindfulness, the [four] trainings,
The four supports for miraculous ability, and the five faculties;
While the dome plinth symbolizes the five powers,
And the dome itself symbolizes the [seven] branches of enlightenment.
The high pavilion symbolizes the [eightfold] sublime path.
All these are the naturally pure causal attributes [of the stūpa].[584]
The life-supporting pole or axis symbolizes
The essential nature of the ten aspects of knowledge,
Namely, [knowledge of the sacred teachings, knowledge of] relative appearances,
Recollection [of past lives], [knowledge of] other minds,
[Knowledge of] the four truths, [knowledge of] the cessation [of corruption],
And [knowledge that] it will not be regenerated.[585]
The lotus [support for the rings] symbolizes
Skillful means and discriminative awareness.
The [thirteen] rings symbolize the ten powers,
And the three essential recollections.
The rain gutter symbolizes compassion,
While the crest symbolizes the buddha body of reality.
Those [attributes] are explained to embody the essential nature of the stūpa.[586]

The decorative features [of the stūpa] symbolize enlightened attributes.
Among them, the long stone slab [of the base] symbolizes
Possession of the four fearlessnesses,
The steps [above it] symbolize the four [commitments] that are not to be guarded,
The victory banner symbolizes victory in battle over the four demonic forces,
The flower garlands symbolize the blazing major and minor marks,
The four victory banners symbolize the reality of the four truths,
The bells symbolize the buddha speech that is endowed With the sixty attributes of the voice of Brahmā,
The sun and moon symbolize the dawning of pristine cognition,
The mirror symbolizes possession of the four facets of pristine cognition,
The crown symbolizes attainment of the kingdom of the sacred teachings,
And the streamers symbolize that the pleasant sound Of the sacred teachings is pervasive—
Those are the naturally pure fruitional attributes [of the stūpa].[587]
Then, [specifically with regard to
The Stūpa of the Wheel of the Sacred Teachings, ]
The multiple gates symbolize the four truths
And the eight approaches to liberation,
As well as [the twelve links of] dependent origination,
And the sixteen types of emptiness.[588]
The projecting bays symbolize that acts of benefit are performed
For the sake of living beings
By means of extraordinary and sublime emanational forms.
The step ladder symbolizes that the Buddha appeared For the sake of others,
The lotus symbolizes that he is uncovered by the stains of cyclic existence,
While the absence of tiers symbolizes Freedom from engagement in the rebirth process,
And also freedom from conceptual elaboration.[589]
With regard to the [Stūpa of] Resolving Schism,
The causal attributes symbolize [control of] the three poisons,
And the evenly truncated tiers of the mid-section symbolize
The eight approaches to liberation.[590]

The uncommon stūpas (thun mong ma yin pa'i mchod rten) may be [exemplified by] the stūpa of pristine cognition (ye shes kyi mchod rten), [which is formed by the indestructible buddha body] and described in the [Tantra of] the Wheel of Time.[591] In this regard, when the Buddha is seated in a cross-legged posture, the area from his navel downwards corresponds to the tiers [of the podium]; and the swelling of his navel or abdomen, to the dome plinth. Then, [the chest] as far as the shoulders corresponds to the bulging dome; the throat, to the high pavilion; and [the face] from the chin to the tip of the nose and the hair ringlet corresponds to the face [painted] on the high pavilion ('bre gdong). From there [upwards], as far as the top-knot, [the crown of the head] corresponds to the [stacked] wheels of the sacred teachings, along with the rain gutter and the crest.[592]
The measurement of the height [of this stūpa] is said by Taktsang Lotsāwa to be 57*5 [lit. five times eleven and a half] finger-widths, and this [measurement], which is generally accepted, accurately correlates to the five energy centers ('khor lo lnga) [within the subtle body], extending from the secret center (gsang gnas) as far as the crown protuberance.[593]
However, according to Belo Tsewang Kunkhyab, the height should be fifty finger-widths, and the width half of that.[594] The vertical grid is divided into four bands, each measuring twelve and a half finger-widths. This correlates proportionately to four hundred thousand yojana—the distance from the circle of wind [below the world] as far as the world-system of formlessness [at the summit of existence],[595] and as such it accurately corresponds to [the extent of] the outer world. It similarly correlates [in proportion] to the inner [or subtle] indestructible body (rdo rje'i lus) [of the meditator], extending from the soles of the feet as far as the crown protuberance; and it is also said to incidentally and accurately correlate to the bodies of other deities as well. In short, this measurement correlates collectively and accurately to [the proportions of] the external [world], the inner [human form], and also to other [subtle visualized and divine forms].[596]

Apart from all those stūpas that are commonly and universally known, there is the particularly sublime Jnanabimbakāya—“the form body of pristine cognition” (ye shes gzugs kyi sku), also known as the Stūpa of Intangible Glory (dpal reg pa med pa'i mchod rten). This is [said] to be present in the form of rainbow-colored light, in the sky above the so-called “town stūpa” (mchod rten grong), in the land of Konkana, which hugs the ocean shore in South [West] India.[597] The venerable Sakya Paṇḍita has referred to the whole region that lies beneath this stūpa in the following verse:[598]
This land, known as Cāritra,
Is located by the ocean shore, in the south.
With regard to that land known as Cāritra, it is where Vajravārāhī is known to have ritually summoned or brought together all the ale of the three levels of existence (srid pa gsum).[599] After she had mixed all the yeast and grain liquor that there was, the quantity increased manifoldly, and when the essence [of that yeast] had been exhausted, she let it set for a while, so that [its potency] was renewed. After this had happened on seven occasions, [subsequently] at auspicious times, the whole region [of Koṅkana] was permeated by the fragrance of the wine.
In that place there was a large reclining stone image of Mañjuśrī, named Jñānakāya, located by the ocean. On auspicious occasions many [extraordinary] phenomena would [naturally] manifest around both [the place and the statue], various sounds of music and fragrances of incense offered by deities would be perceived, along with red fires in the night-time [sky]. These events were witnessed and heard by all.

The [aforementioned] stūpa too would at all times be perceived in common by ordinary persons in a form resembling a smoky apparition in the sky, for which reason it became known as the Smoky Stūpa (du ba can gyi mchod rten). The awareness-holder Tsewang Norbu established its dimensions, based on the verbal description of Jestun Rinpoche [Tāranātha], and with regard to its symbolic meaning, it has been said:[600]
There is also another explanation whereby
The steps symbolize the three levels of going for refuge,
While the vajra seat (rdor gdan), the gold leaf (gser phye),
The lotus (padma) and the cornice (pha gu)
Symbolize the four philosophical systems.[601]
The three great faces [painted on the high pavilion]—
Upper, middle, and lower—and their peripheral features Symbolize respectively the maṇḍalas of the buddha mind,
Buddha speech, and buddha body of the Glorious and Supreme [Kālacakra].[602]
The dome symbolizes the ascendance of the Sugatas,
While the high pavilion and its peripheral features Symbolize the four delights.[603] The [stacked] wheels of the sacred teachings Symbolize the thirteen [buddha] levels (sa bcu gsum),
While the crest symbolizes the buddha body of supreme bliss,
And the rain gutter symbolizes the pure deeds of the three buddha bodies.[604]
The image [within the niche of] the dome (bum sku)
Symbolizes the buddha bodies of reality and perfect resource,
While its pediment symbolizes the buddha body of emanation.
The lowest of the great faces symbolizes the slow stepping
Of the glorious constellations,[605]
While the upper two, with the dome and so forth,
Symbolize the maṇḍala of the power of buddha speech,
Which pertains to the expanse of reality.[606]
In this way, the beneficial attributes [of this stūpa] in particular are more sublime than those of the stūpas constructed according to the traditions of the ordinary [causal] vehicles and the traditions of the lower tantras. Furthermore, it is said that in the place where this stūpa is located [i. e., Koṅkana] there is an abundant [harvest of] grain, and it is endowed with an abundance of food and beverages—fruits, molasses, wine, and so forth.

On the Lotus Hill (padmagiri, padma'i ri) or Ox Horn Hill (gośṛṇgaparvata, glang ru'i ri) in Nepal, there is also a self-originated great stūpa that is called venerable and sacred (rang byung mchod rten chen po rje bo dam pa). When the guide and king of the sacred teachings [Buddha] Śikhin appeared in the world during the age when living creatures had a life span of seventy-thousand years, the expanse of reality (dharmadhātu) naturally arose in a crystalline form from the anthers at the heart of a lotus, fashioned of gemstones. Then, during the age of [the Buddha] Kanakamuni, in order that Dharmaśrīmitra might be accepted into his following, [the bodhisattva] Mañjuśrī emanated the maṇḍala of the power of buddha speech from the expanse of reality into this stūpa, so that the stūpa was named accordingly. [Later] during the age of [the Buddha] Kāśyapa, it was covered with earth and concealed by the accomplished master Śāntaśrī. Subsequently, during the age when our Teacher [Śākyamuni] appeared in the world, it manifested in its [present] form.[607]
As indicated in the new translations of the omniscient Tenpa Nyinje [i. e., Situ Chokyi Jungne], who formerly highlighted these [extraordinary] traditions, there were many [such stūpas] of extraordinary dimensions and shape that existed in the past, which were mostly unheard of by those [later individuals] who arrogandy boasted of their scholarship.

In the tantras of the Nyingma tradition of the secret mantra, there are said to be many categories [of extraordinary stūpas] derived from the transmitted teachings (bka' ma) and the treasures (gter ma), such as the aforementioned “stūpas of the eight virtuous abodes” (dge gnas brgyad kyi mchod rten),[608] as well as the exegesis on the dimensions and designs [of the stūpas] corresponding to the nine sequences of the vehicle (theg rim dgu yi tshad dbyibs) that derive from the empowerment of the bodhisattvas conduct (byang chub sems dpa'i spyod dbang), and so forth.[609] However, these are basically subsumed in the abovementioned description.
The classifications of the types [of stūpa] outlined above can also be found in the authoritative and earliest account, entitled Source of Enlightened Attributes: The Methods of Constructing the Three Representational Supports, which was composed by Tsamorong Sonam Ozer, a student of Drogon Chogyal Phakpa. Furthermore, they are also identical in meaning to the [account found in] the Method of Constructing Stūpas, derived from the Eight Transmitted Teachings: Consummation of Secrets [which was revealed by Guru Chowang], Takstang Lotsāwa's Ocean of Wealth is based upon [these two sources], for which reason his version can be said to represent their common ground.[610]

Previous generations have established the conventional meanings of the vajra and the bell, which are foremost among the symbolic hand-held emblems included among the representations of buddha mind.[611] Among them, the bell corresponding to the outer [tantras] (phyi dril) accords with the defining characteristics presented in the Tantra of the Indestructible Peak, which is an exegetical tantra (bshad rgyud) of the Yoga Tantras; and the bell corresponding to the inner [tantras] (nang dril) accords with the explanations derived from the Tantra of the Wheel of Time, the Tantra of the Emergence of Cakrasaṃvara, and the Tantra of Embrace.[612]
Although systematic presentations have been extensively offered by Gangkar Dorjedenpa and Khedrub Gelek Pel [-zangpo], there is no need to discuss them [here] because their respective traditions are widely known,[613] but with regard to the distinctions between these two [outer and inner approaches], Taktsang Lotsāwa explains:[614]
Whether vajras have five prongs (rtse lnga) or nine prongs (rtse dgu), there are some which do not have their prongs emerging from the mouths of [ornamental] sea-monsters but instead rest [directly] on their lotus bases; and there are some which at their [outer] extremities do not have the tips of the [peripheral] prongs actually touching the central prong (dbus rva), while the [other] end of the central prong is fixed into [a hub], encircled by symbolic motifs such as the lotus and the [moon] disc. The prongs may be as sharp as the thorns of acacia, and round, and fluted.[615]
As for the bells, some may have an open ring (bug pa) in place of the vase [of nectar], which is positioned below the head of Brahmā motif [on the handle]. Above the motif known as the “[eight faces of] glory” (kīrtimukha, grags pa), on the bulbous body [of the bell], [there is the motif of eight lotus petals]. Bells corresponding to the outer [tantras] have the seed-syllable or symbolic hand emblem of [Buddha]locanā on the eastern petal [of the lotus], while, by contrast, those corresponding to the inner [tantras] have the seed-syllable or symbolic hand emblem of [Samaya] tārā.

According to the tradition of the Yoga [Tantras], the vajras and bells corresponding to the five enlightened families are all differentiated; while according to the Unsurpassed [Tantras], there are two traditions—that of the Tantra of the Wheel of Time and that corresponding to the [Unsurpassed] Tantras in general (rgyud sde spy i 'gro'i lugs).[616]

[Similarly,] in the case of the hand-drum (ḍamaru, cang te'u), the defining characteristics and craftsmanship techniques of their long-tassled valances (dra ba can) and back-to-back skulls (thod pa ltag sprod) are [also] distinguished [in the outer and inner tantras].[617]
[The same goes for] all six ornamental [hand emblems] (rgyan drug)[618] and the pair of homa ladles (dgang gzar blugs), as well as the two kinds of hand emblem that are widely mentioned in the tantra texts of the Nyingma tradition, namely the ritual spike surmounted by the five-pronged vajra (phur bu rdo rje rtse lnga) and the tantric staff emblazoned with the motif of the crossed vajra (sna tshogs rdo rjes mtshan pa'i khaṭvāṅga), and so forth.[619]
While it is very important to master in detail the proportions and shapes of the [various] hand emblems, exemplified by the sword, axe, and trident, which are [also] included here, I shall not digress at this juncture, fearful of the large number of texts [on this subject]. If one wishes to understand their modes, these can be learned from the clear [explanations] given in the Collection of Rites by the master Kuladatta and in the aforementioned Tibetan texts, and so forth.[620]

In contrast to [mundane music and dance], which cause the mind to wander in all directions due to fleeting attachments and the desire to dress provocatively, the [ritual] playing of large and small drums, as well as big-boss cymbals (sbub chol) and small-boss cymbals (sil snyan) is integral to the way of [secret] mantra, with the purpose of making offerings to the [three] precious jewels (dkon mchog). Along with the choreographic techniques of the sacred masked dances (gar 'chams stangs stabs), and so forth, these are all included within the extraordinary aspects of the physical arts.
[At first, ] the material of the drum wood, the techniques for attaching the [drum-skin] covers, and the positive and negative qualities of the big-bossed and small-bossed cymbals should be understood, in accordance with the descriptions found in the [relevant] ancient treatises and practical instructions (dpyad don).[621]
Then, with regard to the ways of beating the drum, Candraśrī has said [in the Systematic Presentation of Drums and Cymbals]:[622]
Do not stir the middle of the great ocean,
Do not circumvent Mount Sumeru and the four continents,
Do not pass the rocky boundary between the mountains and the plains,
And do not strike the “face of the king of wild beasts.”[623]
Also:[624]
There are eight unacceptable drumming styles (mi bskul ba'i tshul brgyad),
Including one [that is top-heavy like the crack of] a thunderbolt, One that is like the [lamentable] beating of the chest,
One that is like the plaintive cry of a beggar,
And one that is like the flapping of a small birds wings.[625]
One should strike with the drumstick's own weight,
Flexing the finger [joints of the drumming hand slightly],
At an area of the [drum] surface one “knuckle-width” above the lower rim,[626]
And then immediately let [the drumstick] rebound.[627]
When the [mass drummers] are playing, aligned in a row,
They should just keep the beat in turn, one after the other,
And avoid disparities of height and arrangement,
Aligning the drums evenly and elegantly,
Like a threaded string of gemstones.[628]

And:[629]
When one beats the drum during rites of pacification,
The drumming technique should be slow and relaxed.
When one beats the drum during rites of enrichment,
The drumming technique should be clear and resonant.
When one beats the drum during rites of subjugation,
The drumming technique should be pleasant and melodious.
When one beats the drum [imposingly] during rites of wrath,
The drumming technique should be strong and swift.[630] When beating during the rite of wrath continues without interruption,
It should resemble the fall of a meteor.[631]
There are extensive explanations such as this concerning the different moods to be evoked, and so forth.[632]
Also, with regard to [the playing of] the big-bossed cymbals and the small-bossed cymbals, the same [author] says:[633]
The low sounds (pho sgra) resonate noisily and charismatically,
The high sounds (mo sgra) resonate sweetly and elegantly,
While the neutral sounds (phyed ma) resonate clearly and resoundingly.
During rites of pacification, [the roll of the cymbals] should resemble light drizzle,
During rites of enrichment, it should resemble the blustering of wind and rain,
During rites of pacification, it should resemble torrential rainfall,
And during the rites of wrath, it should resemble a crescendo of lightning and hail...
There are thus twelve similes (dra dpe bcu gnyis) describing the ways in which [the cymbals] and the drums are played.
It is also said in the Treatise on Musical Instruments entitled The Single Knowledge that Liberates All, which was composed by Jamyang Sonam Wangpo:[634]
In general, whatever type of cymbals (rol mo) is being played,
The advice is that one should not hold them tightly,
And that the chest and the hands should not come into contact.
Do not raise [the big-bossed cymbals] up like a club,
And do not hold [the small-bossed cymbals] straight as a pillar.

And in the words of Candra[sri]:[635]
Do not forsake the [necessary] space,
And do not constrict the [natural] resonance [of the cymbals].
They should not touch the chest and the knees.
And with regard to the defining characteristics of the [postures] that are to be rejected and adopted, the same text says:[636]
With the shoulders and the arms relaxed from the wrists,
Play with a flexing movement of the palm,
And strike with [the cymbals'] own weight!
Do not shake [the cymbals] with the tips of the fingers...
And:[637]
One should refine one's understanding of the different striking techniques:
Decrescendo ('jab), rebounding ('phar), loud, soft, harsh,
Light, heavy, clear, and resonant.[638]
In this way, it is explained that one should master the different striking techniques (sgra thabs), which accord with specific rituals.[639]

Choreographic rituals include those for preparing the [dance] arena (sa bzung ba'i stangs stabs) and the specific sacred offering dances (mchod pa'i gar), which are explained in the Tantra of the Wheel of Time, the Tantra of the Ocean of Sky-farers, the Tantra of the Indestructible Tent, the Yoga Tantra entitled Indestructible Garland, and so forth. Also included here are the genre of the basic sacred masked dance of the herukas (khrag 'thung rtsa 'chams) and the sacred masked dance of exorcism (brub 'chams), which are performed in accordance with the [tantras of] the Nyingma tradition, such as the Wrathful Deities of the Magical Net, the Gathering of the Great Assembly, the Eight Transmitted Teachings: Means for Attainment, and above all the [cycles of] Vajrakīla.[640] Moreover, there are also the sacred masked dances of Lord [Mahākāla] (mgon 'chams) which are found throughout both the Ancient and New Traditions (gsar rnying).[641]
All of these [choreographic rituals] generally employ the nine dramatic demeanors of the dance (gar gyi nyams dgu), concerning which the master Candra[śrī ], in particular, has said:[642]
The upper part of one's body should maintain the demeanor of a lion (seng chags),
The waist should maintain a demeanor of elegance ('khril chags),
The wrists and ankles should maintain a demeanor of dexterity ('phrul chags),
The thigh muscles should maintain a relaxed demeanor (lhod chags),
The blood should maintain a fiery red demeanor (mer chags),
The countenance should maintain a handsome demeanor ('gying chags).
The movements should maintain a slow demeanor (dal chags),
The knees should maintain a supple demeanor (ldem chags),
The feet and the head should maintain a demeanor of happiness (bde chags),
And overall [the dancer] should maintain a demeanor
That is both heroic and magnificent (dpa' zhing brjid chags pa).

Dances evoking fear and awe are defective if they are too vigorous.
Dances evoking grace and suppleness are defective If they are too carefree.
Dances evoking speed and ease are defective if they are too hasty.
Dances evoking slowness and relaxation are defective If they are too indolent.
Dances evoking elegance and attractiveness are defective If they are too fickle.
With regard to the particulars that should be avoided and evoked [during the performance of a sacred masked dance]: after generally learning the detailed and common instructions, one should study to the point of mastery whatever the unbewildered primary sources of one's own particular tradition happen to be.[643] Above all, it goes without saying that it is essential for the preparatory dances (sa gar) and the offering dances (mchod gar) to be undertaken in an authentic manner because they are associated with the tantras and the practical traditions of [Ancient] India.

At this point, I should refer to those tantra texts from which there derives the “basic sacred masked dance of the herukas” (khrag 'thung rtsa 'chams), according to the Nyingma tradition. The following verses are found in the Tantra of the Flash of the Splendor of Pristine Cognition:
It is said by the heroes [vīras] that,
Once the disposition in which all things are sameness has been understood,
Everything that stirs or moves becomes the seal [of that reality].
[Therefore], one who maintains these [sacred] dance steps
With meditative stability in his or her own [meditational] deity, Would terrify even the Buddhas themselves,
Let alone the host of arrogant spirits!
The Tantra of the Lasso of Skillful Means also mentions the necessity of these [choreographic] techniques for securing the seals.[644]
The individual practitioner who engages in this practice should maintain the perspective of the indivisible truth, realize the superior great buddha body of reality (lhag pa'i chos sku chen po), and, through the appropriate meditative stability, master the indestructible sacred dances (rdo rje'i zlos gar), securing all appearances and conduct with the seal of the [meditational] deity.[645]
The ways of achieving this [realization] are the objectives of the teachings derived from the unsurpassed tantras of the Vajra family, including the root and exegetical tantras of the Magical Net, and the Supramundane Sūtra entitled Heruka Galpo.[646] These teachings descended from King Indrabhūti [in ancient India] through to the [era of the] three wise men (mkhas pa mi gsum), in a transmission that included the Tibetan translators Ma [Rinchenchok] and Nyak [Jñānakumāra], the eight “glorious” sons (dpal gyi bu brgyad), Nub [chen Sangye Yeshe], the Zur [family], and Dar [charuwa]. Later, the transmission was widely propagated by the brothers from Mindroling [Terdak Lingpa and Lochen Dharmaśrī], who were lords of the most secret teachings.[647] [Among them] Lochen Rinpoche composed and thoroughly established the Choreographic Treatise of the Sacred Dances entitled The Display of Samantabhadra. This [text] includes both the basic sacred dance of the Herukas (khrag 'thung rtsa 'chams), which is associated with the maṇḍala rituals, and the exorcist dance of the hostile and obstructive spirits (dgra bgegs brub 'chams), which is associated with the application of the wrathful rites [of sorcery] (drag po'i las sbyor).[648]

The former contains the following thirteen sections (don tshan bcu gsum):[649]
(1) In order that their bodies might be unharmed by obstructive spirits, [at the outset, the dancers] don the dance costumes (chas gos) and hold the hand emblems that have been consecrated through the pride of the [meditational] deities.[650]
(2) In order that the radiance of the [mundane] gods and ogres might not infiltrate, [the dancers] dedicate the merit of an oblation (gser khyems) [to the protector deities].[651]
(3) In order that the crimes of proclaiming the secret [teachings] might be rejected, [the dancers] visualize the world and its contents as the maṇḍala, so that they come to possess the ten aspects of physical movement that are commonly esteemed, as well as the three masteries of the seals, and the enlightened attributes that conform with the three similes of the bodily ornaments.[652] In this way, they proceed into the maṇḍala arena.
(4) [The dancers] then stand in their respective sectors, corresponding to their [respective] enlightened families.[653]
(5) The master [of the sacred dances] visualizes himself as the lord of the circle, while the others assume the actions of the offspring, so that the maṇḍala [of deities] is completely emanated. The consecratory blessings (bskur brlab) should then be directly absorbed [into the dancers], and the [appropriate] offerings made.[654]
(6) The students [positioned] in the [four] directions should then be consecrated, so as to assume the forms of the female consorts of the four enlightened families (rigs bzhi'i yum).[655]
(7) After making their preparatory offerings and eulogies, the female consorts of the four directions then pray that the maṇḍala might be explained.[656]
(8) The master [of the sacred dances] arouses the meditative commitments of the conquerors who permeate all space.[657]
(9) Aversion and hatred are exorcised by the sacred dance step of indestructible reality (rdo rje'i gar) and the obstructive forces are expelled.[658]
(10) [Following this exorcism,] the [dance] arena is prepared (sa bzung ba) through the choreographic movements of the deities of the maṇḍala, which comprise[659]

The three [initial] dance moves,[660]
The [dance movement] creating the dharmodaya symbol,[661]
The [dance movement] overpowering [phenomenal existence],[662]
The [dance movement] visualizing the ḍākinīs as heroines,[663]
The [dance movement] drawing in the vitality of [oath-] breakers,[664]
The [dance movement] summoning the oath-bound [protectors],[665]
The three [dance movements] consecrating the celestial,
Intermediate, and terrestrial abodes respectively as a wheel,
The eight auspicious symbols, and a lotus,[666]
And the three [dance movements] of the half-vajra, single vajra, and double vajra,
Through which the dance arena is respectively
Staked out, tamed, and consecrated.[667]
In this way the general consecration is carried out by means of these twelve preliminary choreographic movements (sngon gro'i stangs stabs bcu gnyis).
Then, the seven visualizations of the receptacles that support [this maṇḍala] (rten bskyed bdun) are to be made. These comprise[668]

The [protective] circles of space, wind, blood,
Human corpses, skeletons, and fire,
Along with the [actual] celestial palace.
Thereafter, the visualizations of the [deities] supported [by this purified and protected receptacle] are to be undertaken. These comprise the following nine classes [of deities] who perform the graceful dance of the central Mahāśrī [Heruka] (gtso bo dpal chen po'i 'gying 'chams):[669]
The central [heruka] and those of the four [surrounding] families,
The female consorts of all five enlightened families,
The eight gaurī, the eight female [piśācī] headed by Siṃhamukhī,
And the four female gatekeepers,
The īśvarī, the [lesser] piśācī, and their corpse-wielding retainers (bam len)
All perform the powerful sacred dance of Mahāśrī [Heruka].[670]
In this way, in the main part [of the sacred dance], the consecrations of the particular [deities] take place through their individual choreographic movements.

(11) The obstructive forces (vighna) of the ten directions are transfixed by the ritual spike.[671]
(12) Extreme views of eternalism and nihilism are eliminated.[672]
(13) [Finally], the dedication of merit and aspirational prayers (bsngo smon) are undertaken, along with the benedictions (shis pa brjod pa), which [altogether] comprise an ornate finale.[673]
By performing [the sacred dances] in this way, based on the movement and actions of the indestructible body (rdo rje'i lus), the great waves of the two provisions [of merit and pristine cognition] are increased.[674] This therefore is a marvelous technique for attaining the [four] rites and the [supreme] spiritual accomplishment with ease.[675]

[Among other traditions,] the basic sacred dance of Vajrakīla (phur pa'i rtsa 'chams) that accords with the tradition of Sakya is integrated (kha bsgyur ba) in the context of the ceremony dedicated to their [lineage of] glorious and sacred spiritual teachers (dpal ldan bla ma dam pa).[677]
Also, it is claimed that the three hundred and sixty aspects of the dance known as the great masked dance of the assembly of Cakrasaṃvara (bde mchog tshogs gar chen mo) which accords with the auspicious [lineage] of Zurmang (bkra shis zur mang), was conferred upon Drungpa Ma-se Lodro Rinchen, an emanation of the buddha Tilopā, after he had constructed an actual image of the tathāgata and lord of the [sacred] teachings Cakrasaṃvara.[678] These [sacred dances] offer a great approach to the most exalted blessings that were conferred upon him, favored as he was by the body of pristine cognition (ye shes kyi sku) in the buddha-field of the buddha [Tilopā].
Again, in a pure vision, when Guru Chokyi Wangchuk came into the presence of the great master [Padmasambhava] on the Glorious Copper-colored Mountain (zangs mdogdpal ri), the vision that was imparted and the content of the advice he received is contained without error in the renowned sacred dances of the tenth day ceremony (tshes bcu'i gar 'chams), according to which all sentient beings—even animals—who see [these dances] will become students of the great master [Padmasambhava]. It is said that [Guru Chowang's revelations] have such beneficial attributes.[679]
Therefore, since all [sacred dances], exemplified by these, have their [distinctive] purposes, even the most minute aspects of their respective traditions should be observed without error.

As for the common physical arts, these include the construction of high-rise buildings, such as royal palaces, and buildings with as many as five hundred rooms, as well as the residences of ordinary people. They also include [the construction of] large ships which can traverse the great oceans and small boats which can cross the rivers of India, Nepal, China, and the like. They include the particular styles of clothing and ornaments suitable for men and women, as well as the culinary preparation of food and beverages.[680]
Moreover, the astonishing contraptions that are used for acts of aggression against enemies are mentioned in the Tantra entitled Summation of the Real.[681] These include artillery or stone-catapults, which are used to destroy fortresses on the plains; naval cannons, which are used to destroy fortresses at sea or on rivers; catapults of [Greek] fire, which are used to destroy fortresses in the mountains; catapults of curved knives, which are used against a [protective] circle of swords; catapults of wind, which are used to expose the summit [of a fortress]; tented [siege] catapults, which are used to destroy walls; catapults of metal barbs or arrows, which are used for destroying armor; and catapults of swords or lances, which are used to defend one's own position.[682]
Also [included in this category of common physical arts] are the specifications of war chariots for the ruling classes, the specifications of stadia or grand buildings used for holding spectacular events, the specifications for palanquins used at festivals, and turbines that channel water upstream for irrigating gardens.[683]
Moreover, [the common arts] also include the knowledge and technologies pertaining to the making of armor—breastplates, helmets, shields, and the like—as well as arrows, bows, swords, and other types of weaponry.[684]

The master Candraśrī has explained in his Treatise on Melody entitled Neck Ornament of Clear Intelligence:[686]
Through knowledge of speech, endowed with elegance,
The causal basis of the two kinds of spiritual accomplishment[687] Becomes an offering to sublime beings And a boon to sentient beings.
Innate or natural musical sound (lhan skyes rol mo), including the particular aspects of melody which have this specific purpose, refers to the offering hymns that are sung to the [three] precious jewels (triratna). It says in the [transmissions of] monastic discipline:[688]
At first the Teacher [Śākyamuni] prohibited actions associated with singing, dancing, instrumental music, and the like, for which reason the liturgical prayers recited as a eulogy to the Buddha and so forth became nonsensical and garbled. Consequently they were ridiculed by extremist [teachers], and householders had no faith [in them]. Therefore, the householder Anāthapiṇḍada made a [specific] entreaty. At that time, the Teacher granted permission for melodic chants to be intoned as an offering to the [three] precious jewels. [The householder] again said that he did not know how to intone melodic chants, whereupon [the Teacher] replied that they should be intoned like the hymns of the Brāhmaṇa Vedas.[689]
More specifically, in the context of the way of [secret] mantra, there is the Chant of Yoga (yo ga'i gdangs) which was propagated by Lochen Rinchen Zangpo, as well as the Greater and Lesser Melodic Chants of Lord [Mahākāla] and his sister (mgon po Icam dral), while according to the Nyingma tradition of the way of [secret] mantra, there are the [special] intonations of the awareness-holders (rig dzin gyi gsung).[690] All of these, which have unbroken transmissions, are the oldest [chants in Tibet].
Later, [the melodic chants] familiar to the diverse [Tibetan] schools were formulated in accordance with their respective purposes, but I shall not digress here to generalize on these traditions which should be [carefully] studied, or indeed the masters who taught them, the students who were their recipients, the ways in which they should be imparted, or their [potential] pitfalls and advantages, and so forth.[691]

The essence of melodic contour (nga ro) which is to be studied and refined comprises the four [primary] aspects of melodic contour, along with their twelve subsidiary aspects, and the infinite variety of [melodic] permutations that arise when these notes are intermingled (spel ma'i sbyor ba).[692]
Among the four primary aspects of melodic contour[693]
(1) The sustaining note (sthāyī, 'dren pa) may be of five types, because it may be induced by the vowel A, which is level or neutral (drang po), E which is sharp (bsgreng ba), I which is flat (bkug pa), o which is high (bstod pa), or U which is low (smad pa).[634]
(2) The descending note (avarohī, bkug pa), through its undulation (khug), may last for a single beat (rkyang pa) or multiple beats (brtsegs pa).[695]
(3) The changing note (sañcārī, bsgyur ba) occurs due to repetition (nyis 'gyur) and includes three types—guttural variation (mgrin bsgyur), lingual variation (Ice bsgyur), and nasal variation (sna ldan bsgyur).[636]
(4) The ascending note (ārohī, Itengs pa) occurs by raising [the voice an octave] and may be of two sorts—long and short.[697]
Concerning [the functions of these primary aspects of melodic contour], Sakya Paṇchen has said:[698]
The changing note is most important for offering chants,
The sustaining note is most important for songs,
The changing note of short duration is suitable for narratives,[699] While short combinations of the changing and sustaining notes Are suitable for recapitulations.[700]
Although in general all [four primary melodic contours]
May be applicable in all instances,
The sustaining note is regarded as the most important among them.
In order that these [primary aspects of intonation and chant] might be understood, the following similes are applied: Melodies that emphasize the sustaining note are said to resemble a wish-granting tree; those that emphasize the descending note resemble a creeping flower plant; those that emphasize the ascending note resemble a river that is slowly crossed because the current is weak in mid-stream; and the undulations of the changing note ('gyur khug) are explained to resemble the moon [reflected] on [the surface of] an ocean.[701]

In all these [aspects of chant and intonation], the preliminary training that is undertaken should emphasize three essentials—courage or brilliance (spobs pa'i gnad), tempo (dus kyig nad), and refinement (sbyangs pa'i gnad), through which the six defects (skyon drug) and their five causes (rgyu lnga) also should be abandoned. The former comprise mental flaws of distraction and the like, verbal flaws of imperfect diction and the like, melodic flaws of excessive or deficient intonation and the like, physical flaws of decrepit posture and the like, the flaw of having unsuitable associates, and the flaw of having an audience that is scornful or prone to ridicule.[702] Moreover, the following five causes which may give rise to negativity should also be abandoned:[703]
The cause that provokes reproach When [chanters] are ignorant of the words,
The cause that provokes ridicule
When they do not employ [the correct] melody,
The cause that provokes sadness when it is untimely,
The cause that provokes negativity when there is no need to do so, And the cause that provokes suffering Due to [the chanters'] inadequate training,
Faint-heartedness, or feeble intelligence,
Whenever learned persons are present,
Whenever they are surrounded by a large gathering,
Or whenever they have evil associates and many enemies.

With regard to these six great ceremonial events (chenpo drug), the master Candraśrī continues:[705]
Melodic chanting should be undertaken Within six great contexts:
Offering rites of attainment (sgrub mchoci),
Empowerments (dbang bskur) and consecrations (rab gnas), Anniversary offering ceremonies (dus mchod),
Funerary rites (gshin don), and elaborate burnt offerings (shyin sreg rgyas).

When [chanting] is undertaken at the right time and in the right circumstances, the melodic intonations that are chanted in congregations are designated as the “roar of the lion” (seng ge'i nga ro) because the voice has to be loud. Altogether, there are twelve distinctive modes of chan ting (len tshul gyi khyad par bcu gnyis) including [this “lions roar”], and these should be employed as and when appropriate. Therefore it is explained [in Sakya Paṇchen's Treatise on Music]:[706]
Like a lion's roar in congregations,
Like the buzzing of a bee in isolated retreats,
Like the melody of a parrot in the company of the learned,
Like the beauty of the peacock among the ignorant,[707]
Like a leader[708] who inspires confidence in all at times of sadness,
Like the arrow of Kāmadeva, in pursuit of a lover,
Like a virtuous flower among offerings,[709] Like a saline river, refining negativity,
Like a divine drum when praising one's own side,
Like an overpowering wheel [of sharp weapons]
When subduing the other party,
Like melodies of perfume that waft sweetly in all directions,
And like one with a garland of flowers,
Intermingling [these modes of chanting].
Through [metaphors] such as these,
The distinctions [achieved] by the intermingling[710] [Of the primary and ancillary melodic contours]
Should be well examined.
There are also other sorts of melodic composition,
Which should also be applied, as and when appropriate.[711]

When the defining characteristics [of voice pitch] applicable in ordinary contexts are abbreviated, it is said:[712]
There are [also] twelve [modalities of voice pitch] —
Rising ('degs), pausing ('jog), deep (sborn), high (phra),
Tense (grim), relaxed and variable (lhod du 'gyur),
Pliant (ldem), sweet (snyan), covert (gsang),
Decisive (gcod), and connective (sbrel).
On these, Candra[śrī] has said [in his Treatise on Melody entitled Neck Ornament of Clear Intelligence]:[713]
Long but balanced, short but perfect,
Majestic but graceful, pleasant but regular,[714] Firm but yielding, inarticulate but intelligible,
Manifold in voice but in unison,
In unison but enriched with many melodic contours.
In short, [these modalities of voice] should be capable Of being retained by the simple-minded,
And they should cause the wise to rejoice.
Those [endowed with such voices] are worthy of veneration By erudite persons, and they are pleasing to all.
They should attract the high-minded and gratify the common man. They majestically stand out among the crowd,
They captivate the learned and are praised by all.
Separated from enemies and obstacles,
They gather spiritual accomplishments,
And on this basis they will certainly attain the genuine result.

In addition, there is the category known as the eight subjects of scrutiny (brtag pa brgyad). Among them, the scrutiny of land (sa gzhi brtag pa) and the scrutiny of water (chu brtag pa) are discussed in works such as the master Dahura [Nagpo]'s Tantra of the White, Black and Variegated Hundred Thousand Stanzas.[722]
The Scrutiny of Gems and Precious Metals is a treatise composed by the scholar (paṇḍita) Mahoṣadhi, and, based upon that, discussions are found in many early and later works composed in Tibet, such as the White Lotus Bouquet of Investigation.[723]
As far as “human gems” (mi'i nor bu) are concerned, the cranium or skull-cup (kapāla), the so-called “inner begging bowl” (nang gi lhun bzed), according to the way of secret mantra, is also included in this category. Therefore, [the scrutiny of skulls] is clearly mentioned in works such as the Great Tantra of the Emergence of Cakrasaṃvara and discussed in the writings of Tibetan scholars as well as in the esoteric instructions and spiritual revelations based on the Tantra entitled Mountain of Corpses, Fortress of Skulls, the Private Tantra: Black Skull of the Charnel Ground, the Citadel of the Wind Goddess, and similar works.[724]
[Works on] the scrutiny of trees and the scrutiny of elephants (Ijong shing dang glang po brtag pa) were not translated in Tibet; and the scrutiny of underground treasures (gter brtag pa) is only mentioned partially and for illustrative purposes in certain tantra texts, other than which the authentic Indian texts were not translated.
The scrutiny of horses (rta brtag pa) is discussed in Śālihotra's Compendium on the Inspection of the Life Span of Horses, composed by the hermit sage [Śālihotra], and in the Mirror Trilogy translated by Drugu Sengdo Ochen, as well as in the different treatises composed by thirteen royal ministers (rje blon bcu gsum), headed by [the Tibetan emperor] Trisong Detsen.[725]
The scrutiny of men and women (pho mo brtag pa) is found in the miscellaneous tracts on human nature (mi dpyad thor bu) and in the discussions on yoga found in particular tantra texts, as well as in the eightfold scrutiny of women (bud med brtag pa bcas brgyad) that is explained in the Hundred Thousand Scrutinies of the Ḍākinīs within the Nyingma tradition of the way of secret mantra.[726]

In [Nāgārjuna's] Stem of Discriminative Awareness it is said:
If the religious traditions of human beings are well investigated,
The god realms will not be far distant,
And if the ladder of gods and humans is scaled,
Liberation will be near.
There are treatises on [human] behavior (lugs kyi bstan bcos) which offer an initial introduction to the common foundation or starting point applicable to both aspects of science (gtsug lag gnyis) [i. e., verbal expression and meaningful content].[727] Such works include the Letter to a Friend, the Hundred Verses on Discriminative Awareness, the Stem of Discriminative Awareness, the Point of Human Sustenance,[728] the Treasury of the Collection of Topics, the Hundred Verses on the Collection of Topics, the Answers to the Questions of Vimala[kīrti], Cāṇakya's Treatise on the Behavior of Kings, [the Treatise on Human Behavior] composed by Masurakṣa, and the Eloquence of Sakya, which essentializes all of these [aforementioned Indic] works.[729]
Furthermore, it will also be necessary to master related texts, such as the Garland of the Essential Points of the Religion of the Gods and the Religion of Humans, which were composed in Tibet by Gyalwa Tene and Dromtonpa.[730]

<d e="2">
In the Extensive [Commentary] on the Minor Transmissions, composed by the master Śīlapālita, a quite different classification [of the sixty-four crafts] is presented.[735]
According to such texts, the common arts are mainly to be performed with mind as their precursor, and when all of them are subsumed together, they may be gathered within the following four categories (sde bzhi):
(1) The category of wealth or objects (nor ram don gyi sde) comprises the things one studies or learns and so forth, as well as the material objects, merchandise, gemstones, precious metals, and other resources that are acquired with effort and their accumulation then guarded.
(2) The category of desire ('dod pa'i sde) comprises the desired attributes of the senses experienced by [mundane] gods, humans, and other beings who do not inhabit the inferior realms of existence, which are partaken of as objects [of enjoyment].[736]
(3) The category of religion (chos kyi sde) comprises the limitless number of positive teachings which are the causal basis for [rebirth in] the three exalted (abhyudaya, mngon mtho) or higher realms of existence (trisvarga, mtho ris gsum), and for [the attainment of] definitive excellence (niḥśreyasa, nges legs) and the three degrees of enlightenment (byang chub gsum),[737]
(4) The category of liberation (thar pa'i sde) comprises the enlightenment attained through the three vehicles, which reverse suffering and its causes.[738]
Among all these categories, the first two are with reference to cyclic existence (saṃsāra, 'khor ba), since those who strive after objects of desire seek to acquire wealth as their causal basis. The last two are with reference to nirvana, since those who strive after liberation [from cyclic existence] persevere to acquire the sacred teachings, and, if one were to distinguish between them, they correspond to two [distinct] modes [of liberation], causal and fruitional.

All the many classifications of knowledge, including those just mentioned, may therefore be subsumed within the arts of the mind. This is why, for example, the omniscient Dri-me Ozer [Longchen Rabjampa] has said [in his Treasury of Wish-fulfilling Gems]:[739]
These [arts of mind] are known to include
The six classes of sentient beings, the four modes of birth,
The six grounds, the ten measures of time,
The seventeen material objectives (dngos po bcu bdun),
The fourteen useful devices (yo by ad bcu bzhi),
The eight pursuits of daily life (rjes su spyod pa brgyad),
The ten mundane pastimes ('jig rten spyod bcu),
The three kinds of discourse (gtam rnam pa gsum),
The twenty-two kinds of misconduct (nyes rtsom nyer gnyis),
And similarly the sixty-three categories of sentient being (sems can rigs),
The eight phases of the life-cycle (dus brgyad),
The four ways of entering [the womb] ('jug pa bzhi),
The six [acceptable] modes of livelihood ('tsho ba drug),
And the six things to be well guarded (kun nas bsrung ba drug),
The seven kinds of pride (nga rgyal bdun),
And the seven kinds of self-satisfaction (rgyags pa rnam pa bdun), The four kinds of conventional expression (tha snyad bzhi),
And the manifold bases of conventional expressions (tha snyad mangpo'i gzhi),
The six kinds of knowledge (mkhas pa drug),
And the nine themes of [the Buddhas] transmitted teachings (bka'i dngos po dgu),
Along with the eight themes of cyclic existence ('khor gyi dngos po brgyad).[740]

It perfectly reveals the meanings of the eight aspects [of medicine][742] and is great on account of its extensive benefits for all [sentient beings], regardless of their status.

(4) There are three [predominant] locations of the humors (rten gsum) [leaves 39-41], namely, the upper part of the body (stod) [where phlegm is predominant], the lower part of the body (smad) [where wind is predominant], and the middle part of the body (bar) [where bile is predominant],
(5) There are fifteen pathways [affected by pathogenic humors; leaves 42-56], namely, the bodily constituents (lus zung), the impurities (dri ma), the sense organs (dbang po), the solid viscera (don), and the hollow viscera (snod), each of which has specific associations with pathogenic wind, bile, and phlegm.[750]

[The Arboreal Metaphor]
In brief, [the root of] physiology (gso yul) and pathology (nad gzhi) gives rise to eighty-eight [leaves], [the root of] diagnosis to thirty-eight [leaves], and [the root of] the methods of remedial treatment to ninety-six [leaves]. Since the entire content of medical science is established within [this framework], the [arboreal] metaphor of the Aśoka tree has been justifiably applied.[766] Similarly, the “flowers” (me tog) symbolize the freedom from disease and longevity acquired by those who have properly understood and implemented [medical science], as outlined above; while the “fruits” ('bras bu) symbolize the endowments of the sacred teachings, wealth, and well-being.
Concerning the application of these appropriate metaphors, the [Root] Tantra itself says:[767]
There are nine stems that evolve from the three roots,
Forty-seven branches that diverge from [these stems],
Two hundred and twenty-four leaves that flourish,
And radiant flowers that ripen into the five fruits.
These are all explained in the paradigms of the Root Tantra.

Through these [topics], the instructions that concern the remedies or antidotes [for disease] are perfectly presented.[771]
In general, all matters pertaining to [the health of] the physical body and so forth are well known to accord with these [so-called] “eight categories of patients” (gso yul gyi yan lag brgyad).

The first of these [diagnostics] includes both pulse palpation (reg pa rtsa)[777] and urinalysis through visual observation (mthong ba chu la brtag pa).[778] The second includes the nine therapeutic principles (gso tshul rnam pa dgu).[779] The third [the curative methods] number twenty-three altogether. These include
(1 - 8) the eight classes of tranquilizing agents (zhi byed sde tshan brgyad), namely, decoctions (thang), medicinal powders (phye ma), pills (ril bu), pastes (lde gu), medicinal butters (sman mar), medicinal ash (thal sman), medicinal concentrates (khaṇḍa), and medicinal wine (sman chang). There are also gemstone and precious metal compounds (rin po che'i sbyor bd) which can counter complications and relapses, and herbal compounds (sngo sbyor) which are effective against sudden diseases.[780]
(9-15) the seven cathartic procedures (sbyong byed bdun); preliminary oil therapy (sngon 'gro snum 'chos), the five main cathartics (sbyong byed dngos gzhi las lnga): purgatives or laxatives (bshal), emetics (skyugs), nasal medications or snuff (sna smart), mild enema ('jam rtsi), and strong enema (ni ru ha), and the [supplementary] procedure of channel cleansing (rtsa sbyong), which can counter complications and relapses[781]
(16-23) the [six] techniques of external therapy (dpyad pa): bloodletting (gtar ga), moxibustion (bsreg pa), medicinal compresses (dugs), fomentation (lums), massage with ointment (byugs pa), and minor surgery (thur ma), which can counter complications and relapses.[782]
These [twenty-three procedures] may also be reduced to eighteen practical methods of treatment (lag len bco brgyad) when the last five types [of tranquilizing agent], such as medicinal ash, are subsumed within the five types of primary tranquilizing agent (zhi byed rtsa ba'i sde tshan lnga).[783]

With regard to the physiology of the human body, in respect of which treatment is applied, the following [seven] topics are established:
(1) the understanding of human embryology (chags pa'i tshul rtogs). In this regard, the primary cause (rgyu) of human conception refers to [the simultaneous conjunction in the womb] of white and red generative fluids [including sperm and ovum] and a consciousness [inclined to rebirth] (dkar dmar rnam shes gsum). The secondary cause (rkyen) of [embryonic and fetal] development refers to the nutrients that derive from the navel and the umbilical cord. Also included here are the [various] indications associated with parturition.[785]
(2) the understanding of human anatomy (lus gnas kyi nyams shes) based on the application of metaphors, whereby the king [symbolizing the heart], the ministers [symbolizing the lungs], the queens [symbolizing the liver and spleen], and the royal subjects [symbolizing the other organs] are supported within a palatial mansion [symbolizing the tissues and limbs].[786]
(3) the understanding of the natural condition of human physiology, which has four parts:
(a) the natural condition of the bodily constituents (lus zungs kyi gnas lugs), i. e., the exact measurements (ldang tshad) of the [three] humors, along with chyle (dvangs), its residual impurities (snyigs), muscle tissue, bone tissue, and so forth [present in a healthy human organism of average build].[787]
(b) the natural condition of the interconnecting channels ('brel pa rtsa'i gnas lugs), comprising the channel of embryonic formation (chags pa'i rtsa), the channels of existence (srid pa'i rtsa), the channels of connection ('brel pa'i rtsa), and the course of the life span principle (tshe gnas pa'i rtsa).[788]
(c) the natural condition of the vulnerable points (gnyan pa gnad kyi gnas lugs), the seven categories of which include [the vulnerable points of] the muscles, the adipose tissue, the bones, the tendons and ligaments (chu rgyus), the solid viscera, the hollow viscera, and the channels.[789]
(d) the natural condition of the [inner] passageways and [external] orifices (bu ga'i gnas lugs) which are the digestive tracts (zas kyi rgyu lam) for chyle and its residual impurities.[790]

(4) the understanding of the defining characteristics of human physiology (lus kyi mtshan nyid rtogs), based on the elements that are subject to harm (gnod bya khams), i. e., the seven bodily constituents (lus zungs bdun) and the three impurities (dri ma gsum), and the humors that may be harmful (gnod byed nyes pa), which comprise the fifteen types of wind, bile, and phlegm. These are all considered in terms of their formation (grub tshul), their nature (rang bzhin), their metabolism (me drod), their role in the process of digestion (lto ba), their locations [within the human organism] (gnas pa), their functionality (byed las), and their characteristics (mtshan nyid).[791]

(5) [the understanding of] physical activities (lus kyi las), including general actions associated with body, speech, and mind which are non-specific (lung ma bstan) in terms of virtue and non-virtue, and particular actions through which the five sense faculties (dbang po lnga) engage with their own particular sense objects.[792]
(6) the understanding of the [further] distinctions (dbye ba) between these [physical activities], based on sex—male, female, and hermaphrodite; age—old age, childhood, and adult maturity; and the natural human constitution (rang bzhin)—which includes different human characteristics associated with [combinations of] the three humors, as well as the distinctions between non-pathological humors and their pathological transformations.[793]
(7) the determination of the signs of decay ('jig pa'i ltas) in respect of the physical body, based on the [distinctions between] the four categories [of signs]—those that are observed at a distance [from the patient] (ring ba), those that are observed at close proximity [to the patient] (nye ba), those that are of uncertain outcome (ma nges pa), and those that are of certain outcome (nges pa can).[794]
The natural condition or physiology of the [human] body which is to be treated [by the physician] should be understood on the basis of these seven topics, each of which has many subdivisions.

<d e="2">
With regard to the pathological diseases (nad) which are to be treated, there are five topics:[795]
(1) Concerning the primary causes of disease, the remote primary causes (ring rgyu) are the three poisons (dug gsum), which derive from fundamental ignorance (ma rig pa),[796] and the immediate primary causes (nye ba'i rgyu) are [the imbalances of] the three humors (nyes pa gsum) generated by them.
(2.) The three secondary causes (rkyen gsum) which aggravate diseases comprise
(a) the sensory activity fields (skye mched kyi rkyen) of the seasons, sense organs, and modes of conduct, which may be deficient (dman), excessive (lhag pa), or abnormally absent (log pa);[797]
(b) the [covert] gathering and [overt] arising (gsog rkyen) [of the three humors] which tend to gather, arise, and subside in accordance with their primary causes, natures, and the [different] seasons (rgyu ngo bo dus gsum);[798] and
(c) the [fully manifest] arising (slong rkyen)[799] [of diseases], which may be defined in the general context [of the three humors] or in terms of their specific [indications].[800]
(3) The inception of disease (nad 'jug tshul) is the process through which the three humors enter into their six [respective] pathways (lam drug) or areas of inception ('jug sgo), targeted by the four secondary conditions (rkyen bzhi) [of season, demonic possession, diet, and regimen] which direct [dysfunctions] towards their respective [humoral] locations or targets, so that they become localized.[801]
(4) The characteristics of [the different types of] disease (nad kyi mtshan nyid) are based, following this inception, on the three degrees to which the bodily constituents and the three impurities diverge from the standard measurements (ldang tshad) [of a healthy human organism] —whether in excess ('phel), deficiency (zad), or a state of [mutual] aggravation ('khrugs pa).[802]

(5) The classifications of [diverse] diseases (nad kyi dbye ba) include
(a) three that are made on the basis of primary causes (rgyu), i. e., those that originate from the actions of past [lives], those originating from the humoral [imbalances] of this life, and those originating from a combination of these two.
(b) five that are made on the basis of [the sex or age of] the patient (rten), i. e., [diseases] specific to males, females, children, the elderly, and those that are common to all [types of patient].
(c) four[803] that are made when the last [mentioned subcategory of common] diseases are [further] enumerated on the basis of their humoral disorders (nyes pa), their main features (gtso bo), their types (rigs), and their locations (gnas).
However, there are [also] limitless classifications based on the typology of the twenty-five vulnerable [humoral disorders] (gnod bya nyi shu rtsa lnga) and their subdivisions, including [diseases distinguished by] a single isolated humor (rkyang pa), and those [distinguished by] a dependent humor in association with others (ldan dres pa).[804]
The characteristics of the pathological diseases to be treated [by the physician] should be properly understood on the basis of these five topics.

With regard to the remedies which treat diseases (nad gso byed gnyen po rnams), there are four topics:[805]
(1) Among them, the first is the important topic of regimen (spyod lam),
which has three aspects:
(a) continuous [daily] regimen (rgyun du spyod pa) includes activities which prolong the life span, activities associated with worldly pursuits, and those associated with the sacred [teachings] (dam pa);[806]
(b) seasonal regimen (dus spyod) includes reliance on the [different] remedies appropriate for the [different conditions] that [covertly] gather and [overtly] arise during the six seasons [of the year];[807]
(c) occasional regimen (gnas skabs kyi spyod pa) [entails the non-suppression of natural functions] in order that [diseases] might not [suddenly] arise and in order that those that have arisen might be alleviated.[808]
(2.) Dietetics ('tsho ba zas) also has three aspects:
(a) the [diverse] types (tshul) or categories of food and beverages should be understood;[809]
(b) there should be dietary restrictions practiced (bsdam par bya ba) in respect of [food and beverages that are] incompatible with the body;[810]
(c) moderation should be observed with regard to the quantity of food intake (zas tshod ran par bza').[811]
(3) Compounded medications (sbyor ba'i sman) have six [different] tastes (ro drug) and seventeen [different] attributes (yon tan bcu bdun) that arise from their eight [distinct] potencies (nus pa brgyad), as well as three kinds of post-digestive taste (zhu rjes gsum).[812]
The compounding methods (sbyor ba'i thabs) applied in remedies for all kinds of diseases should be mastered. These include sixty-three [types of compound differentiated according to their taste], which are remedies for the [diverse] diseases that arise. For there are fifty-seven compounded tastes (ro bsdebs sbyor ba lnga bcu rtsa bdun) and six [basic or] isolated tastes (rkyang pa drug) which may be applied as remedies to counter the seventy-four different degrees of [humoral] excess or deficiency.[813]
Then, when [medications] are compounded according to their potency, they include both tranquilizing and cathartic [compounds].[814]

(b) rough therapy (rtsub pa'i dpyad) includes bloodletting (gtar), moxibustion (sreg), and minor surgery (dbug pa);[817]
(c) rigorous therapy (drag po'i dpyad) is of four types, including incision ('dral ba), excision (gcod pa), scraping ('drud pa), and extraction ('by in pa);
(d) the surgical instruments [utilized in these therapeutic applications] include fourteen sorts of probes (zug rngu brtag pa'i dpyad bcu bzhi), such as the “needle-headed” probe [for the exploration of cranial fractures] (khab mdo); six kinds of forceps (skam pa rigs drug), such as the “lion-mouthed” forceps (seng ge kha), used for extracting foreign bodies; six kinds of lancet (gtsag bu'i sde drug), such as the “lancet shaped like a sparrows feather” (bye'u sgro 'dra), which are used for incisions of the muscle tissue and to cause bleeding; nine kinds of surgical stylets (thur ma dgu), such as the “stylet shaped like a reed nib” (sbubs thur smyu gu), which are used for making punctures (btsag dbugs) and releasing [fluids or] vapors (dbugs 'dren); and assorted minor instruments, such as the cannula [for irrigating wounds and applying anal suppositories] (gce'u), the cupping horn [for extracting serum] (rngabs ra), and the fire-cupping bowl [used to siphon off fluids from surface boils] (bum pa).[818]
[The practicing physician] should persevere compassionately with these [remedies] in order to treat the [various] types of pathological disease.

(3) Then, there are nine special therapeutic principles, through which diseases are to be treated:[828]
(a) When [the physician] has not yet understood [whether a specific disease is to be classified as one of heat or cold] and is hesitant, the clinical test (sad mda') should be applied [cautiously, like a creeping cat approaching a mouse].
(b) When [the physician] is certain [as to the nature of the disease], having diagnosed it correctly, medication or external therapy should be actually [and openly] applied, [as if hoisting a silken banner on a mountain top].
(c) When [the physician has made a correct diagnosis but] the remedy does not immediately take effect, the course of [secondary] ailments has to be stabilized [as if goading an untamed horse along].
(d) When an ailment has been previously treated [by another doctor and the prescribed medication is diagnosed] to have been deficient, excessive, or counter-indicative, the remedy should be changed [and the mistake swiftly rectified, like a gull catching a fish].
(e) When treating the most serious diseases, the remedy should be expertly applied [as if meeting a deadly enemy on a narrow path].
(f) When treating less serious types of disease, the remedy should be applied gradually [as if scaling the rungs of a ladder].
(g) When, with regard to the three humors, a disease caused by a single isolated [humoral dysfunction] is treated, the remedy should not harm the other [humors, like a hero vanquishing an enemy].
(h) When combined humoral disorders are treated, the cure should be applied proportionately [like a chieftain resolving a dispute].
(i) In all cases, the treatment should be commensurate with the disease and unerring [like the balanced loads carried by hybrid cattle and sheep].

(1) They should have an analytical intelligence, which is broad-minded, steadfast, and refined.
(2) They should have a virtuous or positive outlook, endowed with lovingkindness and compassion.[832]
(3) They should keep their commitments, including the six [commitments] that establish an attitude [of respect for medical teachers, texts, and colleagues] (blo zhag drug), the two [commitments] that are to be retained (bzung bya gnyis), and three that bring about understanding (shes pa gsum).[833]
(4) They should be skillful [in therapeutic techniques]—dexterous in hand, pleasant in verbal communication, and brilliant in their knowledge [of diagnosis and treatment].
(5) They should persevere in their own [medical] studies and training, and be without idleness in attending to their patients.
(6) They should be learned in [basic] human values (mi chos), maintaining saintly characteristics (dam pa'i msthan nyid) and excellence in all ordinary modes of behavior (kun spyod).
In addition, they should have rejected the twelve defects of inferior [doctors] (tha ma'i skyon bcu gnyis), such as the absence of an authentic lineage, and the lack of observational skills or experience.[834] Instead, they should be endowed with supreme qualities. Mastering the ordinary medical practices pertaining to body, speech, and mind, and in particular the practices of the [Buddhist] view, meditation, and conduct, they should maintain a [high] standard that accords with the aforementioned therapeutic principles. Consequently, both they themselves and others [who encounter them] will enjoy the results of immediate happiness [in this life] and long-term well-being [in future lives].

Although there are a few dissimilar opinions as to what subjects actually constitute the enumeration of the “five minor sciences” (rigs gnas chung ba lnga),[835] it is said in the Tantra of Renunciation:[836]
A bodhisattva, in order to inspire sentient beings, should study the treatises of poetics for the sake of others, along with the treatises of synonymics which list both homonyms and synonyms; the treatises of prosody which classify metrical verses according to their varying numbers of heavy and light syllables and the degree to which they are interspersed with [passages of prose]; the treatises of dramaturgy which delight audiences through their discourse, humor, and multi-lingual variation; and the treatises of astrology which make astonishing revelations, appraised on the basis of mathematics. This is because that bodhisattva wishes to attain the unsurpassed and completely perfect enlightenment.
In recent times there has been a consensus that the interpretation [of what constitutes the five minor sciences] should accord with this passage. [The postposition] “among” (las) completes this introductory line of verse.

The point [of astrology] is that since this [science] is undeluded with respect to the mathematical calculations and circumstances applicable in the world of relative appearances, it should disclose without error the things [or courses of action] that are to be adopted or rejected. The well-known [systems] of astrology (skar rtsis) which maintain this purpose include both outer [non-Buddhist] traditions and inner [Buddhist] traditions,[837] and among them here [in Tibet, the tradition] which adheres to the [astrological system] enunciated in the King of Tantras [The Wheel of Time] is [considered to be] the most useful or purposeful.
According to this [system of the Wheel of Time], it is important, at the outset, to understand the precision of the inner world (nang gi nges pa): The abiding nature of reality (de kho na nyid kyi gnas lugs), the emptiness that is free from conceptual elaborations (stong pa spros bra!) owing to the contamination of fundamental ignorance (ma rig pa), its mode of bewilderment, has been fabricated or superimposed in a limitless number of gross apparitional forms.[838] These include dichotomies exemplified by object and subject, or the outer and inner [worlds], and trichotomies, exemplified by the energy channels, winds, and generative essences (rtsa rlung thig le) [within the subtle body], or [the three energy channels of] the Sun, Moon, and Rāhu.[839]
It is this mere apparitional aspect [of emptiness] that underlies the astrological calculations to be made in respect of ordinary individuals,[840] while the actual techniques or methods of astrological calculation are mathematical computations applied to [ascertain] the interdependence or correlation [of these apparent phenomena].

Dependent on the left-side energy channel (lalanā, gYon rkyang ma) [of the subtle body], [this vital energy] generates the objective aspect [of the subject-object dichotomy] which is nature endowed with “lightness” (sattvaprakṛti, snying stobs kyi rang bzhin), setting in motion the five peaceful planets (zhi gza' lnga) respectively through the [progressive elemental] sequence—space, wind, fire, water, and earth. Meanwhile, dependent on the right-side energy channel (rasanā, gYas ro ma), the same vital energy manifests as nature endowed with “motility” (rajaḥprakṛti, rdul kyi rang bzhin), thereby generating the primal self (pradhāna, gtso bo), which is the subjective or conceptualizing aspect [of the same dichotomy], and setting in motion the five wrathful planets (drag gza' lnga) respectively through the [regressive elemental] sequence—earth, water, fire, wind, and space.[842] For this reason it is said that, in the case of the external world, the stepping of the planets in a slow orbital motion (dal rkang) and the stepping of the planets in a fast orbital motion (myur rkang) and so forth[843] may be correlated with the calculations applicable to the fire element and the wind element respectively.[844]
The number of the years (lo grangs) and so forth after which these planets will enter into a state of vacuity at the end of the four ages [of time][845] may also be correlated with the inner [or subtle, microcosmic] body, as stated above, in which case a mature adult male, free from ill-health, should be taken as the [ideal] exemplar: At first five maṇḍalas are set in motion through the [progressive] sequence of the elements—space, wind, fire, water, and earth—emerging exhaled from the left nostril, dependent on the left-side energy channel [of the subtle body], and each of these maṇḍalas is equivalent to three hundred and sixty [breaths]. Then, five maṇḍalas are set in motion in the reverse order, through the [regressive] sequence of the elements—earth, water, fire, wind, and space—absorbed or inhaled into the right [nostril], dependent on the right-side energy channel [of the subtle body].

[On this analogy, it is said that] when the processes associated with the formation and dissolution of the world have come to an end, there will endure a state of vacuity (stong par gnas); or else when the spheres (maṇḍala) of the planets have come to an end, they will enter into [a state of] vacuity.[846] Corporeal beings, after [completing] the cycle of birth and death, similarly enter into the [state of] natural inner radiance (rang bzbin 'od gsal).[847] Such are the points [indicated here].
In accordance with this principle of correlation, there are six major cycles [of breath] ('pho chen) associated with the odd-numbered solar mansions (mi mnyam pa'i khyim), starting with Aries (meṣa, lug), which emerge from the right-side energy channel and six major cycles [of breath] associated with the even-numbered solar mansions (mnyam pa'i khyim), starting with Taurus (vṛṣa, glang), which emerge from the left-side energy channel.[848] Together, these [solar mansions] form the “twelvefold cycle of the ascendant conjunctions” (dus sbyor gyi 'pho ba bcu gnyis),[849] which is [precisely] equivalent [in its duration] to twenty-one thousand six hundred breaths—i. e., the total number of breaths (rang dbugs) in a single [solar] day.[850]

Therefore, internally, once the elements have completed their course of exhalation and inhalation over two major cycles [of breath], they come to rest in emptiness or vacuity within the central energy channel [of the subtle body]. This is the meaning that accords with the [Buddhist] teachings.
In other contexts, in order to induce eternalistic extremists to enter upon [the Buddhist path], this [process] is [provisionally and artfully] presented as if it were due to a powerful “self” (puruṣa, gtso bo), for whom one single breath is equivalent to one thousand and two hundred human years.[851] When two major cycles of his breath have come to an end, it is said that, externally, one Great Age [of time] (mahāyuga) will come to an end;[852] and that in the interval between [these] and [the next] of his [major breathing] cycles, [the breath] will enter the central energy channel [of his subtle body], while externally the planets will enter into a state of vacuity.
Concerning the timing of this entry into [the state of] vacuity (stong 'jug), the followers of the Tsurphu tradition hold that the actual calculations presented in the Tantra [of the Wheel of Time] should be taken literally, while the followers of the Phugpa tradition hold that the [actual] calculations were concealed in order that [non-Buddhist] extremists might not understand them, and that therefore [the comments of the Tantra] are not to be taken literally. [On this basis] they invented a new and detailed “textbook system of calculation” (grub mtha'i zhib rtsis).[853]
Furthermore, just as sentient beings transmigrate and take birth through vital energy, by the power of their all- [embracing] conceptual thoughts, similarly the precision of time may also be observed sequentially in the external [world]. This is why, at the end of the solar mansion Pisces (nya khyim), on the thirtieth day of the month of Phālguna (dbo zla ba), in the fire tiger year [which is the last year of the Jovian sexagenary cycle], the exact longitude (longs spy od rnam par dag pa) of the planets and constellations is conventionally designated as an “entry into vacuity” [i. e., zero degrees]. Then, once again from the first day of the month of Caitra (nag zla) in the [fire hare] year of Prabhāva (rab byung), [which is the first year of the next sexagenary cycle], the mean longitudinal positions (rtag pa'i longs spyod) pertaining to all the years, months, planets, and constellations newly arise.[854]

In the sky the Sun marks out its celestial longitude, [moving] anti-clockwise through the twelve solar mansions, while on earth the four seasons rotate cyclically through their [corresponding] twelve terrestrial aspects which are indicative of past actions, changing and moving in a clockwise manner.[859] So it is that the solar mansions of the constellations (skar gyi khyim) and the zodiac, dependent on the motion of the wind element (rlung 'gros), move clockwise [rising in the east and setting in the west] in the course of each solar day. By contrast, the planetary bodies, [moving anti-clockwise] through their respective motions (rang 'gros), demarcate their celestial longitude against the constellations and solar mansions.

Unlike the other planetary bodies which [appear to] move anti-clockwise [from west to east] around Mount Sumeru [i. e., the Earth] because the motions of their epicycles turn eastwards upon the [band of] constellations, the eclipser Rāhu, by contrast, from the perspective of ultimate [truth], [is said to] steal the power of the other planets because it is endowed with merits, orbiting Mount Sumeru in a clockwise manner [from east to west], since it turns westwards, in conformity with the motion of the wind element that propels the solar mansions. For this reason, Rāhu demarcates its longitude in reverse, starting from [the constellation] Pisces (Revatī, Nam gru) and ending with Aries (Aśvinī, Tha skar).
Furthermore, since Rāhu internally is an aspect of the pristine cognition within the central energy channel [of the subtle body], the nature of Rāhu may also be understood through the adamantine meditative stability (vajropamasamādhi) which destroys aspects of bewilderment with regard to relative [truth]. In accordance with this perspective, correlated to the external world, while the other planets demarcate their celestial longitude in an anti-clockwise manner, and are weak in power (stobs dman), Rāhu takes an opposite course because it is endowed with the higher power of merit.[860]

Since Rāhu partakes of the nature of emptiness or vacuity within the central energy channel of [the yogin's] own body, and is unobscured and unimpeded in terms of the physical elements, its upper part (yar sna) has [the appearance of] a ball of semen (dpyid kyi gong bu), formed of the water element, and its lower part (mar sna) has [the appearance of] a blazing seed (thig le), formed of the fire element. Moreover, since Rāhu is endowed with a single purity in respect of both external and internal aspects, its body is vacuous, unobscured and unimpeded, like the space element, while its head (vaktra. gdong) is black, embodying darkness, the nature of the water element, and its tail (puccha, mjug ma) is red and fiery, [embodying] the nature of the fire element. These two [nodes—the head and the tail—] are the coarsely [appearing aspects of Rāhu], which have the power to cause [solar and lunar] eclipses.[861]
Internally [within the subtle body], during the last of a series of three “seasons” (try ṛtu, dus gsum) [each lasting two months], which are respectively named motility (rajas), lightness (sattva), and darkness (tamas), [Rāhu] steals the power of the right-side channel through the vital energy of great darkness (mun pa chen po'i rlung). Similarly, when the [cycle of the] six elements— earth, water, fire, wind, space, and pristine cognition—comes to an end [after six months], it steals the power of the left-side channel.[862]
By analogy, in the outer [world], the eclipser Rāhu (mun can) appears to enter [across the path of] the Sun in the interval between the waxing and waning phases of the Moon [i. e., on the thirtieth day of the lunar month], once three “seasons” [i. e., six lunar months] have elapsed, whether this period is calculated on the basis of a single link [of dependent origination] or a single “season” corresponding to two months [of the year],[863] Furthermore, when six months have elapsed [on the fifteenth day of the lunar month], Rāhu appears to enter [across the path of] the Moon.[864]

According to [the system] whereby [the Sun is considered to] rotate sequentially through the twelve links of dependent origination (dvādaśāṅgapratītyasamutpāda, rten 'brel yan lag bcu gnyis), solar eclipses (nyi 'dzin) inevitably coincide with the last day [of the lunar month], which is identified with the link of dependent origination known as “contact” (sparśa, reg pa'i rten 'brel). Commencing from the lunar mansion (khyim zla) Aries, one link [of dependent origination] is assigned to each of the twelve months, and within each of these links [or months], the first solar day (nyin zhag) [in turn] corresponds to [the link of] “fundamental ignorance” (ma rig pa), the second to [the link of] “formative predispositions” ('du byed), the third to [the link of] “consciousness” (rnam shes), the fourth to [the link of] “name and form” (ming gzugs), the fifth to [the link of] the “six sensory activity fields” (skye mched drug), the sixth to [the link of] “contact” (reg pa), the seventh to [the link of] “feeling” (tshor ba), the eighth to [the link of] “craving” (sred pa), the ninth to [the link of] [the “grasping” (len pa), the tenth to [the link of] the “rebirth process” (srid pa), the eleventh to [the link of] “birth” (skye ba), and the twelfth [to the link of] “aging and death” (rga shi).[865]
Thereafter the cycle is repeated, from “fundamental ignorance” to “aging and death,” corresponding to the thirteenth to twenty-fourth [solar days], and again from “fundamental ignorance” on the twenty-fifth day through to “aging and death” on the sixth day [of the following month], and from “fundamental ignorance” on the seventh day [of that second month] to “aging and death” on the eighteenth day, and from “fundamental ignorance” on the nineteenth day to “aging and death” on the thirtieth day.
In brief, [over a two-month cycle] it is said that the thirtieth day will coincide either with [the link of] “contact” or with [the link of] “aging and death,” and that an eclipse may occur when [the link of] “contact” is present— [a day] that occurs in rotation [every other month]. At the mid-point (dbus) of this [day or] link of “contact,” the exact Moon (zla dag) and the exact Sun (nyi dag) may be eclipsed by the motion of Rāhu.[866]

Dependent on three kinds of zodiacal epicycle (go la'i 'gros gsum)—those of the Sun, the Moon, and the wind element—there emerged the zodiacal or sidereal day (khyim zhag), the calendar day (tshes zhag), and the solar day (nyin zhag). The first of these is longer [in its duration], the second is shorter, and the last is intermediate between these two [in its duration], as has been explained in detail above.[867]
The principal aspect among the [various] divisions of time, which include years, months, and so forth, is the solar day, which depends on the epicycle of the Sun.

Corresponding to every three “ascendant conjunctions,” there is a single [six-hour] “juncture” (sandhyā, thun mtshams), so that [in the course of a whole solar day] there are four such [six-hour] “junctures.”[868] Likewise, corresponding to every one and a half “ascendant conjunctions” there is a single [three-hour] “watch” (prahara, thun tshod), so that [in the course of a whole solar day] there are eight such [three-hour] “watches.”[869]

At this juncture, incidentally, we should consider the starting point of the monthly cycle, in the course of a year. It says in the Sūtra of the Nucleus of the Sun:
I am referring to the constellation Pleiades.
When the Moon is full [in Pleiades], [the cycle of] months will be complete.
Thus, I affirm that the “late autumn month” should herald the start of the year.
On this basis, it is said that the year should start with the month of Kārttika (smin drug) [or late autumn] because Pleiades (kṛttikā, smin drug) was the first of the lunar mansions, according to the sequence originally established for the course of a given year.[873] However, as is known in the world, it is the early spring month (dpyid ra) [equivalent to Caitra (nag pa)], that is generally considered to start the year.[874]
In addition to those two traditions, which [respectively] reflect [the views of] monastic discipline (Vinaya) and phenomenology (Abhidharma), there are also other sources claiming that the month of Āśvina (tha skar) should herald the start the year, while according to Chinese astrology (rgya rtsis) the start of the year is assigned to the first Mongolian month (hor zla ha dang po), which they identify with the [month of] the tiger, or early spring.[875]
The Tantra of the Wheel of Time identifies three different starting points for the year: (1) with reference to the formation of the world systems in this [universe], (2) while emphasizing the solar mansions, and (3) when emphasizing utility. As for these,
(1) The Tantra states that, starting from the mid-summer month, in the solar mansion of Cancer (karkaṭa'i khyim),[876] not long after the formation of the world, when the autumn, spring, Sun, Moon, and so forth were still non-existent, the Sun was born—its birth-sign, in terms of celestial longitude, commencing from the third quadrant of the constellation Gemini (punarvasū, nabs so) or the first [quadrant] of the solar mansion Cancer. For this reason, the first season of the year [is reckoned] to have been summer.[877]
(2) This refers to the time when the Sun enters Aries (lug khyim) because the planets, constellations, and seasons all follow [the passage of] the Sun, and the first of its [zodiacal] mansions is Aries.[878]
(3) It is held that the [months of] the year commence from the first calendar day of the waxing fortnight of the month Caitra (nag zla) because this is the month [principally] mentioned in the [Concise] Tantra of the Wheel of Time.[879]

According to the [Concise Tantra of the Wheel of Time], as well as the [sources of] mundane [astrology] and non-Buddhist [astrologers], the waxing fortnight of the months has precedence, whereas it states in the Commentary on the Treasury of Phenomenology that in the case of every month, the waning fortnight comes first.[880] Many texts concur that although [Śākyamuni]'s ascetic endeavors appear to have been arduous at the start [of the waxing fortnight],[881] in the end, his attainment of buddhahood coincided with the [fifteenth day] when [the moon] had already reached its fullest extent, and that therefore the waning fortnight should have precedence.[882] Consequently, in the commentaries on the tantras, the majority also give precedence to the waning fortnight. Yet there are some [other sources] which purposefully state that the waxing fortnight has precedence.[883]
It is also known that in the Root Tantra [of the Wheel of Time], the waning fortnight has precedence, whereas in the Concise Tantra [of the Wheel of Time], the waxing fortnight has precedence in order to [artfully] induce [non-Buddhist] extremists to enter [the path of the sacred teachings].[884]

Also, [for the prediction of lunar and solar eclipses], one has to examine the longitude of the head and tail of Rāhu (sgra gcan gdong mjug),[892] and one has also to examine the rising of the current ascendant conjunction (tatkāla, dus sbyor) [among the twelve solar mansions].[893]
Further calculations take into account the aspects of the primary and secondary Svarodaya calculations (dbyangs 'char) in respect of the calendar days and the seasons.[894]

Positive and negative prognostications should also be studied according to other minor astrological systems, such as the system known as elemental divination ('byung rtsis) or Chinese divination (nag rtsis), in which the five elements ('byung ba lnga) are the object of the calculation.[896] Here there are two sets of techniques (gtsug lag gnyis):
(1) the technique for making the basic natural calculation [of the order of the elements] (rtsis byed rang bzhin gzhi)[897] (2) the techniques for calculating the bewildered misconceptions of fundamental ignorance (ma rig 'khrul snang), which are integrated in the four “hidden points of divination” (gab rtse bzhi). These charts distinguish respectively between
(a) the discrete elements [which are determined according to their external, internal, and secret classifications] ('byung ba rang rgyud);
(b) the sense objects which convey these elements to the senses (snang ba yul);
(c) the intellect which analyzes the mutual relationships between the elements and sense objects (gcod byed yid); and
(d) the mind which grasps the negative and positive attributes of such relationships ('dzin pa sems).
Together they are known as the four primary “hidden points of divination.”[898]

It is said in a sūtra that[900]
Poetry should be composed in order to elucidate the sacred teachings. It should eulogize the three precious jewels, through which the unsurpassed enlightenment will be attained.
Supreme among the three activities of the learned[901] is composition (rtsom pa), the quality of which may emulate or contradict the recognized norms of poetics. The main subject matter of this [science] comprises both the body [of poetic composition] and the [various categories of the poetic] ornaments. Concerning the first [of these aspects], it is said:[902]
The body comprises a string of words (padāvalī),
Determining the intended sense.
And [in the auto-commentary], it is said:[903]
Accordingly, the intended or conceived meaning that is to be expressed by poets is known as the body of poetic composition.
Once this meaning has been ascertained, the [appropriate] words should be eloquently formed and [the lines] determined, in accordance with the intended sense (iṣṭārtha).[904]
The body [of poetry] may be expressed in [verses of] seven or nine metrical syllables, and so forth, as well as [passages of] non-metrical prose, and [passages of] mixed verse and prose.

Among these, when metrical compositions (padya, tshigs bcad) are classified according to their typology, they are said to be of four categories—detached verses (muktaka, grol ba), clustered verses (kulaka, rigs), intricate verses (kośa, mdzod), and compound verses (saṃghāta, 'dus pa). Respectively, these refer to (1) single verses which independently and fully convey a single point; (2) multiple stanzas[905] governed by a single verb which convey a single point;
(3) intricate but unconnected verses with diverse breaks and verbs, and an indeterminate number of metrical lines [which convey multiple points];[906] and (4) compound verses which employ multiple metrical lines and verbs to convey a single point.[907]
When verses are divided into many cantos (sarga), i. e., chapters, sections, or parts, [the compositional style] is known as “court poetry” (mahākāvya, snyan dngags chen po).[908]
Although the Compendium of Phenomenology explains that poetry may form stanzas of anything from one to six metrical lines (pāda), according to the tradition of [the Mirror of Poetics itself, verses exclusively form [stanzas of] four metrical lines.[909]

Then, with regard to prose (gadya, lhug pa), although two distinct terms, narrative (ākhyāyikā, brjod pa) and legend (kathā, gtam), [are implied], the master Daṇḍin has asserted that these are identical in meaning.[910] According to paṇḍita Vidyāsāgara (Rig byed rgya mtsho),[911] the defining characteristic of narrative is that knowledge is expressed in the poetic medium of prose that is not deduced from historical legends (itihāsakathā, sngon byung gi gtam rgyud), whereas the defining characteristic of legend is that it is expressed in the poetic medium of prose that largely commences with ancient tales. Indeed in the Mirror [of Poetics], the following verse is also found:[912]
[The style of prose] should derive either from historical legends,
Or from some true facts.
In conformity with this [verse], there are many scholars of the past who have asserted the factual basis [of their own composition].

With regard to mixed verse and prose (miśra, spel ma), there are both important and ordinary sorts [of composition].[913] Among them, the former refers to the compositions of [courtly] drama (nāṭaka, zlos gar), embodying verse, prose, and mixed verse and prose, in which the four languages (skad rigs bzhi) are fully represented. The latter refers to the so-called Campū style [of composition] in which verse and prose alternate or intermingle and which depends on any one [of the four acceptable] languages, as appropriate.
In this regard, when [mixed verse and prose] is classified according to the language that is employed, it is explained that there are four categories: the refined language [of Sanskrit] (legs sbyar), the common language [of Prākrit] (rang bzhin), the corrupted language [of Apabhraṃśa] (zur chag), and the hybrid language [of Miśrabhāṣā] ('dres ma).[914]

Features which embellish [the body of] poetic composition Are designated as “ornaments.”
Just as the human body may be embellished by necklaces, shoulder bracelets, and so forth, a body of poetic composition may also be embellished by ornaments of sense (arthālaṃkāra, don rgyan), such as double entendre (śliṣṭha, sbyar ba), and so forth. It is for this reason that such compositional features are known as “poetic ornaments.”

In the treatise of Daṇḍin, the traditions of the East [Indian Gauḍa] style and the South [Indian Vaidarbha] style are differentiated on the basis of the following ten uncommon attributes (asādhāraṇadaśaguṇalakṣaṇa, thun mong min pa'i yon tan [mtshan nyid] bcu):[916]
(1) double entendre (śleṣa, sbyar ba),[917]
(2) clarity (prasāda, rab dvangs),[918]
(3) phonetic balance (samatā, mnyam nyid),[919]
(4) sweetness (mādhurya, snyan),[920]
(5) tenderness (sukumāratā, shin tu gzhon pa),[921]
(6) elucidation (arthavyakti, don gsat),[922]

(8) vigor (ojas, brjid),[924]
(9) beauty (kānti, mdzes ldan),[925] and

These ten attributes are explained
To be the vital characteristics of the tradition of Vaidarbha.

While engaged in poetic composition, there are ten [potential] defects (skyon bcu) [outlined in the Mirror of Poetics] as follows:[933]
(1) incoherence (apārtha, don nyams pa),
(1) incongruity (vyartha, don 'gal),
(3) tautology (ekārtha,, don gcig pa),
(4) ambiguity (sasaṃśaya, the tshom can),
(5) syntactical disorder (apakrama, rim pa nyams pa),
(6) grammatical error (śabdahīna, sgra nyams),
(7) discordance of metrical pause (yatibhraṣṭa, gcod mtshams nyams pa),
(8) prosodic deviation (bhinnavṛtta, sdeb sbyor nyams),
(9) absence of euphonic conjunction (visaṃdhika, mtshams sbyor bral), and
(10) non-sequitur with regard to place and time (deśadeśādivirodhin, yul dus la sogs 'gal ba),
Or with regard to fine arts, the mundane world,
Scriptural authority, or logical reasoning.
The poet should abandon these ten defects [While engaging] in poetic composition.

The metric rules governing syllabic quantity concern the scansion of the number of syllables occurring in the four metrical lines [of a stanza] where the syllables [of each line] are [usually] equal in number (samāvṛtta, mnyam pa'i bri tta).[940] In this regard, there are meter classes of precise [syllabic quantity], ranging from the six-syllable Gāyatrī class (dbyangs sgrog) and the seven-syllable Uṣṇih class (rab 'dga) meters to the twenty-six-syllable Utkṛti class (lhag par byed ldan) meter.[941] Those ranging from twenty-seven syllables upwards are called Saṃtāna meters and they also have many subdivisions, including [the actual] Saṃtāna meter and the Pracaya (rab bsags) meter, each of which has subcategories numbered one to eight.[942]
[The precise meter classes, for which tables are calculated] starting from the six-syllable Gāyatrī class, also have a great many subcategories. For example, in the case of the ten-syllable [Paṅktī (ploreng ldan)] meter class, the number of permutations may multiply to one thousand and twenty-four, when the [possible] combinations of heavy and light syllables are analyzed.[943]
Some of the subcategories of the meter classes also have definite names, such as the Tanumadhyā meter (dbus phra) [which belongs to the six-syllable Gāyatrī meter class],[944] the Kumāralalitā meter (gzhon nu rol pa) [which belongs to the seven-syllable Usnih meter class],[945] the Samānikā ('dra mtshungs)[946] and the Vidyunmāla (glog phreng) meters [which both belong to the eight-syllable Anuṣṭubh meter class],[947] the Suddhavirāja meter (dag pa'i snang ba) [which belongs to the ten-syllable Paṅktī meter class],[948] and so forth. However, there are also a great many which are not precisely named in the [primary] texts [on prosody]. All of them fall within the scope of the rules governing syllabic quantity.

<d e="2">
The prosody based on the scansion of moric instants, rather than the number of syllables, is known as jāti. In the case of the aforementioned eight-syllable Anuṣṭubh meter class, for example, in which each line of a stanza has precisely eight syllables, here one disregards the syllabic quantity and instead has to scan eight complete moric instants (mātrā, phyi mo).[955]
A short vowel and a single consonant with a following vowel are both scanned as a single moric instant. A long vowel and a double consonant with a following vowel are long, as are the [four] diphthongs (mtshams sbyor gyi yi ge), the aspirated [consonants] (srog tu zhugs pa), and so forth.[956] In short, all these “heavy” (guru, lci ba) syllables are scanned as two moric instants; while non-aspirated consonants are scanned as a half [moric instant].
On this basis, the Precious Source [of Prosody] explains the arrangement of moric instants (phyi mo 'god tshut) and the three subcategories of the Āryā,[957] Vaitālya, and Paiṅgala meters, which are differentiated [respectively] in accordance with the distinctions between [stanzas which have] four metrical lines that are unequal, semi-equal, and equal.[958] Although many [other categories of moric based meters] are also explained in other works, such as [Kṛṣṇamiśra's] Defining Characteristics of Prosody entitled Mastery through Learning,[959] all of them may be subsumed within these [three] essential meter classes.

In all of these moric based meters, each group of three syllables forms a distinct trimeter (gaṇa, tshogs).

[Trimeters] adopting a “heavy” stress in the first, middle, and last syllables
Are [respectively known as]
The dactyl (bha), the amphibrach (dza), and the anapaest (sa).
Those adopting a “light” stress [in the first, middle, and last syllables] Are [respectively known as]

And:[963]
Each of these [types of trimeter] is also said to correspond to a specific deity, indicating virtue or non-virtue. (1) The dactyl (bha) corresponds to Bhūdevalakṣmī [symbolizing the earth element] and suggests enrichment, (2) The amphibrach (dza) corresponds to Varuṇa [symbolizing the water element] and suggests prosperity. (3) The cretic (ra) corresponds to Agni [symbolizing the fire element] and portends death. (4) The anapaest (sa) corresponds to Vāyu [symbolizing the wind element] and suggests distant travel to other lands. (5) The antibachius (ta) corresponds to Gagana [symbolizing the space element] and suggests an empty or vacuous result. (6) The bachius (ya) corresponds to Sūrya or Udāra [symbolizing the Sun] and suggests that diseases will be contracted.
(7) The molossus (ma) corresponds to Candra [symbolizing the moon] and suggests an immaculate reputation. [Finally,] (8) the tribach (na) corresponds to the devas [in general] and suggests that the boon of happiness will be granted. In this way, learned [masters of prosody] can suggest certain outcomes on the basis of the [various types of] trimeter they employ.
It is explained that this inspection should be undertaken with regard to the first trimeter [of the hemistich] (dang poi tshogs).
Similarly, it is also held that there is a distinct deity corresponding to each of the precise [categories of meter], starting with the six-syllable [Gāyatrī] meter class and extending as far as the [twenty-seven syllable] Saṃtāna and Pracaya meter classes. Specifically, the deity of the Gāyatrī meter class is explained to be Hayagrīva. Although [this deity] does seem to have the form of Hayagrīva, [one should know that] all of these [presiding gods] actually appear to be non-Buddhist deities.[964]

[Conclusion]
With regard to that text, it has been said:[973]
[This text is characterized by]
Its synopses, its versification, and clarity,[974]
Its inclusion of illustrative examples based on the sūtras,
Its exposition in [distinct] steps that are not confused,
And its [elucidation of] caesurae (mthar sdod), trimeters, and their attributes.
Owing to these eight [special] qualities, it is explained to surpass the Treatise on Prosody by Piṅgala. The text is also [considered] to be wondrous because its author [Ratnākaraśānti] was particularly sublime.[975]

The defining characteristic of a name (nāman, ming) is that it is a signifier (vācaka, rjod byed), [capable of] subsuming multi-syllabic forms as the basis of its designation (prajñaptivastu. gdags gzhi), and indicating the bare essential nature of a given object [without syntactically bound stems]. Regarding the necessity for naming substantives [in this way], it is said:
The Sublime One said:
If names are not designated,
The entire world will be deluded.
Therefore, in order to dispel delusion The Lord designates names.
So it is that the comprehension of conventional terms (vyavahāra, tha snyad) and communicative symbols (saṃketa, brda) is dependent on names.

Primary names (yādṛcchikanāman, 'dod rgyal gyi ming), such as “space,” “earth,” and “water,” convey primary communication, without the need for [establishing] a reason or purpose. [On this basis, ] it is explained in the Sword at the Gateway to Language:
Any primary name accords with actual reality [or emptiness],
In that it has no basis for etymological definition.

When names are analyzed further, they comprise both proper names (mūlanāman, dngos ming) and imputed names (prajñaptināman, btags ming).
[The defining characteristic of] the former is that proper names are either well-known as primary radical names, or else they require the presence of any one of the three appropriate etymological terms for proper [names]. In the latter case, they comprise (1) proper nouns formed from original primary radicals, exemplified by the name “god” (dev a, lha); (2) proper names formed from primary names functioning as derivatives, which may be exemplified by the expression “drinking at the foot” (pādapa, rkang 'thung), which poetically designates a “tree”; and (3) proper nouns unbewildered with regard to their meaning, as when a heroic man is designated “tiger” (vyāghra, stag).

The defining characteristic of imputed names is that anyone of three appropriate etymological terms for imputed [names][977] must be present. On analyisis, these comprise (1) imputed names formed on the basis of similarity ('dra ba rgyu mtshan du by as pa); (2) imputed names formed on the basis of a causal relationship ('brel ba rgyu mtshan du byas pa), or derived therefrom; and (3) imputed names formed on the basis of a causal relationship which is contrary to these two (de gny is ka ldog pa rgyu mtshan du byas pa).
The first category [imputed names based on similarity] is exemplified by the medication kākapāda (bya rog rkang, Delphinium) [lit. “crow's foot,” so called because the plant resembles a crows foot].
The second category [imputed names based on a causal relationship] includes both names that impute the result from the cause, as when the “disease of indigestion” is termed “indigestion” (ajīrṇa, ma zhu ba), and those that impute the cause from the result, as when the names “pine tree” (devadāru, sgron me'i shing) or “avaricious” (īrṣālu, phyug po ser sna can) are given to an anguished spirit (preta).
[In this context], there are instances of collective names (tshogs pa'i ming) being applied to an individual, as when certain men are given the name “god,” or certain women are given the name “girl”; and by contrast there are instances of individual names (ya gyal gyi ming) being applied to a group, as when “gold” and so forth are called “metal.”
The third category, imputed names that are based on the contrariety of similarity and causal relationship, includes euphemisms such as “auspicious” (maṅgala, bkra shis) for [the inauspicious] Tuesday or Mars, and “excellent” (bhadra, bzang po) for Viṣṭi, which is one of the [negative] impact days of the lunar phases (karaṇa, byed pa).

With regard to names, [the formation of which] has just been explained, some are characterized as homonyms (nānārtha, don sna tshogs), and these may be illustrated by the following extracts from the Treasury of Amarasiṃha:[978]
Kaḥ, in the masculine, can have [three] meanings:
“Brahmā” (tshangs pa), “wind” (māruta, rlung), and “sun” (sārya, nyi). Kaṃ can have [two] meanings:
“Head” (śiras, mgo) and “water” (ambu, chu).
And:[979]
Kauśikaḥ can have [four] meanings:
“Mahendra” (dbang chen), “frankincense” (gu gul),
“Owl” (ūlūka, 'ug pa), and “snake-catcher” (vyālagrāhin, sbrul 'dzin).
And:[980]
Artha can have [five] meanings:
“Signified object” (abhidheya, brjod bya), “wealth” (dhana, nor), “Meaning of a word” (padārtha, tshig don), “purpose” (prayojana, dgos pa),
And “prevention” (nivṛtti, ldog pa).
And:[981]
Antaraṃ can have [thirteen] meanings:
“Gap” (avakāśa, go skabs),” “interval” (avadhi, mtshams),
“Skirt” (paridhāna, smad gos), “concealment” (antardhi, sgrib),
“Difference” (bheda, dbye), “for the sake of” (tādarthya, de'i don “Imperfection” (chidra, skyon), “intimate” (ātmīya, bdag gi ba), “Without” (vinā, bral),[982] “exterior” (bahir, phyi rol),
“Opportunity” (avasara, skabs), “between” (madhye, skabs),
And “inner soul” (antarātma, dbus gang gi bdag).
And:[983]
Svāsti can have [three] meanings:
“Benediction” (āśi, smon), “welfare” (kṣema, bde),
And “provision of merit” (puṇyādau, bsod nams tshogs).
Nāgārjuna has also said:[984]
The learned recognize that the term go Has nine [distinct] meanings, including
“Speech” (vāg, ngag), “direction” (dik, phyogs), “earth” (bhūtala, sa), “Light ray” (kiraṇa, 'od zer), “cattle” (paśu, phyugs), “eye” (netra, mig), “Vajra” (rdo rje), “higher realms” (svarga, mtho ris), and “water”
(lakṣya, chu).[985]
A [seemingly] limitless number of other [homonyms] are also found in works such as the Pearl Necklace of Synonymics[986] and the Sheaf of Glorious Terms.[987] Accordingly, Sanskrit has a great many [homonyms].
Also in the Tibetan language, it should be understood that [the use of homonyms] is extensive. For example, the term “twice-born” (gnyis skyes; Skt. dvija) can mean “moon,” “brāhmaṇa,” “bird,” and so forth; while the term “sky-goer” (mkha' 'gro, Skt. ḍākinī) can mean “accomplished yoginī,” a “woman who has been born in a buddha-field such as Oḍḍiyāna,” “sun,” “bird,” and “arrow.”[988]

There are also names which are characterized as synonyms. For example, it says in the Treasury of Amarasiṃha that the synonyms of svarga (mtho ris, meaning “higher realms”) include[989]
“Absence of endless sorrow” (nirakṣayaduḥkha, mi zad mi bde med), “Paradise” (susthita, legs gnas), “third heavenly realm” (tridiva, sum rtsen),
“Heavenly abode of the thirty-three gods” (tridaśālaya, skabs gsum gnas),
And “the world system of the gods” (suraloka, lha yi 'jig rten).
Similarly, the synonyms or epithets of the term “buddha” (sangs rgyas) include the following:[990]
“omniscient one” (sarvdjña, kun mkhyen),
“one gone to bliss” (sugata, bde gshegs),
“one who is awakened” (buddha, sangs rgyas),
“king of the sacred teachings” (dharmarāja, chos kyi rgyal po),
“one who has departed in accord with reality” (tathāgata, de bzhin gshegs pa),
“all-positive one” (samantabhadra, kun tu bzang po),
“transcendent lord” (bhagavān, bcom ldan 'das),
“subduer of malign forces” (mārajit, bdud 'thul),
“conqueror” (jina, rgyal ba),
“conqueror of the world” (lokajina, 'jig rten rgyal),
“one endowed with six supernormal cognitive powers” (ṣaḍabhijña, mngon shes drug ldan),
“one endowed with the ten powers” (daśabalin, stobs bcu pa),
“one endowed with non-dual speech” (advayavādin, gnyis med gsung ba),
“guide” (vināyaka, rnam par 'dren pa),
“mighty among sages” (munīndra, thub dbang),
“dense with glory” (śrīghana, dpal stug), and “teacher” (śāstṛ, ston pa).
As these examples illustrate, there are a great many [classes of] synonyms.

<d e="2">
[The construction of the synonyms and homonyms outlined in] this science of synonymics requires knowledge of the paradigms of Sanskrit roots and the definitions of the terms expressed in both [the Sanskrit and Tibetan] languages. For example, in Sanskrit the term buddhaḥ is formed by combining the root budh,[991] which means “to realize,” with the suffix -kta, which indicates a participial substantive (bhāvārtha, dngos po'i don). Therefore [the term buddhaḥ] is interpreted to mean “one who has awakened,” as if free from sleep, or “one who has qualitatively realized all knowable phenomena.” In Tibetan the term was rendered by the great translators of the past, relying on its meaning, by the [compound] sangs rgyas [lit. “purified and expansive”]. As has been said:[992]
The buddha is fully purified and expanded like a lotus flower,
Because he has awakened from the sleep of fundamental ignorance, And his mind is extensive with regard to all objects of knowledge.
Since [the construction of synonyms] requires the compounding of such etymologies, illustrative terms [should conform to this standard] and [their meaning] should be inferred accordingly.

Since the following exegesis on dramaturgy does not for the most part accord with the [normal] exegeses presented by Tibetan writers, utilizing their creative imagination, I will not repeat [their views here]. Rather, I will follow the tradition of the omniscient Tenpei Nyinje, who [personally] inspected the [relevant] Indian manuscripts along with the procedures of [classical Sanskrit] drama and delivered some approximate teachings on the subject.[994]

First, the aspects of dramatic juncture refer to the different sections [of a play], signifying the particular phases of the plot,[996] which require dialogue to be spoken in various languages.[997] These comprise
(1) the dramatic juncture of the introduction or protasis (mukhasaṃdhi, sgo'i mtshams sbyor) in which an [initial] proposal ('dri ba) is made;
(2) the dramatic juncture of the progression or epitasis (pratimukhasaṃdhi, lan gyi sgo'i mtshams sbyor), in which a multitude of causes provoke a dialogue of proposals and rejoinders;
(3) the dramatic juncture of the development or catastasis (garbhasaṃdhi, snying po'i mtshams sbyor), in which, following many verbal exchanges, exemplified by episodic discussions (skabs 'gar gros byed pa), the deliberations are decisively determined;
(4) the dramatic juncture of the plot crisis or peripeteia (vimarśasaṃdhi, mi bzod pa'i mtshams sbyor), in which words that seek to expose the wrongdoings [of another] backfire, exposing the speaker's own wrong-doings, which cannot be tolerated, engendering suffering due to attachment and an unbearable crisis;
(5) the dramatic juncture of the conclusion or catastrophe (nirvahaṇa-saṃdhi, nges pa thob byed kyi mtshams sbyor), in which, following many statements expressing hesitation, a singular resolution or [positive] outcome is obtained.
These are known as the five sequences of dramatic juncture.[998]
Also, it is said in an Indian commentary on the Mirror of Poetics, which
was composed by the master Ratnaśrī:[999]
The dramatic junctures are explained to number five: the introduction, the progression, the development, the plot crisis, and the conclusion.

Moreover, there are also other [essential] elements of drama, including graceful [song and dance] (lāsya, sgeg pa), [the wearing of] garlands (phreng ba), and the aspects of other [additional] dramatic junctures.[1019]
All of these [aspects] are actually experienced, as it were, within the context of [plays enacting] tales and legends of the past and the relevant physical and verbal moods that they evoke, such as the sentiment (rasa, nyams) of extreme anger, the sentiment of anguish caused by desire, the sentiment of suffering caused by sorrow, the sentiment of astonishment caused by amazement, and other dramatic moods. The extensive characteristics of these [moods and sentiments] should be learned from other [sources] because they are too voluminous for inclusion here.[1020]

[Conclusion]
In brief, the science of Indian dramaturgy is endowed with sentiments or moods which give rise to joy in the people who see and hear [dramatic performances] because the physical and verbal moods [that they evoke] are repeatedly recreated in the context of a play, captivating the minds [of the audience]. Although [this science] is known to be particularly amazing, the relevant [classical Indian] treatises are not extant in [Tibet, ] the Land of Snows, and they are not immediately useful for the purpose of attaining liberation [from cyclic existence]. Even so, all the actions of the bodhisattvas, which are reminiscent of such [dramatic sentiments] and bring delight to sentient beings, should be studied. As has been said:[1021]
There are no methods that please the buddhas
Apart from those that bring delight to sentient beings.

In general, sentient beings designate as “common” those understandings that exclusively concern matters of this life alone—those that are to be adopted in the pursuit of happiness, or abandoned in the avoidance of suffering, without venturing to investigate the [aforementioned] subjects of classical science or the circumstances of the next life and beyond. On the other hand, those who are philosophically inclined and who, to some extent, venture to investigate [the true nature of] phenomena are designated as persons “endowed with a spiritual path.” For this reason, they are deemed superior to ordinary worldly folk.
With regard to those in the world who are philosophically inclined, the term “philosophical and spiritual system” (siddhānta, grub mtha') implies that they attain “realization” (siddhi, grub) in accordance with their respective classes, but cannot transcend their [particular level of realization]. It has indeed been said that although reality (tattva, de nyid) is true, the perspectives of it which are known in the world are uncertain in terms of their truthfulness. In the words of the Introduction to the Conduct of a Bodhisattva:[1022]
When worldly folk perceive phenomena
They consider them to be real, and not illusory.
On this point, yogins and worldly folk will enter into debate.

Moreover, there are the twenty views concerning mundane aggregates[1030] the sixteen alien interpretations, among the [diverse] analytical views (vicāradṛṣṭi, rtog dpyod kyi lta ba),[1034] the fourteen unspecified views,[1032] and the eight, four, or two categories of extremist views (antagrāhadṛṣṭi, mthar 'dzin gyi lta ba).[1033]
Since such classifications of inauthentic views have been expounded many times, this [list] is merely illustrative. Among the many hundreds and thousands of ordinary mundane [levels of existence], including those assumed by the denizens of the three inferior realms (ngan song gsum)[1034] and most classes of gods and humans, virtually each of them has its own approach to the spiritual and philosophical path. Among them, those who enter [the spiritual path] at the lower end of the scale are greater in number, while those who enter at the higher end are fewer. Accordingly, Jowoje [Atiśa] has said:[1035]
Nowadays in India, at this time when hundreds are learned in the philosophical systems of the extremists (tīrthaka, mu stegs pa), for every [hundred of them], there is one who understands the philosophical system of the Vaibhāṣikas, and for every hundred of them there is one Sautrāntika, for every hundred of them there is one Vijñānavādin holding sensa to be veridical (ākāravādin, rnam bden pa), for every hundred of them there is one Vijñānavādin holding sensa to be false (nirākāravādin, rnam bden pa), for every hundred of them there is one Mādhyamika upholding independent reasoning (svātantrikamādhyamika), and for every hundred of them there is no more than one who understands the tradition of Candrakīrti.
Although there are a great many subdivisions among those espousing spiritual and philosophical systems, when these are subsumed according to their dissimilarity, they comprise (1) the others who are extremists upholding non-Buddhist schools (gzhan sde phyi rol mu stegs pa) and (2) the Buddhists of our own tradition. Their [distinctive] positions will now be explained in turn.[1036]

Those who maintain standpoints outside [the perspective of] the Buddhist teaching, alien to [the words of] the Teacher [Śākyamuni Buddha], are designated as non-Buddhists or “outsiders” (phyi rol pa). This is because, even though they may investigate [the nature of] phenomena through their mundane discriminative awareness, they lack the spiritual path that is in conformity with [the attainment of] nirvana, the abiding nature of reality (yin lugs). However, they are also designated as “extremists” or “forders” (tīrthaka, mu stegs pa) because, in slightly simulating this attainment, they continue to maintain their extreme [positions] (mu) and cling to their [inconclusive] platforms or fords (stegs). Therefore, it is said in the Commentary on the Aspirational Prayer of Good Conduct,[1037] composed by the great translator Yeshede:
In the case of the term “extremist” (mu stegs can), the word “extreme” (tīrtha, mu stegs) designates, for example, a ford (rab kha) where a river is easily crossed, or a stepping stone that is reached when negotiating a pool or pond of water. Accordingly, this term comes to refer to the [inconclusive] “fords” (mu stegs) encountered while embarking on the lake that leads to [the attainment of] nirvana, and the “fords” encountered on the path of skillful means, whereby the river of cyclic existence (saṃsāra) is crossed. Those who maintain and cultivate spiritual paths [fixated on fords and supports] are called “extremists” or “forders” (tīrthaka).
Their defining characteristic is that they propound spiritual and philosophical tenets which are contrary to Buddhism in terms of their view, meditation, action, and result.

Among them, concerning nominal [extremists] it says in the Sūtra of the Descent to Laṅkā:[1038]
As long as the mind engages [with sense objects],
So long will there be mundane materialism.
While elsewhere in the sūtras it says, for instance, that those virtuous ascetics (śramaṇa, dge sbyong) who advocate mundane materialism are corrupt.[1039]
In addition, the Vātsīputrīya and others like them who hold the psychophysical aggregates (skandha, phung po) and so forth to be truly existent[1040] may also be nominally designated as extremists, alongside those who are cut off from the seed of buddha nature, maintaining heretical views and imputing disillusionment [with the world] as the bliss of quiescence.[1041]

With regard to the last of these aforementioned categories, the independently established [extremist schools] (svātantrikatīrthaka, mu stegs rang rgyud pa), their spiritual and philosophical systems, which are to be explained here, include both those of the meditators and the dialecticians.
Among them, the former possess the five supernormal cognitive powers (pañcābhijñā, mngon shes lnga) associated with formless meditative concentration, as suggested in the [poetic] words of the master Śūra, “The great hermit sage, endowed with five supernormal cognitive powers.”[1043]
It is explained in the extensive Interlinear Commentary on the Compendium of the Nucleus of Pristine Cognition,[1044] in the Flame of Dialectics, and so forth that the extremists include three types of meditator—lower, middling, and superior—who respectively have the ability to recollect thirty, sixty, and ninety aeons of time. Beings such as these hold that cyclic existence is beginningless in its origins, whereas [paradoxically] their spiritual and philosophical systems, which offer an explanation that is generally similar to that of the dialecticians, largely originated during this present aeon of [historical] time.

The spiritual and philosophical systems espoused by non-Buddhist extremists have many branches. In general, three such subdivisions are identified in the Compendium of the Nucleus of Pristine Cognition, comprising the Advocates of the [Three] Attributes (traiguṇya, yon tan [gsum] can pa), the Sāṃkhya (grangs can pa) and the Brāhmaṇa (tshangs pa [ba]). However, according to the Flame of Dialectics (Tarkajvālā), they fail into four categories, including the Sāṃkhya (grangs can pa), the Vaiśeṣika (bye brag pa), the Vedāntaupaniṣadika (rigs byed kyi mtha' gsang ba pa), and the Mīmāṃsaka (spyod pa can).
According to the Tantra of the Wheel of Time, there are six categories of extremist, including the Brāhmaṇa, the Aiśvarya (dbang phyug pa), the Vaiṣṇava (khyab 'jug pa), the Lokāyatika ([jig rten] rgyang 'phen pa), the Nirgrantha Jains (gcer bu pa), and, in another context, the Sāṃkhya.
Then, according to the eloquent textual tradition of the Sakya school,[1045] there are nine categories, including five eternalist schools—Sāṃkhya, Bārhaspatya (phur bu pa), Vaiśeṣika, Naiyāyika (rig pa can pa), and the Nirgrantha Jains—along with four nihilist schools, namely, the Cārvāka (tshu rol mdzes pa), the Mīmāṃsaka, the Vedāntaupaniṣadika, and those [Advaitavedāntins] who simulate the approach of Madhyamaka (dbu ma'i tshuldu smra ba).[1046]

Yet again, in the Ornamental Flower of Philosophical Systems, composed by Chomden Rigpei Raldri, a twelvefold classification is given, starting with the Lokāyatika, and it is his presentation that I have followed below.[1047]
Exemplified by these [diverse enumerations], many [different] classifications are be found in the [different] textual traditions. However, all these [systems] of the dialecticians may be subsumed within two basic divisions— the eternalist schools and the nihilist schools.
They are all largely similar in their common adherence to Viṣṇu, Īśvara, and Brahmā, in their adherence to the Four Vedas as [the revelatory source of] their teachings, in their propounding of the [concepts of] “soul” (ātmavāda, bdags mras byed pa) and eternally existing entities (nityabhava, rtag dngos), in their inclusion of livelihood or the means of [mundane] sustenance among their tenets, in their polemics directed against the Buddhist tradition, and so forth.
[In short, ] all these categories of extremist take refuge in those three [Brāhmaṇical] deities, they uphold [the authority of] the Four Vedas, and they propound [the existence of] a “soul” or “self” among the four primary causes (caturupādāna, nye bar len pa bzhi) [of involuntary rebirth in the cycle of existence], which [from the Buddhist perspective] is the [misconception] that generally underlies all the other [three] primary causes.[1048] This is because even the mundane materialists uphold [the existence of] a “soul” or “self” comprising the four elements and formed of a single substance.

Among all these [twelve] schools [identified by Chomden Rigpei Raldri], the Lokāyatika (rgyang 'phen pa) are so called because, in holding that past actions (karma, las) have no result, they have “deviated far” (rgyang ring du song ba) from the genuine view as understood by worldly persons [in general].
In antiquity, during the legendary battles between the gods (deva) and the antigods (asura), the gods, being of a naturally virtuous disposition, were disinclined to fight and consequently they were nearly defeated in battle. At that time, the hermit sage Bṛhaspati composed and revealed a text on the nihilist view (chad par lta ba'i gzhung), in order to induce the gods to fight, with the result that the gods grew confident and emerged victorious in the battle.
Later, hesitating to propagate this negative view in the god realms, Bṛhaspati threw the book into the River Ganges, where it was retrieved by a hermit sage [Vālmīki] and propagated in India. Derived from it, [new treatises] were compiled—the primary text by the hermit sage Lokākṣin ('Jig rten mig) and its commentary by Avatārabalin ('Jug stobs [can]).[1049] Their followers [during the lifetime of Śākyamuni Buddha] were known as the six nihilist teachers who were masters of meditative absorption (chad smra'i ston pa snyoms 'jug pa drug), the six who emulated them (rjes sgrogs pa drug), and the six dialecticians or teachers (rtog ge pa' am ston pa drug).[1050]
Moreover, it is said that the hermit sage Avatārabalin wished to engage in sexual intercourse with his own daughter, and set out to do so. [To vindicate his incestuous intention,] he established four kinds of proof (sgrub pa bzhi) and five kinds of refutation (dgag pa lnga).[1051]

[The four kinds of proof are as follows:]
(1) There is an indiscernible soul or self (avyaktātma, mi gsal ba'i bdag) existing when the elements are in their causative or formative state.
(2) There is a discernible soul or self (vyaktātma, gsal ba'i bdag) existing when the elements are in their resultant or fruitional state.
(3) There are three classes of sentient beings—the enumeration of six classes being incorrect because the gods (deva), anguished spirits (preta), and denizens of the hells (naraka) do not exist. The three that do exist include human beings and animals which are discernible. They also include animistic spirits of woods, trees, and so forth, composed of the four indiscernible elements, in which the faculty of consciousness has not yet expired.
(4) Although they themselves do not uphold [the deductions of] logical inference (anumāna, rjes dpag), they [seek to] establish a reasoned argument which could be communicated to others in logical terms, such as the following [syllogism]: “The [concept] vase, the subject for discussion, may denote sentient beings in whom the physical body and the mind are of a single [material] substance, and it may signify any [actual] vase whatsoever, because it is a material object distinct from the lily [it contains], just as is, for example, a wall [that has a vase upon it].[1052]
As for their five kinds of refutation:
(1) They profess that causes and so forth which are not visible are nonexistent because the [diverse] states of sorrow and happiness inherently originate in themselves, just as, for example, a pea is round, a thorn sharp, and so forth. Therefore they deny the existence of past and future lives.
(2) They deny the processes of past actions, causes and results.
(3) They deny the three precious jewels.
(4) They deny that there are invisible phenomena.
(5) They deny the valid cognition of logical inference.
Since these [mundane materialists] hold the basest of all [philosophical] views, they are [regarded as] the lowest of all those propounding spiritual and philosophical systems; and they are the most severely [deluded] among deluded beings. Let us not even mention [the possibility of them aspiring to] liberation [from cyclic existence]! Since they lack the causal basis for attaining simply a physical body compatible with the exalted realms (svarga, mtho ris) [of gods and humans], the result that they accrue is exclusively compatible with the inferior realms (durgati, ngan 'gro).

The oldest of all the eternalist schools among the extremist [traditions] is the Sāṃkhya. In antiquity, v/hen the life span was inestimable,[1053] there was a hermit sage named Kapila who boasted of attaining release (mokṣa, thar pa) [from rebirth] according to the extremist systems by meditating in his hermitage (āśramapada, bsti gnas). In order to reveal to others the reality which he had seen, he composed the Treatise on the Categories of Reality.[1054] Later, the hermit sage Patañjali who was a practitioner of yoga, upholding the Shaivite tradition, reworked the Thirty Chapter and Six Chapter Tantras of Īśvarakṛṣṇa,[1055] and so forth, for which reason he is held to be their teacher, but, as it is said in the Introduction to Madhyamaka:[1056]
Through minor variations on this theme,
The extremists form their different traditions.
Accordingly, there were many different traditions that evolved from this [school].
With regard to the tenets of the [Sāṃkhya school],[1057] the valid cognition of direct perception (pratyakṣapramāṇa) is held to apply to the sense organs, while inference for one's own sake (svārthānumāna) entails seven kinds of relation (saptasaṃhandhana), including the relation of implication (arthāpattisaṃbandhana, nor bdag gi 'brel ba),[1058] and inference for the sake of others (parārthānumāna) may include both [syllogisms in which the inference] is based on yoga and those employing elimination (bsal ha). In this way, they hold that through these three modes of valid cognition, appraisable objects will be discerned in terms of the “twenty-five categories of reality” (pañcaviṃśatitattva, de nyid nyer lnga).

<d e="2">
The twenty-five categories [of reality] are enumerated as follows: (1) primal matter (pradhāna, gtso bo); (2) great intelligence (mahat/buddhi, chen po/blo); (3) the threefold ego-principle (ahaṃkāra, nga rgyal gsum); (4-8) the five potentials of subtle matter (pañcatanmātra, de tsam lnga), namely, sound-potential, touch-potential, color-potential, taste-potential, and smell-potential; (9-13) the five elements (pañcabhūta, 'byung po lnga), including space; (14-18) the five inner sense organs (pañcantarendriya, nang blo'i dbang po lnga), namely, ear, skin, eye, tongue, and nose; (19-13) the five motor organs (pañcabāhyendriya, phyi las kyi dbang po lnga), namely, speech, handling, walking, excretion, and reproduction; (24) the mind (manas, yid), which is a faculty shared by both [categories of sense organs], bringing the number of sense organs up to eleven; and (25) the “soul” (ātma, bdag) or “cognizant self” (puruṣa, shes rig gi skyes bu).
When these are all subsumed, they may be gathered into two categories, primal matter and cognizant “self” the former comprising nature (prakṛti, rang bzhin) and the latter the absence of nature (aprakṛti, rang bzhin min pa).
Among them, with regard to the “self' its essential nature is both that of an actor or creator and a consumer. It is said to be a consumer in the sense that it enjoys or partakes of its sense objects. It is [regarded as] permanent because it cannot be destroyed, nor is it created because nothing has produced it. It is devoid of the threefold attributes—lightness (sattva, snying stobs), motility (rajas, rdul), and dullness (tamos, mun pa). It is free from activity because it permeates all space and time. In short, it is endowed with all those five distinctive or defining characteristics. [Therefore] it is known as the [unchanging] soul or self that is cognizant of the nature of primary [matter], subject to various changes.

<d e="2">
Then, with regard to the essential nature of primal matter in general, the term “primal matter” (pradhāna, gtso bo) is employed as a general term encompassing all twenty-four categories [of reality] distinct from the self. In terms of the dichotomy between sense objects and their subject, it refers to the sense objects, their [three] attributes (triguṇa, yon tan gsum), and physical matter. More specifically, primal matter at the causal level (hetupradhāna, rgyu'i gsto bo) is identified with nature (prakṛti, rang bzhin), the first of the twenty-five categories. It is the circumstance in which the three attributes—motility, dullness, and lightness—are present in a state of equilibrium.
The defining characteristic of these three [attributes] is that [motility] is dynamic and interactive, [dullness] is heavy and obstructive, and [lightness] is light and luminous. This [equilibrium] is said to be an ideal state [of homogeneity] (prakaraṇa, rab tu byed pa), because it is [the actual state of] “nature” itself, not subject to modifications or change.
From this primal matter, there [first] originated “intelligence” (buddhi, blo), which is designated as “great” (mahat, chen po). From that, the threefold ego-principle originated;[1059] and from it there evolved in succession the five quidities or aspects of subtle matter from the modified ego-principle (vaikārikāhaṃkāra),[1060] and the five gross elements from those five aspects. Meanwhile, the five motor organs and the five sense organs, along with the single category of the mind (manas, yid), which is a faculty shared by both [motor and sense organs], all evolved from the ego-principle imbued with lightness (sāttvikāhaṃkāra). As for the ego-principle imbued with dullness (tāmasikāhaṃkāra), it interacts with both the other two aspects of the ego-principle.

The [great] intelligence, the ego-principle, and the five aspects of subtle matter all are all modifications when contrasted with the [original and unmodified] nature. On the other hand, from the standpoint of their actual modifications, the great intelligence, the ego-principle, and so forth are assigned to the [unmodified] nature, and only the remaining sixteen categories [comprising the five elements, the five sense organs, the five motor organs, and mind] are considered to be [extraneous] modifications.
The “soul” or “cognizant self” being ignorant of the impurity of “nature” which gives rise to [the aforementioned] modifications, then becomes attached through a series of events, and as long as it enjoys or partakes of the sense objects, such as sound, and so forth, it will remain within the cycle of existence. But when it becomes dissatisfied with such enjoyments of the sense objects, through the supernormal cognitive powers associated with meditative concentration (dhyāna), it will [directly] behold the impurity of this engagement in “nature” and flee away in shame. Separated from [this involvement], all the modifications produced by nature will be reversed in turn, and dissolve into the reality [of unmodified nature] itself. When the “self” abides in an absolutely radiant state, it is held that it will attain release [from the cycle of existence].

Secondly, the Vaiśeṣika (bye brag pa) are the followers of the hermit sage Kaṇāda.[1061] They hold that knowable phenomena constitute six categories (ṣaṭpadārtha, tshig don drug), namely, (1) substance (dravya), which has nine aspects: “self” (ātma), time (kāla), relative direction (dik), space (ākāśa), and mind (manas), along with the four elements;[1062] (2) “self” which has nine attributes (ātmanavaguṇa, bdag gi yon tan dgu), namely, intellect (buddhi), happiness (sukha), sorrow (duḥkha), effort (yatna), merit (dharma), demerit (adharma), velocity (vega), [and so forth];[1063] (3) actions (karma, las), which are of five sorts: ascending ('degs), descending ('jog), expanding (brkyang), contracting (bskum), and moving (gati);[1064] (4) universals (sāmānya, spyi), which [are characterized as] permeating all particulars;[1065] (5) particulars (viśeṣa, bye brag), which differentiate or distinguish object-universals;[1066] and
(6) inherence (samavāya, 'du ba), which establishes both direct relations and indirect relations between [different] substances.[1067]
The Vaiśeṣika hold that [these phenomenological categories] may be appraised by means of the [aforementioned] three kinds of valid cognition, with the addition of the valid cognition originating from Vedic testimony (śabdapramāṇa, sgra byung tshad ma).[1068] They also maintain that as long as the nine attributes are all inherent in the soul, it will remain within the cycle of existence, performing virtuous and non-virtuous actions. However, once the six categories that pertain to the “individual” (puruṣa, skyes bu) are known, the nine attributes and their roots will be cut off, leaving the “self” or “soul” alone, whereupon it will be released [from the cycle of existence].

Thirdly, the Naiyāyika (rig pa can pa) are similar [to the Vaiśeṣika] in holding that there are six phenomenological categories. They also uphold the four kinds of valid cognition, namely, (1) the valid cognition of direct perception, through which objects encountered by the senses are unmistakenly examined; (2-3) the two kinds of inference, which are undertaken for one's own and others' sake; and (4) the valid cognition originating from Vedic testimony, proffering examples which virtually appraise the scriptural testimony [of the Vedas] on the basis of trust.
They hold that if there is an appraisable object, it is implicitly an entity (bhāva, dngos po), and they do not accept that it may be a non-entity (abhāva, dngos med). In fact, [they enumerate] twelve [different] kinds of entities [or valid objects of knowledge], namely, (1) the “self” (ātman); (2) the body; (3) the sense organs; (4) the sense objects; (5) the understanding (buddhi);
(6) the mind (manas); (7) sensory engagement (pravṛtti, 'jug pa); (8) defiled emotions (doṣa skyon); (9) rebirth (bhava, srid pa); (10) the experience of results in future lives (aparaphala, phyi ma 'bras bu); (11) suffering (duḥkha, sdug bsngal); and (12) final emancipation (apavarga, byang grot).[1069]

Fourth, according to the Aiśvarya (dbang phyug pa), [almighty] Īśvara is the creator of the world. In order to dispel darkness, [he created] the sun and moon. In order to generate the inanimate world and its living organisms [he created] the five elements; and in order to mature [living beings], [he introduced] sacrificial offerings (yajña, mchod sbyin). They also hold that Īśvara emanated in eight distinct forms [Rudra, Bhava, Śarva, Īśāna, Paśupati, Bhīma, Ugra, and Mahādeva],[1070] and that these are endowed respectively with eight [distinct] attributes [or supernormal powers]: (1) subtlety (sūkṣmatā, phra ba); (2) agility (laghutva, yang ba); (3) worthiness of offering (pūjya, mchod par 'os pa); (4) supremacy (īśitva, bdag por gyur pa); (5) dominion (vaśitva, dbang du gyur pa); (6) the power to move freely and obtain anything (prāpti, gar yang phyin pa); (7) irresistible will-power (prākāmya, 'dod dgur sgyur ba); and (8) teleportation (yatrakāmāvasāyitva, dga' mgur gnas pa).
[By contrast, ] they hold that mundane beings have no control over their own actions and so forth, that they should make offerings to Īśvara, and that liberation will be attained, having cultivated a non-symbolic wisdom by relying on sexual union.

Fifth, the Vaiṣṇava (khyab 'jug pa), according to [authorities] such as [Mahāvīra], teacher of the Nirgrantha Jains, and [the Mīmāṃsaka] Kumārila, claim that the Bhagavān Vāsudeva [i. e., Kṛṣṇa] is the omniscient, all-seeing creator of all living beings, and that he is the conferrer of release [from the cycle of existence]. He himself is also [said to have] exhibited an extraordinary manifest pride, in saying, “I am fire, water, and wind. I am also the [bestower of] food and drink, and the lord of all living creatures. I abide within the physical body of a Brahmin. I am the actor and also the giver!”[1071]

Now [among the ten incarnations], it is said that (1) Viṣṇu incarnated [first] as Matsya (nya bo che), “the great fish,” and retrieved the Four Vedas, which had sunk into the ocean on account of a primeval [flood]. (2.) He then incarnated as Kūrma (rus sbal), “the turtle,” where he continued to support the world [on his back]. (3) Then, [incarnating] in the form of Varāha (phag rgod), “the wild boar,” [he assisted by raising] the world realms of Brahmā (brahmāloka) [on his tusk] when they had been oppressed [by the demon Hiraṇyakṣa]. (4) Then, having incarnated in the form of Narasiṃha (mi seng ge'i stod can), “the man with the torso of a lion,” at the time when Asurendra [or Daityendra] had offered sanctuary to living beings, he killed [the demon] Hiraṇyakaśipu with his claws. (5) Then, he incarnated as Vamāna (mi'i thung), “the dwarf,” and made offerings to the asura Bali, whereupon [on being granted a boon] he deceived [the antigod] by taking three strides [to consolidate his celestial, terrestrial, and subterranean dominion] and forced [the demon] underground. (6) Then, he incarnated as the hermit sage Paraśurāma (dza mā ang'i bu rā ma), “Rāma with an axe,” and [as an act of vengeance] he killed Prince Arjuna among others, and eliminated the princely kṣatrīya class. (7) Thereafter, he incarnated as Rāma, son of King Daśaratha, and when his wife Sītā was captured by Daśagrīva, the “ten-headed” [Rāvaṇa, and abducted to Śrī] Laṅkā, charging the [emanational] monkey Hanumant to assist him, he overwhelmed the rāksaṣa. (8) Subsequently, he incarnated as Kṛṣṇa (nag po) and worked for the benefit of sentient beings during an age of strife.[1072] (9) After incarnating as Buddha Śākyamuni, he offered refuge to all sentient beings, in order to purify his former negative actions [as Paraśurāma] in slaying members of the princely kṣatrīya class. (10) In the future, [it is said that] Viṣṇu will also incarnate as Kalkin, the son of a Brahmin of noble family, and after disciplining many sentient beings, he will reverse [the negativity] of that age.[1073]
[The followers of Viṣṇu] also hold that when an aeon [of cyclical time] is destroyed, the hermit sages [who are his devotees] will be preserved within his stomach.

As for the tenets which they espouse, they include eternalism in that [some of them] hold the nature of mind, which they call the “self” (ātman) or the sacred Vāsudeva, to be eternal, free from creation and destruction, and to be without duality (advaita) in terms of substantial existence and non-existence. Yet they also propound the nihilist view, which may be exemplified by the many verses [in their own scriptures] concerning the view of non-existence, [particularly] at the time when Viṣṇu was [on the verge of] being defeated in battle [with the antigods]; and also by the passages from the Ornament of the Madhyamaka, which explain that the view of the Vaiṣṇava is partly in conformity with Madhyamaka.[1074]
In terms of meditation, the Vaiṣṇava engage in the yoga of the six branches (ṣaḍaṅgayoga) and so forth.[1075]
Moreover, their subdivisions include the Mīmāṃsaka (spyod pa po), the Vaidika (rig byed pa), the Vaiyākaraṇa (brda sprod pa), the Cāraka (tsa ra ka pa), and the Aupaniṣadika (gsang ba pa).[1076]

Sixth, there are the Brāhmaṇa (tshangs pa ba), who maintain that the Vedas are eternal, and not created because they are the recollections of Brahmā, and as such they represent a valid form of cognition [in their own right]. They hold that those who die in battle will be reborn in exalted realms, that negative actions can be cancelled out by bathing in [sacred rivers] such as the Ganges, and that the whole world and its living organisms were created by Brahmā. The hermit sages and the Brahmins are also regarded as the children of Brahmā (brahmaputra).[1077]

Seventh, there are the Vedāntaupaniṣadika (rigs byed kyi mtha' gsang ba pa), who hold that there is a [shining] immortal person (amṛtamayapuruṣa, 'chi med bdud rtsi'i skyes bu)[1078] submerged within the maṇḍala of terrestrial darkness (pṛthivītalatamomaṇḍala), in which the eternal “self” (ātman), “consciousness” (cit), and “being” (sat, dam pa) are all gathered together as a single entity, in the manner of space, and that both the container world and living beings originated through its modifications.
According to Vedanta, when all phenomena are seen to be illusory, at that time, by cultivating the view concerning the creator “self” (kartṛkapuruṣa, byed pa po'i skyes bu), they hold that one will awaken from darkness, and, perceiving [all things] as golden [light], one will then be liberated by merging with [the immortal person or brahman] in a single savor, and so forth.

Eighth, there are the Vaiyākaraṇa or grammarians (brda sprod pa), such as Bhartṛhari,[1079] who hold that although the valid cognition of direct perception and inference ostensibly exist, they are not definitive, and that the foundations of all knowledge are the treatises on Sanskrit grammar, while the Vedas offer genuine valid cognition. All phenomena are embodiments of sound, and the ultimate among all sounds is the syllable OM, which is the pure source (brahman, tshangs pa) of sound, free from creation, destruction, and preservation, and entirely without relative direction. Although this [sound] is eternal and unchanging, it has become sullied by ignorance and consequently appears as form. But when this apparitional aspect is reversed, the pure source of non-apparitional sound is realized to be immortal.

Ninth, the [Mīmāṃsaka] followers of Jaiminī (rGyal dpogs pa) uphold the following twelve [defining characteristics that apply to ritual sacrifices], namely, (1) the validity or authority [of Vedic ritual and tradition] (pramāṇa, tshad ma); (2) the general [rules on lack of precedence and improper implementation of rites] (sāmānya, spyi); (3) the particular [rules on the context and sense of specific passages] (viśeṣa, bye brag); (4) the impact [of general and particular rules on other ritual practices] (prayojana, dgos pa); (3) the relative sequence [of the stages of ritual practices and the passages of their texts] (anukrama, go rim); (6) the basic [obligations and prescriptions regarding officiating priests and ritual materials] (adhikaraṇa, gnas gzhi); (7) the general prescriptions [concerning the transfer from one rite to another based on the direct injunctions of the Vedic texts] (sāmānyanirdeśa, spyi nges bstan); (8) the specific prescriptions [concerning the transfer from one rite to another based on overt or covert signs] (viśeṣanirdeśa, bye brag nges bstan); (9) the discussion [on the adaptation of Vedic hymns, sāman, and mantra] (ālāpa, gleng ba); (10) the debate [concerning the preclusion of secondary rites] (vivāda, rtsod pa); (11) the continuous [performance of several autonomous rites in sequence] (svatantra, rang rgyud); and (12) the contiguity [between primary and secondary rites] (prasaṅga, thal 'gyur).[1080]
As for valid cognition, they accept the following six modes: direct perception, inference, scriptural testimony, comparison (upamāna, nyer 'jal), presumption (arthāpātti, don gyis go ba), and absence or non-entity (abhāva, dngos med).[1081] They also propound [the ideas] that since the “self” (ātman) is the progenitor of the psycho-physical constituents, permanence is a condition of mankind (mānava, shed las skyes); that impurity is a condition of the nature of mind; and that once it has expired, release [from the cycle of existence] will occur.

Tenth, the Cāraka or followers of Caraka are largely similar to the Mīmāṃsaka.

Eleventh, the Nirgrantha Jains (gcer bu pa) hold that knowable phenomena comprise nine categories (navapadārtha, tshig don dgu), or ten with the addition of “self” (ātman). Included among them are the three modes of valid cognition: direct perception, inference, and scriptural authority.[1083]
They also hold that there are nine types of animate substance (navajīva, srog ldan dgu), and that since earth and other [such elements] are living organisms, the construction of monastic gardens (ārāma, kun dga' ra ba) and so forth is a causal basis of negativity.
Jains revere the hermit sage Vardhamāna Mahāvīra (rGyal ba dam pa) as a god, and follow the [tradition of] the twenty-five Jain mendicant teachers (kṣapaṇaka, zad byed pa),[1084] beginning with Ṛṣabha (Khyu mchog), Ajita (sNod kyi rje) and so forth.
They hold that by subjecting the physical body to austerities (tapas, dka' thub), the knots that bind the mind are destroyed, and they are known to possess about three hundred and sixty-three modes of ascetic discipline (vrata, brtul zhugs), including the control of the three “staffs” [of body, speech, and mind] (tridaṇḍin, dbyu gu gsum pa) and the “possession of only a tree” (palāśin, lo ma can).[1085]
The objects that may be appraised by means of the three modes of valid cognition, including the three times, the six substances, the nine categories, and the nine animate substances, are all [considered as] the ground, [when analyzed] in terms of ground, path, and result.
Here, the three times include the past and so forth. The six substances (ṣaḍ-dravya, rdzas drug) include animate substances (jīva, srog ldan), matter (pudgala, gang zag), time (kāla, dus), space (ākāśa, nam mkha'), merit (puṇya, bsod nams), and negativity (pāpa, sdig pa).

<d e="2">
In particular, as far as the nine categories and nine animate substances are concerned, the hermit sage Jina [Mahāvīra] has explained:[1086]
Animate substances (jīva, srog ldan), inanimate substances (ajīva, zag pa),
And commitments (saṃvara, sdom pa),
Rejuvenation (nirjara, nges par dga'), bondage (bandha, 'ching),
And deeds (karma, las),
Negative acts (pāpa, sdig pa), merits (puṇya, bsod nams),
And release (mokṣa, thar pa)—
These are held to be the nine categories [of knowable phenomena].
As for animate substances, they [also] have nine classes:
[The elementary life-forms of] earth, water, wood, fire, and wind,
As well as [the four classes of living creatures, namely, ]
Animalcules, ants, bees, and human beings,[1087]
Which possess anything from one up to five sense faculties.[1088]
The path [followed by the Nirgrantha Jains] entails the observance of controlled actions (saṃvara), the minor vows of ascetic restraint (aṇuvrata), and the cultivation of knowledge (jñāna, ye shes), each of which has five aspects, as well as the thirteen modes of conduct (pratimā, spyod pa bcu gsum) and various austerities (tapas) designed to terminate [the impact of] past actions (karma, las).[1089]
The result or fruit [of the practice] is that, on bringing an end to [the impact of] past actions, the animate abode known as the “aggregate of worlds” (lokasaṃgraha, 'jig rten 'dus pa) will still remain, present at the summit of the three world systems (tridhātu), and therefore, although one has been released from material forms and cyclic existence, the release [that is attained] will be immaterial but still a positive state of being, pure, and resembling an upturned parasol, fragrantly scented and pleasant, extending to a distance of four million five hundred thousand fathoms (yojana, dpag tshad).[1090]

These different traditions have their own scriptures which [seek to] refute [the view and practice of] Buddhism, establishing their respective frameworks for the ground, path, and result, [applying] reason to analyze objects of appraisal, rejecting [the teachings of] the omniscient Buddha, and so forth. Although they have many [different] views and modes of conduct, [they have been summarized as follows] in the Exposition of Valid Cognition:[1091]
Those who propound the Vedas as authoritative,
Who speak mistakenly [of an eternal “self”],
Who seek the [sacred] teachings through physical [ablutions],
Who speak of class [distinctions],[1092]
And say they have to engage in ascetic mortification
In order to overcome arrogance and negativity,
All of them represent the fivefold reasoning of foolish persons, Chattering about discriminative awareness!
Among them, there are [spiritual and philosophical systems] that form a view concerning future [lives and] worlds, while engaging in practices that reject negative actions and adopt positive actions, but they are merely focused on the pathway of the exalted realms. Indeed, since these are all similar in maintaining the [mistaken] view of the “self,” beginners engaging in Buddhist practice should reject them, giving them a wide berth, so that they might eliminate, in particular, the obscurations covering the path that [actually] leads to release [from cyclic existence].

Furthermore, there are also extremists and others in conformity with them who are not included within the Brāhmaṇical and Buddhist traditions, who consider the three precious jewels to be heretical, and so forth.[1093] And there are also the most debased of all the extremists who hold harmful or violent acts as their sacred teaching. [For example, ] in West India there are the followers of the god Rahman from the country of Mecca (ma kba), who are also known as the Mughals or “barbarous Tajiks”[1094] They eat the flesh of cattle, having slit their throats with knives charmed by the spell of Bismillah, and, on account of their own karma, they do not eat the flesh of a creature that has died [naturally].
Then, there are also those who maintain ascetic disciplines [pertaining to diet] such as drinking only the [raw] eggs of a hen—nowadays these traditions are prevalent exclusively in India.
Among those upholding [other] purported philosophical systems that are said to confer liberation from cyclic existence, there are some in the aboriginal borderlands who claim that killing many living creatures is a means of attaining release [from the cycle].
Then, among adherents of the [Ājīvaka] school, the so-called teaching of Maskarī Gośālaputra,[1095] there were also those who held that by piercing ants in a golden bowl with a golden needle they would still be liberated from cyclic existence.[1096] Then again, there are some worldly folk who hold that if one repeats the names of the five Pāṇḍava [brothers], one will obtain great merit.[1097]
In Tibet also, there are the followers of Bon who do not uphold the act of taking refuge in the three precious jewels, and among them, in particular, there are [adherents of] the original Bon (rgyu'i bon) widespread in some districts in ancient times and even nowadays [to a limited extent], who adopt harmful or violent acts as their sacred teachings.[1098]

Then, in China, there is the [Daoist] tradition associated with [Princess] Jincheng (Gyim shang), which asserts that the entire world originated from a great golden turtle, and those upholding the views and practices espoused by numerologists (grangs can pa) and Confucius (Khong spu tse).[1099] Including them, all those who assert eternalist and nihilist views, and claim harmful or violent acts as their sacred teachings, are beyond the pale in terms of the Buddhist scriptures; all of them should be treated circumspectly, rejected and given a wide berth by those who [genuinely] seek release [from cyclic existence].
In general, with regard to [the distinction between] impure and pure textual traditions, one should know that these are differentiated on the basis of whether or not they emphasize the extraordinary appreciation of great compassion (mahākaruṇā) or skillful means (upāya), and the abiding nature of reality (gnas lugs kyi don), which is discriminative awareness.

In general, the exalted realms (abhyudaya, mngon mtho) and the level of definitive excellence (niḥireyasa, nges legs kyi go 'phang)[1100] are the objectives to be attained by intelligent beings. The defining characteristics of these are, respectively, (1) the immediate release from the sufferings [of rebirth] in the three inferior realms, accruing the happiness of gods and humans through the ripening [of virtuous past actions] in conformity with their [appropriate] causes; and (2.) the release passing beyond sorrow and into nirvana, which is a perpetual liberation from the sufferings of all [classes of beings] within cyclic existence.
With regard to these two [goals], initially one has to become secure in the vehicle of the exalted realms, and then subsequently one should attain the conclusive path of definitive excellence. It says in the Precious Garland:[1101]
First there are the teachings of the exalted [vehicle],
And subsequently the [level of] definitive excellence will emerge.
For this reason, having attained the exalted [realms],
One should successively [attain] definitive excellence.
We hold that the exalted [realms are states] of happiness,
While definitive excellence is release [from cyclic existence].
Among them, the vehicle of the exalted realms which is first to be attained comprises both the vehicle of gods and humans (devamanuṣyayāna, lha mi'i theg pa) and the vehicle of Brahmā (brahmāyāna, tshangs pa'i theg pa).

<d e="2">
The teaching presented in this section is preliminary, to be actually undertaken before engaging in the vehicle of the exalted realms. Yet, as if to supplement [the main instructions] by way of incidental commentary, it says in the Precious Garland:[1104]

When the means of attaining this [path] are abbreviated,
They comprise faith and discriminative awareness.
In order to acquire faith,
One should consult the [sacred] teachings,
And in order to acquire discriminative awareness,
One should [cultivate] genuine awareness.
The most important of these two is discriminative awareness,
But it should be preceded by faith.

Accordingly, the foremost of all the means of attaining both the exalted realms and the definitive excellence are faith and discriminative awareness. This is because [in the case of the exalted realms], when one is motivated principally by the faith born of conviction in the results of past actions, among the three kinds of faith, one can effectively adopt virtuous actions and reject negative actions. Also, it is because [in the case of the attainment of definitive excellence, ] the roots of cyclic existence are severed by means of discriminative awareness that is non-discursive with respect to the three spheres [of subject, object, and their interaction].
The defining characteristics of these two [prerequisites] are, respectively, that (1) faith reverses, without any special reason, the four erroneous ways of progressing [on the spiritual path], namely, (a) progressing with attachment to one's own affairs, (b) with aversion for others, (c) with delusion in respect of what should be adopted and rejected, and (d) with fear of officialdom and so forth. Consequently, [with faith, ] one will not transgress the things that should be [properly] accepted and rejected by means of the four correct ways of progressing [on the path]. (2) Discriminative awareness engages body, speech, and mind while being non-discursive with respect to the three spheres [of subject, object, and their interaction], whether one possesses or lacks the great compassion that emphasizes the well-being of others.

</d>
<d e="2">
Accordingly, it says in the same source:[1105]

A faithful person is one who does not transgress the [sacred] teachings
Through attachment, aversion, fear, and delusion—
That one is a supremely excellent recipient [of the teachings].
Discriminative awareness is that which knows
And always engages in actions of body, speech, and mind,
Which are beneficial to both self and others,
Without being discursive with respect to the three spheres.

Therefore, as one should generally know, it is said that if one is not motivated by [genuine] faith, one will not progress [effectively] towards [engagement in] even a modicum of virtuous activity. Equally, if one does not realize selflessness [with respect to individual persons and phenomena] through discriminative awareness that is non-discursive with respect to the three spheres [of subject, object, and their interaction], one will never progress on the path that leads to release [from cyclic existence].
This being the case, the prerequisites of all those who would enter upon the vehicle of [any spiritual] path are the three kinds of faith.[1106] When, among these, one is motivated mainly by the faith born of conviction in the results of past actions, [it is clear that] the attainment of virtuous actions by means of the four correct ways of progressing [on the path] will itself be preliminary to engaging in the vehicle of the exalted realms.

The mundane vehicle of gods and humans is the means of attaining an exalted physical form through fear of [rebirth in] the inferior realms (durgati, ngan song) and by striving for the result of happiness, which is associated with the higher realms (svarga, mtho ris).[1107] This is the [spiritual] path suited for persons of inferior ability, which relies on protection from fear and auspicious aspirational prayers. It is the path influenced by [the impact of] past actions, which is in conformity with [the practice of] the ten virtuous actions (daśakuśala, dge ba bcu) but which is not yet apprehended by means of meditative concentration (dhyāna, bsam gtan)—the actual attainment of experiential cultivation.
Since there are no [higher] vehicles that do not engage in [the basic virtuous practices associated with] this [vehicle], it is [regarded as] the foundation of all vehicles and precedes them all. As it is said in the Tantra of Hevajra:[1108]
Having commenced from the ten virtues His teachings are disclosed.
It is said in the Sūtra of the Descent to Lanka that this [vehicle] is called the “vehicle of the gods” (devayāna) with reference to the foremost [levels of the world system of desire] which are to be traversed [through it], but, in respect of its peripheral [attainments], it also encompasses all the [lower] paths that progress to the happiness [of humans], experienced in the [world system of] desire (kāma[dhātu]).[1109]
With regard to this [vehicle], the view (lta ba) is [deemed to be] correct in its convictions that there are other worlds and that past actions do have causes and results. Conduct (spyod pa) requires an uninterrupted familiarity with practices in which the ten non-virtuous actions are renounced and the path of the ten virtuous and peripheral actions is pursued. Thereby, as a result ('bras bu), one will traverse [the various realms of the world-system of desire], as far as the Paranirmitavaśavartin realm, experiencing the conclusive happiness of the human beings of the four continents and the six species of Kama divinities.[1110]
[At the outset] it is important for followers of this [vehicle] to retain the authentic worldly view, which functions as an antidote for the wrong view that past actions have no result, and so forth.

For this reason, it says in the Letter to a Friend:[1111]

If one espouses the release associated with the higher realms,
One should cultivate familiarity with the correct view.
Even though an individual may have practiced well,
With a wrong view, all that matures will be unbearable.

Thereafter, it will be important for them to maintain the ethical discipline (śīla, tshul khrims) which does not confuse the things that are to be rejected and those that are to be accepted. For this reason, it says in the Four Hundred Verses (Catuḥśataka):[1112]

Through ethical discipline,
Progress towards happiness will be attained.

And in the Introduction [to Madhyamaka]:[1113]

Apart from ethical discipline,
There is no other cause of [rebirth in] the exalted realms.
If the ethical discipline associated with this vehicle is analyzed to some extent, it generally requires that, motivated by modesty and decency, one should train oneself in the three modes of conduct (spyod pa gsum) that are in conformity with principled physical and verbal behavior.

On these, it says in the Treatise on Behavior entitled Holy Ornament:[1114]

To honor well those who are worthy of reverence,
To be especially benevolent to those who are unprotected,
And not to forget to repay kindness
Are [the modes of] conduct of saindy persons.
One should also train oneself, more specifically, in the sixteen [commonly accepted] human laws, which are explained as follows in the Short Chapter on Discrimination:[1115]
One should develop faith in the three precious jewels without sorrow or weariness; search ultimately for the sacred teachings; skillfully study the excellent sciences; and first recollect and then appraise anything that is to be undertaken. One should not hanker after unassigned work; but one should look to a higher level and emulate the ancients and those of superior conduct; repay kindness to one's parents of the past, present, and future; be broad-minded and hospitable in one's dealings with elder and younger siblings and paternal relatives; ensure that the young respect their elders by degrees; show loving-kindness to one's neighbors; arduously assist one's acquaintances who are spiritual advisors (dge bshes); perfectly fulfill the needs of those nearby who are connected through the worldly round; help others through one's skill in science and the arts; provide a refuge with kindness to those who depend upon it; resist bad advice and establish advice which will increase the happiness of the country; and, entrusting the goals of one's past actions to the [sacred] teachings, one should bring one's spouse to obtain the ground of enlightenment in future lives.
Therefore, one should train oneself in the pure behavior which accords with these [sixteen] human laws.

In particular, as previously mentioned, one should abandon, both directly and indirectly, the ten kinds of non-virtuous actions, such as killing, and adopt to the best of one's ability the ten virtuous actions, which include saving lives, charity, and so forth.
Among the [various nuances of] this view, meditation, and conduct, the lowest are those who engage in confused [virtuous and non-virtuous] actions, where the parameters [of the actions] that propel [sentient beings into subsequent rebirths] and those that fulfill [the diverse positive and negative experiences of the present lifetime] are in a state of disharmony.[1116] The average or mediocre sort are those who fulfill the path of virtuous actions [in the present lifetime], and the superior sort are those disciplined in the essential nature of the vows that regulate the ten virtuous actions and cyclic existence.
When [such beings] are born in the exalted realms, by mastering the fully ripened effects [of past actions] and effects that conform to their causes, they will consequently obtain excellent results that are respectively inferior, average, and superior.[1117]

Therefore, with reference to the wide range of the term, as explained by Ārya Vimuktisena, everything subsumed within the levels of the two higher world-systems [of form and formlessness] is designated by the term “Brahmā”; while the path that traverses and reaches that [goal] along with its peripheral [activities] is called the “the vehicle of Brahmā.”[1118]

These [nine techniques] are as follows:
(1) Mental placement (cittasthāpanā, sems 'jog pa). This is the placement that focuses the mind on an image or referential object within the scope of meditative stability, such as a [divine] icon with a luster resembling that of gold, without permitting the mind to wander externally.
(2) Perpetual placement (saṃsthāpana, rgyun 'jog). Here, the mind is not only focused upon its object, but the placement is continued without interruption for even an instant.
(3) Integrated placement (avasthāpanā, bslan 'jog). Here, even when the mind is distracted elsewhere from its object, it is immediately drawn back and refocused.
(4) Intensified placement (upasthāpanā, nye bar 'jog pa). Here, the mind is intensely focused inwardly upon its object, without allowing it to settle [elsewhere], for as long as it is distracted.
(5) Control (damana, 'dul ba). This is the process through which the thoroughly disturbed streams of conscious thought caused by dissonant mental states such as greed are properly controlled.
(6) Calmness (śamana, zhi ba). Here, the waves of non-discursive mental states are becalmed.
(7) Quiescence (vyupaśamana, rnam zhi). Here, even the most subtle conceptual thoughts are again calmed.
(8) One-pointedness (ekotīkaraṇa, rtse gcig). Here, the mind focuses one-pointedly and without differentiation upon its object, with minimal effort.
(9) Meditative equipoise (samasaṃsthāpa, mnyam bzhag). Here, the mind is equipoised in a state of spontaneous presence, without effort, having dispelled all mental dullness and agitation.[1121]
When meditative stability is attained by means of these nine [techniques], it is implicit that one will be transported to a state of happiness, characterized by both physical and mental refinement (praśrabdhi, shin tu sbyangs pa).[1122]
One who develops meditative stability endowed with refinement characteristically focuses on the calm abiding associated with the mundane [realms], but when [one's meditative stability] lacks this refinement, [the aspirational experience] is known as the “level of conduct brought about through resolve in accord with calm abiding” (śamathānulobhādhimukticaryābhūmi, zhi gnas rjes mthun pa'i mos pas spyod pa'i sa).[1123]

Having accomplished the defining characteristics of calm abiding, one should then focus on the six modes of attention (ṣaḍmanaskāra, yid la byed pa drug) [associated with higher insight],[1124] which are defined as follows:
(1) The attention that is aware of individual characteristics (lakṣaṇa-pratisaṃvedanāmanaskāra, mtshan nyid rab tu rig pa yid la byed pa)[1125] implies that those for whom the [world system of] desire is defective and for whom the first meditative concentration [is appealing because it] is endowed with positive attributes, engage coarsely in ideation and subtly in scrutiny, by means of study and reflection combined.
(2) The attention that arises through resolve (ādhimokṣikamanaskāra, mos pa las byung ba yid la byed pa) implies that they generate the [same] essential nature that [also] arises in the course of meditation (sgom byung gi ngo bor skyes pa).
(3) The attention that arises through isolation (prāvivekyamanaskāra, dben pa las skyes pa' i yid la byed pa) implies that they are isolated from the three great kinds of overt dissonant mental states associated with the world system of desire.[1126]
(4) The attention imbued with encompassing joy (ratisaṃgrāhakama-naskāra, dga' ba sdud ba yid la byed pa) implies that they have also renounced the three middling kinds of overt dissonant mental states associated with the world system of desire.
(5) The attention that is imbued with scrutiny (mīmāṃsāmanaskāra, dpyod pa yid la byed pa) implies that they continue to engage in ideation and scrutiny whether their minds are covered or uncovered by the three subtle kinds of overt dissonant mental states associated with the world system of desire.
(6) The attention that is imbued with perfected application (prayoganiṣṭhamanaskāra, sbyor ba'i mtha' yid la byed pa) implies that they have renounced by means of the [appropriate] antidote even the subtlest and minute traces of overt dissonant mental states associated with the world system of desire, which derive from that [aforementioned] scrutiny.[1127]

Through these six kinds of attention, one will then accomplish the conclusive higher insight attainable by mundane beings, which is called “attention to the fruit of perfected application” (prayogeṣṭhāphalamanaskāra, sbyor ba'i mtha'i 'bras bu yid la byed pa).
These forms of [higher insight] have both coarse and quiescent aspects—in that beings of the lower levels whose meditative stability is defective coarsely inspect [their objects], while those of the higher levels who are without such defects inspect [their objects] in a state of quiescence. As such, [these modes of higher insight] are the manifest realizations of the spiritual paths that are commonly pursued in the [diverse] vehicles of pious attendants, hermit buddhas, and mundane [gods and humans] (laukika, 'jig rten pa).[1128]

The actual foundation of meditative concentration will be achieved through those [aforementioned] preparations [of calm abiding and higher insight].

(2) scrutiny (vicāra, dpyod pa), (3) joy (priti, dga' ba), (4) bliss (sukha, bde ba), and (5) one-pointed mind (cittaikāgratā, sems rtse gcig pa).
Among them, when [one's meditative concentration] possesses both ideation and scrutiny, this is [known as] the “ordinary actual foundation” (dngos gzhi tsam po), and when it possesses scrutiny but no ideation, this is [known as] the “extraordinary actual foundation” (dngos gzhi khyad par can).[1129]

The actual foundation of the fourth [meditative concentration] has four aspects, namely, (1-2) the two antidotal aspects, comprising purity of recollection (smṛtipariśuddhi, dran pa yang dag) and purity of equanimity (upekṣāpariśuddhi, btang snyoms yang dag); (3) the beneficial aspect, comprising equanimity of feelings (vedanopekṣā, tshor ba btang snyoms); and (4) the aspect of abiding in meditative stability.
In this context, purity of recollection implies complete purity of the eight defects associated with meditative concentration (dhyānāṣṭadoṣa, bsam gtan gyi sky on brgyad). These defects comprise (1-2) ideation and scrutiny with respect to the first meditative concentration, which are said to resemble fire; (3-4) feelings of bliss and sorrow with respect to the second meditative concentration, which originate within the range of sensory consciousness; (5-6) [feelings of] mental comfort and discomfort with respect to the third meditative concentration, which originate within the range of mental consciousness; and (7-8) exhalation and inhalation of breath with respect to the fourth meditative concentration.
In this way, [the actual foundation of the fourth meditative concentration] is completely purified of these eight defects.[1132]

As for the results that are attained by means of these meditative absorptions (snyoms 'jug), by meditating [successively] on the lesser, mediocre, and greater actual foundations of the first meditative concentration, one will obtain [rebirth] in three other [god] realms, starting with the Stratum of Brahmā (brahmakāyika, tshangs ris), and so on, until, by meditating [successively] on the lesser, mediocre, and greater actual attainments of the fourth meditative concentration, one will obtain [rebirth] in three other realms, starting with the Cloudless (anabbraka, sprin med). Having conclusively perfected the lesser, mediocre, and greater actual foundations of each [of the four meditative concentrations] in this way, one will experience the ripening fruit and so forth of the realms or states associated with each [in turn].[1133]
Here, the term “ripening result” (vipākaphala, rnam smin gyi 'bras bu) includes both the locations, i. e., those [twelve god] realms and the [divine] forms assumed [by the gods] who take birth therein. These attributes [are considered to be] “results in conformity with their causes” (niṣyandaphala, rgyu mthun 'bras bu)—in this case the meditative absorptions. The term “predominant result” (adhipatiphala, bdag po'i 'bras bu) here refers to the [distinctive] resources that are perceived to be associated with [these distinctive god] realms.

The [four meditative absorptions] known to be in association with the four extremes of the formless sensory activity fields (ārūpyāyatana, gzugs med skye mched) are enumerated as follows:[1134]
(1) The first is the meditative absorption of the sensory activity field of infinite space (ākāśānantyāyatana, nam mkha' mtha' yas skye mched kyi snyoms 'jug), in which the mind, in addition to obtaining the fourth meditative concentration and not relapsing from that state, has inhibited the [world system of] form and its threefold interaction of sensory contact, vision, and perception (reg mthong snang gsum), and completely perfected meditation on the thought that all things are infinite like the sky.
(2) The second is the meditative absorption of the sensory activity field of infinite consciousness (vijñānāntyāyatana, rnam shes mtha' yas skye mched kyi snyoms 'jug), in which, in addition to that [first meditative absorption], one has completely perfected meditation on the thought that consciousness is infinite, just as space is infinite.
(3) The third is the meditative absorption of the sensory activity field of no thing-at-all (akiṃcanyāyatana, ci yang med pa'i skye mched kyi snyoms 'jug), in which, having discerned these two [previous meditative absorptions] to be symbolic, one has completely perfected meditation on the thought that there is nothing at all to be grasped.
(4) The fourth is the meditative absorption of neither perception nor nonperception (naivasaṃjnāsaṃjnāyatana, 'du shes med min gyi snyoms 'jug), in which, having discerned these three [previous meditative absorptions] to be symbolic, one has completely perfected meditation on the thought that there is neither perception, coarse or subtle, nor non-perception. This is the conclusive perfection of the path that leads to the summit of [mundane] existence (bhavāgra, srid pa'i rtse).[1135]

With regard to the results achieved through these four meditative absorptions, although the world-system of formlessness is not differentiated like the other [aforementioned] locations or [god] realms which may be distinguished on the basis of their coarse material form, there are still differences [therein], based on the superior and inferior [degrees of meditative absorption], the duration of the life span [enjoyed by its denizens], the higher and lower [levels], and so forth.
Among the Mahāsaṅghikas, there are some who explain that [these results] may also be differentiated on the basis of their [distinctive] locations or realms.[1136] However that may be, it is on account of their ever-increasing meditative stability, which becomes more extensive and more steadfast, and on account of the duration of the life span and so forth, that the results of happiness experienced in the exalted realms are particularly sublime.

Dependent on the actual attainments of the four meditative concentrations, the distinctive attributes associated with the two higher world-systems [of form and formlessness] will become familiar. They include the four immeasurable aspirations (caturaprameya, tshad med bzhi), starting with loving-kindness (maitrī, byams pa),[1137] and the five mundane supernormal cognitive powers (pañcābhijnā, mngon shes lnga), namely, clairvoyance (divyacahkṣurabhijnā, lha'i mig gi mngon shes), clairaudience (divyaśrotrābhijnā, lha'i rna ba'i mngon shes), knowledge of the minds of others (paracittābhijnā, gzhan sems gyi mngon shes), recollection of past lives (pūrvanivāsānusmṛtyabhijñā, sngon gyi gnas rjes su dran pa'i mngon shes), and knowledge of the nature of passing away and rebirth (cyutyupapadajñāna, 'chi 'pho dang skye ba shes pa).[1138]
All who enter upon the [Buddhist] vehicles initially must cultivate those meditative stabilities and their associated attributes, and repeatedly attain the distinctive features of the higher realms. Therefore, [the vehicle of the exalted realms] is the basis of all enlightened attributes that may be cultivated, including the supernormal cognitive powers.
In particular, the meditative absorption of neither perception nor nonperception is obtained dependent on the mind that has attained the actual foundation of the fourth meditative concentration, and the [conclusive] meditative absorption of cessation is obtained dependent on the mind that has attained the actual foundation of the summit of existence, and so forth.[1139] Consequently, this is the supreme objective to be striven after and attained even by the non-Buddhist hermit sages and philosophical extremists, as well as by the pious attendants and hermit buddhas, who follow the Lesser Vehicle of Buddhism.
Since [the vehicles of gods and humans, and the vehicle of Brahmā] are the preliminary or prerequisite teachings practiced by all those who progressively embark on the Buddhist teachings of the Conqueror, one should understand them and master their experiential application.

Concerning the distinctive attributes of the Buddhist and non-Buddhist philosophical systems, which we and others respectively espouse, scholars hold many different opinions, and yet no bias can be distinguished in the [following] qualitative [presentation of] the view, meditation, conduct, and result:
(1) The view (lta ba) on the basis of which one embarks upon any philosophical and spiritual system is differentiated according to whether it accepts or does not accept the four hallmarks indicative of [the Buddhas] transmitted teachings.
(2) The meditation (sgom pa) is differentiated on the basis of whether it acts or does not act as an antidote for [attachment] to the summit of existence.
(3) Conduct (spyod pa) is differentiated on the basis of whether it renounces or does not renounce the two extremes of self-mortification (ātmaklamathānta, bdag ngal dub kyi mtha') and over-indulgence (kāmasukhallikānta, 'dod pa bsod nyams kyi mtha').
(4) Release [from cyclic existence], which is the result ('bras bu), is differentiated on the basis of whether it upholds or does not uphold the extraordinary truth of the cessation [of suffering], which is [completely] free from the corruption [of past actions] that are to be abandoned.
Accordingly, it is said in [Śākyaprabha's] Sun Commentary on Monastic Discipline:
The learned realize that the Buddhas speech Teaches well the three trainings,
Is correctly endowed with the four seals,
And is virtuous in the beginning, middle, and end.[3]

The four seals or hallmarks are [also known as] the four maxims pertaining to the [sacred] teachings [of the Buddha]. As is said in the Sūtra of Inconceivable Secrets:[4]

The Tathāgata has subsumed all the teachings in four aphorisms:
All that is conditioned is impermanent;
All that is corrupt is suffering;
All things are without self;
And nirvana is peace.

The objection might be raised that this is untenable because the Vatsīputrīyas among the Buddhist schools also uphold [the view] that there is a “self” and they accept that there are compounded [phenomena] which are not perishable, [persisting] through [the series] of indivisible time moments. Even so, there is no defect because they do not hold that there is an object [i. e., a “self”] that is extraneous to the psycho-physical aggregates and permanent, and they do not accept that there are eternal, imperishable, and permanent entities. Therefore, there is a great distinction between them and the [non-Buddhist] extremists.[5]
The “antidote for [attachment to] the summit of existence” (srid rtse'i gnyen po) cannot be found in [the philosophical and spiritual traditions of the non-Buddhist] extremists because selflessness (nairātmya, bdag med) is diametrically opposed to those [spiritual] paths which maintain [that the “self”] is a truly existent entity, and because above that [summit of existence] there is no other level [of the form or formless realms], and therefore no quiescent or coarse entity existing whatsoever.[6] Therefore, the master Śūra has said:[7]

The beings who do not side with your teaching
Have been blinded by delusion.
Even though they might reach the summit of existence,
They will achieve a rebirth in which suffering reemerges.
Those who follow your teaching,
Even without obtaining the actual realization of meditative concentration,
Will oppose [the cycle of] rebirths,
As if they were the vision of Mara.

With regard to the defects of conduct [maintained by non-Buddhists], they fall into the two extremes [of self-mortification and over-indulgence]. Through attachment to [material] gain and veneration, such persons are unsatisfied by [resources of] poor quality and scarcity, while indulging in [resources of] excellent quality and abundance. However, when one's own ethical discipline is pure and one realizes through the view of selflessness [the defective nature of] coarse materialism (dngos 'dzin rags pa), with a modicum of understanding, at that time one may partake of [one's resources] without hardship, whereupon, if no strong attachment or clinging then arises, even the partaking [of resources] of excellent quality and abundance may be without defect.
Those who do not act accordingly but engage in physical and mental overindulgence and self-mortification are mainly to be identified, respectively, with the Lokāyatikas and the Nirgrantha Jains.[8] However, the Transcendent Lord [Buddha] emphasized [monastic] discipline with regard to the four [essential] resources—clothing, food, dwelling, and bedding—which does not fall into the two extremes.
Concerning the release [from cyclic existence], which is the result [ensuing from practice of the Buddhist path], it is said in the Letter to a Friend:[9]
One should attain [the state] that is free
From earth, water, fire, wind, sun, and moon.

In this context, the Lokāyatikas hold that release [from cyclic existence] and the four elements have a common ground because they define cyclic existence and nirvana respectively as the presence and absence of the four elements, along with the mind. It says in the Eulogy on Distinctions:[10]
Parrots are known to say that once the sun has exploded,
There will be release [from cyclic existence].
Passages such as this suggest [the Lokāyatikas] held [the disintegration of] the sun and moon as indicators of release [from cyclic existence]. The Nirgrantha Jains, on the other hand, hold that release occurs in the expanse of celestial space, resembling an upturned parasol.[11] Since beings are deluded with regard to the release that is to be attained according to such [philosophical systems], the corresponding spiritual paths that [are said to] bring about this release are also deluded.
On the other hand, the teaching of the Conqueror [Buddhism] holds that release [from cyclic existence] or nirvana is the truth of the cessation [of suffering, nirodhasatya] and it is the source of provisional and conclusive spiritual and temporal well-being, whereby those who achieve it surpass the traditions of the non-Buddhists. For these reasons, the term “definitive excellence” (niḥśreyasa, nges legs) applies to the teaching of the Conqueror alone.

With reference to the [sacred] teachings that comprise the transmissions (āgamadharma, lung gi chos) of Buddhism, the distinctions and doxographical classifications made in terms of both the [canonical] transmitted teachings (vacana, bka') [of Buddha word] and the [commentarial] treatises (śāstra, bstan bcos) are said to be manifold.[12]
It says in Āryadeva's Compendium of the Nucleus of Pristine Cognition:
The [sacred] teachings of the Buddha Are actually discerned by intelligent persons To comprise four aspects:
By elucidating the paths of the Vaibhasikas and so forth,
The real nature [of the sacred teachings] is attained.
Accordingly, all the sacred Buddhist teachings may be ascertained in terms of the following four spiritual and philosophical systems: the Vaibhasika (bye brag smra ba), the Sautrāntika (mdo sde pa), the Yogacārin (rnal 'byor spyod pa) and the Mādhyamika (dbu ma pa). These [four systems] may also be subsumed into a threefold classification, comprising the Bāhyārthavādin (phyi don du smra ba), the Cittamātrin (sems tsam pa), and the Mādhyamika who propound the absence of inherent existence (niḥsvabhāvikamādhyamika, ngo bo nyid med par smra ba'i dbu ma pa), because the Vaibhāṣika and the Sautrāntika are both subsumed under the category of those who propound the existence of external objects (bāhyārthavādin). Then again, the [four] systems may be further subsumed within the two vehicles because it is certain that the first two are associated with the followers of the Lesser Vehicle (hīnayānin, theg dman pa), and the second two with the followers of the Greater Vehicle (mahāyānin, theg chenpa).[13]
The Sūtra of the Descent to Lanka also explains that the entire teaching [of the Buddha] may be subsumed within five vehicles, in the following words:[14]
The vehicle of gods and the vehicle of Brahmā,
And likewise the vehicles of the pious attendants,
Tathāgatas, and hermit buddhas were explained by me.
In this regard, it is said in the Precious Garland that, when these [five vehicles] are further subsumed, they may be gathered within two [distinct] vehicles because the first two are associated with the exalted realms and the last three with [the attainment of] definitive excellence.[15]

Similarly, in the context of the pith instructions of the perfection of discriminative awareness (prajñāpāramitopadeśa, sher phyin gyi man ngag) [exemplified in the Ornament of Emergent Realization and its commentarial literature], these [five vehicles] may also be subsumed according to the [spiritual] paths followed by three types of person (tripuruṣa, skyes bugsum), i. e., the first two [vehicles] correspond to the spiritual path followed by persons of narrow scope (adhamapuruṣa, skyes bu chung ngu), the middle two [vehicles] correspond to the spiritual path followed by persons of average scope (madhyamapuruṣa, skyes bu 'bring pa), and last [vehicle] corresponds to the spiritual path followed by persons of extensive scope (mahāpuruṣa, skyes bu chen po).[16]
On the other hand, if one were to [rigidly] hold that there are [only] five vehicles, it even says in the following verses from [Praśāntamitra's] Commentary on the Nucleus of Indestructible Reality that there is no fourth vehicle, nor is there a fifth philosophical system:[17]
For those who are Buddhists,
Neither the fourth nor the fifth Are the Sage's enlightened intention.
Does this passage not contradict, one might ask, [those references to the five vehicles which have been expressed in texts such as the Sūtra of the Descent to Lankā]? Indeed, the Sūtra of the Lotus also says:[18]
The teaching of the three vehicles by the Great Sage Is the skillful means of the guiding [buddhas].
Although there are passages such as these, stating [the buddhas] enlightened intention to be that the [spiritual] path to liberation has no fourth vehicle, there is not the slightest contradiction because these [different] textual traditions have divergent exegetical bases or starting points.
[While we are on the subject of the threefold doxography,] it is said in the Lamp Which Subsumes Conduct::[19]
With reference to the three kinds of volition possessed by those who require training, conduct comprises the following three categories: for those whose volition is directed towards the low-level [practice] there is the conduct that is free from attachment; for those whose volition is directed towards the extensive [practice], there is the conduct associated with the [bodhisattva] levels and the transcendental perfections; while for those whose volition is directed even higher towards the profound [practice], there is revealed the conduct which engages with desire and attachment.

Also, in the Lamp of the Three Ways of the master Tripiṭakamāla, it is said:
Whatever ways reveal the real nature of the [four] truths,
Whatever ways are the objective of the [six] transcendental perfections,
Whatever ways are the objectives of the great [vehicle of] secret mantra,
They are [all] integrated and presented herein.
This latter text therefore seeks to integrate [the teachings] according to their three [established] “ways” (tshul gsum): the way of the yogin who pursues the four [sublime] truths, the way of the yogin who follows the [six] transcendental perfections, and the way of the yogin who follows the great [vehicle of] secret mantra. The master Jñānakīrti similarly integrates [the diverse teachings of the Buddha] in his Abridgement of All Transmitted Teachings Without Exception: A Dissertation on Exegesis.
Now, it says in the Ornament of the Sūtras of the Greater Vehicle:[20]
The canonical compilations appropriately may number three or two.
According to this [authoritative] text, there are a great many ways in which [the teachings of the Buddha] may be subsumed: integrating them into the two canonical compilations (piṭaka, sde snod) or vehicles of the supreme [Mahāyāna] and the lesser [Hīnayāna], or more usually, integrating them into the three vehicles of the pious attendants, hermit buddhas, and bodhi-sattvas, and so forth.
Even so, the general consensus is that [the teachings of the Buddha] are to be known in terms of either the “three vehicles” or the “four spiritual and philosophical systems.
All of these traditions concur that once the apprehension of the self or egotistical grasping (ātmagraha, bdag tu 'dzin pa), which is the causal basis of cyclic existence, has been abandoned, the level of nirvana, which is [a genuine] release [from cyclic existence], will be attained.[21]
Also, with regard to those [diverse vehicles and philosophical systems, one should know that] the more advanced among them will not emerge without relying on those that precede them.[22] This may be exemplified by the following quotation from the Sūtra of the Ten-Wheeled Kṣitigarbha:
Whoever lacks the vehicle of the exalted realms,
Also lacks the vehicle of the pious attendants.
Whoever lacks the vehicle of the pious attendants,
Also lacks the vehicle of the hermit buddhas.
Whoever lacks the vehicle of the hermit buddhas,
Also lacks the Greater Vehicle.

It is said in the Treasury of Phenomenology:[23]
Apart from the thorough discernment of phenomena, there is no means to extinguish the dissonant mental states, and it is by reason of the dissonant mental states that the world roams this ocean of rebirth. Therefore, to enhance this [discernment], the Teacher has taught [phenomenology].
Once the causal basis of cyclic existence has been abandoned, in order that release [from cyclic existence] might be attained, it will be essential to establish the defining characteristics of all objects of knowledge by means of the discriminative awareness (prajñā, shes rab) which thoroughly discerns [all] phenomena. Since this is effected by qualitatively establishing the defining characteristics of the five psycho-physical aggregates (pañcaskandha, phung po lnga), the eighteen sensory bases (aṣṭadaśadhātu, khams bco brgyad), the twelve sensory activity fields (dvādaśāyatana, skye mched bcu gnyis), and the processes of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda, rten cing 'brel bar 'byung ba), it is essential that these [phenomenological constituents] should be understood. Therefore it is said in the sūtras:[24]
One should understand the psycho-physical aggregates,
One should understand the sensory bases,
One should understand the sensory activity fields,
And one should understand the processes of dependent origination,
As well as the positive and negative contingencies [of all things].[25]
With regard to these [phenomenological structures], although there are many classifications and presentations of their defining characteristics made in accordance with the Greater Vehicle and the Lesser Vehicle, here I shall briefly discuss the general tradition that is prevalent in all [the Buddhist schools].

<d e="2">
The transcendent lord [Buddha] established [all] objects of knowledge by expounding phenomena in terms of the three constituents: psycho-physical aggregates, sensory bases, and sensory activity fields.[26]
With regard to the essential purpose underlying these [phenomenological structures], the Vaibhasikas hold that they function as an antidote for the apprehension of wholeness that comes about through three aspects of delusion (trimoha, rmongs pa gsum), and they are directed with an intention towards those requiring training, who are endowed with three [distinct] faculties and three [distinct] volitions.[27]
As for these terms, the three aspects of delusion comprise the delusion that comes about through the apprehension of a composite or conglomerate “self” (piṇḍātmagrāha, ril po'i bdag nyid du 'dzin pa) with respect to (a) mental states (caitasika, sems byung), (b) physical forms (rūpa, gzugs), and (c) physical forms and mental states combined (gzugs sems gnyis ka).
The three faculties (dbang po gsum) [associated with persons of different scopes] are keen faculties, mediocre or average faculties, and dull faculties.
The three volitions [associated with persons of different scopes] include those inclined towards concise explanations (samāsādhimukti, tshig bsdus pa), moderate explanations (madhyamādhimukti, 'bring), and extensive explanations (udārādbimukti, rgyas pa 'dod pa).[28]
As for the teachings of dependent origination, they were expounded in order to dispel delusion with respect to the processes of dependent origination held by some who maintain the view that all things have emerged from an [inherently] existing “self,” and by others who maintain the nihilist view that all things have emerged without a causal basis.[29]
In brief, these [constituents of Buddhist phenomenology] were sequentially taught as an antidote for delusion with regard to the abiding nature of [all] objects of knowledge.

First [in the tradition of Higher Abhidharma], there are three topics, comprising respectively the psycho-physical aggregates, the sensory bases, and the sensory activity fields. Since the Compendium of Phenomenology, representing the uncommon phenomenology of the Greater Vehicle, refers to an abundance of phenomenological categories and makes extensive and significant points [with regard to all these three topics], the exegesis that follows accords with that tradition.

As for the meaning of the term “psycho-physical aggregate,” the Tibetan phung po corresponds to the Sanskrit skandha, a synonym of rāśi,[32] conveying the sense of a “collection” (tshogs pa) or “heap” (spungs pa). The “aggregates” are so called either because they function as heaps of multiple phenomena, partaking of a common class, or because they bundle together all the distinctive attributes of their [respective classes].

As is said in a sūtra:[34]
O monks! The compulsively accrued aggregate of physical forms (rūpopadānaskandha) is so called because [matter] exists materially (rūpaṇa), and [therefore] is capable of assuming [visible] physical forms (rūpya).
The Compendium [of Phenomenology] adds:[35]
It exists materially through physical contact (sparśarūpaṇā), and it exists materially through sensory localization (viṣayarūpaṇā).
[The former] refers to unprecedented changes that occur through the contact of physical objects (rūpin), as when, for example, a hand touches a flower and the attributes of that [flower] begin to wither. [The latter] refers to the sensa of physical form (rūpākāra) arising as mental objects.[36]

Derivative matter refers to that which derives from the four primary elements, acting as the causal basis. Among its particular aspects, there is the clear and sensitive matter (ādhyātmakarūpa, nang gi gzugs dang ba) [of the eyes], which is the support or possessive condition of visual consciousness. Similarly, there is the clear and sensitive matter [of the ears, nose, tongue, and body], which are respectively the supports or possessive conditions of auditory consciousness, olfactory consciousness, gustatory consciousness, and tactile consciousness. The five [gross] sense organs, including the eyes, also originate respectively from the corresponding aspects of these seeds, based upon the substratum [consciousness] (ālaya, kun gzhi).[38]
The term “clear” (accha/svaccha, dang ba) here refers to the apperception (prativid., rnam par rig pa) that arises when the clear sense organs perceive their [respective] objects on the basis of visual forms, sounds, and so forth, just as reflected images arise on a clear mirror, contingent on the actual forms that it reflects.[39]

First, with reference to those visual forms which are the sense objects of the eye, the following twenty-five [aspects] have been distinctly enumerated: blueness, yellowness, redness, whiteness, longness, shortness, squareness, roundness, subtle particles, coarse particles, evenness, unevenness, highness, lowness, shadow, sun, light, darkness, cloud, smoke, dust, mist, [atmospheric] forms that are widespread and spacious (abhiyavakāśikarūpa, mngon par skabs yod kyi gzugs), apperceived [but intangible] forms (vijñaptirūpa, rnam par rig byed kyi gzugs), and monochrome sky (nam mkha' kha dog gcig pa).[40]
When these attributes are classified according to their defining characteristics [and so forth], they are explained according to six categories,[41] and when these are further reduced, they comprise the following four categories: (1) visual forms differentiated on the basis of color, including blueness, redness, etc.; (2) visual forms differentiated on the basis of shape, including squareness and roundness, etc.; (3) visual forms differentiated on the basis of appearance, including [atmospheric] forms that are widespread and spacious, exemplified by luminosity in the sky; and (4) visual forms differentiated by circumstances, including apperceived [but intangible] forms, which may be perceived on the basis of other, past impulses (samutthāna, kun slong), such as when the body is in motion, bending, rising, or sitting, or when the hands are doing something.
Among them, in this [tradition],[42] [phenomena belonging to] the [last] category, visual forms designated according to circumstances, are considered to be imputed existents (prajñaptitaḥ, btags yod), whereas both the pious attendants and the hermit buddhas hold them to be substantial existents (dravyataḥ, rdzas yod).[43]
Alternatively, [these twenty-five aspects of visual form] may be subsumed within the following four categories: positive, negative, neutral, and colorful.[44]

Second, with reference to the classification of sounds (śabda, sgra), the following eleven types have been distinctly enumerated: (1-3) pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral [sounds]; (4-6) sounds produced through the cause of the primary elements, which are either organic (upāttamahābhūtabetukaśabda, zin pa'i 'byung ba las gyur ba'i sgra) [such as human sounds], or inorganic (anupāttamahābhūtahetukaśabda, ma zin pa'i 'byung ba las gyur ba'i sgra) [such as rustling trees], or both [such as the sound of a musical instrument]; (7-9) sounds that are known in the world, or demonstrated by accomplished spiritual masters, or imagined; and (10-11) sounds that are designated as originating from sublime beings (ārya, 'phags pa) and from those who are not sublime.
These [eleven] are also explained to be subsumed into four categories, including [sounds] that are differentiated on the basis of their advantages and disadvantages (phan gnod kyis phye ba);[45] but when all these are further reduced, they comprise the following [three categories]: (1) the three types of sound differentiated on the basis of the feelings they evoke, namely, pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral sounds; (2.) the three types of sound differentiated on the basis of whether they are produced organically or inorganically, such as melodies which are organically produced, the sound of water which is inorganically produced, and the beating of a drum by a human being which is both [organically and inorganically produced]; and (3) the five types of sound differentiated on the basis of imputed symbols and conventions, namely, (i) terms that are imputed or designated by worldly [conventions], such as “vase” and “blanket”; (ii) terms that are expressed by accomplished spiritual masters, such as “emptiness” (stong pa nyid) and “selflessness” (bdag med); (iii) terms that are imagined by extremists and the like, such as “creator” (byed po) and “consumer” (za bo); (iv) terms that are designated by sublime beings, such as “purification” (vyavadāna, rnam byang); and (v) terms that have been designated by beings who are not sublime, such as the jargon employed by worldly folk.[46]

It is explained that these [twenty-two types of tangible sensation] may also be subsumed within six categories, including tangible sensations that are based on touch (āmarśanasthita, kun tu brnabs pas bzhag pa) and so forth.[52] Then, when these are further reduced, they comprise (1) tangible sensations differentiated on the basis of mutual contact or interaction, namely, those of softness, roughness, and so forth; (2) tangible sensations differentiated on the basis of whether the outer and inner elements are balanced or imbalanced, namely, those of warmth, coldness, hunger, thirst, and so forth; and (3) tangible sensations differentiated on the basis of circumstances, namely, those of faintness, itchiness, and so forth.[53]

The classification of those [forms constituting the sensory activity field of phenomena] is fivefold, starting with [atomic] forms that are extremely [small and] concentrated (ābhisaṃkṣepikarūpa, bsdus pa las gyur pa'i gzugs). Altogether they are enumerated as follows:
(1) the forms that are extremely [small and] concentrated, such as indivisible atomic particles (paramāṇu, rdul phra rab), which appear as the objects of mental consciousness (manovijñāna, yid shes)
(1) the forms that are widespread and spacious, such as atmospheric phenomena, which appear to mental consciousness [but not to visual consciousness]
(3) the forms that derive from genuine meditative commitment (sāmā-dānikarūpa, yang dag par blangs pa las byung ba), such as uninterrupted [visualized] forms (āyantikarūpa, gtan du ba'i gzugs) [indicative of spiritual progress], appearing in the mind that has genuinely assumed [monastic or spiritual] vows and achieved renunciation. These are also called “non-apperceived forms” (avijñaptirūpa, rnam par rig byed ma yin pa'i gzugs) because they arc imperceptible to others with different motivations
(4) the forms that are imagined (parikalpitarūpa, kun brtags pa'i gzugs), such as the skeleton that appears [in the mind while practicing] the meditative stability on impure phenomena (aśucisamādhi, mi gstang ba'i ting nge 'dzin)[55]
(5) the forms that derive from supernormal powers (vaibhutvikarūpa, dbang 'byor ba'i gzugs), such as the form of the earth element that derives from the meditative stability of the all-consuming earth element (zad par sa'i ting nge 'dzin). These are also called “images that appear within the perceptual range of meditative stability” (ting nge 'dzin gyi spyod yul gzugs brnyan[56]
There are also many other ways in which [forms] may be classified. For example, there is a threefold classification into [forms] that are (1) revealed and obstructed (sanidarśanasapratigha, bstan yod thogs bcas); (1) unrevealed and obstructed (anidarśanasapratigha, bstan med thogs bcas); and (3) unrevealed and unobstructed (anidarśanāpratigha, bstan med thogs med).[57]
And, there is a twofold classification into [forms] that are organically retained (upāttasaṃkṣipta, zin pas bsdus pa) and those that are unretained (anupāttasaṃkṣipta, zin pa ma yin pas bsdus pa);[58] or into forms with a shared support (sabhāga, rten mtshungs) and forms resembling those with a shared support (tatsabhāga,, de'i mtshungs kyi gzugs).[59]

First, the sixfold classification is as follows: (1) physical feelings or sensations originating in affinity with the five types of sensory consciousness, each of which includes feelings of pleasure, pain, and neutrality; (2) mental feelings originating in affinity with mental consciousness; (3) disturbed feelings originating in affinity with attachment to self, which is dependent on the five compulsively acquired psycho-physical aggregates; (4) undisturbed feelings acting as an actual antidote for the [aforementioned attachment]; (5) feelings associated with greed, originating in affinity with attachment to the objects of the five senses; and (6) feelings dependent on renunciation which function as an actual antidote for the [aforementioned greed].[61]
The latter is the fivefold classification, comprising (1) sensual happiness which has affinity with the five types of sensory consciousness; (2) mental happiness which has affinity with mental consciousness; (3) physical pain which has affinity with [the five types of] sensory consciousness; (4) mental unhappiness which has affinity with mental consciousness; and (5) equanimity that is free from both happiness and sorrow.

What, in general, you may ask, are the defining characteristics of mind (citta, sems) and mental states (sems byung, caitasika)? Mind comprises the eight modes of consciousness (rnam shes tshogs brgyad), and objectively refers to its given range of objects.[66] As such, its perceptual range is the essential nature of [a given] object, i. e., the supporting substance, exemplified by a visual form or sound. Mental states comprise fifty-one aspects such as feeling (vedanā, tshor ba), and objectively refer to their given range of objects.[67] As such, their perceptual range comprises the distinguishing attributes of [a given] object, i. e., the supported qualities, exemplified by states of happiness and suffering, or moods that are pleasant and unpleasant. Therefore, it is said in the Analysis of the Middle and Extremes that mind perceives the essential nature of its [given] object and mental states perceive the distinguishing attributes of their [given] object.[68]

It is explained in [Vasubandhu's Dissertation on] the Five Psycho-physical Aggregates and in its Commentary composed by Sthiramati,[69] that the central mind and its peripheral mental states have a natural concomitance that is acquired through five unrelated factors. That is to say, mental states adhere to mind through their five concomitant characteristics (pañcasamprayuktaka, mtshungs ldan rnam pa lnga), starting from their [concomitance of] location or support, and continuing through their [concomitance of] objective referent, their [concomitance of] sensum, their [concomitance of] time, and their [concomitance of] substance.[70]
Among these, first, concomitance of support (āśrayasamprayukta, rten mtshungs) means that both the central [mind] and peripheral [mental states] are dependent on a single sense organ. For example, when visual consciousness depends on the sense organ of the eye, its peripheral feelings or sensations also depend on that identical [sense organ].
Second, concomitance of objective referent (ālambanasamprayukta, dmigs mtshungs) means that [both the mind and its mental states] refer to an identical object. For example, when visual consciousness refers to a visual form, [the peripheral] feelings or sensations also refer to that [identical object].
Third, concomitance of sensum (ākārasamprayukta, rnam pa mtshungs) means that [both the mind and its mental states] share an identical sensum in the course of sensory apprehension. For example, when the sensum of blueness arises in visual consciousness, that [identical sensum] also arises in respect of [the peripheral] feelings or sensations.
Fourth, concomitance of time (kālasamprayukta, dus mtshungs) means that [both the mind and its mental states] are active instantaneously. For example, whenever visual consciousness is active, [the peripheral] feelings or sensations are also active [in that same instant].
Fifth, concomitance of substance (dravyasamprayukta, rdzas mtshungs) means that [both the mind and its mental states] are of similar class and are identical in number. For example, if visual consciousness refers to a single substance, [the peripheral] feelings or sensations also refer only to a single substance.[71]
The rejection of doubt with regard to [certain apparent] contradictions concerning the concomitance of sensum and time, and so forth, are not discussed here, and these points should therefore be understood from [other] texts.[72]

If one were to ask whether mind and mental states are of a single substance or different, [Santaraksita, ] who is uniquely called “Bodhisattva” and so forth, along with the glorious Dharmakīrti, hold that both [mind and mental states] are of a single substance, while the master Candrakīrti holds that they are different.[73] Although such [opinions] are found, according to this tradition [of Higher Abhidharma], the sublime Asaṅga suggests that there would be six defects [if mind and mental states were identical in substance]. He disagrees [with this standpoint], stating, for example, that if mind and mental states were not different in substance, the definitive order of the five psycho-physical aggregates would not hold.[74] Therefore, we should follow his position.
[At the same time, ] he also states that although they are different, this is with reference to material things. It is hard to investigate this remark in detail because he did not elaborate, and yet one should know that this [distinction between material and immaterial phenomena is understood] dependant on both scriptural authority grounded in conviction and logical reasoning, as when the sense organs focus upon sensitive [inner] forms [which are not objects of external sense perception].[75]

Here we shall examine how the eight modes of consciousness, subdivided into three groupings, give rise to specific categories among the fifty-one mental states:[76]
[First,] the so-called “five ever-present mental states” (pañcasarvatraga, kun 'gro lnga) arise within the periphery of the substratum [consciousness] (ālayavijñāna, kun gzhti rnam par shes pa).[77]
[Second,] these five, along with four of the six primary dissonant mental states (sadmūlakleśa, rtsa nyong drug)—namely, desire or attachment, pride, ignorance, and views concerning mundane aggregates—and six of the [twenty] subsidiary dissonant mental states (viṃsatyopakleśa, nye nyon nyi shu)—namely, distraction, carelessness, mental agitation, faithlessness, indolence, and dullness—all arise within the periphery of the dissonant mental consciousness (kliṣṭamanovijñāna, nyon yid kyi rnam par shes pa). The other [primary and secondary dissonant mental states] do not arise here because they are essentially dissimilar and lack the [requisite] concomitances of objective referent, sensum, and so forth.[78]
[Third,] in the case of the engaged modes of consciousness (pravṛttivijñāna, 'jug pa'i rnam shes), there are two sorts [of mental process]: one in which the conditions are only simulated, as when visual forms are involuntarily perceived, and the other in which the mind has precedence, as when they are voluntarily perceived. In this regard, only the five ever-present mental states arise within the periphery of the former [involuntary or passive consciousness] because if the other [mental] states were to manifest therein, there would be no such thing as blindness, for example.

In the case of the latter [voluntary or active consciousness], there are twenty-three [mental states] which may arise within the periphery of the five sense consciousnesses (pañcadvāravijñāna, sgo lnga rnam shes) when they are engaged in virtuous actions, namely, the first twenty-one [of the fifty-one] mental states, along with [the last two], ideation and scrutiny. There are also twenty-five [mental states] which may arise within the periphery of those [five sensory modes of consciousnesses] when they are engaged in defiled actions, namely, the first ten, the “three poisons” among the six primary dissonant mental states, and the last group of ten subsidiary dissonant mental states, along with ideation and scrutiny. In addition, there are twelve [mental states] that may arise within the periphery of [those five modes of sensory consciousness] when they are engaged in unspecified or indeterminate actions, namely, the first ten along with [the last two], ideation and scrutiny.
Furthermore, there are twenty-five [mental states] that may arise within the periphery of mental consciousness (manovijñāna, yid kyi rnam par shes pa) when it is engaged in virtuous actions, namely, the first twenty-one and the four variable mental states, which all pertain to the world-system of desire. However, all the mental states, with the exception of the eleven virtuous ones (dge ba bcu grig) may arise within the periphery of that [same mental consciousness] when it is engaged in defiled actions, while [only] the first ten and the last four may arise within its periphery when it is engaged in unspecified or indeterminate actions.
In brief, all [fifty-one] mental states arise according to their respective circumstances. The reasons why they do so can be known through investigation, starting with the defining characteristics of each of them in turn.[79]

In general, with regard to the determination of things that are substantial existents (dravyataḥ, rdzas yod) and those that are imputed existents (prajñaptitaḥ, btags yod), the scriptures consider things to be substantially existent when they are causally effective (arthakriyāsamartha, don byed nus pa), proven through reason (rigs pas grub pa), continuous (rgyun brtan pa), and autonomous (rang rkya thub pa).
Among these four criteria, here [in this tradition of Higher Abhidharma], only the last [autonomy] can determine whether things are substantially existent. An autonomous object is exemplified by something that arises as an intrinsic object-universal (svārthasāmānya, kho'i don spyi) and is not dependent on the arising of an extraneous object-universal (anyārthasāmānya, gzhan gyi don spyi).[80]
However, in other [traditions], all [mental states] may be implicitly established as substantial existents on the basis of their causal effectiveness and reasoned proof, while the [mental state known as] “mundane view” or “view of mundane aggregates” (satkāyadṛṣṭi, 'jig tshogs la lta ba) may even be implicitly established as a substantial existent on the basis of its enduring continuity.[81]
Similarly, there are also four criteria in respect of imputed existents. Among them, existents imputed on the basis of circumstances are exemplified by [mental states] disassociated with the mind (cittaviprayuktacaitasika). Existents imputed through exaggeration, while not actually existing, are exemplified by [the concepts of] “self” and the “horns of a hare.” Existents imputed through extraneous [labeling] are exemplified by [the concept of] a “vase.” However, existents imputed through their parts are the fragments of the phenomena which are the basis of their designation and these, [being valid,] are not to be rejected.
Accordingly, the master Sthiramati has explained that [a mental state] which has its intrinsic continuity independently established is a substantial existent, while one that does not is an imputed existent.[82]

In this regard, [the mental states that are classed] as substantial existents are twenty-two in number, including the first two groups of five, along with seven [of the eleven] wholesome mental states (kuśalacaitasika, dge ba'i sems byung), with the exception of non-delusion, vigilance, equanimity, and non-violence, and five [of the six primary] dissonant mental states, with the exception of [wrong] view. This is because they are autonomous and not dependent on other [object-universals].
[The mental states that are classed] as imputed existents are twenty-nine in number, including the four remaining wholesome mental states, along with [wrong] view [among the six primary dissonant mental states], the twenty subsidiary dissonant mental states, and the four variable mental states (gzhan 'gyur bzhi). This is because, in their essential nature, they turn the mind towards its object and are [therefore] dependent on specific phenomena which are the basis of their designation.[83]
In brief, as explained above, these [categories of] substantial and imputed existents are each determined on the basis of four criteria, among which, in this tradition [of Higher Abhidharma], it is maintained that substantial existents are autonomous and imputed existents are partial or incomplete.
The exact number and the sequence [of the mental states] is established on the basis of supposition, and is not precise. Therefore, in the Minor Transmissions (Kṣudrāgama), the mental states are numbered fifty-seven, while in the texts of the mantra [traditions], other sources give other figures, exemplified by the eighty natural [states of conceptual thought] ([kun rtog gi] rangbzhin brgyad cu).[84] However, all of them are designated as “mental states” (caitasika, sems byung) because they are contingent on the mind and arise from the mind, or because they emerge from the mind and emerge dependent upon the mind, or else because they are modifications of the mind, just as the ripples of a river are modifications of the river. Since they emerge immediately in the manner of the sound of a conch shell and the flames of a fire, there is no need [to state] even that they emerge [in a subsequent moment] respectively from their homogeneous classes (sajātīya, rigs 'dra las 'byung ba).[85]

It is explained in [ Vasubandhu's] Thirty Verses that:[86]
Feeling, perception, volition, contact, and attention Are the five ever-present mental states.
Among [the five ever-present mental states (pañcasarvatraga, kun 'gro lnga)] (1) feeling (vedanā, tshor ba) and (2) perception (saṃjñā, 'du shes) are both similar in their essential nature to the corresponding aggregates, apart from [certain] general and particular distinctions. The reason for these two having to be additionally included among the mental states is that they are the roots of disputation, foremost among the causal bases [of the continuity] of cyclic existence—feeling is the basis on which the laity engage in disputations concerning sentiments of happiness and sorrow, while perception is the basis on which renunciant monks engage in disputations concerning different views. (3) Volition (cetanā, sems pa) is a modification of the mind, occurring in the circumstances when the mind is propelled towards its object. (4) Contact (sparśa, reg pa) is the imposition or confirmation of [certain] modifications of the sense faculties [through the preclusion of others], in conformity with feelings of happiness and sorrow, whenever sense objects, faculties, and consciousness interact. (3) Attention (manaskāra, yid byed) is the apprehension of details, through which the mind focuses repeatedly on its object.[87]
If any one of these five [ever-present mental states] is absent, the process through which the mind focuses on its object will be incomplete. They are designated as “ever-present” because they shadow all aspects of consciousness assumed by the central mind, compounded by [all sentient beings within] the three world-systems.[88]

Among [these five object-determining mental states (pañcaviṣayaniyata, yul nges lnga)], (6) will (chanda, 'dun pa) is the striving towards a conceived objective; (7) resolve (adhimokṣa, mos pa) is the focusing exclusively on an ascertained object; (8) mindfulness (smṛti, dran pa) is the non-forgetting of an object with which one has experience or familiarity; (9) meditative stability (samādhi, ting nge 'dzin) is the one-pointed mental focus on an object to be investigated, such as the coarse and quiescent [objects of higher insight][90] and the four truths;[91] and (10) discriminative awareness (prajñā, shes rab) is the analysis of specific and general defining characteristics.[92]
These are all designated as “object-determining mental states” because they determine their objects, which are [respectively] conceived, ascertained, experienced, and investigated, without the mind grasping anything apart from these objects.

It is said in the Thirty Verses:[93]
Faith, conscience, shame, non-attachment, non-hatred, non-delusion, Perseverance, refinement, vigilance, equanimity, and non-violence: These eleven are wholesome mental states.
As for [these eleven wholesome mental states (ekadaśakuśalacaitasika, dge ba'i sems byung bcu gcig)], (11) faith (śraddhā, dad pa) has three qualities— conviction, serenity, and eagerness; (12) conscience (hrī, ngo tsha shes pa) is the means of avoiding inadmissible or censurable offences with reference to oneself; (13) shame (apatrāpya, khrel yod) is the means of avoiding those [offences] with reference to others; (14) non-attachment (alobha, ma chags pa) is the manifest absence of clinging to the five psycho-physical aggregates, which are compulsively acquired, and to mundane resources; (15) non-hatred (adveṣa, zhe sdang med pa) is the absence of enmity with regard to inimical objects; (16) non-delusion (amoha, gti mug med pa) is the absence of delusion with regard to the practices that are to be adopted and those that are to be rejected; (17) perseverance (vīrya,, brtson 'grus) is the non-relaxation of enthusiasm for virtuous actions; (18) refinement (praśrabdhi, shin sbyangs) is the ability of the mind to engage its object of reference with physical and mental malleability; (19) vigilance (apramāda, bag yod) is the means of protecting the mind against things that are corrupt and of meditating on things that are virtuous; (10) equanimity (upekṣā, btang snyoms) is the means of abiding effortlessly in sameness when absorbed in meditative equipoise (samasaṃsthāpa) without being submerged by mental dullness, agitation, and so forth; (21) non-violence (ahiṃsa, mi 'tshe ba) is the means of not harming others owing to the [presence of] the minds compassionate aspect.[94]
These [eleven] are all designated as “wholesome mental states” and established as virtuous phenomena, ensuring that a pleasant ripening [result] will emerge through the appropriate ethical practices. As such, they are the causal bases [of virtuous conduct], [collectively] named according to their fruitional effect.

<d e="2">
[According to the Thirty Verses:[95] ]
Desire, anger, pride, ignorance, doubt and [wrong] view Are the six primary dissonant mental states.
As for [these six primary dissonant mental states (sadmūlakleśa, rtsa nyon drug)] (22) desire (rāga, 'dod chags) is attachment to the abodes, physical bodies, and resources associated with the three world-systems; (23) hostility (pratigha, khong khro) is a state of total enmity or malevolence, entailing (a) a sentient being intent on inflicting harm, (b) suffering, which is the [actual] harm inflicted, and (c) poisoning, weapons, and so forth, which are the harmful conditions; (24) pride (māna, nga rgyal) is an exalted attitude (cittasyonnatiḥ) imbued with conceit and dependent on [wrong] views concerning mundane aggregates; (25) ignorance (avidyā, ma rig pa) can include both delusion with respect to the nature of reality and delusion with respect to the meaning of the four truths, and in this context it refers to the latter; (26) doubt (vicikitsā, the tshom) [can be understood] on many levels, but in this context it refers to hesitation and uncertainty with respect to the [four] truths, as well as to past actions and their results.[96]
Among these, pride also has seven subsidiary aspects (saptamāna), namely,
(1) conceited pride (ahaṃkāramāna, khengs pa'i nga rgyal), thinking of oneself and those of similar talents as peers; (2) exalted pride (adhimāna, che ba'i nga rgyal), thinking that one is superior to one's peers; (3) exaggerated pride (mānātimāna, nga rgyal las kyang nga rgyal), thinking that one surpasses even the self that exhibits exalted pride; (4) egotistical pride (asmimāna, nga'o snyam pa'i nga rgyal), exemplified by holding the view that the psychophysical aggregates are endowed with a “self”; (5) manifest pride (abhimāna, mngon pa'i nga rgyal), thinking that one has acquired qualifications that one has not [actually] acquired; (6) perverse pride (mithyāmāna, 'dzin pa log pa'i nga rgyal), holding that one is talented when one is actually untalented; and
(7) slight pride (ūnamāna, cung zad snyam pa'i nga rgyal), thinking that one is [only] slightly lower than extraordinarily sublime beings.[97]

The essential nature of negative viewpoints or wrong views is fivefold, comprising (1) mundane views (satkāyadṛṣṭi, 'jig lta), (2.) extreme views (antadṛṣṭi, mthar lta), and so forth. The latter additionally include (3) adherence to the supremacy of wrong views (dṛṣṭiparāmarśa, lta ba mchog dzin), (4) adherence to the supremacy of ethical and ascetic disciplines (śīlavrataparāmarśa, tshul khrims dang brtul zhugs mchog 'dzin), and (5) heterodox views (mithyāyadṛṣṭi, log par lta ba).[98]
Among these five, concerning the first [mundane views], this comprises the views that regard the five compulsively acquired psycho-physical aggregates, which are composites of many perishable and impermanent [phenomena], as an [imperishable and permanent] “self” and as properties of an [imperishable and permanent] “self” Such viewpoints may be instinctive or imaginary—in the former case they may occur in all sorts of [conventional] circumstances where sentient beings entertain the thought of the first person singular, and in the latter case they refer to the views derived from poor spiritual advisors, such as the foremost of [non-Buddhist] extremists, who maintain that there is a permanent self existing independently of the psycho-physical aggregates.
Concerning the second, extreme views include the views that the self [falsely] apprehended by means of the [aforementioned] mundane view is either eternal or self-annihilating [at death].
As for the third [adherence to the supremacy of wrong view], this is attachment to the notion that mundane view, extreme view, and false view—these three, along with the psycho-physical aggregates, which are their subject-matter—are supreme and genuine.
As for the fourth [adherence to the supremacy of ethical and ascetic discipline], this is the view that poor ethical and ascetic discipline in pursuit of an inferior and poor objective are pure and conducive to liberation [from cyclic existence].
Then, as for the fifth, heterodox views are those which deny causes and results, along with the [four] truths, the [three] precious jewels, and so forth.
[Among these five kinds of view, ] the first four are exaggerated viewpoints, while the last is largely one of deprecation.

Four views of eternalism, four views of partial eternalism,
Two views of fortuitous origination, four views of finitude,
And four views of equivocation regarding finitude.
There are also forty-two extreme views in respect of [speculations about] the limits of future time (aparānta, phyi mtha'), comprising[101]
Sixteen views on percipient [immortality],
Eight views on non-percipient [immortality],
Eight views on neither percipient nor non-percipient [immortality],

<d e="2">
There are also fourteen indeterminate or unspecified views (caturdaśāvyākṛta-vastudṛṣṭi, lung ma bstan gyi lta ba bcu bzhi). These include the view that the Tathāgata continues to exist after passing into [final] nirvana, which is said to be a deluded view, other than the truth; and similarly the views that he does not continue to exist, that he both continues and does not continue to exist, and that he neither continues nor does not continue to exist. Thus there are four [unspecified] views with reference to [his] attainment of [final] nirvana.
This subcategory also includes four extreme views with reference to future lives, namely, that the self and the world are finite, infinite, both, or neither; as well as four extreme views with reference to past lives, namely, that the self and the world are eternal, not eternal, both eternal and not eternal, and neither eternal nor not eternal. The first position in each of these distinct tetralemmas represents the eternalist view of the Sāṃkhya. The second position in each tetralemma represents the nihilist view of the Lokāyatika. The third position in each tetralemma represents the view of the Nirgrantha Jains that nature (prakṛti) is permanent and its actual circumstances impermanent. The fourth position in each of the tetralemmas represents the view of the Vātsīputrīya that nothing at all can be expressed with regard to permanence and impermanence.[103]
In addition, [this subcategory] also includes the view that the vitality or life-force is to be identified with the physical body, and the view that the vitality or life-force and the physical body are independent of one another.
Thus there are [two standpoints] with reference to the physical body and its vitality. The former represents the view of the Naiyāyika and the latter the view of the Sāṃkhya.
These fourteen standpoints are designated as “unspecified or indeterminate views” because when the transcendent lord [Buddha] was asked about them, he said, “Starting from the [concept of] selfwith regard to individual persons, one may know how to speculate [about these matters] but they cannot be established. Therefore, it is not right to investigate these points particularly, and I will not do so!” For this reason, his enlightened intention was not swayed in that direction, and these [speculations] were deemed to be indeterminate or unspecified.[104]

The twenty listed here, from inattentiveness backwards, are consistently classed as subsidiary dissonant mental states (upakleśa, nye bar nyon mongs), while the [last] four—regret, drowsiness, ideation, and scrutiny—partake of some circumstances when they are dissonant and others when they are not, for which reason, when they do so, they are included alongside the subsidiary dissonant mental states.
Now, with regard to the first of the twenty that are consistently considered to be subsidiary dissonant mental states: (28) Anger (krodha, khro ba) is the inability to tolerate harmful [thoughts or deeds]. (29) Enmity (upanāha, 'khon 'dzin) deposits harmful [thoughts] in the mind. (30) Hypocrisy (mrakṣa, 'chab pa) is the concealment of one's own inadmissible faults. (31) Annoyance (pradāśa, 'tshig pa) is the desire to utter harsh words, preceded by anger and enmity. (31) Jealousy (īrṣyā, phrag dog) is the inability to tolerate the excellence of another. (33) Miserliness (mātsarya, ser sna) is not daring to use one's own resources. (34) Deceit (māyā, sgyu) is the physical or verbal fabrication one employs with an intention to deceive others. (35) Pretentiousness (śāṭhya, gYo) is the [deliberate] misrepresentation of one's own faults whenever they are seen or heard.

(36) Self-satisfaction (mada, rgyags pa) is the obsession of those in the prime of life, and so forth, with their own prosperity and prestige. It entails attachment to one's own talents, in contrast to “pride,” which entails conceit with regard to the talents of others. (37) Violence (vihiṃsa, rnam par 'tshe ba) is the permitting of oneself or others to engage in acts of killing, beating, and so forth. (38) Lack of conscience (āhrikya, ngo tsha med pa) is the non-avoidance of wrong-doing with regard to oneself. (39) Shamelessness (anapatrāpya, khrel med pa) is the non-avoidance of wrong-doing with regard to others. (40) Dullness (styāna, rrnugs pa) is the lack of malleability in the mind with regard to its objects or sensa. (41) Mental agitation (auddhatya, rgod pa) is the reverting [of the mind] to previously encountered sense objects. (42) Faithlessness (aśraddhya, ma dad pa) is an absence of eagerness due to lack of conviction in virtuous teachings or wholesome phenomena. (43) Indolence (kausīdya, le lo) is the attachment to inferior activities and the lack of enthusiasm for wholesome phenomena. (44) Carelessness (pramāda, bag med) is the means of not protecting the mind [from corruption], permitting it to run carefree. (45) Forgetfulness (muṣitasmṛtitā, brjed ngas pa) is the lack of clarity and repeated loss of memory with respect to virtuous objects of reference. (46) Distraction (vikṣepa, gYeng ba) is the fascination of the mind for any objects associated with the three poisons. It has six aspects: natural distraction (svabhāvavikṣepa, ngo bo nyid kyi gYeng ba), exemplified by the consciousnesses of the five senses; external distraction (bahirdhāvikṣepa, phyi rol du gYeng ba), which, is consciousness engaging its sense objects; internal distraction (adhyātmavikṣepa, nang gi gYeng ba), which occurs in the context of the mental dullness and agitation experienced when one savors meditative stability; the distraction of symbolism (nimittavikṣepa, mtshan ma'i gYeng ba), which is the practice of the [sacred] teachings for the sake of the eight [worldly] concerns;[107] distraction due to adverse circumstances (dauṣṭhulyavikṣepa, gnas ngan len gyi gYeng ba), which is craving for the happiness associated with physical and mental refinement; and distraction due to mental attention (manasikāravikṣepa, yid la byed pa'i rnam gYeng), which occurs when the mind, without having completed its engagement in one object of reference, engages in another. (47) Inattentiveness (asaṃprajanya, shes bzhin ma yin pa) refers to the mental processes of the afflicted discriminative awareness that inappropriately scrutinizes states [of non-virtue] that are to be rejected and those [states of virtue] that are to be adopted.[108]
All of these are established as the [six] primary and [twenty] subsidiary or lesser dissonant mental states.

With regard to these four, which are mentioned at the end of the aforementioned passage quoted from the Thirty Verses, (48) regret (kaukṛtya, 'gyod pa) refers to the subsequent thought of remorse in respect of an action that one has previously undertaken; (49) drowsiness (middha, gnyid pa) occurs when the six modes of the engaged consciousness (satpravṛttivijñāna, 'jug pa'i sems drug) are internally absorbed; (50) ideation (vitarka, rtog pa) refers to the [process of] coarse [mental] engagement with the phenomena characterized as formative predispositions; and (51) scrutiny (vicāra, dpyod pa) refers to the [process of] subtle mental engagement [with regard to the same phenomena].[109]
These four are all designated as “variable mental states” (gzhan 'gyur bzhi) because their application varies according to circumstances and they are unspecified in terms of wholesome and unwholesome [phenomena], without being limited to one or the other. They may be exemplified by the negativity that ensues when one regrets virtuous actions, the virtue that ensues when one regrets negative actions, the negativity that ensues when one becomes drowsy while focusing on virtuous actions, and the virtue that ensues when one becomes drowsy while focusing on negative actions.

This category [of formative predispositions] is designated as “disassociated” (viprayukta, mi ldan pa) because they do not, like mental states, partake of [the aforementioned] circumstances where the mind engages with its object of reference through the five concomitant characteristics (pañcasamprayuktaka, mtshungs ldan rnam pa lnga).[110] They are nonetheless designated as “formative predispositions” (saṃskāra, 'du byed) because they partake of predisposed circumstances.[111]
In this regard, Upa Losal[112] and others have held that these refer to circumstances other than physical form, mind, and mental states. As for [the opinion of] most [masters] of the past, Karma Trinlepa II[113] says that
There is nothing other than physical form, mind, and mental states, but the designations that are imputed with regard to the circumstantial factors cannot be described as being either the same as or other than physical form, mind, and mental states. That is to say, they are neither established as any distinct substance apart from the triad of physical form and so on, which are the basis of their designation, nor [can they be considered to be] distinguishing counterparts (vyatireka, ldog pa) of those three kinds of entity, physical form and the like. They resemble, for example, a fist that cannot be described as identical with or anything other than its fingers.[114]

In this regard, there are various extant enumerations and sequences, such as in the Sūtra That Reveals the Ten Abodes, where it is stated that there are seven hundred formative predispositions disassociated [with mind and mental states], and in the [Dissertation on] the Five Psycho-physical Aggregates, which presents a different account.[115]
However, when these are subsumed principally in accordance with the Higher Abhidharma [of the Compendium of Phenomenology, the following twenty-three formative predispositions are enumerated]:[116]
(1) Acquisition (prāpti, thob pa) is an imputed existent referring to the [particular or qualitative] circumstances of which all formative predispositions partake, including wholesome and unwholesome phenomena, although the Vaibhasika regard it as a substantial existent.[117]
(2) The meditative absorption devoid of perception (asaṃjñīsamāpatti, 'du shes med pa'i snyoms 'jug) is characterized as the cessation of the six modes of consciousness, which are non-stable conditions of mind and its mental states, by relying on the state of mind associated with the attainment phase of the fourth meditative concentration.[118]
(3) The meditative absorption of cessation (nirodhasamāpatti, 'gog pa'i snyoms 'jug) is characterized as the cessation of the six modes of consciousness, which are non-stable conditions of mind and its mental states, along with the dissonant mental consciousness which is their stable condition. This occurs when a sublime [practitioner] of the Lesser Vehicle, who has mastered calm abiding—his mind reaching the summit of existence—and higher insight, relies on whatever uncorrupted discriminative awareness is present in the mind-stream.[119]

<d e="2">
(4) The state of non-perception (āsaṃjñika, 'du shes med pa) is characterized as the cessation of directly evident innate feelings and perceptions, deriving from the mind that has attained the fourth meditative concentration. This is a particular [attribute of] Great Fruition (bṛhatphala, 'bras bu che), a distinct abode associated with the fourth meditative concentration. This refers to the abode of the so-called “long-living gods” (dīrghāyuṣadeva, lha tshe ring po), who lack the leisure [to engage effectively in Buddhist practice] because they maintain a false view that deprecates [the possibility of attaining] release [from cyclic existence] at the time of their death, [knowing that] they would die and transmigrate [away from their exalted state] if perceptions were to arise.[120]
(5) The faculty of the life-force (jīviten'driya, srog gi dbang po) is the very substratum of formative predispositions, sustaining living beings for a fixed period of time, in accordance with their respective classes. As such, it has a time-frame, measured in hundreds or thousands of years, or even lasting as long as an aeon, propelled by the force of the three kinds of deeds, generated in former lives.[121]
(6) Similarity of class or homogeneity (nikāyasabhāga, rigs mthun pa) refers to the sentient beings of the three world-systems and the psycho-physical aggregates through which they apprehend their respective objects. In the world-systems of desire and form, [sentient beings] appear to have a continuum comprising five [aggregates], whereas in the world-system of formlessness they have a continuum comprising four [aggregates]. Alternatively, [similarity of class] indicates the interrelationship of bodily parts belonging to sentient beings who may partake of different classes [gods, humans, etc. ], assuming different physical appearances, and so forth.[122]

(7) Birth (jāti, skye ba) refers to the arising of a [particular] continuum of internal formative predispositions, which precludes [the possibility] of it taking birth in any other form. As such, [this continuum] partakes of a newly emerging [appearance], one that has not previously emerged.[123]
(8) Aging (jarā, rga ba) refers to the distinct transformational and sequential circumstances of which this continuum partakes, from the moment of birth through to the moment of death, including childhood, youth, adult maturity, and old age.
(9) Duration (sthiti, gnas) refers to the period during which this continuum does not perish, starting from birth and ending with death.
(10) Impermanence (anityatā, mi rtag pa) refers to the time of death, when this formerly existing continuum perishes and comes to an end.
(11) Nominal clusters (nāmakāya, ming gi tshogs) are the expressive designations which, although the essential nature of the aggregate of knowable phenomena and the like cannot actually be expressed, nonetheless extrapolate the essential nature of [generic] clusters [of phenomena], such as the eye and ears, or individual beings, such as gods and humans. “Names” are so-called because they are the means through which the intellect symbolically appraises conventional circumstances. “Clusters” are so-called because they combine within them many syllables or many similarities pertaining to their own particular classes.[124]
(12)[125] Phrasal clusters (padakāya, tshig gi tshogs) express [meaning] by extrapolating particularities, even though the particular attributes of phenomena cannot actually be expressed, as in the sentence, “All formative predispositions are impermanent.” “Phrases or words” are so-called because through them particular objects are known. [The designation] “cluster” has already been explained.[126]
(13) Syllabic clusters (vyañjanakāya, yi ge'i tshogs) are the basis [of language] in that both nominal [clusters] and phrasal [clusters] emerge from their interrelated combinations. In this case, “cluster” (tshogs) means that [the syllables] combine minute phonemes or [syllables] of similar [phonetic] class.[127]
(14) The status of an ordinary individual (pṛthagjanatva, so so'i skye bo) refers to birth that is taken among the different distinct classes of living beings under the sway of the individual past actions when one has not obtained the sublime teachings [of Buddhism] that are remote from non-virtuous actions and has not abandoned the seeds of engagement in the three world-systems.[128]

(15) Engagement (pravṛtti, 'jug pa) refers to the process of uninterrupted continuity in respect of the [interrelated] circumstances of causes and results, because this [process] cannot cease, even for an instant.
(16) Distinctive regularity (pratiniyama, so sor nges pa) refers to the ascertainment made in accordance with actual reality (dharmatā, chos nyid) that virtuous and non-virtuous causes are differentiated, and that the results of past actions are also differentiated on the basis of patterns that are wanted and those that are unwanted.
(17) Connection (yoga, 'byor 'brel ba) refers to the rightfully obtained conformity of cause and result, exemplified by the resources that derive from generosity and the discriminative awareness that derives from learning.
(18) Rapidity (java, rngyogs pa) refers to the swift and fluid [succession of] circumstances on the basis of which particular causal results immediately arise and subside.
(19) Sequence (anukrama, go rim) refers to the orderly succession of individual causes and results, from one to the next, which does not emerge spontaneously.
(20) Time (kāla, dus) refers to the process whereby causes and results that have originated and then ceased are [designated as] “past,” those that have not yet originated are [designated as] “future,” and those that have originated but not ceased are [designated as] “present.”
(21) Location (deśa, yul) refers to the [diverse] presence of causes and results subsumed in corporeal beings in all the ten directions [of space].
(22) Number (saṃkhyā, grangs) refers to the separate and distinct enumeration of [all] the formative predispositions, which is made because their differences are incompatible with them numbering only one.
(23) Grouping (sāmagrī, tshogs pa) refers to the combination of all interrelated conditions that pertain to [specific] causes and results, as, for example, in the case of the production of sensory consciousness, when sense objects, sense faculties, and mental attention—these three—are all grouped together.

Among these twenty-three [formative predispositions that are disassociated with mind and mental states, when they are all grouped together]: (1) the first one [acquisition] partakes of circumstances when it will increase and decrease; (2) the second, third, and fourth all partake of an absence of cognizance; (3) the fifth [the faculty of the life-force] partakes of abodes or realms; (4) the sixth partakes of similarity [of class or species]; (5) the four commencing with the seventh partake of the characteristics [of birth, aging, duration, and impermanence]; (6) the three commencing with the eleventh [i. e., nominal, phrasal, and syllabic clusters] partake of conventional terminology; (7) the fourteenth [the status of an ordinary individual] partakes of an absence of [higher spiritual] attainments; and (8) the nine commencing from the fifteenth partake of the circumstances that pertain to causes and their results.
So it is that all these [formative predispositions disassociated with mind and its mental states] are subsumed into eight categories.[129]

It is the case that “mind” (citta, sems), “mentation” (manas, yid), and “consciousness” (vijñāna, rnam par shes pa)—all three—are held by the Vaibhasika and Sautrantika to be “term-universals” (sāmānyaśabda, spyi sgra) correlating with the six modes [of consciousness]. By contrast, the Mādhyamika and Cittamātrin apply them as term-universals correlating with the eight modes [of consciousness] (tshogs brgyad), whether in the context of the ordinary presentation [of mind] or with reference to the widest sense of these terms.[130]
The defining characteristic which these three terms [commonly] share is that they are all [aspects of] mind, apperceiving the essential nature of objects and differentiating the essential nature of their respective referents by means of cognition.
However, when the [mentalist] teachings are emphasized, or when one refers to these three terms in their narrowest possible sense, “mind,” “intellect,” and “consciousness” may be separately applied as follows:[131]
(1) The substratum consciousness (alayavijñāna, kung zhi'i rnam par shes pa) should be exclusively established as “mind” (citta) because (a) it accumulates the [latent] propensities or seeds of all the psycho-physical aggregates, sensory bases, and activity fields; (b) it refers objectively to the diversity [of its maturational propensities]; and (c) it cognizes its objects.
(2) The dissonant mental consciousness (kliṣṭamanovijnāna, nyon yid kyi rnam par shes pa) should be exclusively established as “mentation” (manas) because it is the cognition that at all times is conceited with pride, imposing egotistical thoughts on clear sensory images, for which reason it embodies arrogance and egotism.
(3) The six modes of engaged consciousness (pravṛttivijñāna, 'jug shes tshogs drug) should be exclusively established as “consciousness” (vijñāna) because they clearly refer to diverse particulars, engaging with their distinctive [sense] objects individually. Therefore, it is said in the [Sūtra of the] Dense Array (Ghanavyūhasūtra):[132]
Mind pertains to the substratum consciousness,
Mentation embodies the egotistical mind.
Consciousness is that which apprehends sense objects.

<d e="2">
The ordinary or general definition of the substratum consciousness is that it is the unobscured and unspecified principal mode of consciousness, functioning as the ground from which propensities are actually distributed, cognizing the essential nature of its objects dependent on both its maturational aspects and its seminal aspects.[133]
Among the nuances implied by the term “aspect” (cha) in this context, the definition of the seminal aspect (bījabhāga, sa bon gyi cha) [of the substratum consciousness] is that it denotes the [latent] propensities present within the substratum, while the definition of the maturational aspect (vipākabhāga, rnam smin gyi cha) is that it is the causal condition giving rise to distinct fruitional phenomena. Therefore, the substratum is designated as “that in which seeds are fully ripened or perfumed, dependent on [latent] propensities that have been atemporally present.”[134] In relation to phenomena that will manifest in the future, [the content of the substratum consciousness] is designated as “seminal” or “potential,” and in relation to phenomena that have already manifested, it is designated as “maturational.”[135]
Since both of [these seminal and maturational aspects] are in association with consciousness when it cognizes the essential nature of its objects, [it is] also [said that] the substratum consciousness in fact has three facets [seminal, maturational, and cognitive], which partake of an identical nature.

[More specifically, ] the demonstrations of the seminal aspect [of the substratum consciousness] are found in those imprints of it which are endowed with propensities capable of regenerating the content of the substratum itself, while the demonstrations of the maturational aspect [of the substratum] are found in those imprints of it that are endowed with maturational phenomena that have already been ripened or projected by means of corrupt past actions.

The engagement [of the substratum consciousness] occurs in respect of the external and internal objects which form its objective referent, and takes place exclusively in concomitance with the five ever-present mental states (kun 'gro lnga), [among] the associated mental states.[140]
This process is characterized as an “engagement based on interacting conditions,” in that it depends on the interaction of the substratum consciousness with the engaged consciousness—analogous to the relationship between a structural supporting beam[141] and a building.[142]
Then again, this process may also be [described as] a “concurrent engagement” (sahabhavapravṛtti, lhan cig 'jug pa), implying that
(1) with the exception of the meditative equipoise of cessation, in circumstances in which the mind is inactive, [the engagement] will be concurrent with the dissonant mental consciousness;
(2) whereas, in the [world-system of] formlessness, it will be concurrent with both mentation and the mental consciousness; and
(3) in the [world-system] of desire, it will be conditionally concurrent with all the [other] seven modes [of consciousness].
In this way, the process of engagement is considered to be innately concurrent, regardless of whatever world-system the substratum relates to, whatever the class of sentient beings, whatever feelings are present, and whatever unspecified virtuous or non-virtuous mental states happen to arise. It does not function [merely] “in association with” these [respective levels of existence].[143]
Moreover, this engagement [of the substratum consciousness] is one that persists continuously through [a succession of] births. For, when [the substratum consciousness] pertaining to this [present] life expires, it will be revived by the propensities of past actions (karmavāsanā, las kyi bag chags) and the propensities of the subject-object dichotomy (grāhyagrāhakavāsanā, bzung 'dzin gyi bag chags) and then re-engage as the substratum [consciousness] pertaining to the next life. So, once [this consciousness] has expired, it reengages with the next life, and so on.[144]

The maturational aspect of [the substratum consciousness] will be reversed, according to the tradition of the followers of the Greater Vehicle, immediately after the adamantine meditative stability (vajropamasamādhi, rdo rje lta bu'i ting nge 'dzin) has arisen and [consciousness] is transformed into the mirrorlike pristine cognition (ādarśajñāna, me long lta bu'i ye shes).[145] According to the tradition of the Lesser Vehicle, this reversal occurs when one has attained [the status of] an arhat and the psycho-physical aggregates have all passed into non-residual nirvana (niravaśeṣanirvāṇa, lhag ma med par mya ngan las 'das pa). At that time it is held that the continuity of awareness will also be interrupted.[146]
With regard to the non-virtuous or unwholesome phenomena pertaining to the seminal aspect [of the substratum consciousness], once the antidotes for these unwholesome phenomena have arisen and become steadfast, they [too] will be reversed.

[Synonyms for the Substratum Consciousness]
There are many synonyms for this [substratum consciousness]. In the context of the Greater Vehicle, it is known as the “ground of knowable phenomena” (jñeyasthiti, shes bya'i gnas) because it is the locus of the three natures (trisvabhāva, ngo bo nyid gsum) into which all knowable phenomena [may be allocated].[147] Also [in the Greater Vehicle], it is known as the “appropriating consciousness” (addnavijñāna, len pa'i rnam shes) because it has the functions of reincarnating (pratisaṃdhi, nying mtshams sbyor ba) as well as acquiring and maintaining the psycho-physical aggregates.[148] Elsewhere, it is called the “store-consciousness of all seeds” (sarvabijakālayavijñāna) because it has the function of supporting all the seeds. It is known as the “fruitional consciousness” (vipākavijñāna, rnam smin gyi rnam shes) because it assuredly ripens and generates past actions and their corrupt deeds; and it is commonly known as the “substratum consciousness” (ālayavijñāna, kun gzhi'i rnam shes) because it functions as the ground of all things of cyclic existence and nirvāṇa.[149]
The terms “fundamental consciousness” (mūlavijñāna, rtsa ba'i rnam shes), “aggregate that persists for the duration of cyclic existence” (āsaṃsāraskandha, 'khor ba ji srid pa'i phung po), “link of the rebirth process” (bhavāṅga, srid pa'i yan lag), “maturational consciousness” (vipākavijñāna, rnam smin gyi rnam shes), and so forth, which are known in the context of the Lesser Vehicle, are also identical in their meaning.[150]
Although these terms cannot be differentiated in their essential nature, there are indeed many characteristics that differentiate them on the basis of the propensities.
Proofs are also found of [this substratum consciousness] in the Summation of Ascertainment from the Yogācāra Level, established by means of scriptural authority and logical reasoning, including the eightfold reasoning [of Asaṅga].[151]

The distribution of the propensities takes place within the substratum, which has a stable continuum, and not within the six modes [of engaged consciousness] and their external physical forms, which are unstable. That is to say, the distribution of propensities takes place within the substratum, where virtuous and non-virtuous or wholesome and unwholesome [phenomena] are unspecified, and their objective referents, sense data, essential nature, and so forth are not clearly cognized by ordinary persons, pious attendants, hermit buddhas, and the like.[152]
On the other hand, this distribution [of propensities] does not take place within the six modes of engaged consciousness where virtuous and non-virtuous [phenomena] arise, and objective referents and sensa are cognized with great clarity. Nor does it occur within the dissonant mental consciousness because the latter cognizes its objective referents and sense data with great clarity and is delimited, even though [virtuous and non-virtuous phenomena] are unspecified therein.[153]
[Furthermore, ] the distribution of propensities takes place within the substratum, which is the apprehending subject, in an impermanent state of flux, because they have the capacity to be distributed [therein]. On the other hand, this distribution does not occur within permanent [phenomena, such as] space, or the cessation obtained through non-analytical means (apmtisaṃkhyānirodha, so sor brtags min gyi 'gog pa), and the like.[154] Also, the distribution of propensities within the substratum takes place with reference to a single mental continuum, concurrently with [the other seven modes of consciousness] which function as their distributors, and it does not occur when these are in isolation.

[Propensities] abide through their association with five natural properties (rang bzhin lnga), that is to say:
(1) Seeds or propensities originate co-emergently (lhan cig 'byung ba), intending to produce their [appropriate] results in an immediate manner, uninterrupted by the instant when they perish, which immediately follows their production, or by any other intervening instant of time.
(2) They originate continuously (rgyun chags su 'byung ba), until [their continuum] is destroyed by [an appropriate] antidote.
(3) Even though many propensities may be spontaneously present, they originate exclusively through the distinctive regular patterning [of their own seeds] (so sor nges pa kho na las 'byung ba).
(4) The propensities originate through proximate conditions (rkyen gang nya ba las 'byung ba).
(5) They originate indirectly from beginningless seeds (sa bon thog med nas brgyud de 'byung ba). Therefore, an intrinsic result may be established as being present in its seed, and a result may be established also on the basis of its seed. These may be exemplified [respectively] by the re-emergence of the substratum from the substratum, and by the emergence of a rice shoot from another rice shoot.
These points concerning the seeds and their natural properties have [also] been mentioned by Dignāga.[159]

If one were to ask what is the essential abiding nature of these propensities, it is that, regardless of the unspecified virtuous or non-virtuous [phenomena] in which they become localized, the propensities themselves remain unspecified. This is because they are identical in substance to the unspecified substratum.
However, you might ask, surely this [process] applies not to the diversity of propensities, but rather to the causes of the diversity of phenomena? [One should know that] while [these propensities] are [merely] propensities they do not appear diversified, but when their [appropriate] results are taking shape, they themselves are transformed into the diversity of phenomena. In the Greater Vehicle, this is also called the “profound and subtle dependent origination” (zab cing phra ba'i rten 'brel).[160]
Then, with regard to whether the propensities abide in a manner that is qualitatively identical or different [to the substratum], one might think that if the propensities are identical in substance to the substratum and [consequently] unspecified, there would be a contradiction in them subsequently emerging from it as the manifold diversity of virtuous and non-virtuous [phenomena]; and that if they are different [in substance], the seeds themselves would [have to be identified with] the [diversity of] mind and its mental states, and so it would be implicit that a single individual person could partake of many minds.
The sublime [Asaṅga] has said in this regard that the propensities cannot be described as [phenomena] that are the same or distinct from this [substratum].[161] In the Combined Commentary [on the Summary of the Greater Vehicle], [Asvabhāva] explains with examples that the Sautrantika hold the mind which apprehends the sensum of an object and the sensum itself to be neither identical nor different. Accordingly, on that analogy, he states that “the propensities and the substratum cannot be described as counterparts that are identical [in substance], nor can they even be described as different substances”[162]

In this regard, although there are different explanations which accord with [different] teachers, the master Dharmapāla[163] and others have said that if one could think of [all] the classes of the propensities one would be well acquainted with beginningless cyclic existence! For this reason he identified both of the ways in which [the propensities] become localized: (1) their primary function is to regenerate their own locus or habitat [which is the substratum]; and (2.) they also newly generate [imprints] that did not previously exist, as when maturational propensities newly emerge or the propensities associated with what one has heard or studied are newly established.

The directly manifest dissonant mental consciousness, along with its peripheral [mental states], does not emerge during the meditative equipoise of sublime beings, nor while entering the meditative absorption of cessation, nor on the levels associated [with the path] of no-more-learning (aśaikṣamārga, mi slob pa'i lam), but it does emerge during the [four paths of] learning (śaikṣamārga) and during the post-meditative experiences associated with the meditative absorption of cessation.[166]
Apart from these [special] circumstances, in all [other ordinary] circumstances where it is unspecified in terms of virtuous and non-virtuous [phenomena], the dissonant mental consciousness refers objectively to the substratum [consciousness] and at the same time it engages routinely [with the six modes of engaged consciousness].
Even so, this process may be reversed from the first level of the path of insight (darśanamārga), according to the Greater Vehicle; and its [latent] propensities or innate aspects may be reversed through the transformations that occur on the eighth [bodhisattva] level, associated with the path of meditation (bhāvanāmārga). Its most subtle latent tendencies (bag la nyal phra zhing phra ba) are reversed at the same time when the substratum [consciousness itself is reversed], i. e., at the end of the continuum of the ten [bodhisattva] levels (daśabhūmi). On the buddha level, it is then transformed into the conclusive pristine cognition of sameness (samatājñāna, myam nyid kyi yes hes).[167]
There are many authoritative passages of the scriptures that establish the proof of this [dissonant mental consciousness].[168] The Summary of the Greater Vehicle itself offers six reasons.[169]
Incidentally, if I may digress, there is a passage [in the Treasury of Phenomenology] which says:[170]
Mentation is the [residual] consciousness immediately after The sixfold [engaged consciousness] has passed.
In accordance with this passage, Je Rangjungwa has designated the [residual] mentation [that remains] immediately after [any of] the six modes of consciousness have ceased by the term “mentation that is [an aspect of] the sixth [mode of consciousness]” (drug pa'i yid).[171] It is [generally] acknowledged that this does not refer to the dissonant mental consciousness, but is, rather, a synonym for mentation (manas). However, there are some who also refer to it as the “mentation that serves as a property of the dissonant mental [consciousness]” (nyon mongs can gyi yid kyi chos can dugyurpa'iyid).[172]
It is explained that this immediate mentation must also continue to function, after the sixfold [mode of engaged consciousness] has ceased, as the predominant condition of the uncorrupted pristine cognition in the mind of a sublime being.[173]
Also on this point, there are some who employ similar terminology, saying that the principal [aspect of] mind is the substratum, and that mentation has two aspects, comprising absolute mentation (don dam pa'i yid) and circumstantial mentation (gnas skabs pa'i yid). In this case, the former refers to the dissonant mental [consciousness] and the latter to the [residual] consciousness that remains immediately after the cessation of the six modes of engaged consciousness.[174]

In general it is the case that consciousness becomes localized on account of its [ability] to cognize dissimilar sense objects. The term “engagement” (pravṛtti, 'jug pa) suggests that [consciousness] relates to individual sense objects among those that diversely appear, and consequently a clear sensum repeatedly emerges. The term “consciousness” (vijñāna, rnam par shes pa) here suggests that [the subject] refers objectively to the essential nature of its [appropriate] sense object.
This [engaged consciousness] comprises six [modes] extending from visual consciousness (cakṣurvijñāna, mig gi rnam par shes pa), as far as mental consciousness (manovijñāna, yid kyi rnam par shes pa).
Furthermore, each of these [six modes of engaged consciousness] arises dependent on four conditions. Among them, in the case of visual consciousness, the referential condition (ālambanapratyaya, dmigs pa'i rkyen) comprises the visual forms that appear as if they were external to itself The predominant condition (adhipatipratyaya, bdag rkyen) comprises the sense organs of the eyes. The immediate condition (samanantarapratyaya, de ma thag rkyen) comprises an uninterrupted preceding moment of mental attention. The causal condition (hetupratyaya, rgyu'i rkyen) comprises the [visual] consciousness that arises, dependent on [the propensities of] the substratum, endowed with the characteristic of apperceiving individual visual forms.[175]
These four conditions are similarly applied to each of the [following] four [modes of engaged consciousness], namely, auditory consciousness (śrotravijñāna, ma'i rnam par shes pa), olfactory consciousness (ghrāṇavijñāna, sna'i rnam par shes pa), gustatory consciousness (jihvāvijñāna, Ice'i rnam par shes pa), and tactile consciousness (kāyavijñāna, lus kyi rnam par shes pa).
As far as mental consciousness is concerned, the referential condition comprises the knowable phenomena which appear as if they were different to itself; the predominant condition comprises, with one special exception, the dissonant mental [consciousness]; the immediate condition is the mental activity preceding it; and the causal condition is the mental consciousness that arises, dependent on [the propensities of] the substratum, endowed with the characteristic of apperceiving individual mental phenomena.
With regard to the [aforementioned] “special exception,” the predominant condition of the uncorrupted pristine cognition of sublime minds is its necessity to [continue] functioning by means of mentation immediately after the six [modes of consciousness] have ceased.[176]

As far as the defining characteristics of these six [modes of engaged consciousness] are concerned, the defining characteristic of visual consciousness is that, dependent on the sense organs of the eyes, which are its predominant condition, sensory consciousness perceives sensa corresponding to the activity field of visual form, and so on [in the case of auditory consciousness, etc. ]. The defining characteristic of the sixth, mental consciousness, is that the central consciousness cognizes the activity field of mental phenomena, which is its own object, dependent on the sense faculty of the mind (mana indriya, yid dbang), which is its predominant condition, and it is [therefore] different in substance from the [previously mentioned] dissonant mental [consciousness].

Regarding the locus [of the six modes of engaged consciousness], (1) in general, the substratum consciousness is the locus for the seeds of all [the six modes of consciousness]. Their former locus—immediately preceding that [subsidence in the substratum]—is the immediate mentation which lingers following their cessation; and their subsequent locus which will re-emerge concurrently with mental consciousness [when they are reactivated] is the dissonant mental consciousness.[177] Thereafter, the peripheral mental states are the locus in which all the six modes [of engaged consciousness] pursue virtuous or non-virtuous actions, and dissonant mental consciousness is the locus in which they pursue corrupt [actions] and are consequently bound to substantialist [views]. (2.) In particular, the [distinctive] loci that emerge concurrently with [the consciousnesses of] the five senses comprise the respective sense organs, such as the eye.
It is through these loci that [the six modes of engaged consciousness] refer objectively to their respective six sense objects—visual forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangibles, and mental phenomena. At the same time, they maintain a concomitance between mind and its mental states, including the five everpresent [mental states].

The functions (byed las) of these [six modes of engaged consciousness] are to facilitate the apprehension of their respective sense objects. [Among them, ] the five modes of sensory [consciousness] engage in the pursuit of virtuous and dissonant [actions], they engage in the pursuit of the [positive and negative] motivations behind those actions, and they engage in the pursuit of [the corresponding results] which are imbued with suffering or the absence of suffering.[178]
On the other hand, mental consciousness [only] has the functions of engaging in [the pursuit of] virtuous or non-virtuous phenomena and the [associated] actions, whereas the other [five modes of engaged] consciousness also facilitate the complete apprehension of their [respective] results, endowed with suffering or the absence of suffering. The salient point here is that the actions themselves originate, in particular, through mental activity.
In this regard, [the most distinctive activities pursued by the engaged consciousness are outlined in] the following maxim:[179]
Conceptualizing with respect to objects of reference,
Prevaricating with respect to objects of reference,
Being intoxicated, falling sleep, and waking up.
Fainting and regaining consciousness,
Engaging in physical and verbal activities,
Experiencing activity devoid of attachment,
Cutting off and connecting with the roots of virtue,
Transmigrating at death and being reborn.
With regard to the origins [of the six modes of engaged consciousness], the Sautrantika and others hold that there is no multiplicity of immediate conditions and that each [moment of] consciousness arises exclusively due to a single [preceding moment of] consciousness, because an immediate condition comprising a multiplicity [of immediate conditions] would not be causally effective. However, in this [tradition of Higher Abhidharma], it is the referential condition of consciousness that is individually ascertained, and consequently, there is no need to individually ascertain the immediate condition. Indeed, many [moments of] consciousness may originate from a single immediate condition. Therefore, it is explained in the Thirty Verses that [the moments of] consciousness that originate may number anything from one to a multiplicity [of moments], according to the conditions that emerge concurrently with the substratum, just as waves emerge from water.[180]
In particular, mental consciousness originates without interruption in all circumstances, except the following five which are characterized by an absence of mind: (1) rebirth as a deity without perception, (2-3) the two kinds of meditative absorption, (4) sleep, and (5) unconsciousness.[181]
Exponents of Buddhist phenomenology explain that in the case of the five modes of sensory consciousness, there are both simulated or proximate conditions, as when visual forms are involuntarily observed, and [instances of] sensory consciousness being preceded by mentation, as when [visual forms] are voluntarily observed.[182]

However, they are progressively diminished in higher and higher realms, such as the world-system of form (rūpadhātu, gzugs khams), the world-system of formlessness (ārūpyadhātu, gzugs med khams), and the [exalted states] attained through the sublime [path] of the Lesser Vehicle.
Yet that is a gross generalization. At this juncture, the many intricate ways of quantifying [the aggregates] should be studied in the texts of phenomenology. Since these are hard to understand, I fear that my writing [on this subject would be too protracted].[183]

Derived from [the Sanskrit] term dhātu, and rendered [in Tibetan] as khams, the “sensory bases” are designated as such because they “support the seeds” [of everything] (sarvadharmabījadhara, sa bon 'dzin pa) or because they “support their own specifically characterized phenomena” (rang mtshan 'dzin pa).[184]
With regard to their essential nature, there are altogether eighteen sensory bases (aṣṭadaśadhātu, khams bco brgyad), namely, six internal sensory bases (nang gi khams drug), including the eyes; six external sensory bases (phyi'i khams drug), including visual form; and six cognizant sensory bases (rnam par shes pa'i khams drug), including visual consciousness. It says in the Commentary on the Treasury [of Phenomenology]:[185]
The [Sanskrit] term dhātu (Tib. khams) means “species” or “natural type” (gotra). Just as in some parts of the earth, where there are many kinds of [precious metals] —gold, silver, copper, iron, and the like—one speaks of those places and their [various] “constituents” (dhātu, khams) or “elements” (bhūtadhātu, 'byung khams), in the same way, there are [said to be] eighteen “sensory bases” because a single human body and a single mind with a single continuum of mental states partake of eighteen “natural modes” (gotra, rigs) or “constituents” (dhātu, khams).
With regard to those [eighteen]:
(1-6) The internal sensory bases, including the eyes, are designated as such because when they engage with their respective sense objects, they do not act [directly] but support specifically characterized phenomena, or else because they support their respective sensory environments (upacāra, nyer spyod), or because they support their seeds [of visual consciousness and so forth].
(7-12) The external sensory bases, including visual forms, are designated as such because they support specifically characterized [physical] phenomena.
(13-18) The cognizant sensory bases are designated as such because they support specifically characterized mental phenomena, which apperceive the essential nature of their [respective] sense objects, dependent on their [respective] sense organs.
The defining characteristics of each are extensively explained in [Asaṅga's]
Actual Foundation of the [Yogācāra] Level.[186]

The “aggregate of physical forms,” which is presented as one [distinct component] in the context of the psycho-physical aggregates, [here,] in the context of the sensory bases, is re-designated as the “ten physical sensory bases” (daśarūpakadhātu, gzugs can gyi khams bcu). These ten comprise the sensory bases of the five physical sense organs (dbang po gzugs can lnga'i khams), including the eyes, and the sensory bases of the five physical sense objects (yul gzugs can lnga'i khams), including visual forms.
Also included here is one part, i. e., half, of the sensory base that derives from the five types of form within the sensory activity field of phenomena (dharmāyatanapañcarūpa, chos kyi skye mched pa'i gzugs lnga), including [intangible atomic] forms that are extremely [small and] concentrated (ābhisaṃkṣepikarūpa, bsdus pa las gyur pa'i gzugs).[187] Thus there are [altogether] eleven aspects subsumed within [the category of] form.
The “aggregate of feelings,” the “aggregate of perceptions,” and the “aggregate of formative predispositions,” which are presented as three [distinct components] in the context of the psycho-physical aggregates, [here, ] in the context of the sensory bases, are [all] localized within one part of the sensory base that derives from the sensory activity field of mental phenomena (dharmāyatandhātu, chos kyi skye mched pa'i khams) because they are exclusively objects of the mental faculty. Thus they are [all] subsumed within [the category of mental] phenomena.
The “aggregate of consciousness,” which is presented as one [distinct component] in the context of the psycho-physical aggregates, [here, ] in the context of the sensory bases, is re-designated as the “seven sensory bases of consciousness” (rnam par shes pa'i khams bdun), comprising the six modes of [engaged] consciousness, from visual consciousness as far as mental consciousness, along with the sensory base of the dissonant mental [consciousness].
According to the tradition of the pious attendants (śrāvaka, nyan thos), immediately after the six [modes of engaged consciousness] have ceased to function, they still remain localized within the sensory base of the mental faculty (manodhātu, yid kyi khams) because this [base] is presented as the locus or habitat of mental consciousness even though there are no [actual circumstances] when it is separated from the six modes.[188] According to the tradition of the Greater Vehicle, on the other hand, the sensory base of the mental faculty is identified with the dissonant mental [consciousness] and also, by implication, with the substratum [consciousness] because it stores the seeds of the [other] seven [modes of consciousness]. Thus, [all these eight modes of consciousness] are subsumed within [the category of] mind.

What, you may ask, are the sensory bases which are not subsumed in the five psycho-physical aggregates? These are designated as the “unconditioned sensory bases” (asaṃskṛtadhātu, 'dus ma byas kyi khams), included within one part of the sensory base of phenomena (dharmadhātu, chos kyi khams) that is not covered by the five psycho-physical aggregates, because they are not generated by causes and conditions and are not [considered to be] an agglomeration of parts, as is, for example, [the continuum of] past time.
Although there are different exegetical traditions, such as the explanation in the [Dissertation on the] Five Psycho-physical Aggregates which asserts that there are four unconditioned things ('dus ma byed bzhi),[189] according to this tradition [of Higher Abhidharma] there are said to be eight [unconditioned things]. These comprise (1-3) the three aspects of reality, (4) space, (5) cessation obtained through non-analytical means, (6) cessation obtained through analytical means, (7) the immovable state, and (8) the cessation of perception and feeling.[190]
Among them, with regard to the three aspects of reality (trayatathatā, de bzhin nyid gsum), although in [actual] reality (dharmatā, chos nyid) there are no distinctions, three aspects [of reality] are established on account of their different modes of support (chos can rten). Accordingly, they comprise (1) the reality of virtuous phenomena (kuśaladharmatathatā, chos dge ba rnams kyi de bzhin nyid), (1) the reality of non-virtuous phenomena (akuśaladharmatathatā, chos mi dge ba rnams kyi de bzhin nyid), and (3) the reality of unspecified phenomena (avyākṛtadharmatathatā, lung ma bstan rnams kyi de bzhin nyid).[191]
The essential nature of these [three aspects] is the actual reality [or emptiness] present respectively in virtuous, non-virtuous, and unspecified [phenomena]. This is the essential nature that comprises the two aspects of selflessness because it is [characterized by] emptiness in respect of both the self of the individual person (pudgalātma, gang zag gi bdag), as when a “self” with permanent, unitary, and independent properties is [mistakenly] apprehended, and the self of phenomena (dharmātma, chos kyi bdag), as when phenomena comprising the apprehended [object] and the apprehending [subject] are both [mistakenly] imputed [to have inherent existence].[192]
There are many synonyms of this reality, including emptiness (śūnyatā, stong pa nyid), signlessness (animitta, mtshan nyid med pa), genuine goal (bhūtakoṭi, yang dag pa'i mtha'), ultimate reality (paramārtha, don dam pa), and expanse of reality (dharmadhātu, chos kyi dbyings).[193]

With regard to the fourth, space (ākāśa, nam mkha'), since things become manifest exclusively through physical form, this refers to anything characterized by an absence of material form which is [still] an object of mental consciousness and facilitates or conducts the arising, perishing, and so forth of obstructive matter (sapratigharūpa, thogs bcas kyi gzugs). Actually, [space] is not designated as such because it facilitates or conducts [matter] by means of motion but merely because it does not impede the possibility of obstructive matter arising.[194]
With regard to the fifth, cessation obtained through non-analytical means (apratisaṃkhyānirodha, so sor brtags min gyi 'gog pa), this refers to the [temporary] cessation [of phenomena] obtained on account of the insufficiency of the causes and conditions [for their arising]. Even so, the seeds or subconscious tendencies of these [phenomena] are, for the while, not destroyed and they are never disconnected because their rejection is not irreversible. This may be exemplified by the non-arising of other modes of consciousness when visual consciousness is distracted by visual forms.[195]
With regard to the sixth, cessation obtained through analytical means (pratisaṃkhyānirodha., so sor brtags pa'i 'gog pa), this occurs when the [spiritual] path associated with any uncorrupted antidote is [consciously] cultivated in the mind, and all the corresponding [impurities] that are to be rejected cease, without exception. In this case, the dissonant mental states and their seeds or subconscious tendencies are thoroughly destroyed by means of the antidote in question, and the [impurities] which are to be rejected are perpetually disconnected because their rejection is irreversible.[196]
With regard to the seventh, the immovable state (āniñjya, mi gYo ba) is designated as such because when one is free from the desires associated with the third mundane meditative concentration and those below it, and all feelings of happiness and suffering have ceased, one is unmoved by the eight defects [associated with meditative concentration], and, in particular, one is unmoved by transitory happiness and suffering. The eight [defects] comprise ideation and scrutiny, feelings of bliss and sorrow, [feelings of] mental comfort and discomfort, and exhalation and inhalation of breath.[197]
With regard to the eighth, the cessation of perception and feeling (saṃjñā-vedayitanirodha, 'du shes dang tshor ba 'gog pa), when one is free from the desires associated with the sensory activity field of nothing-at-all and those below it, and has left behind all sorts of [impurities] that are to be abandoned, passing beyond the very summit of [mundane] existence, the six modes [of engaged consciousness] and the dissonant mental consciousness will cease to function, preceded by the perception that even the perception of moving upwards and the feeling of equanimity will come to rest in a state of quiescence (śāntavihāra, zhi bar gnas pa).[198]

Together with the eight unconditioned states [described earlier], these two [sets of eight], totaling sixteen, are objects exclusively within the range of mental consciousness.

The “sensory activity fields” (āyatana, skye mched) are so designated because their environmental role is to “extend [sense perception] outwards” (mched pa) to extraneous objects from the sensory gates (dvāra, sgo) where consciousness “arises” (skye ba).[200]
There are twelve [sensory activity fields], comprising (1-6) the six inner sensory activity fields (nang gi skye mched drug), such as the eye (cakṣurāyatana, mig gi skye mched); and (7-12) the six outer sensory activity fields (phyi'i skye mched drug), such as visible form (rūpāyatana, gzugs kyi skye mched).
It says in the Commentary on the Treasury [of Phenomenology]:[201]
The [Sanskrit] term dyatana (skye mched) [literally meaning “seat” or “abode”][202] is interpreted to mean “sensory gate where [consciousness] arises” (āyadvā[ra], skye ba'i sgo).[203] The sensory activity fields are designated as such because they are the portals through which mind and mental states arise and extend or expand outwards, dependent on whichever [internal or external aspect of sense perception is applicable].
When [this definition] is applied in detail to each of [the sensory activity fields] individually, (1) the sensory activity field of the eye (cakṣurāyatana, mig gi skye mched) subjectively activates the sensory gate where visual conscious arises, and (2) the sensory activity field of visible form (rūpāyatana, gzugs kyi skye mched) objectively activates the sensory gate of visual consciousness. Then, in the same manner, [this dual function] applies to all the remaining [sensory activity fields], since each of them activates the corresponding sensory gate where its respective mode of consciousness [auditory, olfactory, etc.] arises, both subjectively and objectively.

However, as in the case [of the aforementioned sensory bases], one should know in particular that the sensory activity field of the mental faculty (mano āyatana, yid kyi skye mched) activates the sensory gate where mental consciousness arises on the basis of its immediate condition (samanantarapratyaya, de ma thag rkyen), and the sensory activity field of phenomena (dharmāyatana, chos kyi skye mched) activates the sensory gate where mental consciousness arises on the basis of its referential or objective condition (ālambanapratyaya, dmigs pa'i rkyen).[204]
In brief, subjective and immediate conditions direct [the modes of] consciousness internally, while referential and objective conditions direct them externally, towards the [respective] gates that form the sensory activity fields.
At this juncture, you may ask why only the sense objects of the eyes are designated as [the sensory activity field of] form (rūpāyatana, gzugs kyi skye mched), even though the first ten [of the twelve sensory activity fields] all partake of [the aggregate of] physical forms (rūpaskandha), and why only the objects of the mental faculty are designated as [the sensory activity field of] phenomena (dharmāyatana, chos kyi skye mched), even though all twelve [of the sensory activity fields] constitute phenomena.
In the former case, the point is that a single item [in a group] is distinguished from the others [in the same group] on account of its distinctive designation [and usage]. Specifically, in this case, only the sense objects of the eyes are designated as [the sensory activity field of] form because they are [held to be] the foremost aspects of form on account of their being both revealed and obstructed (sanidarsanasapratigha, bstan yod thogs bcas).
Similarly, [in the latter case, ] the point is, just as in the former case, that a single item [in a group] is distinguished from the others [in the same group] owing to its distinctive designation [and usage]. Specifically, only the objects of the mental faculty are designated as [the sensory activity field of] phenomena because they include within them many [diverse mental] phenomena, such as feelings, and they also include nirvana, which is the supreme among all phenomena.[205]

It is said in Buddhist phenomenology that all those phenomena which are differentiated according to the psycho-physical aggregates, sensory bases, and sensory activity fields may also be subsumed in five basic categories (pañcajñeya, shes bya thams cad kyi gzhi lnga) with reference to their broad classification.
What, you may ask, are these five? They comprise (1) the basic category of apparent forms (snang ba gzugs kyi gzhi), (2) the basic category of the central mind (gtso bo sems kyi gzhi), (3) the basic category of peripheral mental states ('khor sems byung gi gzhi), (4) the basic category of circumstantial formative predispositions disassociated [with mind and mental states] (gnas skabs ldan pa ma yin pa'i du byed kyi gzhi), and (5) the basic category of unconditioned states [including] cessation ('gug pa 'dus ma byas kyi gzhi).[206] The pious attendants hold that all knowable phenomena may be subsumed within these five basic categories, but as Zilung Paṇchen has said, “One cannot agree that the five basic categories are assigned exclusively within the tradition of the Vaibhasikas because they are also lucidly explained in the Compendium of Phenomenology.”[207]

Among these [five basic categories], the first is the basic category of apparent forms, which comprises eleven substances—the five sense organs, their [corresponding] five [sense] objects, and imperceptible form. The five sense organs are as [explained] above. Among the five [sense] objects, the sensory activity field of visible forms (rūpāyatana, gzugs kyi skye mched), comprising the sense objects of the eye, includes both color and shape:[209]
When these are differentiated there are twenty aspects:
Blueness, yellowness, whiteness, redness,
Light [of the moon and stars], darkness, cloud,
Smoke, dust, mist, sunlight, and shadow,
Along with the long, the short, the square, the round,
The high, the low, the even, and the uneven.
The first twelve of these are [classed as] colors [and shades] —
Four of them are primary colors
And eight are particular or secondary aspects [of shade].
The last eight items [in the list] are [classed as] shapes.[210]
Sounds (śabda, sgra) comprise both organically produced sounds [such as human sounds] and inorganically produced sounds [such as rustling trees].
These become four because each [of the two] types includes [sounds] capable of signifying their object and the opposite, and they become eight because each of these [four types] includes sounds that are pleasant and unpleasant.[211]
Odors (gandha, dri) include both those that are fragrant and strong, and each of these is differentiated on the basis of whether [it evokes] a neutral [feeling] or one that is not neutral.[212]
Tastes (rasa, ro) include the six essential types, namely, those that are sweet, sour, salty, bitter, spicy, and astringent.[213]
Tangibles (spraṣṭavya, reg bya) are eleven in number, comprising the four primary elements, which are [classed as] causal tangibles (rgyu'i reg bya), and the seven [sensations of] softness, roughness, heaviness, lightness, hunger, thirst, and coldness, which are [classed as] fruitional tangibles ('bras bu'i reg bya).[214]
Imperceptible forms (avijñaptirūpa, rnam min gyi gzugs) are those forms belonging to the sensory activity field of phenomena, which arise during [distracted periods of] apperception and during any meditative stability, whether virtuous or non-virtuous, [providing continuity of experience, ] and which have the characteristics of imperceptible universals. When classified, they comprise both [imperceptible forms] that originate during [distracted] apperception and those that originate during meditative stability. The former includes three types: [distracted apperceptions] that are disciplined, undisciplined, or neutral; while the latter includes two types: [periods of] meditative concentration and [periods of] uncorrupted discipline (zag med kyi sdom pa).
Here, “disciplined” (sdom pa) implies virtuous [states], “undisciplined” (sdom min) implies non-virtuous [states], and “neutral” (bar ma) implies any unspecified virtuous or non-virtuous state. The causal bases of these [imperceptible forms] are the four primary elements, as [explained] above.[215]

The third is the basic category of peripheral mental states, which partake of the following five classes:
(1) The group of ten mental states that are found in all minds (daśacitta-mahābhūmika, sems kyi sa mang po bcu) comprises[216]
Feeling, volition, perception, will, contact, intelligence,
Mindfulness, attention, resolve, and meditative stability.
(2) The group of ten mental states that are found in all virtuous minds (daśakuśalamahābhūmika, dge ba'i sa mang bcu) comprises[217]
Faith, vigilance, refinement, equanimity, conscience, shame,
The two roots of virtue, namely, non-attachment and non-hatred, Along with non-violence and perseverance.
(3) The group of six mental states that are found in all dissonant or afflicted minds (ṣaṭkleśamahābhūmika, nyon mongs can gyi sa mang drug) comprises[218]
Delusion, carelessness, indolence,
Faithlessness, dullness, and mental agitation.
(4) The group of two mental states that are found in all non-virtuous minds (dvayākuśalamahābhūmika, mi dge ba'i sa pa chen po gnyis) comprises[212]
Lack of conscience and shamelessness.
(5) The group of ten mental states that are found in all slightly dissonant or afflicted minds (parīttakleśabhūmika, nyon mongs chung ngu'i sa pa bcu) comprises[220]
Anger, enmity, pretentiousness, jealousy, annoyance,
Hypocrisy, miserliness, deceit, self-satisfaction, and violence.
These thirty-eight [mental states] are actually presented in the Treasury [of Phenomenology], while the commentaries of Vasubandhu (bhāṣya) and Yaśomitra (ṭīkā) supplement the list with the addition of the following eight indeterminate mental states (aṣṭāniyatabhūmika, ma nges pa'i sa pa brgyad):[221]
Ideation, scrutiny, regret, drowsiness,
Hostility, desire, pride, and doubt.[222]

The fourth is the basic category of the formative predispositions that are disassociated with mind. When these are all subsumed, there are eight of them, which are enumerated as follows:[223]
Acquisition (prāpti, thob pa), non-acquisition (aprāpti, ma thob pa),[224] Homogeneity (sabhāgata, skal mnyam),[225] Non-perception (āsaṃjñika, 'du shes med pa),[226] Meditative absorptions (samāpatti, snyoms 'jug),[217] life-force (āyus, srog),[228]
Characteristics (lakṣaṇa, mtshan nyid),[229]
And nominal clusters (nāmakāya, ming gi tshogs), etc.[230]
When these are further differentiated, they number fourteen. For, meditative absorption includes both the meditative absorption devoid of perception and the meditative absorption of cessation. Conditioned characteristics include four aspects: birth, aging, duration [of the life span], and impermanence. Nominal clusters imply three clusters altogether, with the addition of phrasal clusters and syllabic clusters.
Derived from these [fourteen] there are also many further classifications. Thus, it is extensively explained, for example, that acquisition may have three aspects, with the addition of new acquisition (labdhaprāpti, rnyed thob) and [uninterrupted] possession (samanvāgama, ldan thob). Even “former acquisition” (pūrvaprāpti, sngar las thob pa) may include the acquisition of something that had not been acquired (aprāptiprāpti, ma thob pa las thob pa), the acquisition of something that had been lost (vihīnaprāpti, nyams nas thob pa), and the acquisition of conditioned and unconditioned phenomena (saṃskṛtāsaṃskṛtaprāpti, 'dus byas dang 'dus ma byas pa'i thob pa), and so forth.[231]

With regard to all those [phenomenological structures] that have just been explained, the sensory bases are established, having been specially extracted from the psycho-physical aggregates, and the sensory activity fields are [similarly] established, having been specially extracted from the sensory bases. Then, when the psycho-physical aggregates, sensory bases, and sensory activity fields of which this structure is composed are concisely reconstituted, they may all be integrated together under three headings [the aggregate of physical forms, the sensory base of mental phenomena, and the sensory activity field of the mental faculty].
It says in the Treasury [of Phenomenology]:[233]
Matter comprises the five sense organs,
The five objects, and imperceptible forms.
And:[234]
These sense organs and their objects are exclusively
Held to comprise ten sensory activity fields and ten sensory bases.
So it is that the aggregate of physical forms (rūpaskandha, gzugs kyi phung po) [the first of these three headings] subsumes all aspects of form, including the ten physical sensory bases and sensory activity fields, which are mentioned in this passage, along with the physical forms which are the objects of the mental faculty. The sensory base of mental phenomena (dharmadhātu, chos kyi khams) [the second of the three headings] subsumes the three aggregates of feelings, perceptions, and formative predispositions, along with one part of form, and the sensory activity field of mental phenomena.[235] The sensory activity field of the mental faculty (mano āyatana, yid kyi skye mched) [the third heading] comprises the aggregate of consciousness and the seven sensory bases [associated with consciousness].
Therefore, it says in the Treasury [of Phenomenology]:[236]
All [phenomena] may be subsumed in a single aggregate,
A single sensory base, and a single sensory activity field.
[Reduced in this way, ] all relative appearances that are objects of knowledge can be subsumed under these three [headings].
Furthermore, all phenomena may also be classed according to three other modalities, designated respectively as (1) causally effective phenomena which are substantial existents (dravyataḥ vastu, rdzas yod kyi dngos po); (2.) causally effective phenomena which are imputed existents (prajñaptitaḥ vastu, btags yod kyi dngos po); and (3) non-causally effective phenomena (avastuka, dngos po med pa).[237]
Among them, the [class of] substantial causally effective phenomena is assigned to inert substances, including atomic particles composed of the primary elements and so forth, and to “conscious substances” (shes pa'i rdzas), including the sense data and apperceptions that arise when consciousness relates to its sense objects. The [class of] imputed causally effective phenomena is so designated because, although in general things that are not subject to ideation or scrutiny such as a “vase” are substantially existent, the [concepts of] production and cessation in relation to the vase and so forth are imputed by the intellect. Then, [the class of] non-causally effective phenomena includes [unconditioned phenomena] such as space.
In addition, [phenomena] are also explained to be subsumed within [the categories of] substantial entities (dravyavastu, rdzas dngos), imputed entities (prajñaptivastu, btags dngos),[238] relative entities (samvṛtivastu, kun rdzob kyi dngos po), and absolute entities (paramārthavastu, don dam gyi dngos po).[239]

The second part [of the extensive exegesis on the actual structure of Buddhist phenomenology; see p. 472] is a systematic presentation of phenomenological categories according to the uncommon tradition of the final promulgation.[240] This has three topics: (1) the basis of the phenomenological categories which encompass all twenty-five realms of phenomenal existence (srid pa nyi shu rtsa lnga); (2) the five foundational factors (gzhi chos lnga) of which the [three] natures partake; and (3) an exegesis of the three natures (mtshan nyid gsum) which partake of these [foundational factors].[241]

As explained above, the five psycho-physical aggregates, the eighteen sensory bases and the twelve sensory activity fields may be reconstituted in the following three aspects: (1) the aggregate of physical forms (rūpaskandha, gzugs kyi phung po), (2) the sensory base of mental phenomena (dharmadhātu, chos kyi khams), and (3) the sensory activity field of the mental faculty (mano āyatana, yid kyi skye mched).[242]
Each of these also has three further subdivisions. Among them, the aggregate of physical forms comprises the following three aspects: (4) the sensory base of the elements (bhūtadhātu, 'byung ba'i khams), (5) the containing physical world (bhājanaloka, snod kyi 'jig rten), and (6) the sentient beings within it (sattva, bcud kyi sems can). The sensory activity field of the mental faculty[243] also comprises the following three aspects: (7) the mind (citta, sems), (8) mentation (manas, yid), and (9) consciousness (vijñāna, rnam par shes pa).
The sensory base of mental phenomena similarly has the following three subdivisions: (10) mental phenomena denoting demonstrations (lakṣyadharma, mtshan gzhi'i chos), (11) mental phenomena denoting defining characteristics (lakṣaṇadharma, mtshan nyid kyi chos), and (12) non-substantial mental phenomena (abhāvadharma, dngos med kyi chos).
Among the latter, the demonstrations comprise three further aspects: (13) the aggregates of feelings, (14) perceptions, and (15) formative predispositions. The defining characteristics comprise three further aspects: (16) those that are imputed with regard to space (dikparikalpita, yul la btags pa), (17) those that are imputed with regard to time (kālaparikalpita, dus la btags pa), and (18) those that are imputed with regard to substance (bhāvaparikalpita, dngos la btags pa). Then, the non-substantial mental phenomena may also be subdivided into (19) non-substantial phenomena arising through the transformation of substance (bhāvanyāthikābhāva, dngos po gzhan 'gyur gyi dngos med), (20) non-substantial mental phenomena dependent on substance (bhāvaniśritābhāva, dngos po la brten pa'i dngos med), and (21) non-substantial mental phenomena which do not exist (asambhavābhāva, mi srid pa'i dngos med). These twenty-one are collectively designated as the “aspects associated with the ground” (gzhi'i chos).[244]

<d e="2">
These largely accord in their meaning with the foregoing [explanations]. However, the “defining characteristics” refer [in this context] to particular aspects of phenomena that are imaginary or imputed (chos kun tu btags pa). These include all phenomena that are relatively determined, such as [the dichotomies of] cause and result, greatness and smallness, light and dark, or example and exemplified, which are all said to be imputed with regard to space (yul la btags pa). By contrast, those phenomena that are analyzed in terms of past and future are imputed with regard to time (dus la btags pa), while those such as “vase” and “pillar” [which may be conceived or imagined] are imputed with regard to substance (dngos la btags pa).
Furthermore, non-substantial [phenomena] which were once substantial but subsequently destroyed, such as the cessation [of sensory functions] obtained through analytical means, are [classed as] non-substantial phenomena arising through the transformation [of substance]. Substantial object-universals (dngos po'i don spyi), such as the concepts “vase universal” or “pillar universal” (bum pa dang ka ba'i spyi), are [classed as] non-substantial [phenomena] dependent on substance. Concepts such as the “horns of a hare” or “non-vase universal” (bum pa med pa'i spyi), are [classed as] non-substantial [phenomena] which do not exist.

By contrast, the expanse of reality (dharmadhātu, chos kyi dbyings), which is the ultimate truth (paramārthasatya, don dam pa'i bden pa), alone is [considered to be] unique and uncompounded.[249]
The systematic presentation of renowned [texts] such as the Sūtra of Great Final Nirvāṇa and the Sūtra of the Great Drum, which belong to the irreversible promulgation [of the Buddhas teachings], has determined that all things of phenomenal existence, encompassing all the twenty-five realms (srid pa'i chos mtha' dag bsdus pa nyi shu rtsa lnga po) have this field of knowledge, [the actual reality, ] as their ground and path.[250]

Appearances are universals indicating states or objects which may be signified verbally or through the distracting imagination of the mental faculty. As such, they may be exemplified by the universal image of a given conceived object that arises in the mind due to the apprehending imagination of a “vase”
Among their subdivisions, there are many variations, including (a) natural appearances (svabhāvanimitta, rang bzhin gyi rgyu mtshan)—the signs of the diverse imaging or propensities that manifest to the innate mind in cyclic existence; (b) projected appearances (bimbanimitta, gzugs bmyen gyi rgyu mtshan), such as the apprehension of a self, which is imputed by erroneous philosophical systems; and (c) dichotomizing or polarizing appearances (dvandvanimitta, rgyu mtshan gnyis gnyis), such as [phenomena that are] realized and unrealized, clear and unclear, or symbolic and non-symbolic.[253]
Furthermore, the term “appearance” may also be uniquely applied to each of the five foundational factors, as follows:
(1) The appearance of appearances (rgyu mtshan gyi rgyu mtshan) refers to the subjective apprehension of the universal image corresponding to a conceived object, such as a “vase.”
(2) The appearance of names (ming gi rgyu mtshan) may be exemplified, in this instance, by the universal image of the conceived object [i. e., the “vase”].
(3) The appearance of false imagination (rnam rtog gi rgyu mtshan) is exemplified by the workings of the mind and its mental states.
(4) The appearance of absolute reality (de bzhin nyid kyi rgyu mtshan) refers to a given object imputed as absolute reality by means of thought processes.
(5) The appearance of genuine [non-conceptual] knowledge (yang dag pa'i shes pa'i rgyu mtshan) refers to a given universal image apprehended while one adheres to the [spiritual] path.[254]

The essential nature of names is that they are verbally designated universals which, on being imputed with respect to a given appearance, are perceived and then labeled. For example, a “vase” is designated on the basis of a given object apprehended by means of the imagination that conceives a vase; and indeed it is even perceived as the term-universal (sgra spyi) corresponding to its given [object], without being audibly sensed.
Although among the subdivisions [of names] almost forty have been enumerated,[255] here they are subsumed in the following six:
(1) Substantive names (dngos po'i ming) may be exemplified, in this instance, by the given term-universal (sgra spyi) “vase.”
(2) Relational names ('brel ba'i ming) may be exemplified by the term-universal inherent in the thought, “This vase is large. This vase is small.”
(3) Integrating names ('dus pa'i ming) are exemplified by term-universals in which multiple aspects are perceived as one, as in the statement, “These golden vases, silver vases, and copper vases are vases”
(4) Diversifying names (tha dad pa'i ming) are the opposite of these, exemplified by term-universals in which the details derived from a single descriptive base (khyad gzhi) are diversely perceived, as in the statement, “These vases comprise golden, silver, and copper vases.”
(5-6) Known names (grags pa'i ming) and unknown names (ma grags pa'i ming) refer to those that are known and unknown in a given place and time. For example, the Sanskrit term hasti (lag ldan) is known to mean “elephant,” while the same expression (lag pa dang ldan pa) is not known to mean “bull.”

The essential nature of false imagination is that it denotes the mind and its mental states;[256] while its subdivisions may be either symbolic or non-symbolic (nimittavikalpa cānimittavikalpa, mtshan bcas dang mtshan ma med pa'i rnam rtog). The former refers principally to the imaginations associated with the mind and mental states prevalent in the world-system of desire, as well as those prevalent as far as the first meditative concentration. The latter refers to [imaginations that are prevalent] from that [first meditative concentration] as far as the summit of existence, as well as to the temporary mind and mental states associated with unconsciousness and sleep. However, the last mentioned are not designated as “perpetually non-symbolic” (mtshan ma gtan nas med pa) but as “inferior states which are subject to cessation.”
Alternatively, imaginations may include those associated with dissonant mental states (kliṣṭavikalpa, nyon mongs can gyi rnam rtog) and those associated with non-dissonant mental states (akliṣṭavikalpa, nyon mongs can ma yin pa'i rnam rtog). Among these, the former are the non-virtuous imaginations prevalent in the world system of desire, while the latter are the imaginations compounded by uncorrupted [states]. Among these, three further types are also distinguished, namely, object-oriented [imaginations] (ālambanavikalpa, yul la 'jug pa), investigative [imaginations] (paryeṣakavikalpa, 'tshol ba po), and analytical imaginations (pratyavekṣakavikalpa, so sor rtog pa'i rnam rtog).[257]

Elaborating on these [five foundational factors of epistemology], if I might offer some further words of explanation:[260] Since names and appearances are neither identical nor different, they are both [said to be] “inexpressible apart from the absolute reality,”[261] while it is also said of the four other foundational factors in relation to the absolute reality that they too are “inexpressible apart from the absolute reality.”
[In terms of their defining characteristics, ] appearances are the defining characteristic of the subjective aspect of false imagination. This is because while appearances are the objective aspect of imagination they are also the agent or enactor of a given object of imagination. Names are the defining characteristics of the ground or locus from which conventional expressions originate.
[In term of substantial and imputed existents, ] both false imagination that objectifies appearances and genuine knowledge are [classed as] “substantial existents” (rdzas yod), while names are [classed as] “imputed existents” (btags yod). Those aspects [of imagination] that apprehend [both] names and appearances are [classed as] substantial existents. Absolute reality transcends both substantial and imputed existents.[262]
[In terms of the three natures, those postulated concepts] which are not apprehended on the basis of appearances are assigned, along with names, to the imaginary nature (parikalpita, kun brtags). Both false imagination and genuine knowledge are assigned to the dependent nature (paratantra, gzhan dbang). The absolute reality refers to the unchanging consummate nature (pariniṣpanna, yongs grub).[163]
With regard to the term “factor” (chos) as employed here in the expression “five [foundational] factors” (chos lnga), it conveys the sense of a foundation [of epistemology], facilitating the understanding of phenomena. Alternatively, these [five factors] are also known as the “five entities” (pañcavastu, dngos po lnga), simply indicating that they have the causal efficacy of substantial entities (bhāvasadartha, dngos po'i don yod pa).[264]
The expression “five foundational factors” was mentioned by the Conqueror himself [in the sūtras of the final promulgation],[265] because the factors of demonstration (lakṣyadharma, mtshan gzhi chos) among the twofold division of defining characteristics and demonstration, and all phenomenological categories associated with the supportive [consciousness] (rten gyi shes bya thams cad) among the twofold division of the supportive [consciousness] and its supported [objects], are subsumed within these five [foundational factors].

Designated objects imputed by means of verbal and mental expression and by the false imagination of the mind are assigned to the imaginary nature. In the case of a designated object imputed by the term “vase,” for example, the act of designation is carried out by the imaginations of mental consciousness and its peripheral mental states.
When classified, [the imaginary nature] comprises the following three aspects:
(1) the imaginary nature of delimited characteristics (paricchedaparikalpita, mtshan nyid yongs su chad pa'i kun btags), exemplified by objects that are apprehended through the [deluded] apprehension of individual selfhood (pudgalātma, gang zag gi bdag). In this case even the apprehended object is precluded by nature because despite its apparent image, individual selfhood does not actually exist as a phenomenological category.
(1) the nominal imaginary (paryāyaparikalpita, rnam grangs pa'i kun btags), which is exemplified by the dualistic appearances of the subject-object dichotomy
(3) the referentially imputed imaginary (Itos nas btags pa), which may be exemplified by [the concept of] “large” imputed in relation to “small,” and “west” imputed in relation to “east”[267]
Alternatively, [the imaginary nature] also alludes to the dichotomy between the basis of designation (gdags gzhi) and the designator (gdags byed), and the dichotomy between the imagining of the essential nature [of an object] and its attributes (ngo bo nyid dang khyad par gyi kun btags).[268]
Or else, taking the case of the Sūtra of the Descent to Lanka, although the verses of the version translated from Sanskrit mention ten aspects (rnam pa bcu) [of the imaginary nature, here] in conformity with the version translated from Chinese, where a more detailed explanation is found, referring to twelve [aspects], the text says:[269]
The imaginary nature has twelve aspects
And the dependent nature has six aspects.
These [twelve] are said to include false imaginations of verbal expression, false imaginations of absolute reality, false imaginations of defining characteristics, false imaginations of property, false imaginations of nature, false imaginations of causes, false imaginations of philosophical views, false imaginations of reasoning, false imaginations of birth, false imaginations of non-birth, false imaginations of interdependence, and false imaginations of bondage and emancipation.[270]

The dependent nature [lit. “that which is subject to extraneous control”] (paratantra, gzhan dbang) is assigned to “apperception alone” or “ideation alone” (vijñaptimātra, rnam parrigpa tsam), arising through its own intrinsic causes and conditions.
“Intrinsic” implies that the causes and conditions that give rise to this apperceptive consciousness originate from factors that are appropriate or in conformity with it. The term “extraneous” here refers to the diverse propensities which are imprinted upon the substratum, and it is under the “control” of these propensities that the substratum consciousness, congruent with apperception, becomes manifest.
When there is only a radiant and aware consciousness, uncontrolled by propensities, the apperception does not become diversified and abides right where it is, [unmodified, ] but otherwise, through its dependence on propensities, the apperception does become diversified.
When classified, [the dependent nature] has two aspects: the dependent nature comprising the seeds of all dissonant mental states (kun nas nyon mongs pa sa bon gyi gzhan dbang) and the dependent nature in which neither deluded nor purified mental states inherently exist (kun byang gi ngo bor ma grub pa'i gzhan dbang), because conscious awareness is pure and unmodified by propensities.[271]
Alternatively, [the dependent nature] may be classified according to the impure mundane dependent nature (ma dag 'jig rten pa'i gzhan dbang), in which the mind and mental states of the three world systems manifest as real existents through the power of propensities, and the pure mundane dependent nature (dag pa 'jig rten pa'i gzhan dbang), in which appearances devoid of substantial existence manifest in an illusory manner during the post-meditative experiences of sublime beings.[272]
Or else, it may be classified into six aspects, in accordance with the following sixfold enumeration that is mentioned in the Sūtra of the Descent to Laṅka: (1) visual consciousness and the physical forms that are its object; (2) the mental states that originate within its periphery; (3) the dissonant mental consciousness that closely depends upon these [mental states]; (4) the substratum that is the initial entry-point of diversification; (5) the application of this general process to the other [modes of consciousness]; and (6) the relation of the six modes [of engaged consciousness] to the substratum and the dissonant mental consciousness.[273]

The term “consummate nature” (pariniṣpanna, yongs grub) refers to the actual reality of all phenomena, the original ultimate [truth]. Although from the perspective of its essential nature, the consummate cannot be differentiated, there are many classifications corresponding to each of its distinct nuances or facets. Therefore, its [synonyms] which have been enumerated [in the sūtras] include the “reality of physical form” (rūpatathatā, gzugs kyi de bzhin nyid) and the “reality of feeling” (vedanātathatā, tshor ba'i de bzhin nyid).
The sublime Asaṅga, with an enlightened intention directed respectively towards the naturally pure aspect, freedom from adventitious stains, the pristine cognition of the [spiritual] path, and those who have as their objective meditation on the path of the Buddhas scriptures, has said that, without differentiating proper and conventional terms, [the consummate nature] comprises four aspects, namely, (1) the natural consummate nature (svabhāvapariniṣpanna, rang bzhin yongs grub), (2) the immaculate consummate nature (vimalapariniṣpanna, dri med yongs grub), (3) the consummate nature of the spiritual path (mārgapariniṣpanna, lam yongs grub), and (4) the consummate nature of the [scriptural] objectives (ālambanapariniṣpanna, dmigs pa yongs grub).[274]
Also, in the Analysis of the Middle and Extremes, it is revealed that there are also two aspects: (1) the unchanging consummate nature ('gyur med yongs grub) and (2) the incontrovertible consummate nature (phyin ci ma log pa'i yongs grub).[275]

Elaborating on the aspects of the three natures [that have just been summarized], there are also [other] particular analyses that have been mentioned in the Ornament of the Sūtras of the Greater Vehicle and in the Summary of the Greater Vehicle.
[Analysis of the Imaginary Nature]
Firstly, there are the ten aspects of distracting false imagination (daśavikṣepavikalpa, rnam gYeng gi rnam rtog bcu), which are related to the imaginary nature (parikalpita). These comprise (1) imaginations of nonexistence (abhāvavikalpa, med par rtog pa), (2) imaginations of existence (bhāvavikalpa, yod par rtog pa), (3) imaginations of exaggeration or reification (adhyāropavikalpa, sgro 'dogs par rtog pa), (4) imaginations of underestimation or repudiation (apavādavikalpa, skur 'debs kyi rtog pa), (5) imaginations of singularity (ekatvavikalpa, gcig tu 'dzin pa'i rtog pa), (6) imaginations of multiplicity (nānātvavikalpa, du mar 'dzin pa'i rtog pa), (7) imaginations of inherent existence (svabhāvavikalpa, rang gi ngo bo nyid du 'dzin pa'i rtog pa),
(8) imaginations of attribution or qualification (viśeṣavikalpa, khyad par du rtog pa), (9) imaginations of meanings that accord with names [i. e., naïve realism] (yathānāmārthābhiniveśavikalpa, ming la don du rtog pa), and (10) imaginations of names that accord with meanings [i. e., naïve substantialism] (yathārthanāmābhiniveśavikalpa, don la ming du rtog pa).[276] These are enumerated as aspects of false imagination which may be imputed in all sorts of contexts, and it is on this basis that the process of reification actually comes to partake of the imaginary nature.
More generally, it is explained that there are (1) fundamental imaginations—the substratum consciousness (mūlavikalpa, rtsa ba'i rnam rtog kun gzhi'i rnam shes), as well as (2) symbolic imaginations that apprehend objects (ṇimittavikalpa, yul du 'dzin pa mtshan ma'i rnam rtog)', (3) imaginations that mirror the six modes of [engaged] consciousness (nimittābhāsavikalpa, rnam shes drug mtshan snang gi rnam rtog); (4) changeable and symbolic imaginations (nimittapariṇāmavikalpa, mtshan ma 'gyur ba'i rnam rtog), which include feelings of happiness, suffering, and so forth; (5) changeable imaginations that mirror the variations of the six modes of [engaged] consciousness (nimittābhāsapariṇāmavikalpa, rnam shes druggi 'gyurba las byung ba mtshan ma snang bar 'gyur ba'i rnam rtog); (6) imaginations disclosed by other intellectual efforts consequent on having studied Buddhist and non-Buddhist teachings (parānvayavikalpa, chos dang chos ma yin pa thos pa'i rjes su blo gzhol ba gzhan gyis bstan pa'i rnam rtog); (7) inappropriate imaginations (ayoniśovikalpa, tshul bzhin ma yin pa'i rnam rtog), such as the view that postulates a [permanent] self; (8) appropriate imaginations (yoniśovikalpa, tshul bzhin gyi rnam rtog), such as [the view of] impermanence; (9) imaginations that manifesdy cling to negative views (abhiniveśavikalpa, lta ngan la mngon par zhen pa'i rnam rtog); and (10) distracting imaginations (vikṣepavikalpa, rnam par gYeng ba'i rnam rtog).[277]
Although, on account of the limitless number of imputative imaginations, there are seemingly limitless classifications of the imaginary nature, imputed by them, even so the last-mentioned classifications are explained to be particularly relevant and are listed alongside the objectives of [spiritual] training on the grounds that they are to be rejected by bodhisattvas.[278]

[Analysis of the Dependent Nature]
The eleven aspects of apperception (rnam rig bcu gcig), which derive from the dependent nature, comprise[279]
(1) the apperception that the physical manifestations of propensities which are “only consciousness” appear to the sense faculty of the body (rnam shes tsam bag chags kyi gzugs snang ba lus kyi dbang por snang ba'i rnam rig)
(2) the apperception that corporeal forms become manifest to the faculty of visual consciousness (mig shes dbang por snang ba lus can gyi rnam
rig)
(3) the apperception of the consumer mental consciousness (yid kyi rnam shes za ba po'i rnam rig)[280]
(4) the apperception of resources that manifest as the six objects [of sensory consciousness] (yul drug tu snang ba nye bar spyad bya'i rnam rig)
(5) the apperception of resources associated with visual consciousness and so forth (mig shes sogs nye bar longs spyod pa'i rnam rig)
(6) the apperception of temporal divisions that become manifest, such as years and months (lo dang zla ba sogs dus su snang ba'i rnam rig)
(7) the apperception of numeric categories that become manifest, such as units, tens, hundreds, and thousands (gcig bcu brgya stong sogs grangs su snang ba'i rnam rig)
(8) the apperception of geographical features that become manifest, such as villages, cities, forests, and mountains (grong dang grong khyer nags tshal dang ri la sogs pa yul gyi snang ba'i rnam rig)
(9) the apperception [of linguistic concepts] that manifest as conventional terms, phrases, and letters (tha snyad ming tshig yi ge gsum du snang ba'i rnam rig)
(10) the apperception of self that becomes manifest with reference to one's own body, speech, and mind (rang gi lus ngag yid gsum la dmigs nas bdag tu snang ba'i rnam rig)
(11) the apperception of others that becomes manifest with reference to the body, speech, and mind of others (gzhan gyi lus ngag yid gsum la dmigs nas gzh an du snang ba'i rnam rig)
Among these, with regard to [the first] five, which concern the sense faculties, there is an “apperception only” (vijñaptimātra, rnam par rig pa tsam) which manifests as these [faculties]. The middle four originate exclusively through the power of inbuilt propensities (abhidānavāsanā, mngon brjod kyi bag chags). The last two originate from the propensities that maintain the [mistaken] view of a [permanent] self.[281]

[Analysis of the Consummate Nature]
The consummate nature also has nine further aspects, as is stated in the Extensive Mother (Yum rgyas pa), namely, (1) the absolute reality (tathatā, de bzhin nyid), (2) the unmistaken absolute reality (avitathatā, ma nor ba'i de bzhin nyid), (3) the non-extraneous absolute reality (ananyatathatā, gzhan ma yin pa'i de bzhin nyid), (4) the actual reality (dharmatā, chos nyid), (5) the expanse of reality (dharmadhātu, chos kyi dbyings), (6) the abiding nature of reality (dharmasthititā, chos gnas pa nyid), (7) the stainless nature of reality (dharmanirdoṣatā, chos skyon med pa nyid), (8) the genuine goal (bhūtakoṭi, yang dag pa'i mtha'), and (9) the inconceivable expanse (acintyadhātu, bsam gyis mi khyab pa'i dbyings).[282]
These are respectively identified by the master Vasubandhu with (1) the consummate nature devoid of fear ('jigs pa med pa yongs su grub pa), (2) the incontrovertible [consummate nature] (phyin ci ma log pa), (3) the unchanging [consummate nature] ('gyur ba med pa), (4) the [consummate nature] devoid of inherent existence (ngo bo nyid med pa), (5) the [consummate nature present] as the seed of all purificatory teachings (rnam par byang ba'i chos kyi rgyu nyid du), (6) [the consummate nature] present at all times (dus thams cad du), (7) the irreversible [consummate nature] (phyir mi ldog pa), (8) the [consummate nature] of the real (tattva, de kho na nyid), and (9) [the consummate nature] that transcends the path of sophistry (rtog ge'i lam las 'das pa).[283]
The expression “and so forth” (sogs) here implies that when the consummate nature is further classified, it may be exemplified by the sixteen aspects of emptiness (ṣoḍaśaśūnyatā, stong nyid bcu drug),[284] and that the other two [natures] have also acquired many [additional] aspects.

When these [diverse aspects of the three natures] are all subsumed, the inconceivable appearances which are the bewildering apparitional aspect of the dependent nature, and the substratum consciousness, which is the repository of all seeds and the ground from which that [apparitional aspect] arises, are not extraneous to the imaginary nature. For this reason, the natures that are classified may be reduced to two: (1) the imaginary nature that relates to phenomena (dharmaparikalpitalakṣaṇa, chos kun brtags kyi mtshan nyid) and (1) the consummate nature that relates to actual reality (dharmatāpariniṣpannalakṣaṇa, chos nyid yongs su grub pa'i mtshan nyid).
More generally, with regard to the relationship between these two natures—one combining the imaginary and the dependent, and the other being the consummate—it is also said that they are [all] “inexpressible apart from the absolute reality”[285] The imaginary is the aspect which imputes reification or exaggeration, and the dependent is the object of this reification or exaggeration. The consummate is the actual reality of those other two aspects. Therefore, when the three natures are analyzed from one perspective they are not identical, but when analyzed from another perspective, they are not different. So it is that they are not established as being identical or different in any respect.[286]

It is said in the Ornament of the Sūtras of the Greater Vehicle that
(1) The imaginary nature is designated as the “emptiness of non-existence” (abhāvaśūnyatā, med pa'i stong pa nyid) and in terms of both the [ultimate and the relative] truths, it is devoid of inherent existence.
(2) The dependent nature is designated as the “emptiness of existence” (bhāvaśūnyatā, yod pa'i stong pa nyid) and is non-existent from the standpoint of ultimate [truth] (paramārthasatya, don dam bden pa) but does exist in terms of the relative truth (saṃvṛtisatya, kun rdzob bden pa).
(3 The consummate nature is designated as the “emptiness of inherent existence” (svabhāvaśūnyatā, rang bzhin stong pa nyid) and abides as the actual reality of all things.[288]
This modality is also mentioned in the following passage from the [Sūtra of the] Transcendental Perfection of Discriminative Awareness in Five Hundred Lines:[289]
What, you might ask, Subhūti, is the meditative stability of emptiness with regard to physical form? Subhūti, this one-pointed focusing of the mind on physical form, [firstly] with reference to the emptiness of its non-substantiality, and similarly with reference to the emptiness of its substantiality, and [thirdly] with reference to the emptiness of its inherent existence, is known as the meditative stability of emptiness (śūnyatāsamādhi). So it is that the bodhi-sattvas should completely understand meditative stability with regard to physical form.

The second aspect concerns the demonstrations of the three natures, which maybe exemplified as follows: Whether there are appearances that arise before visual consciousness or appearances that arise before mental consciousness, at the time when [this visual or mental object] appears [for example] as a “vase,” the aspect which apprehends the vase is the imaginary nature. The bare consciousness, radiant and aware, which distinguishes it is the dependent nature, and the pristine cognition that remains when the imaginary and dependent natures have ceased to exist is held to be the consummate nature.
Then, taking as another example a dissonant mental state, such as attachment or hatred: When a strong attachment or hatred arises in the mind, the afflictive apparitional aspect of attachment or hatred is the imaginary nature, the aspect of radiant awareness that cognizes it is the dependent nature, and the pristine cognition, free from conceptual elaboration, that permeates all things in a common savor is the consummate nature.
In this context, the expression “common savor” (ro mnyam) may be understood as follows: Although, for example, the radiant and aware aspect of the consciousness of hatred and the radiant and aware aspect of the consciousness of attachment are both very similar, because they relate to different things, they are not mutually inclusive. However, according to the consummate nature of these [apparently dissimilar mental states] they are essentially inseparable, for which reason they are of a common savor in their essential nature.[290]
One should know that this analogy may also be applied to [the apparent dichotomy between all] the phenomenological categories of the path and the result.

The definitive establishment of the three natures is extensively found in the sūtras of the final promulgation, but it can equally be recognized in [the writings of] venerable Maitreya and in Nāgārjuna's Commentary on the Sūtra of the Shoots of Rice.[291]
A somewhat different interpretation may be found, however, in Vasuban-dhu's Dissertation on the Thirty Verses, which is well known among the exponents of extraneous emptiness.[292] Accordingly, the mighty lord of awareness [Vasubandhu] has clearly established that[293]
The objects that are imputed by false imagination Are the imaginary nature,
While the imaginations [themselves] are the dependent [nature],
And their emptiness is the consummate nature.
I disagree with those who think that the definitive structure of the three essential natures is a tradition that is known only to the Cittamatrins (sems tsam pa) and not to the Mādhyamika (dbu ma pa).[294] Indeed, it says in the Chapter Requested by Maitreya from the Sūtra of the Transcendental Perfection of Discriminative Awareness:[295]
Maitreya, the thorough analysis of physical form has three aspects: the thorough analysis of the imaginary nature, the thorough analysis of the imputed nature (rnam par btags pa'i mtshan nyid), and the thorough analysis of the nature of actual reality.
The systematic presentation of the three natures of our own tradition is also established in [Candrakīrti's] Auto-commentary on the Introduction [to Madh-yamaka] and in [Śāntaraksita's] Auto-commentary on the Ornament of Madh-yamaka.[296] Furthermore, in [Kamalaśīla's] Lamp of Madhyamaka, it says:
It is not the case that the adherents of Madhyamaka do not admit the systematic presentation of the three essential natures. I will reject any contradictory comments, such as those that can be seen in other [writings].
Therefore, the definitive structure of the three essential natures is clearly presented, again and again, in the textual traditions of Madhyamaka.
Furthermore, it says in [Nagarjuna's] Commentary on Enlightened Mind:
The imaginary, dependent, and consummate natures Are all of an identical nature, emptiness,
But they are imputed within the mind.
On this basis, it can certainly be asserted that all phenomena are mind, that the nature of this mind, described by many synonyms including inner radiance (prabhāsvara), emptiness (śūnyatā), ultimate reality (paramārtha), buddha nature (dhātu), the nucleus of those gone to bliss (sugatagarbha), and so forth, is the consummate nature, that the relative appearances of this mind as mere illusory apperception are the dependent nature, and that the aspect imputed as the dualistic phenomena of the subject-object dichotomy and so forth, even while apperception is non-existent, is the imaginary nature.

However the first two of the three natures—the imaginary and the dependent—arise, it is the case that they do so through the power of dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda, rten cing 'brel bar 'byung ba). The consummate nature may also be explained in terms of dependent origination with an intention directed towards the ultimate aspect of dependent origination ('paramārthapratītyasamutpāda), even though it is not actually subject to relative dependent origination (samvṛtipratītyasamutpāda).[298]
In general, [the term] “dependent origination” denotes the dependent origination that is endowed with generated and generative aspects (utpād-yotpādakapratītyasamutpāda, bskyed bya skyed byed kyi rten 'brel), which are [respectively] the fruitional and causal processes associated with the arising of the physical environment and its sentient inhabitants, along with the inner consciousness. These processes principally fall within the scope of the dependent nature.
The same term may also denote the dependent origination that is endowed with determined and determinative aspects (sthāpanīyasthāpakapratītya-samutpāda, gzhag by a dang 'jog byed kyi rten 'brel). Here, the determinative aspects ('jog byed) occur with reference to the [just-mentioned] generated and generative [causal nexus] and may be exemplified by the arising of the consciousness in which a shoot appears from the consciousness in which a seed appears. The determined or relational aspects (gzhag bya) also occur without reference to this [causal nexus] and may be exemplified by the determination of “small” in relation to Targe.” In brief, these interrelated aspects [of causality] principally fall within the scope of the imaginary nature.[299]
As far as the genuine dependent origination (samyakpratītyasamutpāda, yang dag pa'i rten 'brel) is concerned, it is this that determines [the composition of] the substratum consciousness, along with all its propensities. This is one of the two categories of dependent origination—provisional and genuine—which are identified within the dependent origination of the generative and generated [causal nexus]; and for this reason it is subsumed within the dependent nature.[300]

When all phenomena are investigated, although they [ultimately] abide as emptiness, without inherent existence in any respect, the characteristic or essential nature of dependent origination is that this is an [empirical process] that occurs only with regard to appearances, and it arises contingent on them. It is said in the Fundamental Stanzas of Madhyamaka, entitled Discriminative Awareness:[302]
Whatever is dependently originated,
This has been explained as emptiness.
It is imputed [as existent], dependent on [something else].
This is indeed the path of Madhyamaka.
Because there is nothing that is not dependently originated,
There is nothing that is not empty.

The Tibetan term rten 'brel [translated as “dependent origination”] in the original Sanskrit is rendered as pratītyasamutpāda. The prefix pratītya [here] conveys the meanings or a congregation, a convergence or an encounter.”[303] Samutpāda means “generated” or “originated.” The point is that, whatever object one considers, it is impossible for diverse results to arise from a single cause, or for only a single result to arise from diverse causes. Rather, diverse results originate dependent on an encounter or convergence of diverse causes and conditions, or else one might say that [causal] links originate in dependence on previous links.[304]

The essential nature of fundamental ignorance (avidyā, ma rig pa), which is the first of the twelve links of dependent origination (dvādaśāṅgapra-tītyasamutpāda, rten 'brel gyi yan lag bcu gnyis), is that it is the opposite or disharmonious counterpoint of awareness (vidyā, rig pa) and is endowed with the following three particular attributes: (1) it implies a consciousness that refers objectively to its object; (2) it implies that the sense data of this object are extremely inconspicuous; and (3) it is the gateway through which the mental continuum arises in a non-quiescent dissonant or afflicted state.[307]
Although [fundamental ignorance] has many classifications, it [essentially comprises] both the ignorance endowed with dissonant mental states (kliṣṭāvidyā, nyon mong pa can gyi ma rig pa) and the ignorance devoid of dissonant mental states (akliṣṭāvidyā, nyon mong pa can ma yin pa'i ma rig pa). The former is the causal basis of cyclic existence, the obscuration comprising dissonant mental states (kleśāvaraṇa, nyon mong gi sgrib) that obscures [the attainment of] release [from cyclic existence]. The latter is the obscuration of knowable phenomena (jñeyāvaraṇa, shes bya'i sgrib), which obscures [the attainment of] omniscience (sarvajñā, thams cad mkhyen pa).
According to this tradition [of Tāranātha], fundamental ignorance (mūlāvidyā, rtsa ba'i ma rig pa) actually lies within the periphery of the dissonant mental consciousness and is said to denote “delusion with respect to [the erroneous imputation of] a self.”[308]
There are also some who have simplistically stated that, from the perspective of its conspicuousness, [ignorance] is recognized as and identified with the [aforementioned egotistical] views that uphold mundane aggregates (satkāyadṛṣṭi, 'jig tshogs su lta ba).[309]

The second link [of dependent origination] comprises formative predispositions (saṃskāra, 'du byed) which may be associated with meritorious past actions (bsod nams kyi las), non-meritorious past actions (bsod nams min pa'i las), or unwavering or non-dynamic past actions (āniñjyakarma, mi gYo ba'i las). The first of these are the virtuous past actions pertaining to the world-system of desire; the second are the non-virtuous past actions associated with the world-system of desire; and the third are the past actions, or meditative stabilities, through which the two higher world-systems [of form and formlessness] are attained.[310]
The third link [of dependent origination] is the substratum consciousness (ālayavijñāna, kun gzhi'i rnam shes) upon which the propensities of past actions are imposed, for which reason they represent the transformational aspect of this consciousness. It includes both the [substratum] consciousness that is replete with causal imprints and the [substratum] consciousness replete with fruitional imprints.[311]
The fourth link [of dependent origination] comprises name and form (nāmarūpa, ming gzugs). Here “name” refers to the four nominal aggregates (ming bzhi'i phung po), i. e., the four subsequent aggregates of feelings, and so forth. Although there are reasons for these [feelings, perceptions, formative predispositions, and consciousness] being assigned to the “four nominal aggregates,” the aggregate of physical forms should not be understood as being dependent on names because it manifests directly within the perceptual range of the five sensory consciousnesses. By contrast, the four subsequent aggregates, being present in the mental continua of others (parasāntānika, gzhan gyi rgyud la yod pa),[312] are understood to be dependent on names.[313]
The link of form comprises the five stages of embryonic and fetal development (mngal gyi skabs lnga), known respectively as the clotting of the embryo (kalala, nur nur po), the oval formation of the embryo (arbuda, mer mer po), the rounded formation or solidification of the embryo (peśi, gor gor po), the suspension of the embryo (ghana, mkhrang 'gyur), and the limb formation of the fetus (praśākha, rkang lag rnam par 'gyus pa).[314]
The fifth link [of dependent origination] comprises the six sensory activity fields (ṣaḍāyatana, skye mched drug), the essential nature of which is that they clearly demarcate the six sense organs, consequent on the five stages of embryonic and fetal development.[315]

The sixth link [of dependent origination] is sensory contact (sparśa, reg pa). Following birth from the womb, there emerges sensory contact, in which sense objects, sense organs, and consciousness all converge together. However, sensory contact actually refers to a transformation that occurs in consciousness [prior to birth] due to the presence [in the womb] of its sense objects, and consequent on the interaction of consciousness and its sense objects.[316]
The seventh link [of dependent origination] is sensation (vedanā, tshor ba). Dependent on that sensory contact, sensations or feelings of happiness, suffering, and neutrality are then experienced. This process may be exemplified as follows: Through the convergence of the sense organ of the eye with its sense objects—comprising pleasant physical forms—and visual consciousness, visual consciousness initially generates sensory contact, which delimits its sense objects. Immediately thereafter, there arises the sensation of happiness, which is experienced through that sensory contact.[317]
Since this analysis of the three types of sensation may be made in relation to all of the six [modes of engaged] sensory consciousness, sensations are collectively designated as the eighteen sensory objects that impact upon the mind (aṣṭādaśamanopavicāra, yid nye bar rgyu ba bco brgyad).[318]
The eighth link [of dependent origination] is craving (tṛṣṇā, sred pa), which refers to the craving and attachment that occur in relation to the three [just-mentioned] types of sensation—those of happiness, suffering, and neutrality.
Now there are [three aspects of craving] that may arise: the craving that one might not be separated from happiness, the craving that desires separation from suffering, and the craving that desires not to be separated from neutrality.
Alternatively, craving may comprise the craving that desires rebirth (kāmatṛṣṇā, srid pa la 'dod pa'i sred pa), the craving associated with the rebirth process (bhavatṛṣṇā, srid pa'i sred pa), and the craving associated with decay or perishable phenomena (vibhavatṛṣṇā, 'jig pa'i sred pa). The first of these is [the craving] associated with the world-system of desire, the second is [the craving] associated with the two higher world systems, and the third is the craving that grasps after [material] resources.[319]

The ninth link [of dependent origination] is grasping (upādāna, len pa), which originates dependent on craving. When, for example, there is craving for and attachment to the sensa of pleasurable objects, such as food, drink, and resources, the desire that these [pleasures] might repeatedly arise, and the potential to engage in diverse activities in pursuit of that goal, are designated as “grasping.”
It is said that there are four kinds of grasping (caturupādāna, nye bar len pa bzhi), namely, the grasping after desires (kāmopādāna., 'dod pa'i len pa), the grasping of rebirth (bhavopādāna, srid pa'i len pa),[320] the grasping of [erroneous] views (dṛṣṭyopādāna, lta ba'i len pa), and the grasping after belief in an [inherently existing] self (ātmavādopādāna, bdag tu smra ba'i nye bar len pa).
Through these [aspects of grasping], the subsequent links [of dependent origination] are formed or fulfilled.[321]
The tenth link [of dependent origination] is the rebirth process (bhava, srid pa), which is endowed with the potent function of implementing reincarnation.[322]
The eleventh link [of dependent origination] is actual birth (jāti, skye ba). Now, with reference to the [initial] manifestation of the link of birth, this coincides with the moment of conception (pratisaṃdhi, nying mtshams sbyor ba), and [from that perspective] everything following the moment of conception [is said to be included within] the twelfth link of aging and death (jarāmaraṇa, rga shi'i yan lag).[323]
Having obtained the circumstances of birth, starting with the clotting of the embryo, from then on, there is a continuous series of indivisible time moments, which is [known as] “aging.” In this context, [the process of aging] is included within the single link of aging and death. This is said to be the case because if there is no aging, there is also no death.
Therefore, one should know that in respect of all [phenomena] that arise, there are two processes of unfolding (dvisammukhībhāva, mngon du 'gyur ba gnyis): one [static process] whereby the twelve links of dependent origination manifest the propensities imposed on the substratum, and one [dynamic process] whereby the twelve links are manifested through the maturation of the seeds [of past actions].[324]

The individual functions of these [twelve links of dependent origination] are presented in one and a half stanzas from the [Analysis of the] Middle and Extremes.[325]
[Accordingly, it is said that]
(1) The function of fundamental ignorance is to obscure the vision of the genuine truth, and similarly, through the power of that [fundamental ignorance]:
(2) The function of formative predispositions is to cause the seeds of past actions to be sown in the substratum.
(3) The function of consciousness is to convey [formative predispositions] towards [an appropriate] place of birth, in conformity with those seeds [of past actions].
(4) The function of name and form is to fully embrace a physical body, corresponding to the direction in which [consciousness] has been conveyed.
(5) The function of the six sensory activity fields is to fully perfect a physical body, corresponding to that which is embraced [by name and form].
(6) The function of sensory contact is to integrate the three aspects [of the sense objects, sense organs, and consciousness] through the power of those [sensory activity fields] and to delimit the sense objects.
(7) The function of sensation is to partake of happiness and so forth, corresponding to the [sense objects] that have been delimited [by sensory contact].
(8) The function of craving is to acquire rebirth corresponding to one's past actions, through the power of these [sensations].
(9) The function of grasping is to conjoin the consciousness with birth, corresponding to that craving.
(10) The function of the rebirth process is to manifestly propel a reincarnating [consciousness] towards birth, corresponding to that union [induced by craving].
(11) The function of birth is to engender an aggregate of suffering through the power of that [rebirth process].
(12) The function of aging and death is to transform youth and vitality in accordance with the disadvantages [of birth].
All of these [functions] indeed induce dissonant mental states, conducive [to rebirth] within cyclic existence.

This [realization] was presented as the lot of only bodhisattvas of highest acumen who enter into the Greater Vehicle, but was not disclosed to the other two sorts of spiritual being who follow the way of Buddhism. This means that it is a realization attained uniquely by bodhisattvas or buddhas, whereas the pious attendants and hermit buddhas are not even partly aware of it.[327]

Attractive [goals] (priya, sdugpa) are pleasant or agreeable, while unattractive [goals] (apriya, mi sdug pa) are unpleasant or disagreeable. Distinguishing between these two accords with the twelve links of dependent origination. This [realization] was presented by the transcendent lord [Buddha] to both the pious attendants and the hermit buddhas who follow the way of Buddhism. Although both of these types meditate in accordance with this teaching, the hermit buddhas extensively understand the [two] processes of dependent origination, namely, its “arising process” (anuloma, lugs 'byung) and its “reversal process” (pratiloma, lugs ldog), whereas the pious attendants do not extensively understand the [processes] of dependent origination through their own comprehension, as do the hermit buddhas.[328]
Now this process [distinguishing attractive and unattractive goals] has two aspects, which refer respectively to dissonant mental states (saṃklesa, kun nas nyon mongs pa) and to purification (vyavadāna, rnam byang).[329]
The former, [evolving in association with dissonant mental states, ] includes a [positive] process that gives rise to birth within the higher realms (svarga, mtho ris) through the power of corrupt virtuous actions that are concomitant with ignorance (ma rig pa dang mtshungs ldan gyi dge ba zag bcas) and is designated as the “dependent origination that distinguishes attractive goals” (sdug pa rnam par 'byed pa'i rten 'brel). It also includes another [negative] process that gives rise to birth within the three lower realms (durgati, ngan song) through the power of non-virtuous actions concomitant with ignorance (ma rig pa dang mtshungs ldan pa'i las mi dge ba) and is designated as the “dependent origination that distinguishes unattractive goals” (mi sdug pa rnam par 'byed pa'i rten 'brel).
The latter, [evolving in association with purification, ] includes one process that gives rise to birth among the six classes of sentient beings through the power of virtuous and negative actions concomitant with ignorance (ma rig pa dang mtshungs ldan gyi las dge sdig) and is designated as the “dependent origination that distinguishes unattractive goals” (mi sdug pa rnam par 'byed pa'i rten 'brel). It also includes another process that obtains release [from rebirth in cyclic existence] through the power of uncorrupted virtuous actions (dge ba zag med) and is therefore designated as the “dependent origination that distinguishes attractive goals” (sdug pa rnam par 'byed pa'i rten 'brel).
The verb “distinguishes” (rnam par 'byed pa), in this context, means “augments” ('phel ba) or “magnifies” (rgyas pa). This is because it is by means of all the diverse appearances, including visible forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangible phenomena, and all the inauthentic imaginations associated with mind and mental states, that propensities are imposed upon the substratum, causing the substratum itself to be “augmented” or “magnified.”

The dependent origination associated with sensory engagement is the process that causes the six modes of consciousness to arise and cease. In this context, it is said that “sensation” refers to the experiencer or subject of sensory engagement, “sensory contact” to the object of sensory engagement, and the “act of sensory engagement” to the entity where this [interaction] occurs.[330]
For example, [taking] an agreeable visual form as the referential condition (ālambanapratyaya,, dmigs pa'i rkyen); the sense organ of the eye as the predominant condition (adhipatipratyaya, bdag po'i rkyen); visual consciousness as the causal condition (hetupratyaya, rgyu'i rkyen), occurring in the first moment [of this perceptual process]; and the mental activity that desires to engage with the object as the immediate condition (samanantarapratyayay mtshungs pa de ma thag pa'i rkyen): through the power of these fully present four conditions, visual consciousness is generated.
The interaction of this visual consciousness with the visual form that is its object is [known as] “sensory contact” (sparśa, reg pa). The sensation of happiness experienced through consciousness of that agreeable sensum of the object is [known as] the “gateway that generates attachment” ('dod chags skye ba'i sgo), and the [consequent] thought that desires not to be separated from that agreeable mental object is [known as] “volition” (cetanā, sems pa). Accordingly, when visual consciousness arises through these four conditions, the mental states that emerge in the periphery of this [visual consciousness] — namely, sensory contact, sensation, and volition—obscure the nature of the central mind and render it impure.
One should know by analogy that when this process depends on a disagreeable sense object, [the unhappy sensation experienced is known as] the “gateway that generates aversion” (zhe sdang skye ba'i sgo), and when it depends on a neutral or indifferent sense object, [the neutral sensation experienced is known as] the “gateway that generates delusion” (gti mug skye ba'i sgo).
In this way, the six modes of [engaged] consciousness generate the dissonant mental states of attachment, aversion, and delusion, dependent on sense objects that are respectively agreeable, disagreeable, and neutral; and there is an activation of false imagination that ensues. This is why the pious attendants undertake to control the dissonant mental states that arise dependent on those [sensations]. The controls [that they seek to impose] are implemented by means of [their understanding of ] impermanence (unitya, mi rtagpa), suffering (duḥkha, sdug bsngal), emptiness (śūnyatā, stong pa nyid), and selflessness (nairātmya, bdag med), and above all they exercise control [over dissonant mental states] by meditating on the nature of the selflessness of the individual person (pudgalanairātmya, gang zag gi bdag med).[331]

The first topic of the eightfold analysis [of dependent origination] includes the following six aspects, which are [collectively known as] the dependent origination falling within the range of dissonant mental states (kun nas nyon mongs pa'i phyogs kyi rten 'brel):[332]
(1) The dependent origination through which consciousness arises (vijñānotpattipratītyasamutpāda, rnam par shes pa 'byung ba'i rten 'brel). This is the very same dependent origination associated with sensory engagement which has just been explained [above].
(2) The dependent origination through which birth and death arise (cyutyupapattipratītyasamutpāda, skye ba dang 'chi 'pho ba 'byung ba'i rten 'brel). This [process], which is within the range of dissonant mental states, distinguishes between agreeable and disagreeable aspects, starting with the formative predispositions that arise through the condition of fundamental ignorance.
(3) The uninterrupted dependent origination of the external world (bāhyaśasyotpattipratītyasamutpāda, rgyun mi 'chad pa phyi'i rten 'br el). This is the process whereby a mass of conditions are present, such as fields, earth, water, and fertilizer, so that shoots then arise from seeds, stems from those [shoots], canes from those [stems] and ears of grain from those [canes], and fruits or harvests from those [ears of grain].
(4) The dependent origination which is an extensive analysis of the physical environment (saṃvartavivartapratītyasamutpāda, snod kyi rab tu dbye ba'i rten 'brel),[333] This [is the process] whereby [the physical environment] appears to undergo [successive phases of] creation, duration, and destruction. Also included here are the appearances of the diverse phases of growth and decline, such as [the fluctuations] in the life span which living creatures undergo as well as their positive and negative attributes.
(5) The dependent origination distinguished by means of nourishing sustenance (āhāropastambhavibhāgapratītyasamutpāda, zas kyi 'tsho bas rnam par dbye ba'i rten 'brel). This is the process whereby [living beings] are uninterruptedly sustained within the abodes of cyclic existence through the successive and consequential generation of the four kinds of nourishment (caturāhāra, zas bzhi), namely, the nourishment of the sensory bases (kavalikāhāra, kham gyi zas), the nourishment of sensory contact (sparśāhāra, regpa'i zas), the nourishment of volition (cetanāhāra, sems pa'i zas), and the nourishment of consciousness (vijñānāhāra,, rnam par shes pa'i zas).
(6) The dependent origination that distinguishes living beings according to desirable and undesirable [realms of rebirth] (iṣṭāniṣṭagativibhāgapratītyasamutpāda, 'dod pa dang mi 'dod par 'gro ba rab tu dbye ba'i rten 'brel). This is the process whereby living beings abide in the desirable abodes of happy beings through the power of virtuous past actions, and whereby living beings abide in the undesirable abodes of inferior realms of existence through the power of non-virtuous past actions.
Among these [six aspects], the dependent origination of the physical environment and the dependent origination of the external [world] are both contingent on the external container world (bhājanaloka, snod kyi 'jig rten), while the other four are all contingent on its sentient inhabitants (sattvaloka, sems can gyi 'jig rten).

(7) The [seventh aspect is] the dependent origination that is well-distinguished by means of purity (viśuddhiprabhedapratītyasamutpāda, rnam par dag pas rab tu dbye ba'i rten 'brel). This is the process whereby the five spiritual paths (pañcamārga, lam lnga) sequentially arise contingent on the three higher trainings (śikṣātraya, bslab pa gsum), and [especially] whereby the level of release [from cyclic existence, also known as] the path of no-more-learning (aśaikṣamārga, mi slob pa'i lam), is manifested contingent on the four preceding spiritual paths.[334]
(8) The [eighth aspect is] the dependent origination that is well-distinguished by means of [spiritual] power (prabhāvaprabhedapratītyasamutpāda, mthu stobs kyis rab tu dbye ba'i rten 'brel). This is the process whereby the six supernormal cognitive powers (ṣaḍabhijñā, mngon shes drug) are obtained.[335]
Concerning these six supernormal cognitive powers, it is also said in the Ornament of the Sūtras of the Greater Vehicle:[336]
The cognition that becomes manifest With respect to lives, speech, minds,
[Formerly] generated virtuous and non-virtuous actions,
Abodes, and [ultimate] renunciation,
Is the [spiritual] power of those who have attained a resolve That is unobstructed[337] throughout space,
In respect of all those distinguished variations.

</d>
<d e="2">
In this regard:
(1) Knowledge of others' lives is the supernormal cognitive power with respect to their death and subsequent rebirth (cyutopapādābhijñā, 'chi 'pho dang skye ba mngon par shes pa).[338]
(2) Knowledge of the speech uttered by those [persons] is the supernormal cognitive power of clairaudience (divyaśrotrābhijñā, lha'i rna'i mngon par shes pa).
(3) Knowledge of the minds of those [persons] is the supernormal cognitive power that knows the modalities of [other] minds (paracittaparyāyābhijñā, sems kyi rnam grangs kyi mngon par shes pa).
(4) Knowledge of the virtuous and non-virtuous actions which beings have generated in former [lives] is the supernormal cognitive power of past abodes (pūrvanivāsābhijñā, sngon gyi gnas mngon par shes pa).
(5) Knowledge of proceeding to the abodes where disciples are situated is the supernormal cognitive power of the domain of miraculous abilities (ṛddhiviṣayābhijñā, rdzu 'phrul gyi mngon par shes pa).
(6) Knowledge of the ways in which sentient beings will transcend rebirth [in cyclic existence] is the supernormal cognitive power of the cessation of corruption (āśravakṣayābhijñā, zag pa zad pa'i mngon par shes pa).
It is explained that such knowledge in respect of these six objects and their distinguished variations (rab tu dbye ba dang bcas pa), manifestly present without obstruction in all world systems, is subsumed in the supernormal cognitive powers of the bodhisattvas.[339]
The six supernormal cognitive powers of sublime bodhisattvas definitively characterize the distinguished variations of [spiritual] power; while the five supernormal cognitive powers acquired by those on the paths of provisions and connection (tshogs sbyor rnams kyi mngon shes lnga) are [said to be] in conformity with those same distinguished variations of [spiritual] power.[340] On the other hand, the attainment of [lesser] supernormal cognitive powers, miraculous abilities, and so forth, which is contingent on the mundane non-Buddhist paths, is [said] not to be in conformity with those genuine distinguished variations of [spiritual] power.
These two aspects of dependent origination fall within the range of purification.
In general, all of these eight aspects are collectively designated as the “interconnected dependent origination” (sāṃbandhikapratītyasamutpāda, 'brel ba can gyi rten 'brel), i. e., [they are aspects of] dependent origination that relate to generative [causes] and generated [results].[341]

Preceded by the [aforementioned] general exegesis of dependent origination, there now follows the detailed exegesis of the actual stages through which the twelve links [of dependent origination] arise. In this regard, the “circumstantial dependent origination” (gnas skabs kyi rten 'brel) includes both the process through which [one cycle of the twelve links] is completed over two lifetimes within the world system of desire and the process through which one cycle is completed over three lifetimes, as extensively mentioned in the sūtras delivered by the transcendent lord [Buddha]. At the outset one should understand that these two [dynamics] should not be confused or intermingled, because they have their own distinctive purposes.[343]
Now, with regard to the process through which [one cycle of the twelve links] is completed over two lifetimes, there are two projective links (ākṣepakāṅga, 'phen byed kyi yan lag gnyis), namely, fundamental ignorance and formative predispositions; and five projected links (ākṣiptāṅga, 'phangs pa'i yan lag lnga), namely, consciousness, name and form, sensory activity fields, sensory contact, and sensation. There are also two formative links (abhinirvartakāṅga, 'grub pa'i yang lag gnyis), namely, craving and grasping; and three links that are formed (abhinirvṛttyaṅga, grub pa'i yan lag gsum), namely, rebirth process, birth, and aging and death.[344]
A single cycle of the causal and fruitional phases [of dependent origination] is completed through these four processes of projection and formation ('phen grub kyi tshul bzhi). It is said that this definitive structure is applicable on the analogy [of farming], since the two links that are projected and formed should be understood to resemble the planting of seeds, and the links that bring about the projection and formation should be known to resemble the nurturing of the seeds.[345]

[In this context, ] two [links], fundamental ignorance and formative predispositions, are associated with the limit of past time (pūrvānta, sngon gyi mtha') [i. e., the immediately previous life]; while another two, birth and aging and death, are associated with the limit of future time (phyi ma'i mtha') [i. e., the immediately following life]; and the eight from consciousness to rebirth process are associated with the limits of the intervening, present [life].
Furthermore, when from the two causal [links] of fundamental ignorance and formative predispositions, the five [fruitional] links from consciousness to sensation arise, this is [regarded as] a single sequence of causal and fruitional phases. Similarly, when from the two causal [links] of craving and grasping, the three fruitional [links] of rebirth process, birth, and aging and death arise, this is also [regarded as] a single sequence of causal and fruitional phases. In this way, two cycles of causal and fruitional phases are completed over three lifetimes within the world system of desire.
This process is extensively revealed by the Buddha in order that sentient beings might reverse the three aspects of delusion, with regard to the limits of the past [life], the future [life], and the present [life].[346]

With reference to the experience of [the fruits of] the presently perceptible phenomena [of this life] (dṛṣṭadharmavedayitvā, mthong chos myong 'gyur), [it is said that the cycle of] the twelve links [of dependent origination] may also be completed in a single lifetime.
For example, when sentient beings who have committed an inexpiable crime proceed into the hells, or when, motivated by fundamental ignorance, a man becomes predisposed towards action with a strong thought desirous of being reborn as a woman, through this action, the seeds associated with rebirth in that [corresponding state] are deposited upon consciousness; and then the seeds of [the consequent] links—name and form, the six sensory activity fields, sensory contact, and sensation—are also sequentially deposited [upon that consciousness]. Whenever this occurs, and there is craving desirous of praise on account of that [sensation], as well as grasping that desires praise, motivated by that [craving], and one has consequently disparaged a group of monks, scornfully dismissing them as a group of women, by having committed that action, the previously deposited inclination to take birth as a woman will become extremely powerful, so that the presently perceptible phenomena [of this life] (mthong ba'i chos) themselves will assume those characteristics, taking on [the form] of a woman. Being born as such, the link of aging and death inevitably ensues, so that [the cycle of dependent origination] will be completed in a single lifetime.[347]

<d e="2">
With regard to the completion of the twelve links [of dependent origination] in a single instant, consequent on the completion of a [specific] deed, this may be exemplified by the act of committing murder, which implies an instantaneous dependent origination.[348]
When, for example, an act of murder is committed, the dissonant mental states present at the time when one kills a sentient being, with thoughts of hatred, motivated by fundamental ignorance, are [considered to be] the link of fundamental ignorance, and the objective of killing is the link of formative predisposition. Consequently, when one's own mind projects negativity, and the propensities to take birth in a [lower realm of existence], such as the hells, contaminate consciousness, this is [considered to be] the link of consciousness. When, at that time, the concerned individual's five psycho-physical aggregates and six sensory activity fields give rise to [further] negativity which contaminates the sensa, these are respectively [considered to be] the links [of name and form and the sensory activity fields]. When, at that time, the sense objects, sense organs, and consciousness all converge and the sense objects are delimited, this is [considered to be] the link of sensory contact. When, on that occasion, he or she experiences the killing of the victim, this is the link of sensation. When, at that time, there is a manifest craving to commit that act of murder, this is the link of craving. When he or she then desires to fulfill that deed through craving, this is the link of grasping. When the propensities for [negative] rebirth in the next life are determined by that [grasping], this is the link of the rebirth process; and when the psycho-physical aggregates determined at that time are actually transformed [into a hellish state of existence], these are [the links of] birth and aging and death.

As far as the interconnected dependent origination is concerned, according to the Analysis of the Middle and Extremes, [the process of dependent origination] is classified according to [only] eleven links, starting with [the links of] fundamental ignorance and formative predispositions and ending with birth and aging and death, which are all combined together [in a single link].
This integration is made because [the link of] birth is [designated as] the “suffering of the supportive” [physical body] (ādhāraduḥkha, rten gyi sdug bsngal), while the diverse manifestations of the aggregate of suffering, including aging, dying, unhappy thoughts, and cries of lamentation, are all [designated as] the “sufferings supported upon it” (ādheyaduḥkha, de la brten pa'i sdug bsngal). The structure presented [in this work] holds that a single cycle of these eleven links will be completed over three lifetimes.[349]

When [these twelve links] are then subsumed together, there are two kinds of synthesis that can be made, one that subsumes them according to the three categories of dissonant mental states and another that subsumes them according to only two categories.[351]
With regard to the former, the lord Nagarjuna has said [in the Nucleus of Dependent Origination according to Madhyamaka]:[352]
The first, eighth, and ninth [links] arise from dissonant mental states, The second and tenth arise from past actions,
While the remaining seven arise from suffering.
Accordingly, fundamental ignorance, craving, and grasping—these three— are [classed as] dissonant mental states arising from [other] dissonant mental states (kleśasaṃkleśa, nyon mongs pa'i kun nas nyon mongs pa); formative predispositions, and rebirth process—these two—are [classed as] dissonant mental states arising from past actions (karmasaṃkleśa, las kyi kun nas nyon mongs pa); while the remaining seven are [classed as] dissonant mental states arising from the birth of sufferings (janmasaṃkleśa, sdug bsngal rnams skye ba'i kun nas nyon mongs pa).[353]
With regard to these, it is said [by Nāgārjuna, also] in the Nucleus of Dependent Origination according to Madhyamaka:
This wheel of the rebirth process,
In which two [links] arise from three [links],
Seven [links] arise from two [links],
And three [links] again arise from seven [links],
Itself revolves repeatedly, in a cyclical manner.
Accordingly, the three categories of dissonant mental states have two functions, among which the basic function is to give rise to the seven [links], and then from these [seven links] the [original] dissonant mental states again arise, so that the process of interaction occurs in a cyclical manner, just as a chicken is produced from an egg and an egg from a chicken.
With regard to the second [kind of synthesis, in two categories], fundamental ignorance, formative predispositions, craving, grasping, and the rebirth process are all subsumed within the dissonant mental states arising from past actions, and are [designated as] the “five causal dissonant mental states” (hetusaṃkleśa), while the remainder are [designated as] the “seven fruitional dissonant mental states” (phala saṃkleśa).[354]

There is also a system according to which [dependent origination] may be presented in terms of the seven projective and formative causes ('phen grub rgyu bdun), in which case [the cycle] is completed over two lifetimes:[355]
(1) Fundamental ignorance is the cause [of perversion] (viparyāsahetu, phyin ci log tu byed pa'i rgyu) that impedes the vision of the genuine abiding nature of reality (yang dag pa'i gnas lugs) and generates an erroneous [perception].
(2) Formative predispositions are the cause [of projection] (ākṣepahetu, 'debs par byed pa'i rgyu) that deposits the propensities of past actions upon the substratum consciousness.
(3) Consciousness is the cause [of propulsion] (upanayanahetu, khrid par byed pa'i rgyu) that impels [these formative predispositions] towards the birthplace.
(4) Name and form, along with the six sensory activity fields, are the cause [of embrace] (parigrahahetu, kun tu dzin pa'i rgyu) that sustains all corporeal forms which are compatible in class.[356]
(5) Sensory contact and sensation are the cause [of engagement] (upabhogahetu, yongs su spyod pa'i rgyu) that interacts with sense objects.
(6) Craving, grasping, and rebirth process are the cause [of convergence] (ākarṣaṇahetu, yongs su sdud pa'i rgyu) that adheres to the next rebirth.
(7) Birth and aging and death are the cause [of distress] (udvegahetu., skyo ba'i rgyu) generated by suffering, which [eventually] gives rise to definitive liberation (niryāṇa/ niḥsaraṇa, nges pas 'byung ba).
In this way, seven causes are presented, among which fundamental ignorance, formative predispositions and consciousness—these three—are [classed as] the projective links (ākṣepakāṅga, 'phen byed kyi yan lag), while name and form, the sensory activity fields, sensory contact, and sensation—these four— are [classed as] the projected links (ākṣiptāṅga, 'phangs pa'i yan lag). Together these [links] constitute the “projective dependent origination” ('phen pa'i rten 'brel), and they are completed with reference to the previous life. [By contrast, ] craving, grasping, rebirth process, birth, and aging and death—these five—are [designated as] the formative links (abhinirvartakāṅga, grub pa'i yan lag), and they are completed with reference to the next life.[357]

The supreme scholar Vasubandhupāda, in his Commentary Analyzing the Sūtra of Dependent Origination, shows that when the structure of the dependent origination that is completed over two lifetimes through the fourfold process of projection and formation ('phen grub bzhi ldan) is analyzed according to its subcategories, it comprises seven aspects. [Specifically, ] the “projective dependent origination” (ākṣepapratītyasamutpāda, 'phen pa'i rten 'brel) is divided into three aspects: the projector (gang gis 'phen pa), the projection process (tshul ji ltar 'phen pa), and the projected (gang 'phangs pa). Then, consequent on this projection, the “formative dependent origination” (abhinirvartakapratītyasamutpāda, 'grub par byed pa'i rten 'brel) is also divided into three aspects: the former (gang gis grub pa), the formation process (tshul ji ltar grub pa), and the formed (gang 'grub pa). In addition, the aspect of disadvantage (ādinava, nyes dmigs) is also presented.[358]
These seven aspects or points are correlated to the sequence of the twelve links of dependent origination as follows: Among them, “the projector” refers to the two links of fundamental ignorance and the formative predispositions motivated by it. “The projection process” denotes the way in which the seeds of past actions are deposited or projected by the link of formative predispositions upon the single link of consciousness. “The projected” refers to the four [consequent links]—name and form, six sensory activity fields, sensory contact, and sensation—which are projected.
Although the seed of the next rebirth is ripened and fully projected by means of these [just-mentioned] seven links, this same seed merely exists as a potential,[359] and it is uncertain that the [corresponding] rebirth will be swiftly assumed. Therefore, it is the [next four] links of formation ('grub pa'i yan lag) that will determine the outcome of the [corresponding] rebirth, in the next life, for example, in a swift and timely manner. In this context, “the former” denotes the two links of craving and grasping through which [the next rebirth] will be formed. “The formation process” denotes the way in which that same seed of the rebirth process, existing in a potential form consequent on the previously projected [links], is actually formed. “The formed” refers to the single link of birth in the next reincarnation.
The seventh aspect, the “disadvantages,” correlates with the single link of aging and death.

These [processes], for the most part, occur [over sequential lives], just as described in the example [given above]. The alternative [processes], on the other hand, are imprecise because it is possible for many past lives to project a single rebirth, or for a body ripened by certain past actions to endure beyond a hundred aeons, and so forth. Also, as mentioned above, the cycle can be completed within a single lifetime. However, Jetsun Chenpo [Tāranātha] of Jonang has said that those [irregular] modalities that confuse the order [of the links of dependent origination], by appending the three links of craving, grasping, and rebirth process directly to the first three links of the [chain], and so forth, are quite mistaken.[360]

Incidentally, if one were to wonder what sort of dependent origination is applicable in the context of the [three] world systems, and whether these [links] are similar for those abiding on the same level (sa mtshungs pa) or not, in the world-system of desire the twelve links [of dependent origination] are fully present, whereas in the two higher world-systems the twelve [links] are partly present because it is explained that [the link of] aging exists therein, in the manner of formative predispositions that are old and putrid. Meanwhile, in the [world system of] formlessness, the physical aspects of dependent origination are absent.

The nine [experiential] levels that collectively comprise the three world-systems (khams gsum sa dgu)[361] may be reduced to the following three circumstances: (1) one's present level (svabhūmi, rang sa), (2) the level below it (adhabhūmi, 'og sa), and (3) the level above it (urdhvabhūmi, gong sa); or alternatively, (1) the level of death ('chi sa), (2) the level of birth (skye sa), and (3) the level of neither [death nor birth] (sa gnyis ka ma yin pa).
In this context, a single link [of dependent origination], with the exception of fundamental ignorance, can only be similar for those who share the level on which they have been born [among these nine levels or three circumstances].
As for fundamental ignorance, when beings are reborn from the world-system of desire back into the [world-system of] desire, this link is similar for all those who continue to abide on this level because it is inherent within the [world system of] desire; but when beings are reborn from their own level among the eight higher levels [of experience, associated with the world-systems of form and formlessness] back into the same [higher] level, [it is said that] there is no fundamental ignorance afflicting those who continue to abide on that same level. This is because the [immediate] past actions that would [ordinarily] project a birth into these [higher levels] are the meditations on quiescent and coarse [appearances] (zhi rags su sgom pa), but when one [merely] continues to abide on one's own [previous] level, [the impact of past actions is projected directly, through their own power] and not through the meditations on quiescent and coarse [appearances].[362]
However, when one makes a detailed investigation, there are many particular explanations, which should be understood from the [aforementioned] work of the supreme scholar Vasubandhu, and other texts.[363]

With regard to the arising and cessation of substantial things: Phenomena are uncreated by the dynamics of false imagination present in the mind of a creator, and they are impermanent because anything permanent and steadfast would not be subject to the arising and cessation of causes and conditions. Since phenomena have a nature that partakes of arising and cessation, and substantial things are seeds endowed with potency, they are produced by causes capable of generating their respective results.[364]
Without knowing the processes of arising and cessation in respect of substantial things in accordance with the three natures of which they may partake, non-Buddhists and others propound their diverse [views of] eternalism and nihilism. However, when the meaning of dependent origination is [properly] understood, the reality will be known. By comprehending the three [natures], one will obtain certainty with regard to dependent origination.

Now, as for the reasons why this [ultimate] reality [of dependent origination] is not understood by others apart from the omniscient Buddha: This [process] is endowed with five [profundities], i. e., it is profound on account of its causal basis (hetugāmbhīrya, rgyus zab pa), profound on account of its defining characteristics (lakṣaṇagāmbhīrya, mtshan nyid kyis zab pa), profound on account of its arising (utpattigāmbhīrya, skye bas zab pa), profound on account of its duration (sthitigāmbhīrya, gnas pas zab pa), and profound on account of its functioning (vṛttigāmbhīrya, 'byung bas zab pa).[365] And it is endowed with five ostensible contradictions (ltar snang lnga), namely,
(1) Although [dependent origination] is momentary, it is also observed to have duration.
(2) Although [dependent origination] arises from unmoving conditions, it is also observed that its potencies are idiosyncratic.
(3) Although [dependent origination] occurs without reference to sentient beings, it is also observed in respect of sentient beings.
(4) Although [dependent origination] has no creator, it is also observed that past actions are not fruitless.
(5) Although [dependent origination] does not arise from the four extremes,[366] it does not arise with reference to any other agency.[367]
One who knows the meaning of this profound dependent origination is endowed with a great sense of purpose because the level of perfect buddha-hood will be attained contingent on the pure view that sees emptiness and dependent origination as indivisible. Accordingly, it is said in the Four Hundred Verses:
When dependent origination is perceived,
Delusion will not arise.
Therefore, at this juncture,
And by every possible effort,
I should explain this point alone.
And in the Letter to a Friend:[368]
This dependent origination is the profound and precious treasure Of the compositions of buddha speech of all the conquerors. Whosoever genuinely perceives it, discerning this reality,
Will perceive the tathāgata.

Since all relative phenomena, associated with cyclic existence and with the [spiritual] paths and their results, arise from compounded causes and conditions, they are impermanent, they are imbued with suffering, they are empty, and they are without self.[369]
As for these [four hallmarks], with regard to the first, impermanence (ani-tya, mi rtag pa), all substantial things are endowed with a subtle impermanence, whereby they arise and cease instantaneously. This is because although things may not perish immediately after they have arisen, the real nature of things that are arising is that they are also perishing. Since there is not the slightest intervening period of duration [between them], the parameters are the present moment of arising and the present moment of perishing.
With regard to suffering (duḥkha, sdug bsngal ba), since things are impermanent, it is established that they are imbued with suffering because they are powerless to endure for more than a mere moment.
With regard to emptiness (śūnyatā, stong pa nyid), taking any substantial thing, whether external or internal, into consideration, it is simply the case that from its causes and conditions, which are multifaceted, diverse, and of the nature of impermanence, the results that arise are also diverse and of the nature of impermanence. However, things are also [designated as] empty because they are in all respects devoid of self and devoid of a creator.
With regard to selflessness (nairātmya, bdag med pa), these phenomena are not created by any truly existing creator, but they appear merely as the process of dependent origination, which can be analyzed in terms of causes and conditions.

If one were to wonder whether, although [substantial things] are without self, the processes of dependent origination that apply to internal consciousness and external objects are in reality truly existent, it is the case that all dependently originated phenomena are without true or substantial existence in any respect whatsoever, because they are contrived and adventitious.
The [dependent origination] that arises through the power of mere apperception or imagination, focussing on the absence of erroneous bewilderment, is designated as the “real nature of internal phenomena” (nang gi de kho na nyid).[370]

There is no contradiction [in saying that] although this mere apperception does not truly exist because it has not existed primordially, it is just something that appears. For example, although the appearances that arise diversely in the form of Mount Sumeru, houses, and so forth in the consciousness of the dream state tainted by sleep have never actually existed, there is a dormant consciousness that does exist in that temporary state. In the same way, all the sensa of sense objects and sense data that arise have never truly existed from the beginning, and yet there is a conceptual basis for their arising that is present in this temporary state.[371]
Just as, although the fire that occurs in a dream has never existed from the beginning but it does appear to kindle firewood, this [mere apperception] also transcends all [extremes] of existence and non-existence, eternalism and nihilism. That is to say, since the diverse sensa associated with the dependent origination of causes and conditions do arise as mere appearances, they transcend [the extreme of] non-existence; and since they are without inherent existence, they also transcend [the extreme of] existence.[372]
Similarly, since the appearances associated with the dependent origination of causes and conditions partake of the nature of impermanence, the former [links] ceasing as the subsequent links arise, they also transcend the extreme of permanence; and since the gateways through which these mere appearances arise from their causes and conditions manifest without ceasing, they transcend the extreme of nihilism. This [process] is [designated as] the “real nature devoid of inherent existence” (rang bzhin med pa'i de kho na nyid).[373]
For this reason, it is said in the Compendium [of Phenomenology]:[374]
It does not arise from itself, or from anything else, nor does it arise from both. It does not arise without a cause. It does not inherently exist in an intrinsic manner, and it does not inherently exist in an extraneous manner. Nor does it inherently exist in a combination of these two.
Although formative predispositions originate through the condition of fundamental ignorance, they do not originate solely from the [concept of] self associated with fundamental ignorance because it is impossible for many [diverse] results to arise from only a single cause. Nor is it the case that they originate from an extraneous substance because they do so with reference to their own cause. Nor indeed do they originate from both [a single intrinsic and an external cause] because [the postulations of] “self” and “other” [as the causes] have been individually refuted. Also, it is not the case that [they can originate] without a cause because one can clearly see that the arising of a result is certainly determined with reference to a cause.[375]

There is an extravagantly proud [view] emphasized by some who have suggested that “this structure of dependent origination associated with Nāgārjuna is the tradition of Madhyamaka, whereas the Cittamātra tradition was expounded by Asaṅga and his brother [Vasubandhu] because they uphold [the concept of] extraneous arising [or production from an external cause].” One can truly understand that this [view] is incorrect on the basis of the foregoing exegesis, which is based on the above citation from the Compendium of Phenomenology.[376]
In general, the expression “extraneous arising” (parata utpāda, gzhan las skye ba) refers to the appearances that appear to arise extraneously merely within the scope of the relative [truth], and the [corollary] expression “extraneous non-arising” (gzhan las mi skye) is refuted because the extraneous arising that truly [or independently] exists is refuted.[377]
Nowadays, those who claim to uphold the content of Nāgārjuna's scriptures unanimously assert the logical congruence that emptiness is dependent origination, and yet it should be understood that the pristine cognition of natural inner radiance (rang bzhin 'od gsal ba'i ye shes), which is the ultimate [truth], [actually] transcends dependent origination because it transcends objects of verbal expression and mental conception, and because it is liberated from [the distinctions between] generative causes and generated results, and from the mutual interdependence of determined and determinative aspects (rnam par gzhag bya 'jog byed kyi ltos bzhag).[378]

Furthermore, with regard to this natural inner radiance, its essential nature is the original pristine cognition, natural and spontaneously present, which has not been generated by any cause whatsoever. This is because it does not produce an extraneous result, nor is it a causal action of extraneous production. This pristine cognition is not even an object of verbal expression or mental conception. However much one who has never previously seen [Mount] Potala might describe or mentally conceive its defining characteristics, one can never depict it, just as it is. In the same way, too, however much the natural inner radiance can be conceived and determined by means of verbal expressions and mental conceptions, its defining characteristics cannot be qualitatively illustrated by any direct or indirect means.[379]
Since [from the perspective of logical analysis], those [processes] of mutually interdependent origination (ltos 'jog gi rten 'brel) are [considered to be] generally characterized phenomena (sāmānyalakṣaṇa, spyi mtshan) [which are not causally effective], such processes do not even rank among the properties of [ordinary] material things which are [considered to be] specifically characterized phenomena (svalakṣaṇa, rang mtshan) [and therefore causally effective], insofar as they are the directly evident signified objects (dngos kyi brjod bya) of verbal signifiers. This being the case, there is no question that natural inner radiance transcends the objective range of dependent origination.[380]
On the other hand, it is not contradictory to say that although the ultimate [truth] is not dependent origination, the ultimate [truth] can be realized by meditating on dependent origination. This is because all phenomena are accepted as dependently originated.[381]
This systematic presentation of dependent origination is expounded as an addendum to the [exegesis of] the three natures, and in order to acquire a more extensive comprehension of it, one should refer to the exegeses that are mainly found in the textual tradition of Asaṅga and his brother [Vasubandhu].

Our Buddhist tradition[170] is renowned for its three yānas and four systems of philosophical tenets. Among these, the three yānas[171] are what the Victor [Buddha Shākyamuni] presented as his teachings; they are also what the victors who appeared earlier in this excellent aeon taught, and what the victors who will appear later will teach.
Generally, it is well known that a “yāna”[172] is [a form of transport] such as an elephant with its load; the term also carries the sense of that which is traveled on (bgrod par bya ba) while it bears its load. Accordingly, the means for traveling (bgrod par byed pa) to the supreme state while carrying the burden of benefiting ourselves and others is designated as a “yāna.” Furthermore, [the yāna that employs] that by which we travel ('dis bgrod pa) [as its method] is referred to as a “cause-based path”; and [the yāna that uses] where we are traveling to ('dir bgrod pa) [as its method] is “a result-based yāna.”[173] Also, the yāna that involves the greater burden of the welfare of both ourselves and others is designated as the Mahāyāna; the yāna that involves only the lesser burden of our own benefit is designated as the Hīnayāna.[174]
The four philosophical tenet systems are described in Secret Mantra[175] as follows.

Teach them the Vaibhāṣhika and Sautrāntika [systems].
Explain Yogāchāra and, after that, Madhyamaka.
The Primordial Wisdom chapter of the Kālachakra Tantra[177] says that the four philosophical tenet systems arise from the four faces of the Bhagavat. Their names are mentioned simply for symbolic purposes; the tantra does not present them in terms of a threefold exposition of ground, path, and result, as it does for the three yānas. (The four Vedas[178] are also said to arise from the four faces of Kālachakra;[179] however, that does not mean that they were the Buddha's exposition.)
The four systems of philosophical tenets were set forth by individuals who appeared after the Teacher [Shākyamuni Buddha] and who were founders of particular chariot-systems. Therefore, the philosophical tenet systems are the outcome (grub don) of the final view (lta ba mthar thug) that individuals [reach] through their own intellectual analysis. For this reason, the omniscient Rongt the Great[180] explains:
As for the meaning of “philosophical tenet”:[181] it is the outcome of thorough analysis, which individuals who are engaged in investigating what is to be accepted and what is to be rejected [arrive at] through their particular orientation ('dod pa). The meaning of the term signifies that what is established
(grub pa) through the scriptures and reasonings of a particular system is not surpassed [for followers of that system].

The Sanskrit shrāvaka[183] is used to mean both “to listen” (nyan pa) and “to hear”[184] (thos pa). Therefore [it was translated into Tibetan as nyan thos, and as] “hearers” [in English]. This is similar to [the Tibetan translation of buddha]: since buddha[185] is used to mean both “to awaken” (sangs pa) and “to blossom” (rgyas pa), [it was translated into Tibetan as sangs rgyas,] meaning “awakened-blossomed one.”[186] [Shrāvaka was translated into Tibetan] in another form: [“hearer-proclaimers” (thos sgrog),] since it is said that they attend others and proclaim what they have heard. Given that they attend their masters and proclaim what they have heard from them to others, they are called “those who proclaim what they hear,” or “hearers.”[187]

• The essence of the truth of suffering is the continuity of the appropriated aggregates,[190] which are produced by the karma and mental afflictions of previous lives.
• The essence of the truth of the origins of suffering is karma and mental afflictions, which are the causes for future appropriated aggregates.
• The essence of the truth of cessation is the relinquishment that has destroyed the origins of suffering, which are the factors eliminated by means of the remedial path.
• The essence of the truth of the path is the primordial wisdom of noble ones, which has the power to relinquish the origins [of suffering] and to attain cessation.
The first two contain saṃsāra's causes and results, which are afflictive phenomena. The last two contain nirvāṇa's causes and results, which are purified phenomena.[191]

• The defining characteristic of the truth of the origins of suffering is whatever produces the aggregates, which appropriate suffering, as taught [by the Buddha].
• The defining characteristic of the truth of cessation is thusness (tathātā, de bzhin nyid) purified of adventitious stains, as [the Buddha] taught.
• The defining characteristic of the path is the passage that leads to liberation, as [the Buddha] taught.

The truths are delineated as four, and two states are ascertained: saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. Since each state has its own set of causes and results, two sets of causes and results are ascertained as follows. In terms of saṃsāra, the truth of suffering is determined to be the result and the truth of its origins is the cause. In the context of nirvāṇa, the truth of cessation is the result, and the truth of the path is the cause. It is definite, therefore, that the number of truths is four. It is not, however, that the four truths include all knowable objects (jeya, shes bya), because they do not include four types of phenomena: space, nonanalytical cessation, impure thusness, and completely pure worldly realms.
The sequence of the four truths, which are the objects, are presented according to the order in which they are comprehended by the perceiving mind. The Treasury [of Abhidharma] states:[193]
The sequence [of the truths] accords with the process of comprehension.
[They are presented this way] because this is how our understanding develops. The first step is to identify the aggregates involving suffering in saṃsāra, as in identifying an illness. Next we recognize that the causes of those aggregates, that is, their origins—karma and mental afflictions—must be abandoned; this is like freeing ourselves from the causes of an illness.
Then we know that cessation, the freedom from all suffering, is what is to be attained; this is like the comfort of being illness-free. Finally we conclude that meditation on the undefiled path, which is the method for [attaining] that [cessation], must be practiced, in the same way that we would take an efficacious medicine. This is stated in the Highest Continuum:[194]
Just as an illness must be identified, its cause eliminated, well-being attained, and medicine taken, so must we identify suffering, abandon its causes, recognize cessation, and practice the path.

This is why they are called “the truths of noble beings.”[195] Their individual etymologies are given in the Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma”:[196]
Because it has the character of being distressful, it is suffering
. . . Since it is the source, it is the origin . . . Because it is the disintegration of the aggregates, it is cessation . . . Since it refers to the journey, it is the path.

(9)one level of the desire[199] realm, which is similar throughout.
These worlds (the inanimate environments) are the places where sentient beings take birth. They and the beings living there (who are the animate inhabitants) should be understood to be of the nature of the truth of suffering.

Sufferings are classified in terms of their natures in the following ways.[200]
Eight [Sufferings]
The four types of suffering in relation to the internal [that is, your body] are birth, aging, sickness, and death. The three types of suffering in relation to external things are encountering unpleasant things, being separated from what is attractive, and not being able to obtain what you desire despite your efforts. The [Compendium of] Abhidharma states:[201]
In brief, the five appropriated aggregates are suffering.
Accordingly, there is the one suffering of negative propensities,[202] which serves as the cause for all [the other kinds of suffering]. Those are the eight.
Six [Sufferings]
Those eight can be reduced to six. Since three—aging, sickness, and death—are related to changes in age, health, and vitality, they are counted as one: the suffering of change. When that is added to the remaining five, there are six.
Three [Sufferings]
Those can be further abbreviated into three.
(1) Of the eight kinds of suffering, the four of birth, aging, sickness, and death, plus the fifth of encountering what is unpleasant have the characteristic of being phenomena that are experienced as suffering. Thus, they are the suffering of suffering (sdug bsngal gyi sdug bsngal).
(2) Two—being separated from what is attractive and not being able to obtain what you desire despite your efforts—are characterized by being changeable phenomena that are initially experienced as pleasurable. Therefore, they are the suffering of change ('gyur ba'i sdug bsngal).
(3) The five appropriated aggregates, which involve negative propensities, are not liberated from pleasure or pain and are linked to what is impermanent. Since they exist that way and are not pleasurable, they are the suffering of conditioned existence ('du byed kyi sdug bsngal).
Two [Sufferings]
The eight kinds of suffering can be condensed into two. The first seven are so easy to understand that even worldly beings recognize them to be suffering. Because they are the objects of such [minds], those seven are suffering according to conventional truth.[203] The Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma” says:[204]
Immature beings are like the palm of the hand: they do not recognize the hair of the suffering of conditioned existence. Noble ones are like the eye: they are greatly disturbed by that hair.
The eighth type of suffering is difficult for worldly beings to understand, but those who have transcended the world know it to be suffering. Since it is the object for their minds, it is suffering according to ultimate truth.[205]

The Treasury of Abhidharma says:[207]
The causes of the mental afflictions are complete [when] the subtle proliferators have not been abandoned, their objects are present, and the mind engages incorrectly.
Mental afflictions arise based on the following three conditions:
(1) Their causal conditions (rgyu'i rkyen) are [present as long as] their seeds, “the subtle proliferators”208—which are that [mental afflictions] mature from subtle [propensities] in a way that is magnified—have not been eliminated.
(2) Their object conditions (dmigs rkyen) are the presence of things that are attractive, unattractive, and so forth.
(3) Their dominant conditions (bdag rkyen) are incorrect mental engagements, such as considering unpleasant objects to be attractive ones.

There are six root mental afflictions.[209] They are also counted as ten, since one, views, is divided into five types.[210] There are also twenty secondary mental afflictions,[211] which, although they do not create mental afflictions in the same way that the root ones do, are capable of creating mental afflictions that are subsidiary to those [root ones]. Their defining characteristics are as described earlier.[212]
Generally speaking, all mental afflictions are origins of suffering, which means they are causes that are the source of suffering. Nevertheless, ignorance is the fundamental, root cause of saṃsāra. Then what about the explanation in the [Compendium of] Abhidharma and other places that craving (tṛiṣhṇā, sred pa) is the origin of suffering?[213] Craving is described in that way because it is what immediately impels us into our next existence and is the principal cause that links us with our next birth. This accords with the Commentary on Valid Cognition:[214]
Although lack of awareness is the cause of existence, that is not stated; it is craving that is named.
It is the cause because it impels.
Karma [is also not stated as the cause] because it is what comes next.
Thus it is that ignorance acts as the cause. Craving, being the linking factor, is the motivating force and the origin of karma.

The Three Types of Physical Karma
Killing
Killing involves five aspects: (1) The basis (gzhi) is a sentient being whose mindstream is different from one's own. (2) The intention (bsam pa) is being aware of that [other being] in an unmistaken way [with the intent to kill]. (3) The act (sbyor ba) is killing that being using poisons, weapons, magic spells,[220] and so forth, or to engage someone else to kill them. (4) The mental affliction is [any of] the three poisons generally; anger specifically completes the act (rdzogs byed). (5) The conclusion occurs when the victim dies before the killer.[221]
These five complete the karmic path of killing. When any one of these five aspects is not present, a wrongdoing occurs, but the karmic path is not complete. We should know that this applies in the case of all following negative actions.
Killing is categorized as three:
(1) killing out of desire, such as craving for meat;
(2) killing out of anger, such as vindictiveness; and
(3) killing out of bewilderment, such as offering a sacrifice.
The most evil form of killing is to kill your father if he is also an arhat.
Stealing
(1) The basis is things owned by others, objects dedicated to the three jewels, the wealth of nonhumans, and the like. (2) The intention is being motivated to take something through deceitful means, through force, or by stealth. (3) The act is stealing something yourself or asking someone else to do so. (4) The mental affliction is [any of] the three poisons in general; desire or avarice specifically completes the act. (5) The conclusion occurs when you have the thought that you have obtained such substances, regardless of whether they have been removed from their original location or not.
Stealing is of three types:
(1) stealing through the use of force, such as seizing things with no explanation;
(2) stealing by stealth, such as breaking into a building; and
(3) stealing by means of deceit, such as altering weights and measures.
The most evil kind of stealing is to steal what has been offered to the three jewels.
Sexual Misconduct
(1) The basis includes your own husband or wife; your relatives up to seven times removed even if they are not specifically committed to someone else; someone else's spouse; inappropriate sexual partners (such as bhikṣhus or bhikṣhuṇīs who are protected by their rules); anyone in unsuitable places (in the presence of representations of the three jewels and so forth); and anyone at an improper time (such as during daylight or when the other person [is observing] the lay precepts,[222] is pregnant, or is menstruating). (2) The intention is being motivated by the desire to have sexual intercourse with inappropriate sexual partners. (3) The act is undertaking that action. (4) The mental affliction is [any of] the three poisons; desire specifically completes the act. (5) The conclusion is to think with lust that you had an experience of pleasure arising from sexual intercourse.
Sexual misconduct is categorized as three:
(1) having sexual relations with those precluded by family ties (such as parents or siblings);
(2) having sexual relations with those precluded by their commitments (such as spouses); and
(3) having sexual relations with those excluded by their dharma vows
(such as bhikṣhus or bhikṣhuṇīs).
In terms of improper desire, the greatest evil is sexual misconduct with your mother if she is also a female arhat.

<d e="2">
The Four Types of Verbal Karma
Lying
(1) The basis is an object [i.e., a person] other than yourself.
(2) The intention is being motivated by the desire to say something like “I saw that” about something you have not seen, with the objective of deceiving others.
(3) The act is doing something cognizable[223] physically or verbally.
(4) The mental affliction is any one of the three poisons, which will complete the act.
(5) The conclusion occurs when someone else comprehends your meaning.
The application is not confined to a cognizable act of speech. One can create false impressions using symbolic gestures of the body, which constitute lying, such as remaining silent about having committed a downfall when questioned directly by the elders (sthavira, gnas brtan) during the purification-renewal ceremony.
There are three types of lies:
(1) defeating lies, such as lying about spiritual attainments;[224]
(2) major lies, which are ones that benefit yourself or harm others; and
(3) trivial lies, such as those that are neither beneficial nor harmful.
The worst type of lie is one that denigrates the tathāgatas or deceives your guru.
Divisiveness
(1) The basis is others who have a friendly relationship.
(2) The intention is wishing to divide them.
(3) The act is initiating the activity.
(4) Among the three mental afflictions, aggression specifically completes the act.
(5) The conclusion occurs when another person comprehends your meaning. This includes any intention or action that subsequently alienates people after you have initiated harmonious relations.
There are three types of divisiveness:
(1) vehement divisiveness, such as directly separating close friends;
(2) indirect divisiveness, such as separating friends through oblique means; and
(3) covert divisiveness, such as secretly creating schisms.
The most evil kind of divisiveness is to cause a schism in the saṅgha.
Harsh speech
(1) The basis is anything that pertains to the mindstreams of sentient beings.
(2) The intention is being motivated by the wish to speak in a displeasing way.
(3) The act is saying something [harsh] that is verbally cognizable.
(4) The mental affliction is [any of] the three poisons, and aggression completes the act.
(5) The conclusion occurs when you are heard by someone and they comprehend your meaning.
Harsh speech is of three kinds:
(1) face-to-face harshness, such as disclosing someone's hidden flaws directly to them;
(2) indirect harshness, such as saying something mean to another mixed with jokes; and
(3) circuitous harshness, such as disclosing someone's hidden flaws to their close friends.
The most evil kind of harsh speech is to speak harshly to your parents or a noble being.
Idle talk
(1) The basis is as before.
(2) The intention is being motivated by the desire to mindlessly chatter a lot.
(3) The act is voicing something obsequious, to sing, or do something similar in a verbally cognizable way.
(4) The mental affliction is [any of] the three poisons, and bewilderment specifically completes the act.
(5) The conclusion occurs when you are heard by someone.
Idle talk is divided into three kinds:
(1) wrong idle talk, such as the recitations and talk of tīrthikas;[225]
(2) worldly idle talk, such as meaningless chatter; and
(3) truthful idle talk, such as teaching the dharma to those who are not suitable.
In terms of idle talk, the greatest evil is to distract those who desire the dharma.

The Three Kinds of Mental Karma
Covetousness
(1) The basis is another's external or internal possessions. (2) The intention is being motivated by a hope or aspiration for the wealth and possessions of others. (3) The act is thinking about that repeatedly. (4) The mental affliction is [any of] the three poisons, and desire completes the act. (5)
The conclusion is to perform that repeatedly and not employ a remedy because you are neither ashamed nor embarrassed [about such actions].
Covetousness is of three types:
(1) covetousness towards what is yours, such as attachment to your family's status;
(2) covetousness towards what belongs to others, such as longing for others' wealth; and
(3) covetousness towards what belongs neither to yourself nor to others, such as wishing for the treasures beneath the ground.
The greatest evil in terms of covetousness is to covet the possessions of renunciates.
Malice
(1) The basis is the same as above. (2) The intention is being motivated by the wish to harm someone, such as by killing or beating them. (3) The act occurs when you contemplate that. (4) The mental affliction is [any of] the three poisons, and aggression completes the act. (5) The conclusion is to regard this [mental state] as a virtue and have no interest in remedying it.
Malice has three divisions:
(1) malice that arises from aggression, such as the intention to kill others during war;
(2) malice arising from jealousy, such as feeling ill will towards competitors; and
(3) malice arising from resentment, such as feeling hostile towards someone who has harmed you even though they have since apologized.
The most evil type of malice is to plan to commit one of the [five] acts of immediate consequence.[226]
Wrong views
(1) The basis is virtuous and unvirtuous phenomena. (2) The intention is being motivated by a belief that there are neither virtuous actions nor negative ones, by an incorrect view concerning causes and their results, and the like. (3) The act occurs when you contemplate that repeatedly. (4) Among the three mental afflictions, bewilderment is the one that completes the act.
(5) The conclusion is to establish [such a view] and not remedy it.
There are three kinds of wrong views:
(1) wrong views about actions and their results, such as not accepting that virtuous actions are the causes of happiness and that negative actions are the causes of suffering;
(2) wrong views about the truth, such as not believing that you will attain the truth of cessation through your practice of the truth of the path; and
(3) wrong views about the three jewels, such as denigrating the three jewels.
The worst kind of wrong view is to hold a view to be supreme.

<d e="2">
[The Results of Unvirtuous Actions]
Those [nonmeritorious actions produce] three kinds of results.
(1) Matured results (rnam smin gyi 'bras bu) refer to the fact that major results can mature from minor causes. In cases where the results do not match their causes in all regards [e.g., a result is experienced for a long time even though its cause was brief], the expression “matured karma”
(smin pa las) is used. Furthermore, when an unvirtuous action is impelled by a strong motivation or done often, the result will be birth in the hells. When done with an intermediate motivation and frequency, it will result in birth as a hungry ghost. When done with a lesser degree of motivation and frequency, it will bring rebirth as an animal.
Secondly, there are results that correspond to their causes; and thirdly, there are dominant results that come to fruition even for beings in the higher realms.
(2) Results that correspond to their causes (rgyu mthun gyi 'bras bu) are of two kinds: (a) [resultant] actions that correspond to their causes and
(b) [resultant] experiences that correspond to their causes. (2a) [Resultant actions that correspond to their causes] are those actions which one naturally enjoys doing from the time of one's birth and which one is compelled to do because of one's previous actions. (2b) [Resultant experiences that correspond to their causes] are described in the Precious Garland:[227]
Having killed, your life will be short.
Having injured others, you will be greatly harmed.
Having stolen, you will be materially impoverished.
Having committed adultery, you will be [plagued by] enemies.
Having lied, you will be disparaged. Having spoken divisively, you will be separated from your friends. Having used harsh language, you will hear unpleasant things. Having spoken meaninglessly, your words will not be honored.
Covetousness will destroy your hopes. Malice will create fears.
Wrong views [create] negative views.

(3) Dominant results (bdag po'i 'bras bu) mature environmentally. The same text says:[228]
Externally, there will be little affluence and many dangers, swirling dust, smells, and [extreme] highs and lows [in the terrain], salt plains, and erratic [seasons]; harvests will be minimal or nonexistent.
As for when those results will ripen, the Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma” provides this quotation:[229]
Whatever is heaviest in the cycle of karma will mature first.
Next will be what is close, followed by what you are habituated to, and finally by what you did in previous [lives].
Engaging in those ten unvirtuous actions yourself is not the only way to complete a karmic path. When [a group of people have] a similar intention and activity—such as is the case with a group of soldiers—if one person commits the act of killing, the karmic path will be completed for all those in that gathering. The Treasury [of Abhidharma] states:[230]
Because armies and the like have the same aim, all will have [the karma] of the one performing [the act].
This is certainly the case for the following as well. Bands of robbers, bandits, and others, who unite for the sake of stealing, [will experience] similar [results]. Anyone who causes someone else to commit one [of the ten unvirtuous actions] (with the exception of the three unvirtuous actions of mind) will complete the karmic path [of that action]. It is also taught that those who rejoice in [the negative actions] done by others will be tainted by a corresponding karma, and that those who rejoice in the virtue engaged in by others will obtain roots of virtue.
When those actions are considered in terms of the mental afflictions (i.e., whether they are committed with aggression, desire, or bewilderment), or in terms of their frequency (i.e., whether they are done innumerable times, many times, or just a few times), or in terms of their object (i.e., whether they are done in relation to supreme, middling, or inferior beings), they are said to cause rebirth as a hell being, hungry ghost, or animal. This is summarized in the Precious Garland:[231]
Desire, aggression, stupidity, and the karma they generate are unvirtuous.
From unvirtuous actions, suffering and all lower states arise.
The ten unvirtuous actions are committed in some form by the beings in the desire realms, with the exception of the beings in the hells and Unpleasant Sound.[232] In the higher realms [the form and formless realms], there are no unvirtuous actions. Also when a chakravartin[233] appears in the other continents of humans,[234] the ten unvirtuous actions are not evident owing to the force of his merit.

Meritorious karma is summarized in this quotation from the same text:[235]
Not killing, giving up stealing, refraining from [sexual engagements] with others' spouses; restraining oneself from speaking falsely, divisively, harshly, or meaninglessly; being without attachments or malice, and renouncing views of nihilists are the ten positive paths of action.
As is stated, the [ten] meritorious actions are the intention to renounce taking life through the intention to give up wrong views. Meritorious karma does not only involve [being free from] the mental afflictions, it must also include the four other aspects of basis, intention, act, and conclusion. These actions become distinguished when we go beyond, for example, simply not killing by committing ourselves to that with a vow, by protecting living beings, and by employing the means to extend the longevity of others. Such distinctions apply to the rest of the virtuous actions.
We should know that these actions bring about matured results, results that accord with their causes, and dominant results, and that they manifest correspondingly pleasurable [results], which are the direct opposites of the unpleasant results of the ten unvirtuous actions.
[The results of] these actions also differ according to whether their object is higher or lower and the frequency of their occurrence, as described above. This is summarized [in the Precious Garland]:[236]
The opposites of desire, aggression, stupidity, and the karma they generate are virtuous.
From virtuous actions, happy states and enjoyments in all lifetimes arise.

Stable [or unmoving] karma (mi g.yo ba'i las) is referred to as such because its maturation does not occur [or “move” to] anywhere but its originating states [which are the form and formless realms].[237] It is a state of equipoise and is not disturbed [or “moved”] by the faults of lower states. The same text states:[238]
The concentrations, the immeasurables, and the formless [realm] bring the experience of the happiness of Brahmā and so forth.
[Stable karma] is described as the special mental state of the main absorptions (snyoms 'jug dngos gzhi) of the four meditative concentrations and four formless states, as is discussed in the earlier section on the paths to the elevated states (mngon mtho'i lam).[239]

Since [the Buddha's] teachings and the treatises treat the topic of karma and its results extensively, there are many ways it is categorized. The main ones are
(1) the classification of karma in terms of the four combinations of impetus and completion ('phen rdzogs);
(2) the classification of karma in terms of the speed of its maturation
(rnam smin myur bul);
(3) the classification of karma in terms of whether it is performed and stored (byas bsags) or not;
(4) the classification of karma in terms of its strength (stobs che chung);
(5) the classification of karma in terms of its mode of appearance (snang tshul); and
(6) the classification of karma in terms of whether it is of a similar type
(rigs mthun) or not.
It is on the basis of the causal karmic origins [of suffering] that there is the resultant suffering and [beings] take rebirth in the three realms.
To state this in a way that is easy to understand:
(1) [The classification of karma in terms of its impetus and completion] is fourfold.[240]
(a) The driving impetus may be a positive action, but if the completing action is negative it will result, for example, in one becoming an impoverished human being.
(b) The action that is the driving impetus may be negative, but if the completing action is positive the result will be circumstances such as those of the wealthy nāgas.[241]
(c) If both the action that is the impetus and the completing action are negative, states such as the hells will be experienced.
(d) When both the action that is the impetus and the completing action are positive, the results include that of a chakravartin.
(2) [The classification of karma in terms of the speed of its maturation] is threefold:[242]
(a) “Karma experienced in this life”: Karma propelled by a strong intention and activity, and done in relation to a supreme object, will ripen in the same lifetime. For example, the karma
Devadatta[243] accrued by attempting to poison the Bhagavat with his fingernails produced the fires of hell at that very moment.
(b) “Karma experienced in the next life” is the experience of the maturation of an action in the life immediately after this lifetime.
The five acts of immediate consequence[244] and the five secondary acts of immediate consequence[245] are examples of this type of karma.
(c) “Karma experienced in a succession of other lives” means that the experience of the maturation of an action can occur during three lifetimes [after the action was done] up to hundreds or thousands of lives later.

</d>
<d e="2">
(3) [The classification of karma in terms of whether it is performed and stored or not]: Taking positive karma as an illustration, “performed and stored” would refer to making offerings to the three jewels with faith. “Not performed but stored” would be to rejoice in other's virtuous actions. “Performed but not stored” would be the recitations of a distracted mind. Actions neither performed nor stored are easy to understand. We should know that these distinctions apply in the case of negative actions as well.
(4) [The classification of karma in terms of its strength]: generally, if one does something that should be avoided, it will impel a result. The action of a remedy, however, is stronger because antidotes have the power to transform [karma].
(5) [The classification of karma in terms of its mode of appearance] is twofold:
(a) The karma related to shared appearances (snang 'gyur thun mong ba'i las) is that the appearances of the world, or environment, and all the beings living there manifest uniformly owing to the shared quality of [sentient beings'] accumulated karma.
(b) The karma related to unshared experiences (myong 'gyur thun mong min pa'i las) is that [beings have] unique pleasurable or painful experiences of different places, bodies,[246] and possessions. These are created by the karmic appearances of individual sentient beings.
(6) [The classification of karma in terms of whether it is of a similar type or not is threefold:]
(a) “Both are positive”: in the case of offering to the guru with faith, since both the intention and the activity are a similar type—positive—the path of virtuous karma is completed.
(b) “Both are negative”: in the case of taking life with the intent to kill, since both the intention and the activity are a similar type—negative—the path of unvirtuous karma is completed.
(c) “Mixed” can be a positive intention and a negative activity, as in the case of killing to protect many beings; or it can be a negative intention and a positive action, in the case of being generous for the sake of killing.

The attainment[247] of separation from stains brought about by meditating on the path is referred to as “cessation” (nirodha, 'gog pa) or “thusness” (tathātā, de bzhin nyid). Vaibhāṣhikas assert that cessation is a nonimplicative negation[248] that is substantially established (dravyasiddha, rdzas su grub pa), and that it is a mere refutation equal in number to what is negated. Sautrāntikas assert that cessation is a nonimplicative negation that is not substantially established, in which, owing to antidotal meditation, the factors to be abandoned have become like a rainbow disappearing in the sky.

What is the truth of cessation? The truth of cessation can be known through a description of its characteristics, profundity, conventional representation, ultimacy, incompleteness, completeness, absence of ornamentation, ornamentation, remainder, and absence of remainder, exalted state, and synonyms.
The nature of cessation is discussed extensively in terms of its twelve aspects, but here I will simply explain what is essential.
(1) How is cessation presented through its characteristics (lakṣhaṇa, mtshan nyid)? Its characteristics are as follows. Cessation is dharmatā, thusness. The undefiled path [leads to] cessation. It is the cessation, or nonarising, of the mental afflictions, the factors to be abandoned. Those are [respectively] the ground where cessation occurs, the methods by which cessation occurs, and the factors to be stopped, which are what cease. In brief, cessation is that, within the naturally pure dharmadhātu, by meditating on the path, adventitious stains cease.
(2) How is it profound (gāmbhīrya, zab pa)?
• Cessation cannot be said to be something that is other than the disintegration of all defiled formative forces ('du byed zag bcas), an implicative negation (ma yin dgag), and an entity (dngos por 'gyur pa), because if it were something other than those [that is, something separate from those], there would be no connection between a phenomenon and its dharmatā [its reality].[250]
• Cessation cannot be said to be something that is not other [than or separate from phenomena], because those [phenomena and dharmatā] do not have the same defining characteristics. If they did, cessation would be an afflictive phenomenon.
• Cessation cannot be said to be both [a phenomenon and its dharmatā], since both [the just-mentioned] faults would apply.
• It cannot be said to be neither of those: since [cessation] is what is intuitively cognized (so so rang gis rig par bya ba), it is not absolutely nonexistent.
• Why is it that cessation cannot be described in any of those ways? It is because the truth of cessation is the expanse (dbyings) in which all conceptual elaborations related to those four possibilities are absent.
(3) How is it conventionally represented (saṃvṛiti, brda)? A cessation in which the seeds of the factors to be abandoned have been restricted or suppressed by the paths of worldly beings is itself simply designated as a cessation, and is considered to belong to the category of cessation. Since [such cessations] are branches, or aspects, of complete cessation (ma lus par 'gags pa), they are taught to be nirvāṇa.
(4) What is ultimate cessation (paramārtha, don dam)? It is a cessation in which the seeds of the factors to be abandoned have been destroyed by the wisdom of noble beings (who have transcended the world), and in which those seeds will not re-arise.
(5) What is an incomplete cessation (aparipūri, yongs su ma rdzogs pa)? It is the cessation of noble beings in training, and refers to any of the following:
• the cessation of all factors to be abandoned by the path of seeing, which is the result of stream enterers;
• the cessation of the six factors to be abandoned during the path of meditation that pertain to the desire realm, which is the result of once returners; or
• the cessation of all the factors to be abandoned during the path of meditation that pertain to the desire realm, which is the result of nonreturners.

<d e="2">
(6) What is a complete cessation (paripūri, yongs su rdzogs pa)? It is the cessation [attained by] noble beings beyond training when all factors to be abandoned are exhausted. This is the fruition of arhats.
(7) What is unornamented cessation (niralaṃkāra, rgyan med)? It is the cessation of arhats who, through their wisdom,[251] are liberated from only the afflictive obscurations (nyon sgrib) but are not adorned with supercognitive abilities or any similar qualities.
(8) What is ornamented cessation (sālaṃkāra, rgyan dang bcas pa)? It is the cessation of arhats who are liberated from both the afflictive obscurations and the obscurations to absorption (snyoms 'jug gi sgrib pa). Such arhats possess the six supercognitive abilities,[252] the three knowledges (knowledge of the process of death and rebirth, of previous and later lives, and of the exhaustion of defilements), and the eight excellent qualities.[253]
(9) What is cessation with remainder (sheṣha, lhag bcas)? It is a cessation in which there is the remainder of the five aggregates (which are the matured [result] of previous [karma]) in the case of beings of the desire or form realms and four aggregates in the case of beings of the formless realm. [These continue to be present] as long as [the arhats] remain in their [present] life, even though they have abandoned all their mental afflictions.
(10) What is cessation without remainder (asheṣha, lhag med)? It is a cessation in which aggregates [resulting from] matured [karma] do not remain because [the arhats] have passed from this life and have relinquished all their mental afflictions.
(11) What is its exalted state (agra, khyad par du 'phags pa)? It is the cessation that is the nirvāṇa that does not abide in either the extreme of existence or of peace. This is [attained] by buddhas and bodhisattvas through their wisdom and compassion, and [is exalted] because it is the source of ultimate benefit for all sentient beings and the source of their temporal happiness.
(12) What are its synonyms (paryā̄ya, rnam grangs)? It has many synonyms: complete relinquishment, definite relinquishment, purification (byang bar gyur pa), exhaustion (zad pa), freedom from desire, cessation, complete peace, and disappearance (nub pa).
Thus it is said [in Asaṅga's Compendium of Abhidharma].[254]

The truth of suffering is summarized by four general characteristics. It is
(1) impermanent (mi rtag);
(2) suffering (sdug bsngal);
(3) empty (stong pa); and
(4) without self-entity (bdag med pa).[256]
It is said, “Everything conditioned (saṃskṛita, 'dus byas) has the characteristic of being impermanent. Everything impermanent is characterized by being suffering. All suffering has the characteristic of being empty.
Whatever is empty has the characteristic of being without a self-entity.”
Yogins and yoginīs should investigate [the truth of suffering] using these four points. The etymologies or meanings of the terms for those four are found in the
Explanation of the “Treasury [of Abhidharma]”:[257]
Because [suffering] depends on conditions, it is impermanent. Because it has the character of being distressful, it is suffering. [Suffering] is empty since it is discordant with the view of
“mine,” and it has no self-entity since it is discordant with the view of a self-entity.
When these four aspects are fully comprehended, they are the remedies for the view [that suffering is] permanent, pleasurable, something that belongs to you, and something that has a self-entity.

The general characteristics of the origins [of suffering] are that they are
(1) causes (rgyu);
(2) origins (kun 'byung);
(3) strong producers (rab skye); and (4) conditions (rkyen).[258]
We should understand the following about these points:
(1) Karma and mental afflictions are characterized as being causes, because they are enabling causes[259] that plant the seeds of the habitual tendencies that will produce future lives in cyclic existence.
(2) They have the characteristic of being origins, because they are enabling causes that are the source of the six states of sentient beings, gods and the others. (All of these states have their respective manifestations and similar attributes, [which are caused by] their accumulated karmic tendencies.)
(3) They have the characteristic of being strong producers, because they are enabling causes that definitely give rise to specific, discrete mindstreams;[260] that give rise to different kinds of beings, types of birth, and so forth; and that give rise to the Pinnacle of Existence,[261] the highest state of beings [in saṃsāra].
(4) [Karma and mental afflictions] have the characteristic of being conditions, since they are enabling causes for obtaining bodies [that is, rebirths] previously not attained and for leaving already obtained bodies.
The etymologies for those four are given in Explanation of the “Treasury [of Abhidharma]”:[262]
[Origins] are causes in the sense of being phenomena that are seeds. They are origins in the sense of being phenomena that are sources. They are powerful producers in the sense of being connectors, and they are conditions in the sense of being creators of the actual [result]. These [work together] in the same way that a pot can be produced when a lump of clay, stick, wheel, rope, and water are assembled.
[Knowledge of] these remedy the wrong views [of thinking that suffering] has no cause, that it has only one cause, that it is a transformation of a causal [entity], and that it is a planned occurrence [i.e., something created by an all-powerful creator].

The general characteristics of cessation are that it is
(1) cessation ('gog pa);
(2) peace (zhi ba);
(3) perfection (gya nom); and
(4) definite release (nges 'byung).[263]
We should understand the following about these points:
(1) Cessation is the characteristic of being separated from all mental afflictions, which are the causes of suffering.
(2) Peace is characterized by the separation from suffering, that is, from the appropriated aggregates [and] formative forces (saṃskāra, 'du byed), which create an unpeaceful state.
(3) Perfection has the characteristic of purity since it is free of the mental afflictions, and the characteristic of being happiness since it free from suffering.
(4) Definite release has the characteristic of being permanent since it will not revert, and the characteristic of being the foundation of benefit for others since, ultimately, it is what is virtuous.
The etymologies of those four are described in the Explanation of the “Treasury [of Abhidharma]”:[264]
It is cessation because it is the disintegration of connections, since it is without any connections. It is peace because it is free from the three characteristics of conditioned phenomena.[265] It is perfection since it is virtuous. It is a definite release because it is a supreme state of confidence.
By meditating on these four, we will definitely emerge from the incorrect views of thinking, “There is no liberation”; “Suffering is liberation”; “The bliss of the meditative concentrations is perfection”; and “Liberation is not lasting.”

The general characteristics of the path are that it is
(1) a path (lam);
(2) suitable (rigs pa);

(1) [The meaning of] “path” is established by its linguistic root, as it is
We should understand the following about these points: said:
[Sanskrit] mārga means “to seek.”[267]
Thus, the path is characterized as being the means for seeking and realizing the dharmadhātu.
(2) “Suitable” is its characteristic of being the antidote for mental afflictions, which are unsuitable.
(3) “Effective” is its characteristic of initiating the realization of suchness (tattva, de kho na nyid) and producing an unmistaken mind, having reversed mistaken [ideas], such as taking conditioned phenomena to be permanent.
(4) “Bringing definite release” is its characteristic of leading to the lasting state of nirvāṇa, which is unconditioned and permanent.
The etymologies of those four are presented in the Explanation of the “Treasury [of Abhidharma]”:[268]
It is a path in the sense that it is what is traversed. It is suitable because it is appropriate. It is effective in the sense that it actually produces [the result of nirvāṇa]. It brings definite release because it brings true transcendence [of suffering].
Meditating on these four is the antidote for views involving mistaken analysis in which one thinks, “There is no path,” “This path is bad,” “Something else is the path,” and “This path also can be reversed.”
These descriptions of the four truths are topics of knowledge common to all yānas. Some of the categorization is derived from the Compendium [of Abhidharma]. In his [Jeweled] Tree,[269] Jets Drakpa Gyaltsen[270] discusses in detail that, overall, the Compendium [of Abhidharma] is to be considered a Sautrāntika text.

In the two Shrāvaka schools and the Pratyekabuddha[yāna], the vows to be guarded consist of the ethical conduct of individual liberation (prātimokṣha, so so thar pa). These vows are motivated by the wish for definite release [from saṃsāra] and involve the intention, and its congruent [mental events], to avoid harming others and the basis [of that harm].
This has already been explained in detail.[271] The explanations of the way the congruent [mental events] operate in the context of those [vows] differ in the higher and lower abhidharma [systems].[272]

The view for shrāvakas is primarily the realization that a self of persons
(pudgalātman, gang zag gi bdag) does not exist. The self of persons imputed by tīrthika practitioners to be permanent, single, clean, a creator, or independent does not exist. The mind that takes such a self of persons to exist is confused, because it is a mind [perceiving] something that is not there, like someone taking a striped rope to be a snake.
The aggregates are not the self of a person, because they are impermanent, multiple, and unclean. They are also not a creator because they are under the power of other things. There is also no self of a person apart from the aggregates, because “person” (gang zag) is [only] used to refer to the continuity of the aggregates, which are filled with (gang) and degenerated by (zag pa) causal karma and mental afflictions. This accords with the statement in the Treasury [of Abhidharma]:[273]
No self exists—there are just aggregates.
[No self of persons exists apart from the aggregates,] because the mind that apprehends a self of persons comes into being when it observes the mere continuity of the aggregates.
In this root verse the term “primarily” is used for the following reason. Texts such as the Sūtra on the Heavily Adorned Arrangement[274] and the Descent into Laṅkā Sūtra[275] teach that shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas do not realize the absence of a self-entity of phenomena (dharmanairātmya, chos kyi bdag med). Their view is that shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas do not directly comprehend [the nonexistence of a self-entity of phenomena] through meditation. On the other hand, some [texts] explain that shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas do realize both [absences of self-entity].
Their view is that the attentiveness [developed] during study, reflection, and familiarization assists shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas in abandoning the mental afflictions experienced in the three realms.
Consequently, some Tibetan scholars say that the view of Nāgārjuna and his son [Āryadeva] is that shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas realize the absence of a self-entity of phenomena, and the view of Asaṅga and his brother [Vasubandhu] is that shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas do not realize this. These scholars maintain that they [i.e., Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva] assert that shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas realize both absences of selfentity.[276]

Nirvāṇa is the nature of an entity [with] defining characteristics
(i.e., the very essence of a form and so forth) that does not arise again owing to the absence of its causes and conditions, or karma and mental afflictions.
The shrāvakas' assertion [regarding nirvāṇa], as stated earlier,[278] is that, among conditioned and unconditioned [phenomena, nirvāṇa] is an unconditioned [phenomenon].
Kashmiri Vaibhāṣhikas say that there are three types of unconditioned phenomena,[279] and Magadha, or Central Indian, Vaibhāṣhikas assert that there are four types by adding thusness. Among those four, Clarifying the Sage's Thought[280] explains that Vaibhāṣhikas assert that [nirvāṇa] with remainder is an analytical cessation and [nirvāṇa] without remainder is a nonanalytical cessation, and Sautrāntikas assert that the absence of mental afflictions is an analytical cessation and the absence of the aggregates is a nonanalytical cessation. The Explanation of the “Treasury [of Abhidharma]” comments that although these schools agree that [nirvāṇa] is unconditioned, they differ in that Vaibhāṣhikas assert that it is an implicative negation and Sautrāntikas assert that it is a nonimplicative negation.[281] The meaning of their [positions] is that Vaibhāṣhikas say that [nirvāṇa] exists substantially (dravya-sat, rdzas su yod pa), thereby asserting that [nirvāṇa] is an existent entity (dngos po yod pa). Sautrāntikas say that it does not exist substantially, thereby asserting that [nirvāṇa] is not an existent entity.
In this presentation of [nirvāṇa] with remainder and without remainder, [nirvāṇa] with remainder means that all mental afflictions have been abandoned, but the continuity of the aggregates has not been severed. It [is divided into] eighty-nine conditioned [results] and eighty-nine unconditioned [results],[282] or the four results of shrāmaṇas.[283] [Nirvāṇa] without remainder is that when an arhat has relinquished all mental afflictions, the formative forces are cast aside and the continuity of the aggregates is severed. Thus, not even a trace of a remainder of suffering or aggregates is left, like a candle flame dying out. Both Shrāvaka schools assert that once arhats die, their awareness does not have any link with a subsequent life
[i.e., does not take birth again].

Because they state that [the phenomena] of the three times exist as discrete particular substances (rdzas kyi bye brag),[286] they are referred to as such [that is, as Vaibhāṣhikas, Proponents of Particular (Substances)]. Alternatively, because they make statements in accord with the Great Detailed Exposition,[287] they are referred to by that [name: Vaibhāṣhikas, Proponents of the Great Detailed Exposition].
Among the orders (nikāya, sde pa), they are a subdivision of the Mūlasarvāstivādins.[288] From the same source:[289]
Since they accept sūtras such as the Six Doors and Excellent Conduct[290] as literal and follow those sūtras, they are Sautrāntikas (Sūtra-followers). They are also known by the name of Dārṣhṭāntikas (Exemplifiers),[291] since they are skilled in teaching through examples.

Both Shrāvaka schools agree that the Mahāyāna scriptures, which comprise the middle and final teachings of the wheel of dharma, are not the words of the Victorious One, and thus they do not accept them. They say that the Mahāyāna scriptures contradict the four principles of the dharma[292] for the following four reasons: The Mahāyāna teaches (1) that the sambhogakāya is always present; (2) that bodhisattvas proceed to happiness; (3) that there is a supreme self, as in such statements as, “the supreme self, which is no-self, is attained”; and (4) that after shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have entered [nirvāṇa] without remainder, they must be roused [from that state] to then become buddhas.
Shrāvakas say that the Mahāyāna is not found within the eighteen orders of the Buddha's teachings and, therefore, is not a part of [the Buddha's teachings]. Also, the Mahāyāna teachings are not part of the three collections of scripture (tripiṭaka, sde snod gsum), because they do not appear in the common vinaya, do not fit within the sūtras, and contradict dharmatā [reality].
• Since the Shrāvaka schools do not consider the self-entity of phenomena or cognitive obscurations, they do not discuss the two types of absence of self-entity or the two obscurations.[293]
• Since they do not posit an ālaya[294] or an afflictive mind, they do not speak of eight modes of consciousness.
• Since they do not accept the extensive collection of the Mahāyāna sūtras, they do not assert the ten bhūmis,[295] which appear in the Mahāyāna sūtras.
• They believe that the bhūmi of a buddha has a remainder of karma and suffering and do not accept that all flaws are exhausted [in that state]; thus, they do not assert a transformation.[296]
• Since they do not accept that the sambhogakāya [forms of buddhas dwell] in Akaniṣhṭha, they do not assert or accept the three kāyas, four primordial wisdoms,[297] and so forth.
In the context of the bases (mūla, gzhi), neither school accepts, even on a conventional level, the self [of persons] imagined by non-Buddhists as being permanent, single, independent, and so forth, just as [they would not accept that] a striped rope is a snake. They assert that the environment and beings have no external creator, such as Cha or Īshvara;[298] they state that karma is the creator, as is said:[299]
The myriad worlds arise from karma.
They concur in their presentations of the categories of the five aggregates, the eighteen constituents, the twelve sense spheres, the four modes of birth, the five kinds of beings, and the four kinds of food (coarse, of contact, mental, and of consciousness).[300]

[The Shrāvaka schools] also agree on the main points regarding knowable objects, which are bases (gzhi'i shes bya): the way of positing defiled and undefiled phenomena[301] and the way of positing the two truths.
[Defiled phenomena] are what cause [mental] defilements (āsrava, zag pa), or mental afflictions, to increase and endure when a mind with desire cognizes and observes the nature of those phenomena. [Defiled phenomena cause mental defilements] by way of being observed objects (dmigs pa) or being [the mind and mental events, which] are congruent in five ways.[302] [Undefiled phenomena,] when observed, are what do not cause [mental defilements] to increase. Thus all conditioned phenomena, other than those included in the truth of the path, are illustrations (mtshan gzhi) of defiled phenomena; and the phenomena of the truth of the path and unconditioned phenomena are illustrations of undefiled phenomena.
The way of presenting the two truths[303] is given in the Treasury [of Abhidharma]:[304]
Something that is no longer engaged by a mind when physically destroyed or mentally broken down exists conventionally, like vases or water.
Everything else exists ultimately.
Conventional reality [is defined as] any phenomenon which is such that if it is physically destroyed or broken down into different parts by an eliminating mind (sel byed kyi blo), the mind perceiving it is halted.[305] Gross entities (such as the environment and its inhabitants) are false because they involve directional parts and because the mind can eliminate them
[by separating them] into different parts. [Temporal] continuities (such as years, months, and days), which are imagined [to exist] in the three times, are not real since they can be divided into parts. All conventionally existent [phenomena] (kun rdzob yod pa) are ultimately unable to perform functions.
Ultimate reality is that which does not halt the mind perceiving it [even] when it is broken down into parts.[306] It consists of (1) minute particles that truly exist (bden par grub pa) as the building blocks of things since they have no directional parts; and (2) the instants of the inner perceiving mind that exist as the building blocks of the temporal continuity
[of mind]. All ultimately existent phenomena are capable of performing functions ultimately.[307] The reason vases and so forth are conventionalities is that ultimately they are unable to perform functions. This is because, if one's position is that an object ultimately able to perform a function from its own side is a phenomenon, or referent, that intrinsically (rang gi mtshan nyid la) produces an unmistaken perceiver of itself, then those vases and so forth are conventionalities since the mind [perceiving them] relies upon inner contributory aspects, such as symbols, [to perceive them]. Thus it is said.

Generally, [Vaibhāṣhikas and Sautrāntikas] agree that the definition of mind is that which apprehends simply the essential nature of an object, and mental events are what apprehend just the distinctive features [of an object]. They also are in agreement about the way conditioned phenomena arise, about which they state the following:
• The element-derivatives[308] of forms arise from the elements.
• The substances of cognitions (shes rig gi rdzas) arise in conjunction with the five congruent aspects.[309]
• The entities of [the formative forces] not associated [with forms or mind][310] arise from forms or minds, which are “that which bear a state”[311] (gnas skabs can).
In terms of the paths and their results, they agree • on the main points of the illustrations and defining characteristics of the four truths, which are either objects to be adopted or to be rejected;[312]
• that, in terms of the subjective agent, there are five paths—accumulation, junction, seeing, meditation, and beyond training;
• on the enumeration of four pairs of beings, also called eight kinds of individuals;[313] and
• on most aspects of relinquishment and realization.
They are in agreement about the way [the Buddha] first developed bodhichitta, in the middle phase increased his stores [of merit and wisdom], and in the end became a buddha. They agree that in his last lifetime in cyclic existence when, as a prince, he was to accomplish his aim, he was an ordinary being on the path of accumulation and fully fettered ('ching ba kun ldan), even though he had perfected his stores of merit and wisdom during three incalculable [aeons].[314] They do not assert that the Buddha awakened in Akaniṣhṭha, but rather that this occurred in front of the bodhi tree. At dusk, he tamed the thirty-seven million hordes of Māra. Then, on the same seat, at dawn he attained all the relinquishments and realizations—having progressed from the path of junction to the attainment of the knowledge of the exhaustion [of defilements] and their [subsequent] nonarising315—solely by means of the path of realizing the sixteen aspects of the four truths (impermanence and the others).
Prior to his awakening, the Buddha received key instructions on the worldly meditative concentrations from Arāḍha-kālāma and Udrakorāmaputra,[316] and through his practice of the absorptions of the sphere of Nothingness and the sphere of Neither Discrimination Nor Nondiscrimination, he became separated from passion. Thus the Buddha was free from passion prior to becoming a buddha.
They mostly agree on the presentation of the relinquishments and realizations for the twenty types of saṅgha[317] and on the way someone can regress from the attainment of relinquishments and realizations, with a few minor exceptions.[318] Their presentations of the excellent qualities of the four samādhis, the four formless states, and the four immeasurables are the same. They assert that the truth of suffering is [experienced] on the bhūmi of a buddha, meaning that the Buddha had matured aggregates that were impelled by previous karma and that he had a remainder of defiled karma.[319] They share the belief that the three types of nirvāṇa without remainder—which are [the fruitions attained by] shrāvakas, by pratyekabuddhas, and by buddhas—are the severing of the continuity of cognition (rig pa rgyun chad pa), just like [the extinction of] a fire when its wood is exhausted.

Specific points of disagreements between the Vaibhāṣhikas' and Sautrāntikas' systems of philosophical tenets are found in abundance throughout the Treasury [of Abhidharma]. I will now summarize the Vaibhāṣhikas' positions in a general way.
Vaibhāṣhikas make the following assertions:
• The seven abhidharma texts[320] are compilations of teachings actually contained in sūtras that were extracted by individual arhats, just as was done with the Collection of Meaningful Expressions.[321] Thus, the seven abhidharma treatises are [the Buddha's] words (vachana, bka').
• Since the collection of dharma—the scriptures and so forth—is a series of words, it is included within the category of non-associated formative forces.[322]
• Everything included with the category of forms is either an element or an element-derivative, or is composed of minute particles.
• When minute particles form gross phenomena, a middle particle is surrounded by particles of the six directions; and yet, partless discrete particles (rdul phran cha med sil bu) have interstices, or empty spaces, between them. Minute particles are substantially established (dravyasiddha, rdzas su grub pa). [When they are] of similar types, they perform the same activity. They are like [the hairs in] a yak's tail or [grasses in] a meadow. Although discrete minute particles remain separate, they do not disintegrate because they are held together by karma or wind. Coarse phenomena are also drawn together in one direction by the wind that holds those [partless particles] together.[323]
• As for the way consciousnesses apprehend objects: sense consciousnesses apprehend their respective objects nakedly and immediately without an [intermediary] image,[324] like pliers [taking hold of] a lump of iron. Once a sense faculty sees the actual object (don gyi rang mtshan), a consciousness apprehends it. Vaibhāṣhikas assert that in most cases percepts and their perceivers, as causes and results, arise simultaneously, because a consciousness cannot be produced by something past or future.

The basis [of their system] was delineated by the four great ones and others in reliance upon scriptures.

• The five bases of objects of knowledge,[325] [the phenomena of] the three times, nirvāṇa, and, particularly, non-associated formative forces— which are referents (don) that are other than “that which bear a state” to which states are ascribed326—are substantially existent in the sense of being self-sufficient (rang rkya thub pa'i rdzas yod).[327]
• They assert the three kinds of unconditioned phenomena[328] to be permanent. Furthermore, since they are incapable of positing knowable objects that are not established by way of their essence (ngo bos ma grub pa), they assert that [unconditioned phenomena] are substances or entities that are [positive] determinations.[329] Although they consider unconditioned phenomena to be entities, they never assert them to be conditioned entities able to perform functions.[330] This is because they state that [unconditioned phenomena] have neither cause nor result, as is said [in the Treasury of Abhidharma]:[331]
Unconditioned phenomena do not have those [that is, causes and results].
• They state that arhats can regress to the state of a once returner (phyir 'ong) and so forth.
• They say that the truth of cessation is something attained through the five faculties,[332] is the supreme of all phenomena, is the substance of separation (bral ba'i rdzas), and so forth; thus they consider the truth of cessation to be an entity.
• Citing the example of the way a sword cannot cut itself, they do not believe that consciousness (shes pa) can be a reflexive awareness [i.e., a consciousness aware of itself] (rang rig), or that it can experience itself. They state that every consciousness is an other-awareness [i.e., a consciousness aware of what is “other,” meaning outer objects] (gzhan rig).
The phrase “and other points” in this root verse refers to other of their numerous unique positions, such as that they are not able to posit that the nonimplicative negation that is the simple negation of the self of persons is thusness.[333]
It is well known that the four great venerable ones,[334] the Kashmiri Saṅghabhadra,[335] the venerable Anantavarman,[336] and others, in reliance upon teachings found in scriptures [of the Buddha], clearly delineated the basis of this system of philosophical tenets.

Dārṣhṭāntikas (Exemplifiers), or Sautrāntikas,[337] mostly state the opposite of the Vaibhāṣhikas, meaning Sautrāntikas do not make the same assertions as the Vaibhāṣhikas on the topics just explained. It is said:
Jñānaprasthāna (Entering Primordial Wisdom)[338] was composed by
Kātāyanīputra;
Prakaraṇapāda (Correct Analysis)[339] by Vasumitra;
Dharmaskandha (Dharma Aggregate)[340] by Shāriputra; Prajñāptishāstra[341] (Treatise on Designations)[342] by Maudgalyāyana; Vijñānakāya (Collection of Consciousnesses)[343] by Devasharman;[344] Saṅgītiparyāya (Enumerations of Persons)[345] by Mahākauṣhṭhila; and Dhātukāya (Collection of Constituents)[346] by Pūrṇa.
Sautrāntikas believe that these seven abhidharma texts[347] are treatises (shāstras, bstan bcos) [and not the words of the Buddha] because they were composed independently by those arhats.
• They assert that the collection of scriptural dharma—which has the characteristics of terms, and covers all that is contained in the scriptural tradition—is included within the aggregate of forms.
• As for forms, like [the Vaibhāṣhikas] above, they say that there are two types: minute particles, which are building blocks; and gross phenomena, which are constructed with those. Sautrāntikas, however, say that minute particles circle [each other] and do not join, but they also have no interstices between them. Hence, they are perceived as touching, like
[the pages of] a bound book.[348]
• Sense faculties are matter (bem po) and, therefore, they are not what sees referents.
• External referents (phyi don) are considered to be hidden.[349] Because
[external referents objects] are past [when a consciousness arises], they are not what a consciousness sees. Thus, [Sautrāntikas posit] what is called “an image,”[350] which is an appearance of consciousness that has been cast by the referent. Although the referent has ceased, the image that is consciousness set by that [referent] is experienced as the likeness of the referent. This is designated as the experience [of the referent]. A consciousness apprehending an object perceives by means of an image [acting] as an intermediary (bar du chod pa).
• Sautrāntikas state that percepts and their perceivers, as causes and results, arise sequentially, not simultaneously.
Given the Sautrāntikas' position that external referents are hidden [phenomena], they are similar to Chittamātra Proponents of Real Images in considering dualistic appearances to be cognition (shes pa). Nevertheless, these systems differ as to whether “what casts [images]” (gtod byed) is an external referent or not: [for Sautrāntikas, it is an external referent that casts the image; for Chittamātra Proponents of Real Images, it is not].

• Among the five bases (which are knowable objects), forms, mind, and either two or three of the mental events—feelings, discriminations, and, [in some cases,] intentions—exist substantially.[351] Everything else is asserted to be imputedly existent entities—meaning that they are designated [as entities simply] in relation to [having some] aspects [of entities]352—or to be imputedly existent nonentities (dngos med).
• They consider the three types of unconditioned phenomena (space and the others) to be permanent, but [simply] as nonimplicative negations that just refute their impermanence. In terms of what is determined,[353] this means that they assert [unconditioned phenomena] simply to be knowable objects that have no established essence, like the horns of a rabbit.
• Using the analogy that if something does not illuminate itself, it cannot illuminate something that is other than itself, they say that consciousness is twofold: it is reflexive awareness (rang rig), which is an inwards-facing experiencer, and it is other-awareness (gzhan rig), which is an outwards-facing experiencer. [The relationship between a consciousness and the objects it cognizes is like that of a crystal and the colors that appear within it:] colors appearing in a clear crystal are of the nature of that crystal. Thus, since a consciousness is that which is aware of referents that are of the same nature as itself, it is an authentic reflexive awareness (rang rig mtshan nyid pa) and a nominal referent-awareness (don rig btags pa ba).
• They maintain that [the phenomena of] the three times are not substantially established, that they are mentally imputed entities.
The phrase “and other points” in this root verse includes the following:
• Sautrāntikas assert that both nirvāṇa with remainder and without remainder are nonimplicative negations, which negate the factors that are to be abandoned by remedies; that is, they are a mere nothingness.
• They say that arhats regress just from the meditative concentration of resting at ease in the present life,[354] and these arhats are called “those who regress.”[355] They do not accept, however, that arhats regress from their result.
• They assert that the truth of cessation is a nonentity for the following reasons: It cannot be observed by a valid cognizer[356] to be an entity, the way a form or feeling can be, or to be a potential (nus pa), the way the eyes can be. Also the sūtras refer to it as “separation,” “exhaustion,”
“disappearance,” and “cessation.”
• Sautrāntikas are able to posit that the nonimplicative negation that is the mere negation of a self of persons is thusness.[357]
The basis of this system of philosophical tenets relies upon the sūtra section of the Victor's scriptures and is explained by the venerable Saṅgharakṣhita,[358] Shrīlāta,[359] and others. The details of the Sautrāntika philosophy can be understood from the Treasury of Abhidharma's Auto-Commentary [that is, the Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma”].[360]

Although there are many descriptions by different masters of the way the Shrāvaka orders (nikāya, sde pa) are divided—such as that there was one [root order], two, three, and so on361—the presentation of four main orders is the most well-known.[362] The four are [Mūla]sarvāstivādins;[363] Mahāsāṅghikas; Sthaviras; and Saṃmitīyas.[364]

Mūlasarvāstivādins
Mūlasarvāstivādins (gZhi thams cad yod par smra ba, Proponents of the Existence of All Bases) are known by that name because they are the basis (mūla, gzhi) for all the orders; and because they state that the five bases (mūla, gzhi), which are knowable objects, exist (asti, yod pa) substantially.
• This order recited their scriptures in Sanskrit (“the well-formed language”).
• Their lineage originated from Rāhula, a master of the warrior caste (kṣhatriya) who was devoted to the trainings (bslab pa).
• Their upper robe (saṅghāṭī, snam sbyar) had between nine and twenty-five patches (snam phran), and their symbol was a wheel and lotus.
• Their names ended with shrī (dpal, glorious), bhadra (bzang po, excellent), or garbha (or sārā) (snying po, heart).[365]
• Their philosophical tenets[366] included the positions that
• [the phenomena of] the three times exist substantially;
• all conditioned phenomena are momentary;
• a self of persons does not exist; and
• buddhahood is attained after three incalculable aeons.

Mahāsānghikas
Mahāsāṅghikas (dGe 'dun phal chen pa, Majority of the Community) are referred to as such because, at the time of the split, the majority of the saṅgha formed this group.
• This order [recited in] Prakṛit (the vernacular language).[367]
• Their [lineage originated from] Kāshyapa, a master of the Brahman caste who excelled in the ascetic practices.[368]
• Their [upper robe] had between seven and twenty-three patches, and their symbol was an endless knot (shrivatsa).
• Their names ended in jñāna (ye shes, primordial wisdom) or gupta (sbas pa, hidden).
• Their philosophical tenets included such assertions as
• the self [of persons] and the aggregates are separate;
• the [four] truths are seen all at once;[369]
• it is possible to regress even from the level of supreme qualities;[370] and
• the sense faculties do not apprehend objects.

Sthaviras
Sthaviras (gNas brtan pa, Elders or Firm Abiders) are called that because they state that they belong to the lineage of sthavira noble ones.
• This order [recited in] Pishācha (the flesh-eaters' language).[371]
• Their [lineage originated from] Kātyāyana, a master belonging to the caste of bamboo workers who was foremost in taming the people of the border lands.
• Their [upper robe] had between five and twenty-one patches, and their symbol was a conch.
• Their names ended in ākara ('byung gnas, source) or varma (or sannāha) (go cha, armor).
• Their philosophical tenets included assertions such as
• the Buddha did not teach in Sanskrit;
• mind is present during the absorption of cessation;[372]
• mistaken consciousness (log shes) is not present [during absorption in cessation];and
• buddhahood is attained after ten incalculable [aeons] at the least and thirty at the most.

Saṃmitīyas
Saṃmitīyas (Mang pos bkur ba, Followers of Mahāsammata) are called that because they are holders of the lineage of the master Mahāsammata, [whose name means] he who was honored (bkur ba), or revered, by many (mang ba) beings.
• This order [recited in] Apabhraṃsha (the corrupted language).[373]
• Their [lineage originated from] Upāli, a master belonging to the caste of barbers who was supreme in upholding the vinaya.
• Their upper robe was similar to that of the Sthaviras.
• Their names ended in “commoner” ('bangs) or “class” (sde).
• Their philosophical tenets included assertions such as
• the existence of an inexplicable self [or person];[374]
• all knowable objects are considered to be both explicable and inexplicable;
• conditioned phenomena with stable continuities are eliminated by destructive objects other than themselves; and
• the path of seeing is [attained] after twelve moments.[375]

It is also explained that those orders had different ways of reciting the Sūtra of Individual Liberation[376] and formulating the proscriptions and downfalls (bcas ltung). There is also the explanation that the Mahāsāṅghikas were the basis of the [four] root [orders]. Name changes are [part of] the present-day [ordination ceremony], but were not part of the original ceremony.[377] The differentiation [of the orders in terms of their] robes, names, and so forth has been explained according to Atīsha's exegesis.
Since the Hevajra Tantra, in the fourth chapter of its second section, correlates the four orders to the four chakras,[378] and it is explained that the four faces of Kālachakra taught the four orders,[379] these are authoritative sources for the position that there were four root orders.

The way the eighteen orders developed from the four main orders is stated in Vinītadeva's Compendium on the Different Orders:[380]
Pūrvashailas,[381] Aparashailas,[382] Haimavatas,[383] Lokottaravādins,[384] and Prajñaptivādins[385] are the five orders of Mahāsāṅghikas.
Sarvāstivādins,[386] Kāshyapīyas,[387] Mahīshāsakas,[388] Dharmaguptakas,[389] Bahushrutīyas,[390] Tāmrashāṭīyas,[391] and Vibhajvavādins[392] are the [seven] orders of Sarvāstivādins.
Jetavanīyas,[393] Abhayagirikas,[394] and Mahāvihārins[395] are the [three] Sthaviras.
Kurukullas,[396] Avantakas,[397] and Vatsīputrīyas[398] are the three Saṃmitīyas.
These are the eighteen groups that formed because of their different geographical locations, points [of doctrine], and masters.
That is the explanation that the eighteen orders are the five Mahāsāṅghikas, the seven Sarvāstivādins, the three Sthaviras, and the three Saṃmitīyas. Their dissimilarities arose only because their followers lived in different areas, had different ways of asserting the points of their philosophical tenet systems, and had different founding masters; they do not differ in terms of being paths to liberation. The Sūtra of a Teaching Given in a Dream[399] to
King Kṛikī states:
Great king, you dreamt that you saw eighteen people divide a single piece of cloth and that each person received a piece without the original being diminished. This signifies that although the teachings of Shākyamuni will split into eighteen parts, the cloth of freedom will not be diminished.
We should know that the eighteen orders do not differ in terms of their qualities.

If the eighteen orders are simplified, they fall into two groups: propounders of a self [of persons] and propounders of an absence of a self [of persons]. The five Saṃmitīyas (the Vātsīputrīyas and the others)[400] assert an inexplicable self [or person]. They maintain that although the person cannot be described as being the same as or separate from the aggregates, or as permanent or impermanent, and so forth, it is substantially existent in the sense of being self-sufficient. All the other Vaibhāṣhika orders, as well as the Sautrāntikas, state that there is no self [of persons]. The Blaze of Reasoning explains:[401]
Among those orders, the eight Mahāsāṅghikas[402] (who were listed first) and (within the [ten Sthaviras] who were listed second) the Sthaviras, Sarvāstivādins, Mahīshāsakas, Dharmottaras,[403] and Kāshyapīyas are propounders of the nonexistence of a self [of persons]. They maintain that the self and “mine” imputed by the assertions of the tīrthikas are empty, and that all phenomena have no self-entity.
The remaining five orders, Vātsīputrīyas and the others,[404] are propounders of a person. They state that while the person cannot be said to be identical with nor other than the aggregates, it is cognizable by the six consciousnesses and it is clearly what circles in saṃsāra.

It is said that the Shrāvaka orders' refutation of the Mahāyāna is [a reflection of] their inability to comprehend the Mahāyāna's profundity and vastness, and that this is attributable to their inferior scholastic knowledge (rtog ge nyid kyi shes rab), beliefs, and weak merit. Their assertion that ultimate reality is substantially established reflects a similar flaw of not understanding the intention (dgongs pa) of [the Buddha's] teachings. It is for these reasons that the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras[405] and other texts discuss in detail how the Mahāyāna is in fact [the Buddha's] words.
The Vaibhāṣhikas' assertion of substantial existence is refuted by Sautrāntikas. The Sautrāntikas' position regarding imputed existence[406] is refuted by the Chittamātras by means of numerous scriptures and reasonings. In particular, since the belief in an inexplicable self [or person] is such an inferior view, it is thoroughly refuted in the Root Commentary on the Kālachakra Tantra,[407] Entrance to the Middle Way,[408] and other texts. Although [the Vaibhāṣhikas' and Sautrāntikas'] general presentations of ground, path, and result seem to conflict with those of the higher [philosophical tenet systems], they are not, however, wrong. They are the shrāvakas' own systems and, thus, they have merit.

The Buddha appeared in the world and the doctrines he taught remain and are practiced. This makes it possible for one, first, to abide by the ethical conduct of one of the seven or eight sets of vows of individual liberation.[409]
Then, with a qualified spiritual mentor, one studies, in keeping with the level of one's acumen, the nine scriptural categories[410] according to the shrāvakas, which are contained within the three collections of scripture. Study is followed by critical reflection. By meditating on the topics of reflection, which are the sixteen aspects of the four truths (impermanence and the others),[411] one will progress gradually through the five paths of the shrāvakas (accumulation, junction, and so forth) by applying the thirty-seven factors for awakening (byang phyogs so bdun). Finally one attains the four results: stream enterer (srota-āpanna, rgyun zhugs pa), once returner (sakṛid-āgāmin, lan cig phyir 'ong ba), nonreturner (anāgāmin, phyir mi 'ong ba), and arhat (dgra bcom pa).

For those approaching the result of a shrāvaka stream enterer, the particular features of their relinquishment[412] are that it is possible that they have not relinquished any of the afflictions of the desire realm ('dod nyon), or that they may have abandoned the fourth or the fifth afflictions[413] of the desire realm. They will not have abandoned the sixth affliction at all for it is not possible that those approaching this result have abandoned the sixth.[414]
The particular features of their realization are that they abide in any one of the first fifteen of sixteen moments, which are the path of seeing.[415] The sixteen moments comprise the following:
• the acceptance of phenomena,[416] knowledge of phenomena,[417] subsequent acceptance, and subsequent knowledge[418] related to the truth of suffering (1–4);
• the acceptance of phenomena, knowledge of phenomena, subsequent acceptance, and subsequent knowledge related to the truth of the origins of suffering (5–8), related to the truth of cessation (9–12), and related to the truth of the path[419] (13–16).
Those approaching the result of a stream enterer fall into two categories:
(1) followers of faith,[420] who are of lower acumen; and (2) followers of dharma,[421] who are of higher acumen.

The specifics of the relinquishments of those who abide in the result of a stream enterer are the same as those on the previous level. The distinctive feature of their realization is that they have attained the realization of the sixteenth moment, which is the subsequent knowledge of the truth of the path.[422]
There are four classifications[423] of abiders in the result of a stream enterer: (1) those of lower acumen, (2) those of higher acumen, and (3–4) [two] ways of taking birth.
First, there are two types in terms of acumen: (1) Those who were of lower acumen as approachers [to the result of a stream enterer now] become those who aspire through faith (shraddhādhimukta, dad pas mos pa).
(2) Those who were of higher acumen become those who attain through seeing (dṛiṣhṭiprāpta, mthong bas thob pa).[424]
Second, in terms of the way they take rebirth, there are two types: (1) those who will take rebirth seven times in cyclic existence (saptakṛitparamaḥ, lan bdun pa); and (2) those who will take rebirth two times, who are called “those born into the same class” (kulaṃkula, rigs nas rigs su skye ba).
(1) For [those who take rebirth seven times,] the basic state is that of abiders in the result of a stream enterer [with the qualification that] they have not freed themselves at all from the afflictions of the desire realm. [Rebirth can manifest in the following two ways:] Those who attained that [result of a stream enterer] as a god will be reborn seven times as a god, then seven times as a human, and will [experience] two sets of seven states as a bardo being (bar srid), making twenty-eight [states] altogether. Those who attained [the result of a stream enterer] as a human will take rebirth as a human seven times, as a god seven times, and as a bardo being seven times during each [of those series of births], making twenty-eight.
Following those rebirths, they all become approachers to once returners. They are called “those who take rebirth in cyclic existence seven times” because the seven sets of lives have similar qualities. This is similar to the way that someone is called “wise in the seven things” [because they know topics grouped in sevens,] or a tree is called “seven-leafed” [because each branch has seven leaves].[425] There are, however, other ways that [taking seven rebirths] is explained.
(2) “Those born into the same class” have the same basic state of being an abider in the result of a stream enterer [with the qualification that] it is possible that they have abandoned either the third or the fourth affliction of the desire [realm, but] they will not have abandoned the fifth at all.[426]
They will take two rebirths in the same class of being that they were when they attained [the result of a stream enterer], be it a god or human.[427]

A subdivision of the abiders in the result of a once returner[428] is “those interrupted for one life.”[429] As for their relinquishments and realizations: In terms of relinquishment, it is possible that they have abandoned the seventh and eighth afflictions of the desire realm, but they will not have abandoned the ninth affliction at all. Realization on this level is the same as before.
Even though “once returners” are the type who return once to the desire realm, if they exert themselves in the path of a nonreturner, they will proceed to that level. However, in the case of those belonging to the subdivision of “those having one interruption for one life,” they will definitely return [to the desire realm for one more rebirth].

When approachers to a nonreturner have abandoned the ninth affliction of the desire realm,[430] they become abiders in its result. They fall into four main categories:
(1) those who go to the form realm (gzugs su nyer 'gro);
(2) those who go to the formless realm (gzugs med nyer 'gro);
(3) those who [attain] peace in this lifetime (mthong chos la zhi); and
(4) those who physically actualize [nirvāṇa] (lus mngon byed).
(1) Those who go to the form realm are of three types:
(a) those who pass beyond [misery] in the bardo (bar dor 'da' ba);
(b) those who pass beyond [misery] after birth (skyes nas 'da' ba); and
(c) those who rise to a higher state [and then attain nirvāṇa] (gong du 'pho ba).
(1a) [Those who pass beyond misery in the bardo:] The basic state is that of abiders in the result of a nonreturner. [Their specific characteristic is that] they are the type who pass beyond misery in the bardo that is a support for [i.e., is the state prior to or on the way to] any one of the sixteen levels of the form realm (with Great Brahmā being the one excluded).[431]
(1b) Those who pass beyond [misery] after birth are of three types:
(i) those who pass beyond [misery] after they are born (skyes nas 'da' ba);
(ii) those [who pass beyond misery] through application ('du byed can); and
(iii) those [who pass beyond misery] without application ('du byed med pa).[432]
(i) [Those who pass beyond misery after they are born] are the type who pass beyond misery as soon as they are born in any one of the sixteen levels of the form realm (with Great Brahmā again being the one excluded).
(ii) [Those who pass beyond misery through application] are the type who pass beyond [misery] by applying themselves with effort to the path after they have taken birth in [any one of] those states [of the form realm].
(iii) [Those who pass beyond misery without application] are the kind who pass beyond [misery] without any effort simply by engaging in the path after they have been born in [any one of] those [states of the form realm].

(1c) Those who rise to a higher state [and then pass beyond misery] are of two types:
(i)those who rise to Akaniṣhṭha[433] ('og min du 'pho ba); and
(ii) those who rise to the Pinnacle of Existence[434] (srid rtser 'pho ba).
(i)Those who rise to Akaniṣhṭha are of three kinds:
(aa) leapers ('phar ba);
(bb) half-leapers (phyed 'phar ba); and
(cc)those who rise through all [the levels] (kun 'pho).
(aa) [Leapers] are abiders in the result of a nonreturner who are born in their next life in Brahmā Type[435] and then leap to the state of Akaniṣhṭha, [thereby passing over fifteen levels of the form realm]. In Akaniṣhṭha they pass beyond misery.
(bb) [Half-leapers] are the kind who are born in Brahmā
Type in their next life and then take birth in one of the four pure states.[436] Following that, they rise to the level of
Akaniṣhṭha, where they pass beyond misery.
(cc) [Those who rise through all the levels] are the type who take birth in all sixteen levels of the form realm one after the other (with the exception of Great Brahmā). Following their [last] death, they pass beyond misery in the state of Akaniṣhṭha.
(ii) Those who rise to the Pinnacle of Existence are similar in that they are the kind who are born in Brahmā Type in their next life. Following that, they rise to the state of the Pinnacle of Existence, where they pass beyond misery.
(2) Those who go to the formless realm are the type who are born in their next life in one of the first three levels of the formless realm, after which they pass beyond misery in the state of the Pinnacle of
Existence. It is said about this [type]:
Wherever they die in the formless [realm], that is where [they pass beyond misery].[437]
[This category] does not have the type who pass beyond [misery] in the bardo.[438] It does, however, have three types who pass beyond misery after birth and three types of leapers, who are similar to the ones described above [for the form realm].[439]
(3) Those who [attain] peace in this lifetime are the type who pass beyond misery during the same state [i.e., life] in which they attained the level of abiding in the result of a nonreturner.
(4) Those who physically actualize [nirvāṇa] are the type who pass beyond misery having actualized the absorption of cessation.[440]

With the abandonment of the ninth affliction of the [Pinnacle of] Existence, they are liberated from the bonds of the habitual conduct (kun spyod) of the three realms and become an abider in the result of an arhat.[441] This is classified in three ways:[442]
The twofold classification in terms of relinquishment:
(1) those with twofold liberation (ubhayatobhāgavimukta, gnyis ka'i cha las rnam grol), who are liberated from both the afflictive obscurations (nyon sgrib) and the obscurations to absorption (snyoms 'jug gi sgrib pa); and
(2) those liberated by means of wisdom (prajñāvimukta, shes rab kyis rnam grol), who are only liberated from the afflictive obscurations.
The twofold classification in terms of excellent qualities:
(1) those with the ornaments (sālaṃkāra, rgyan can) of the degenerative (zag bcas) supercognitive abilities (magical powers and the others)[443] that pertain to their respective level;[444] and
(2) those without ornaments (niralaṃkāra, rgyan med).[445]
The twofold classification in terms of liberation:
(1) those with the remainder (sheṣha, lhag bcas) of the aggregates, which appropriate suffering; and
(2) those called “arhats without remainder” (asheṣha, lhag med) because their [aggregates] have been exhausted[446] and their [state of an arhat] has been brought to completion (mthar phyin pa).

Shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are similar simply in terms of being [classified as] Hīnayāna; from the perspective of their causes and results, they are very different. From a causal perspective, the Treasury [of Abhidharma] says:[449]
The swift are released in three existences.
The rhinoceros [are released] through the causes [they cultivate] during one hundred aeons.
In terms of the result, the distinctive qualities of their type are as follows. Those of the pratyekabuddha[450] type have a strong sense of pride and, consequently, wish to manifest awakening on their own in a world devoid of buddhas and shrāvakas and without any teachers or rivals. They naturally have few mental afflictions, and thus they dislike distractions and seek solitude. Since their compassion is weak, they do not delight in benefiting others and the scope of their concern is limited. Given that their wisdom is more profound than that of the shrāvakas, they do not need to be taught by others and can manifest awakening using their own intelligence.
The distinctions of their path are as follows. In addition to understanding the sixteen aspects of the four truths (impermanence and the others),[451] pratyekabuddhas realize how the twelve links of dependent origination[452] are engaged and reversed ('jug ldog). On top of realizing the absence of a self of persons, they also realize that perceived objects have no nature. Thus it is taught that the pratyekabuddhas' realization is distinguished by their realization of one and a half absences of self-entity.[453]

The meaning of the term pratyekabuddha (rang sangs rgyas; self[-realized] buddha) is as follows. Without relying on anyone else as their master, they manifest their own awakening through the power of their own wisdom and, therefore, are known as “self-awakened” (rang byang chub). Alternatively, in his Commentary on the “Teachings Requested by Akṣhayamati,”[454]
[Vasubandhu] says that they are called “realizers by means of conditions”
(rkyen rtogs)[455] because their primordial wisdom realizes dependent origination by means of the condition of an observed object.[456]

<d e="2">
The entryway for pratyekabuddhas is the twelve links of dependent origination, which has external and internal aspects. In terms of the first, the causal forms of external dependent origination include earth, water, fire, space, and time; and its resultant forms include roots, stalks, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits. The forward sequence (lugs 'byung) is that when causes are present, their results will arise, and the reverse sequence (lugs ldog) is that when the causes are canceled, their results are canceled. Pratyekabuddhas take these as analogies for internal dependent origination. They examine a skeleton and understand that it comes from old age and death. Accordingly, they work through the steps to realizing that ignorance is the root of saṃsāra, thereby understanding the forward order of dependent origination. They also recognize that by reversing ignorance, the formative forces are canceled, and so on up through the reversal of old age and death; thus they realize the reverse sequence of dependent origination.

<d e="2">
Pratyekabuddhas' meditation on dependent origination involves two modes for both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa: a forward mode and a reverse mode.
First: Samsāra
The sequence of engaging saṃsāra through the power of afflictive phenomena (saṃklesha, kun nyon) is the process as it usually is. This is described in a sūtra:[457]
The condition of ignorance produces the formative forces. The condition of the formative forces generates the consciousnesses . . . The condition of birth results in aging, death, misery, lamentation, suffering, unhappiness, and agitation. In this way, it is only a great mass of suffering that arises.
The reverse sequence is the reverse of that order, as is stated:
Aging, death, and so forth follow birth. Birth comes from existence, and existence comes from grasping . . . Formative forces develop because of ignorance.
These sequences are distinguished from each other solely on the basis of their order; in fact, they are equivalent in terms of producing conviction about the causes and results of saṃsāra.
Second: Nirvāna
The sequence of engaging nirvāṇa through the power of purified phenomena (vyavadāna, rnam par byang ba) is stated as follows:
From [the perspective of] the descending order, when ignorance is stopped, the formative forces are stopped. When the formative forces are halted, the consciousnesses are halted . . . When birth is stopped, aging, death, and so forth come to an end.
The reverse sequence is described as
When birth is stopped, aging and death are stopped. When existence is halted, birth is halted . . . When ignorance is stopped, the formative forces come to an end.
These sequences are also simply different in terms of their order, but they are, in fact, identical ways to attain nirvāṇa. Therefore, because it is the case that when fundamental ignorance is stopped one is freed from all suffering, pratyekabuddhas set out to develop true wisdom in order to relinquish that ignorance.

The Treatises on the Bhūmis[458] explain that pratyekabuddhas, like shrāvakas, only realize the absence of a self of persons. On the other hand, the Ornament of Clear Realization says:[459]
Know that the path of the rhinoceros-like is summarized accurately by [three things]: that they abandon the concept of perceived referents, that they do not relinquish [the notion] of a perceiver, and [the particular quality of] their support.
In addition to realizing the absence of a self of persons, pratyekabuddhas realize that perceived referents have no nature, which is one part of the self-entity of phenomena. This [interpretation] accords with the position of most [scholars].

Rhinoceros-like (khaḍgaviṣhāṇakalpa, bse ru lta bu) pratyekabuddhas are of the highest acumen. Like the single horn of a rhinoceros,[461] they dwell alone out of their fear of busyness and distraction, and thus they are given that name.[462] For one hundred great aeons they please the buddhas who appear, thereby accruing stores [of merit and wisdom]. They also become proficient in the six topics of training: the aggregates, constituents, sense spheres, dependent origination, what is the case and what is not the case, and the truth.[463] During their final phase of cyclic existence,[464] they make three aspirations: to be born in a world without buddhas and shrāvakas; to attain awakening on their own, not relying upon a master or anyone else; and to benefit others only by physical gestures that communicate the dharma, not by verbal communications. With these three aspirations they take their final birth in one of three castes[465] (and not the laborer, or shūdra, caste) in a world devoid of buddhas and shrāvakas. In that state [i.e., lifetime] through the force of their previous aspirations, they become fully ordained monastics without preceptors (upādhyāya) or masters (āchārya). They meditate on the sixteen aspects of the four truths (impermanence and the others), relying on the distinctive “final perfection,” which is the fourth meditative concentration.[466] On one seat they proceed from the path of junction to the attainment of the primordial wisdom of an arhat, which is endowed with the knowledge of the exhaustion [of defilements] and the knowledge of their [subsequent] nonarising.[467] This explanation accords with the shrāvaka tradition.
The Mahāyāna's [Compendium of] Abhidharma explains that pratyekabuddhas require a series of lifetimes to proceed from the level of heat [on the path of junction] to the knowledge of the exhaustion [of defilements] and the knowledge of their [subsequent] nonarising.

The pratyekabuddhas called “congregating practitioners” (vargachārin, tshogs spyod) are said to be like parrots, who fly in flocks. Thus, their basic quality is that they meditate with their companions. [There are two subtypes: the lesser congregating practitioners (tshogs spyod chung ngu) and the greater congregating practitioners (tshogs spyod chen po).]
The lesser congregating practitioners have accrued stores [of merit and wisdom] like the previous type [i.e., the rhinoceros-like pratyekabuddhas]. During their final phase of cyclic existence, they become learned in the six topics [of training] and develop through the middle level of patience [on the path of junction]. To progress through the rest of the paths, they again become proficient in the six topics. They take their last birth [propelled] by their three aspiration prayers and attain the result according to their type. This group is of lower acumen.
The greater congregating practitioners are similar to the previous type, except for the following differences. During their final phase of cyclic existence, they become learned in the six topics [of training], see the truth, and attain one of the first three results. Since they have been unable to attain the level of an arhat, they again become skilled in the six topics in order to attain that state. They take [their last birth] through [the force of] their three aspiration prayers and attain the result according to their type.
This group is of intermediate acumen. Both [congregating types] take two lifetimes [to achieve their aims].
All three types of pratyekabuddhas bring to their minds profound dependent origination and the three doors to liberation.[468] To counteract others' lack of faith, they display whatever miraculous powers are appropriate. By being peaceful and restrained when they are out seeking alms, they teach the dharma that brings the realization of dependent origination through silent physical communications.
Generally, the Treatises on the Bhūmis explain shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas in terms of higher and lower acumen and results, but since their expositions of the paths are mostly the same, they do not have separate collections of scriptures. In keeping with this approach, many Indian and
Tibetan texts conflate the philosophical tenet systems of shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. On the other hand, the Sūtra Dispelling the Remorse of [King] Ajātashatru[469] and the Kālachakra Tantra state that pratyekabuddhas have their own collections of scriptures, and, following those, some texts make a distinction between their tenet systems. Here, I have made separate presentations of the philosophical tenet systems of shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas because, despite the fact that their tenet systems are mostly the same, they do have many dissimilarities, and because the general expression “three yānas” is well known in the scriptures.[470]

(3) their relinquishments of the factors to be abandoned;
(4) the results they attain; and

First: [Realizations]
Those who, in addition to realizing the absence of a self of persons, clearly and completely realize the absence of a self-entity of phenomena, belong to the Mahāyāna; those without such realization belong to the Hīnayāna. This accords with [Nāgārjuna's] statement in his Praises of the Transcendent One:[472]
You taught that those who do not realize that characteristics do not exist are not liberated.
Therefore you presented this in its entirety in the Mahāyāna.

<d e="2">
Second: [Trainings]
They differ [in terms of their training]: [Mahāyāna practitioners] are motivated by their intentions of love, compassion, and bodhichitta, and undertake to train in the six pāramitās; [Hīnayāna practitioners] have neither [such intentions nor such trainings]. This accords with the statement by Āchārya Shūra:[473]
The rhinoceros-like have never heard even the words “six pāramitās.”
It is only the Bhagavat who abides in all six pāramitās.

<d e="2">
Third: [Relinquishments]
The Hīnayāna is able to remove the afflictive obscurations (kleṣhāvaraṇa, nyon sgrib) in their entirety, but cannot remove completely the cognitive obscurations (jñeyāvaraṇa, shes bya'i sgrib pa). The Mahāyāna is able to remove both obscurations along with all their habitual tendencies.

<d e="2">
Fourth: [Results]
The Hīnayāna is inferior in terms of its method and wisdom, thus it is for those who aspire only for a nirvāṇa [that is] peace. The Ornament of Clear Realization states:[474]
[Bodhisattvas] do not abide in existence owing to their wisdom, and they do not abide in peace owing to their compassion.
Accordingly, since the Mahāyāna teaches about profound wisdom and extensive methods, it is for those who aspire to and will achieve a nirvāṇa that does not consist of abiding in the extremes of existence or peace.

Fifth: [Seven Greatnesses]
The Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras says:[475]
Because [the Mahāyāna] possesses [seven] greatnesses — great focus; the two accomplishments; primordial wisdom; the cultivation of diligence; skill in methods; the greatness of true accomplishments; and the great activity of the buddhas — it is described definitively as “the Greater Vehicle.”
</d>
</f>

</d>
<d e="2">
To take those in order:
(1) [Greatness of focus means that Mahāyāna practitioners] focus on the great breadth of the Mahāyāna collection of scriptures (piṭakas, sde snod).
(2) [Its two accomplishments] are to be of benefit to oneself and others.
(3) [The Mahāyāna's primordial wisdom] is the realization of the twofold absence of self-entity.[476]
(4) [Bodhisattvas] cultivate the diligence of devoted application throughout three incalculable aeons[477] [on the Mahāyāna path].
(5) [The Mahāyāna's skillful methods mean that] since [bodhisattvas] have not forsaken [beings in] saṃsāra and have none of the afflictive phenomena (saṃklesha, kun nyon), they may, for example, do [any of] the seven physical or verbal unvirtuous actions.[478]
(6) [The true accomplishments of the Mahāyāna] are to perfectly achieve the strengths, fearlessnesses, and unique qualities of a buddha.[479]
(7) [Buddha activity] is spontaneous, uninterrupted activity.
The Mahāyāna possesses those [seven greatnesses]; the Hīnayāna does not.

The Compendium of the Mahāyāna says:[481]
The source of knowable objects; the characteristics; engaging those; its causes and results; its unfolding; its three trainings; and its results—the relinquishments and primordial wisdoms—are what make the [Mahā]yāna outstanding and distinguished.
Such quotations are representative of innumerable similar ones found in the teachings [of the Buddha] and the commentaries on their intention.

Entering this yāna provides us with the power to travel to buddhahood. It enables us to develop vast wisdom and a sphere of far-reaching activity, and to attain the joys of the elevated states[484] and the happiness of definitive excellence.[485] Thus it is termed “Mahāyāna” (Greater Vehicle). The Condensed [Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra] explains why:
Why is it called the Mahāyāna of awakening?
When traveled upon, it takes sentient beings beyond misery.
This yāna is a palace of immeasurable proportions, like space.
It is the supreme of yānas: the means for truly attaining joy, pleasure, and happiness.
[The Pāramitāyāna] is called a philosophical[486] [yāna], because it portrays
(mtshon par byed pa) the path and its attributes that directly connect us to the unified state of Vajradhara, the final fruition. In relationship to the primordial wisdom of unification (which is nonabiding nirvāṇa, the ultimate result), [the Pāramitāyāna] is referred to as the cause-based yāna since it takes as its practice the cause-based part [of the Mahāyāna path that leads] to that [primordial wisdom].[487]

Generally speaking, people who journey on the Mahāyāna path possess great minds: their propensities (rigs) for the Mahāyāna have been awakened by circumstances, they have developed the intention of the two kinds of bodhichitta,[489] and they have the capacity to engage in the extensive conduct of awakening as their undertaking. With those [qualities] as a basis, there are three levels of acumen: lower, higher, and highest. Those of lower acumen have an interest in and forbearance for the pāramitā of wisdom, but when they engage in the first five pāramitās, such as generosity, they are unable to bring the pāramitā of wisdom to bear. Such people are known as beginning bodhisattvas. Those of higher acumen are able to apply the pāramitā of wisdom to their practice of generosity and the other pāramitās. Those who are of the highest acumen are able to bring a distinctive [aspect of] the pāramitā of wisdom to bear on their practice of generosity and the other pāramitās, meaning their intuitive reflexive awareness (so so rang rig) directly recognizes the natures [of the other five pāramitās].

The same text states:[496]
It is explained that they are what dispels poverty; what produces coolness; what prevents anger; what is the supreme application; what focuses the mind; and what knows the ultimate.
“What dispels poverty” is given as the etymology of generosity. The [Sanskrit] equivalent for generosity (sbyin pa) is dāna. Dā is from dāridrya,[497] meaning “poverty.” Na is a negating word, [meaning] “eliminate.” Since [dāna] means “to eliminate and dispel poverty,” it is [the word] used for generosity.

The Divisions
Each of the eighteen divisions of the root pāramitās, which were described in the section on the vows of a bodhisattva,[499] has the following six qualities, making one hundred and eight divisions of the pāramitās:
(1) it is done for the welfare of sentient beings;
(2) it is done in a way that does not harm sentient beings;
(3) it is done with forbearance for the sufferings involved with difficult deeds;
(4) it is done without being interrupted by other activities;
(5) it is done with an undistracted mind; and
(6) it is done with the understanding that everything is empty and illusionlike.
Alternatively, the Ornament of Clear Realization states:[500]
Since each of them incorporates each of the six—generosity and the others— armor[like] accomplishment is described in terms of the six sets of six.
Since each of the six pāramitās incorporates the other six—such that there is the generosity of generosity, the ethics of generosity, and so forth—there are also thirty-six divisions of the pāramitās.
The Summaries
The Ornament [of the Mahāyāna Sūtras] says:[501]
Generosity and ethical conduct contribute to the store of merit, and wisdom to [the store of] primordial wisdom. The other three belong to both.
The [first] five can also belong to the store of primordial wisdom.
Thus it is said that [the six pāramitās encompass] the two stores. One alternative explanation is that when [the first five pāramitās] are embraced by wisdom, they become the store of primordial wisdom. Another is that since the first five [pāramitās] are method and the sixth is wisdom, [the pāramitās] are contained within method and primordial wisdom.

Giving the dharma, maintaining pure ethical conduct, attaining patience with the unborn, cultivating diligence in the Mahāyāna [path], abiding in the final [equipoise] with compassion,[504] and wisdom are considered to be the most important pāramitās for the intelligent.
If we wish to incorporate those qualities associated with [the primary pāramitās], we must practice with the six genuine aspects (dam pa drug):[505]
(1) The genuine support (rten dam pa) is to possess bodhichitta.
(2) The genuine object (dngos po dam pa) is, for example, an object of generosity for which we have absolutely no partiality.
(3) The genuine goal (ched du bya ba dam pa) is to work for the welfare of others.
(4) The genuine method (thabs dam pa) is that [our practice of the pāramitās] is embraced by the wisdom that does not conceive of the three spheres.
(5) The genuine dedication (bsngo ba dam pa) is the sealing [of an act] by purely dedicating [the merit] to [the attainment of] awakening.
(6) The genuine purity (dag pa dam pa) is practicing [the six pāramitās] as the direct antidotes for the two obscurations.

This has two aspects. [First,] there is the distinction between discordant qualities and their remedies. Those with the propensity for degeneration (nyams pa'i skal ba can) possess qualities discordant with generosity, such as attachment to pleasures. There are others with the propensity for distinction in that they possess the remedies [for discordant qualities], such as nonattachment. [The Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras] says:[506]
The causes of the degeneration of the steadfast ones' [pāramitās] are being attached to pleasures, being [morally] weak, being proud, having excessive desire [for comfort], indulging [in meditative concentration], and [holding on to reifying] concepts.
Know that bodhisattvas who have the remedies for those have the qualities conducive to distinction, since they are able to overcome those [hindrances].
[Second,] there is the distinction between artificial [pāramitās] and true [pāramitās] as described in [The Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras]:[507]
It is taught that those who are false, are hypocritical, who make a show of being agreeable, apply themselves [only] intermittently, are [just] physically and verbally calm, or are [merely] eloquent, have divorced themselves from the practice of the [pāramitās].
They are not true bodhisattvas.
Those who practice the opposite of those are said to [posses] the true [pāramitās].

We should practice each [pāramitā] as incorporating all six pāramitās by being aware of their respective benefits and being aware of the faults of the qualities that are discordant with them. This can be illustrated by looking at generosity. When practicing the generosity of giving away our body, possessions, and roots of virtue, we should incorporate the other five pāramitās:
• by maintaining the ethical conduct of [observing] the vows and mental engagements of shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas;
• by having patience for, and interest in, the qualities of omniscience;
• by having the diligence that will motivate us to increase those
[pāramitās];
• by remaining in the meditative concentration of resting our minds one-pointedly without mixing in [things from] the Hīnayāna; and
• by sustaining the wisdom of recognizing that the object of generosity, the act of generosity, and the person who is generous are illusionlike.

That the pāramitās are definitely six is derived from the fact that when all the dharmas that the bodhisattvas practice are condensed, they are contained within the three trainings.[510] The Ornament [of the Mahāyāna Sūtras] explains:[511]
The Victor perfectly elucidated the six pāramitās in the context of the three trainings.
Three [pāramitās belong to] the first [training]; the last two are the [other] two forms [of training]; and one [pāramitā] accompanies all three [trainings].
Alternatively, the six pāramitās are described in relation to the elevated states and definitive excellence. Three pāramitās are performed for the sake of [results in] the elevated states: one is generous in order [to gain future] wealth; one maintains ethical conduct so that one will have a good physical body [in future lives]; and one is patient in order to [attract a favorable] entourage [in the future]. Three pāramitās are [performed for the sake of results] connected to definitive excellence: one practices meditative concentration in order to develop shamatha; onecultivateswisdom in order to develop vipashyanā;and one is diligent for the sake of increasing one's excellent qualities.

The actual practice is described in the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sūtras:[513]
Shamatha and vipashyanā are that, on the basis of true abiding, mind rests within mind and phenomena are discerned.
As a beginning, one cultivates the one-pointed samādhi of shamatha first, and then one practices vipashyanā, which is the wisdom that discerns, or differentiates, phenomena. In the end, one meditates within the samādhi that fuses shamatha and vipashyanā, resting evenly in a natural way. Thus one is liberated from the bonds of cyclic existence and peace, and attains nonabiding nirvāṇa. The Sūtra Unraveling the Intention states:[514]
A person who becomes familiar with vipashyanā and shamatha will be liberated from the bonds of taking on bad states and the fetters of characteristics.
An extensive systematic presentation of shamatha and vipashyanā will appear in the section on the stages of meditation.[515]

It is taught that the source (gnas) of knowable objects is the ālaya consciousness (ālayavijñāna, kun gzhi'i rnam shes) so that we will become skilled in understanding the dependently originated causes of all phenomena.[524] There are four points involved in ascertaining this subject.
(1) The reasons that the ālaya exists are given in the Sūtra Unraveling the
Intention:[525]
The appropriating consciousness,[526] profound and subtle, flows with its seeds, like a river.
It is wrong to regard it as a self; thus I do not teach it to the immature.
(2) The characteristics [of the ālaya] are as described in the Abhidharma
Sūtra:[527]
The expanse of beginningless time is the source of all phenomena. Since it exists, there are beings and the attainment of nirvāṇa.
Since [the ālaya consciousness], on the basis of the habitual tendencies for all afflictive phenomena,[528] holds the seeds [for such phenomena], it is the cause for the arising of all afflictive phenomena. Since it can become anything, it is also not obscured. It is indeterminate, because it is neither virtuous nor unvirtuous.
(3) As for when [the ālaya consciousness] is reversed (ldog pa): it engages ('jug pa) as long as beings are in saṃsāra, but it is reversed with the attainment of arhatship. This accords with the teaching:
That which is like a flowing river is reversed with [the attainment] of arhatship.
When one becomes a buddha, it is reversed in the sense of being transformed, as is said:
Whatever is of the ālaya consciousness becomes mirror[like] primordial wisdom.
(4) [The ālaya consciousness] is distinctly different from a creator, such as Īshvara. Īshvara and the like are considered to be the creator of all, single, a self, and permanent. The ālaya is notably superior since it is asserted that it is present within each and every sentient being, and it is of the nature of the momentary dependent origination that is the differentiation of the nature [into phenomena].[529]

It is referred to as “the imagination of what is unreal”[532] in that it is what appears as perceived aspects (zung cha'i rnam pa)—that is, what appears as the phenomena of the aggregates, constituents, and sense spheres—and it is what appears as the perceiving aspects ('dzin cha'i rnam pa).”
• Because [the dependent characteristic] arises through the force of its own habitual tendencies, which are previous seeds of similar types, it is [dependent] in terms of its causes.
• Because it is its nature not to remain for a second moment once it comes into existence, it is [dependent] in terms of its nature.
• Because it generates subsequent [moments of the dependent characteristic] as similar types, and because such later [moments] are governed by the previous ones, it is [dependent] in terms of its results.
In brief, [the dependent characteristic] is the basis for the designations of imagined [characteristics] and is part of the ālaya. It is the imagination of what is unreal, which is the mere cognition[533] (vijñaptimātra, rnam rig tsam) characteristic of [all beings in] the three realms.[534] Its nature is that it is substantially established.[535] From the perspective of delusion, it arises from causes and conditions.

To focus on these [imagined characteristics as existent] is contrary to liberation. The imagined aspect is utterly nonexistent, like the horns of a rabbit.[538]

Imagined [characteristics] exist simply as imputations, because they do not exist as [functional] entities. Dependent [characteristics] exist substantially, because they are able to perform functions. The consummate [characteristic] exists ultimately, because it is the object of nonconceptual [cognition].
Consequently, in the sūtras, teachings that list nonexistents[540] are presentations of imagined [characteristics]. Teachings on illusions, dreams, mirages, and the like are about the dependent [characteristic]. The presentations of nonconceptuality and the unconditioned teach the consummate [characteristic].
Masters have given various accounts of the categorizations [of the three characteristics], of which the following are the most well-known for the majority of Tibetans.[541]
The imagined [characteristic] is twofold:
(1) Imagined [characteristics] devoid of any characteristics (mtshan nyid chad pa'i kun brtags) are what in fact do not exist, but are conceptually imputed, such as the belief in a self (bdag lta) or something being substantially established.
(2) Nominal imagined [characteristics] (rnam grangs pa'i kun brtags) are object-universals (artha-sāmānya, don spyi), which appear to thoughts, and the appearance of the dualism of perceived objects and perceiving subjects for the nonconceptual sense consciousnesses.[542]
The dependent [characteristic] has two aspects:[543]
(1) The impure dependent [characteristic] (ma dag gzhan dbang) is the mind and mental events of [beings in] the three realms, which, [though] not dual, are what appear as a duality because of their habitual tendencies.[544]
(2) The pure dependent [characteristic] (dag pa gzhan dbang) is the cognition [of noble beings during meditative equipoise,] which has no dualistic experience; and it is the cognition of noble beings during the subsequent state,[545] which does not fixate on appearances.

</d>
<d e="2">
The consummate [characteristic] is also twofold:[546]
(1) The unchanging consummate [characteristic] (nirvikārapariniṣhpanna, 'gyur med yongs grub) is dharmatā, which is empty of both the dependent (the basis for delusion) and the imagined (the delusion). It is a nonimplicative negation, thusness, and what is unconditioned.
(2) The unerring consummate [characteristic] (aviparyāsapariniṣhpanna, phyin ci ma log pa'i yongs grub) is nondual cognition, which is what remains when [cognition] is empty of the duality of percept and perceiver. It is reflexive awareness, real (satya, bden pa), and substantially established. The path and its observed objects are considered part of this [unerring consummate] in the sense that they accompany it.[547]
In terms of conventions (vyavahāra, tha snyad), imagined [characteristics] are the actual conventions; dependent [characteristics] are the basis for conventions; and the consummate [characteristic] is without conventions.
In terms of the use of conventions, the imagined [characteristic] refers to the delusion of dualistic appearances. The dependent [characteristic] is used for the referent that is free from that [imagined nature]. The consummate [characteristic] refers to thusness.
It is clearly taught that a magical illusion serves as an analogy for these
[three characteristics]. The mantras that create a phantom and the small piece of wood that serves as the basis for a phantom [equate, respectively, to] the fundamental mind and thusness. From those [manifests] the image
(ākāra, rnam pa) that appears to be an elephant, which is the dependent [characteristic]. The elephant is the imagined [characteristic]. The nonexistence of that [elephant] in that [image of an elephant] is the consummate [characteristic].[548]

As for engaging those characteristics [of knowable objects], four [criteria must be present] in order for their import to be realized.[549]
(1) Who are the individuals that engage these? They are [bodhisattvas] who have amassed the two stores [of merit and wisdom] of the Mahāyāna.
(2) What causes this engagement?
• The strengths generated by roots of virtue.
• The three types of determination free from discouragement: having the determination that all sentient beings will achieve buddhahood; having the determination to engage in the pāramitās; and having the determination, “I will not be impeded by anything.”
• The four abandonments: abandoning the mental engagements of shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas; abandoning doubts about the Mahāyāna; giving up partiality with regard to dharma; and casting aside conceptuality.
• Engaging in shamatha and vipashyanā with devoted interest.
(3) How do we engage [these three characteristics as a path]? By means of the habitual tendencies of studying, we investigate the classifications of names, entities, natures, and specifics, and thereby come to understand that the three characteristics are not observable reference points. We do this in three stages: (1) by knowing that all those are merely imputedly existent; (2) by understanding them to be mere cognition; (3) and by reversing the idea that they are mere cognition.
In brief, we enter the path by recognizing delusion, which is the imagined [characteristic]; by abandoning the imagination, which is the dependent [nature]; and by directly seeing the consummate.
(4) What are the periods or phases of engagement? We engage gradually: first we [enter] the paths of accumulation and junction with engagement through belief; then we [proceed] on the paths of seeing, meditation, and completion.

As stated above,[550] the six pāramitās are included within the three trainings, which are the foundations for bodhisattvas' trainings.
The training in higher ethical conduct is of three types: the ethical conduct of restraint and the others.[551] The term “higher” is used to indicate that these [trainings] are distinguished from those of the Hīnayāna by the arousing of bodhichitta and so forth.
The training in higher concentration[552] is to practice the bodhisattvas' heroic stride samādhi and the others[553] in order to meditate on the pāramitās, mature sentient beings, and achieve all the qualities of a buddha.
As for the training in higher wisdom:[554] once all concepts and characteristics have been relinquished, nonconceptuality is spontaneously present and the states subsequent [to meditative equipoise] are experienced as illusionlike. This is the pāramitā of wisdom.
In general, the trainings of bodhisattvas are immeasurable, but if they are abbreviated, they are contained within these [three trainings].

[The dharmakāya] is endowed with five attributes: it is a transformation; the basis for positive qualities; nondual; permanent; and inconceivable.[556] It is the source that radiates the immeasurable and inconceivable qualities of a buddha.
I will explain some topics related to the bhūmis, paths, and so forth later.[557]
Those who wish to understand these in detail should refer to earlier Tibetan works, such as Jetsün Drakpa Gyaltsen's [Jeweled] Tree.
I have taken the assertions of earlier Tibetan [masters] as the basis for this presentation, and [followed] traditions that assert that Maitreya's Dharma Treatises[558] and the texts of Asaṅga[559] and his brother [Vasubandhu][560] are Chittamātra.[561]

<d e="2">
The root of the Chittamātras' general assertion is that external referents
(bāhyārtha, phyi don) do not have even the slightest existence other than being mere cognition, like appearances in dreams. Their reasons are as follows:
• Referents, such as forms, and everything such as the arising and ceasing of those [objects] are only mental appearances, like floaters or the appearance of two moons [when you press on your closed eyelids].
• If external referents were to exist in reality (bden par yod), it would follow that they would exist for the nonconceptual primordial wisdom of noble beings abiding in meditative equipoise; and yet they do not exist for [noble beings in that state].
• What appears to the six kinds of beings seems to be distinctly different even though [their perception] is not affected by superficial causes for [perceptual] error. To take one example: a river is seen as nectar by gods, as water by humans, as pus and blood by hungry ghosts, and as molten metal by beings in the hot hells, because of the positive or negative karma [of these beings].
Furthermore, the Chittamātras use many scriptural references and reasonings to refute external referents and prove that [all phenomena] are mere cognition.

As their principal philosophical tenets, Chittamātra Proponents hold [one of] two positions: that images are real (satyākāra, rnam bden pa) or that images are false (alīkākāra, rnam rdzun pa).[562]
As for the first, Proponents of Real Images assert that external referents do not exist as real entities and yet, owing to the habitual tendencies for conceiving [of appearances] as objects, cognition itself arises as the image of a referent, as in the analogy of a crystal with a color.[563] Thus, everything that appears as forms is simply the mind itself, which is the agent for appearances (snang mkhan) manifesting as distant cut-off objects (rgyangs chad kyi don) owing to the power of the deluded habitual tendencies. Moreover, [appearances,] in fact, are real in being the mind, which is the perceived object.[564] Therefore, the aggregates, constituents, sense spheres, and even true cessation (which is considered to be mind free from the factors to be abandoned), all of which are taught in the sūtras, are real in being mental phenomena, which is to say, they are [only] the mind itself. Owing to taking this position, they are known as Proponents of Real Images (Satyākāravādin, rNam bden pa).[565]

[Split-Eggists][567] are those who assert that perceived objects (which are cognitive images) and the perceiving cognition are [matching] halves, like an egg split [in half]. They also say that images are real in being the perceived parts, and cognition is real in being the perceiving part. The master
Jetāri reports [their position]:[568]
The consciousness appearing internally is other than this [external object], and what appears externally is also simply other than [the consciousness]. These two, however, are not a duality, because they are [both] simply reflexive awareness. Conceptuality, which arises through the force of those two, exaggeratedly considers them to be the two entities of percept and perceiver.

[Proponents of Perceptual Parity][569] assert that the number of perceiving cognizers, which are discrete substances, equals the number of perceived images, which are discrete substances, such as white or red. In terms of appearances, many varieties of white or red manifest; in terms of what is real, those various[570] [appearances] are real in being individual substances. In the same way, the sense consciousnesses, which are the agents for appearances, are real in being multiple substantial entities. The Auto-Commentary for the “[Ornament of] the Middle Way” states:[571]
Some say that like pleasure and so forth, images such as blue and so forth are only of an experiential character. Those cognitions are multiple, and they are always of similar types. They arise in the same way that multiple dissimilar-type cognitions arise simultaneously.[572]

Chittamātra Proponents of False Images (Alīkākāravādin, rNam rdzun pa) state that all appearances of white, black, and so forth are nonexistents vividly appearing (med pa gsal snang), meaning that they appear while not existing, like the two moons seen when you press your eyes or the floaters seen by the visually impaired. In fact, they are not real but are false, like dreams and illusions; because, if [appearances] were real as cognition, objects (such as forms) would have to be cognizers (rig pa), which they are not. They assert that cognition empty of the duality of percept and perceiver is reflexively aware and self-illuminating (rang rig rang gsal), like a flawless crystal globe. It is not governed by referents and is not tainted by the stains of appearances. Only that [cognition empty of duality] is real.
To summarize [their view], they say that cognition is untainted by the stains of appearances; [it is pure,] like a pure crystal globe.[576] Appearances, like floaters, are false: even though they do not exist, they appear. Thus those who hold this position are known as Proponents of Nonexistent Images (Nirākāravādin, rNam med pa) or Proponents of False Images (Alīkākāravādin, rNam rdzun pa).[577]

Some say that although consciousnesses are, in fact, the perceiving aspect of pleasure, pain, and so forth, the force of ignorance causes them to appear as outer perceived images, and thus the entity of consciousness is tainted by those false images. Therefore, they are called Proponents of Staining False Images (Samala-alīkākāra, rNam rdzun dri bcas).[578] Others state that ultimately the entity of consciousness is not tainted by outer images, that it is [pure,] like a pure crystal globe. Ordinary beings, however, do not realize this; it is realized only by buddhas. They are called Proponents of Non-Staining False Images (Nirmala-alīkākāra, rNam rdzun dri med).[579] There is another explanation for the two divisions of Staining [False
Images] and Non-Staining [False Images].
• [Proponents of Staining False Images] say that what appears as white or red is present at the bhūmi of buddhahood; nevertheless, [buddhas] are not deluded because they realize what is false to be false. Therefore, they say, “We do not state that referents and cognition are identical nor do we say that they are different.” [Proponents of Staining False Images] assert that there are dualistic appearances at the bhūmi of buddhahood.
• [Proponents of Non-Staining False Images] say that if what appears as white or red were real in being the entity of cognition, it would appear also to buddhas, but it does not. They say, therefore, “Even though there is no connection between a cognition and a referent, [there are] appearances.” [Proponents of Non-Staining False Images] assert that there are no dualistic appearances at the bhūmi of buddhahood.[580]
A Summary [of the Two Chittamātra Subschools]
Chittamātra Proponents of Real Images assert that everything that appears to the five sense consciousnesses as external referents is real in being the substance of the internal cognizer. Proponents of False Images say that everything that appears to the five sense consciousnesses as referents is not real in being the substance of the internal mind; rather, all is false and [only] imputedly existent. We should know that this accords with the explanations given by many scholars, such as Lakṣhmī.[581] Karma Tinlé[582] comments:
Both Chittamātra [subschools] must be called Proponents of Cognition (Vijñaptivādins), or Chittamātras, because they assert each momentary, partless consciousness, which is free from percept and perceiver, to be ultimate reality. However, it is wrong to apply that [name Chittamātra] to those who only assert that appearing referents are mind, because that encompasses too much in that it applies to Sautrāntikas, and does not encompass enough in that it does not apply to Proponents of
False Images.
Both [Chittamātra subschools] assert that reflexively aware, self-illuminating cognition, which is without the duality of percept and perceiver, is ultimate. [In the ordinary state] it is covered by the obscurations of dualistic appearances; thus when the qualities of a noble being are attained, that
[cognition] is simply free from dualistic appearances.
Some Tibetans cite the teachings of the master Vasubandhu as a scriptural [source] for these [Chittamātra views]. This is simply the mistake of those who speak deviously by not distinguishing between [Vasubandhu's] assertion that primordial wisdom is truly existent and [the Chittamātra system's] statement that consciousness is truly existent.

There are Tibetans who say unanimously that with the exception of the Ornament of Clear Realization, all the other Dharma Treatises of Maitreya[583] teach Chittamātra.[584] Some assert that the Highest Continuum keeps to the meaning of the Madhyamaka. Others assert that the final wheel of dharma presents only Chittamātra, not Madhyamaka. They say, “Asaṅga and his brother [Vasubandhu] were the co-founders of this chariot-system, and all their texts are Chittamātra. The Proponents of Real Images and of False Images and other [subdivisions] appeared among their followers. Dignāga[585] and his son [Dharmakīrti][586] asserted the positions of both the Proponents of Real Images and the Proponents of False Images.”[587] Some say, “The noble Nāgārjuna[588] also asserted both those positions.” And others state, “Although Asaṅga was a Mādhyamika master, that does not conflict with his having composed Chittamātra treatises, like Vasubandhu's composition[589] of the Treasury of Abhidharma.” There are many such statements expressing individual points of view.

[Proponents of] False Images and [followers of the philosophical systems] below them assert that appearances are pervaded by delusion. Their positions concerning delusion and actions and agents are such that they cannot comprehend that there is no truly existing substratum.[595] They are, therefore, referred to as Realists.[596] Proponents of these lower [philosophical tenet systems] do—in relationship to a specific basis for negation [that they consider to be] truly existent—refute a specific object of negation that followers of a philosophical system lower than themselves imagine
[to be truly existent]. Nevertheless, ultimately, all the flawed assertions in the Realists' philosophical tenets are thoroughly refuted by the noble [Nāgārjuna's] major texts, called the Collection of Reasonings,[597] and [the works of] of his followers. [Those texts] elucidate a special feature of
Madhyamaka: knowing how to posit actions and agents despite the nonexistence of a substratum for delusion. Consequently, the Synopsis of the View Asserted [by Mañjushrī][598] says:
The main texts of the Vaibhāṣhikas, Sautrāntikas, and Yogāchāras contain a bit of truth as well as untruths. The Madhyamaka system is entirely true.
The Differences Between Chittamātra and Madhyamaka
Some say that there are major differences between the Chittamātra and Madhyamaka [systems] in terms of ground, path, and result and in other ways. However, the principal distinction between these two Mahāyāna schools is that [Chittamātras] assert that reflexively aware, self-illuminating cognition, empty of the duality of percept and perceiver, exists ultimately and Mādhyamikas do not. When explaining the Chittamātra philosophical tenet system, the Compendium on the Heart of Primordial Wisdom[599] and other texts say:[600]
Consciousness free from percept and perceiver exists ultimately.
When explaining the Madhyamaka philosophical tenet system, these texts say:[601]
The wise do not assert that consciousness exists ultimately.

Those who propound a complete absence of reference points are free from
[beliefs] in any extreme: existence or nonexistence, arising or ceasing, and so forth. Thus they are called “Mādhyamikas.”[604] In the Stacks of Jewels, [the Kāshyapa Chapter Sūtra] says:[605]
Do not think that phenomena are permanent. Do not think that they are impermanent. “Permanence” is one extreme and “impermanence” is a second extreme. The middle between two extremes cannot be analyzed and cannot be shown. It is not a support. It is devoid of appearance, devoid of cognition, and devoid of location. Kāshyapa: this is the middle way, the correct discernment of phenomena.
The shorter Ornament of the Middle Way states:[606]
There is no existence nor nonexistence; neither both nor not both. Those who are free from the four extremes are referred to as “Mādhyamikas.”

<d e="2">
The entryway for Mādhyamikas is the explication that, primarily from the perspective of their natures, all phenomena are included within the two truths.[607]
They engage conventional reality in the following manner. They know that unexamined and unanalyzed appearances, regardless of how they seem to be, do not truly exist as entities. Simply as interdependent connections [appearing] on the conventional level, [Mādhyamikas] undertake extensive virtuous actions (such as generosity) and avoid unvirtuous actions—all the while [maintaining] their motivation of bodhichitta and an awareness that things are illusionlike. In this way they train themselves in the scrupulous observance of what is to be adopted and what is to be rejected.
They encounter ultimate reality by knowing that actually there is nothing to adopt or reject, block or encourage, abandon or accept in any phenomenon. The very [moment] that things simply appear, they are empty of any nature.
Entering [the Madhyamaka path] through [understanding] the two truths is an approach that integrates the view and conduct, method and wisdom, and the two stores of merit and wisdom.

The three yānas are similar in that nirvāṇa is the final result to be attained in each case. Mādhyamikas, however, do not assert that the mere cessation of the mental afflictions and the aggregates is nirvāṇa. They state that [nirvāṇa] is the unmistaken realization of the suchness (tattva, de kho na nyid) of all phenomena, both pure and impure, by means of the pacification of all conceptual elaborations. The Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way says:[608]
What is without abandonment, without attainment, without annihilation, without permanence, without cessation, and without arising is said to be nirvāṇa.
Praises of the Incomparable One says:[609]
You know that afflictive phenomena and purified phenomena are of the same taste. Thus, you are inseparable from the dharmadhātu, and you are utterly and completely pure.
There are many such statements.
Nirvāṇa is presented as being twofold: with remainder and without remainder. A Mahāyāna explanation of this is found in the Genuine Golden Light
Sūtras:[610]
The two kāyas are [nirvāṇa] with remainder; the dharmakāya is [nirvāṇa] without remainder.
The noble Nāgārjuna also teaches these as the entryways to the three kāyas. He says that when one attains the nirvāṇa in which conceptual elaborations are pacified, by virtue of one's completion of the two stores of merit and wisdom, one manifests the dharmakāya for one's own sake and the two form kāyas [the sambhogakāya and nirmāṇakāya] for the sake of others. While remaining nonconceptual, like a precious gem, [the form kāyas] work for the welfare of the limitless beings to be tamed, both those with pure mindstreams and those with impure ones.

Proponents of the Madhyamaka system of philosophical tenets were subdivided in several ways both in India and Tibet.[611] Some[612] say that there are three types: Sautrāntika-Mādhyamikas, Yogāchāra-Mādhyamikas, and Mādhyamikas Who Employ Worldly Consensus.[613]
(1) Sautrāntika-Mādhyamikas, such as Bhāvaviveka,[614] assert as conventions that external objects exist.
(2) Yogāchāra-Mādhyamikas, such as Shāntarakṣhita,[615] maintain that [even] as conventions external referents do not exist.
(3) Mādhyamikas Who Employ Worldly Consensus, such as Chandrakīrti,[616] speak about external objects [only] from the perspective of others, that is to say, only in terms of what is commonly acknowledged in the world.
Others say that two subdivisions can be made according to the way the ultimate is asserted: Those Who Logically Establish Illusion, and Proponents of Complete Nonabiding.[617]
(1) Those Who Logically Establish Illusion, such as Kamalashīla,[618] assert that ultimatereality is thecombinationofappearances' absenceofreality and phenomena themselves (such as sprouts and other things).[619]
(2) Proponents of Complete Nonabiding, such as Buddhapālita,[620] assert that ultimate reality is what is determined (pariccheda, yongs gcod) as [a result of] excluding (viccheda, rnam bcad) all conceptual elaborations regarding appearances.
The master Ratnākarashānti[621] divides Mādhyamikas into two groups:[622]
(1) those who state that conventional [reality] is an image of cognition, and
(2) those who state that conventional [reality] is habitual tendencies.
The master Maitrīpa[623] makes two divisions:[624]
(1) Proponents of Illusionlike Nonduality, and
(2) Proponents of the Complete Nonabiding of All Phenomena.
The Kashmiri scholar Lakṣhmī[kara][625] provides a threefold classification:
(1) Sautrāntika-Madhyamaka;
(2) Yogāchāra-Madhyamaka; and
(3) Madhyamaka based on the Mother of the Victors.[626]
All such classifications of Madhyamaka are based on [the different explanations concerning] the way the ultimate is empty and, particularly, [the different] ways conventional [reality] is posited. Despite these many styles of classification, succinctly put, Madhyamaka is definitely of two types: Sūtra-Madhyamaka and Mantra-Madhyamaka.

Because of the slightly different systems, or styles, of commenting on the thought of the Mahāyāna sūtras, it is clear that there are two types [of Sūtra-Mādhyamikas]:
(1) Mādhyamika Proponents of the Absence of a Nature (Niḥsvabhāvavādins),[627] and
(2) Yogāchāra-Mādhyamikas.
Some use the terms “ordinary Madhyamaka” and “preeminent Madhyamaka” for these systems. The master Bhāvaviveka[628] and others use the phrase “broad, outer Madhyamaka” for the first and “subtle, inner Madhyamaka” for the second.[629] In Tibet, from the time of the great omniscient dharma lord of Jonang [Dolpopa] onwards, these have been known as the systems of Rangtong-Madhyamaka and Shentong-Madhyamaka.[630]

The first of the aforementioned [divisions of Sūtra-Madhyamaka], the Mādhyamika Proponents of the Absence of a Nature (Niḥsvabhāvavādin), are said to contain the two [subschools of Svātantrika and Prāsaṅgika][631] for the following [reasons].
The followers of Bhāvaviveka are called Svātantrikas because they assert, as a convention that is part of their own system, that all phenomena are without arising, are empty, and so forth. As proofs [of those assertions], they primarily use independently [verifiable] reasons[632] in which the three modes[633] are established through the power of [their relationship to real] things.[634]
The followers of Chandrakīrti are called Prāsaṅgikas, because they accept that [phenomena] are without arising, are empty, and so forth only from the perspective of others, which means that they commit to this only to refute others' mistaken ideas. [For Prāsaṅgikas] there are no independently [verifiable] reasons in which the three modes are established through the power of [their relationship to real] things. Therefore, they primarily just use consequences (prasaṅga, thal 'gyur) to demonstrate to Realists[635] their internal contradictions.[636]

The common approach of both Svātantrika-Mādhyamikas and PrāsaṅgikaMādhyamikas is to use many references to scriptures and a variety of reasonings (1) to refute a self of persons (pudgalātman, gang zag gi bdag), that is, the views concerning a self [of persons], as they are the source of all views and mental afflictions,[637] and (2) to refute a self-entity of phenomena (dharmātman, chos kyi bdag), that is, the taking of all outer and inner phenomena to be objectively real,[638] as that is the root of the two obscurations.[639] They then rest evenly in the absence of the two types of self-entity.
These modes [of refutation and meditation] are discussed in some detail in the sections on reflection and meditation.[640]

Reasons analyze four points: cause, result, both of those, and nature.

Subject
First, the subject (dharmin, chos can) is the basis for debate.[641] It is not something established by the valid cognitions[642] of both the challenger and the opponent, and it can be something coarse, such as an entity, or something small, such as a sprout. In these systems, the subject belongs to the set heterologous[643] to the probandum (sādhya, bsgrub bya), [and as such] is that which gives rise to reification.

Object of Negation
When a subject is analyzed, the object to be negated (pratiṣhedhya, dgag bya) is determined to be either an appearance or something imagined (brtags pa). It is not logical, [however,] to negate momentary appearances (re zhig snang ba), because reasonings cannot negate them. To take an example: for people with eye diseases, the appearances of floaters,[644] double moons, and the like do not stop as long as their eyesight is impaired. Similarly, as long as beings are not free from unafflicted ignorance,[645] illusionlike appearances [manifesting] to the six modes of consciousness do not stop.
It is not necessary to negate [appearances], because our mistakes[646] do not come from appearances: they arise from fixating on those [appearances]. This is the case because if we do not fixate on appearances, we are not bound—we are like a magician who, having conjured up a young woman, has no attachment towards her. [On the other hand, if,] like naïve beings attached to an illusory young woman, we fixate intensely [on appearances], our karma and mental afflictions will increase.
To intentionally negate appearances would be wrong because, if they were negated, emptiness would come to mean the [absolute] nonexistence of things. Another reason this would be a mistake is that yogins and yoginīs meditating on emptiness would fall into the extreme of nihilism since they would be applying their minds to a negation that [equals] the [absolute] nonexistence of everything.
Thus, [Mādhyamikas] set out to negate only what is imagined (parikalpita, kun brtags pa), because that is what can be negated. Like a rope [mistaken] for a snake, what is imagined does not conform to facts: it is simply the mind's fixations. [Dharmakīrti's] Commentary on Valid Cognition provides a further reason:[647]
This [attachment] cannot be relinquished without the object's being invalidated.
The characteristic of things is that the perceiving mind cannot be negated unless its object is negated; therefore, we will not be able to negate the intense fixation of our perceiving mind unless its imagined object is negated. Without negating that intense fixation, we will not reverse afflictive phenomena,[648] because that [fixation] is their root.
Therefore, the object of negation for Mādhyamikas is only something imagined. It is of two types:
(1) objects whose existence even as a convention (tha snyad tsam du grub pa) is negated; and
(2) objects whose existence as ultimate (don la grub pa) is negated but whose existence as a convention is not.

The first type of object negated is a self either [of persons] or phenomena as imagined by proponents of our own [Buddhist] philosophical tenet systems or by proponents of other philosophical tenet systems. These do not exist even in terms of conventional reality (as was explained above).[649]
The second type of objects negated are the conventions of worldly consensus ('jig rten grags pa'i tha snyad), which are simply dependently originated according to their causes and conditions. These include things of immediate common consensus (such as [saying,] “I am going,” “I am staying,” or “I am eating”); and conventions that are suitable for common consensus, even though they may not be of things of immediate common consensus [now]. [The latter] are things about which there is common consensus in the [Buddhist] scriptures: causes and their results, the bhūmis and paths, factors to be abandoned and their remedies, and so forth.
Things commonly accepted as worldly conventions are not to be refuted as mere conventions. The reason this is not done is the same as what was said above about eliminating [or refuting] appearances.[650]

Probanda
There are two kinds of probanda (sādhya, bsgrub bya):
(1) proofs of facts (don sgrub pa); and
(2) proofs of conventions (tha snyad sgrub pa).[651]
Proofs of facts are of two types since debaters have different issues in question:
(a) nonimplicative negations[652] that [demonstrate that] the nature of a thing does not exist; and
(b) nonimplicative negations that [demonstrate that] the object of negation, just a nature, does not exist.[653]
In these systems, the probandum is a nonimplicative negation that is simply the refutation that a subject inherently exists, is real, and the like. It includes such nonimplicative negations as, “These appearances do not exist with a true nature,” or “They do not exist in the way that they are imagined to be.” [For Svātantrikas and Prāsaṅgikas, the probandum] is only an exclusion (viccheda, rnam gcod), merely the elimination of the object to be negated, and simply free from conceptual elaborations; they have no probandum that is something [positively] determined.[654] Since they do not set forth any [affirmative probanda], there is also nothing that others could object to. In his Rebuttal of Objections, [Nāgārjuna] says:[655]
If I were to have a proposition,
I would have that fault.
Since I have no proposition,
I am without fault.
If [I] were to observe something through direct perception or any other [means of valid cognition],
[I] would either affirm it or deny it.
Since there are no such things, I am beyond censure.
For these [systems,] the import of a nonimplicative negation is that it refers to nothing at all. It is said in the sūtras:
Whoever understands that phenomena do not exist at all will not be attached to phenomena.
This shows that once the power of terms and concepts has been exhausted,
[one's experience] will be like that of someone feeling rested after their hard work is over.
The point of negations and affirmations is summed up by the following [example]: When sound is proven to be impermanent by [the reason that] it is something produced, the actual object negated is the consciousness that ascribes (sgro 'dogs pa) permanence to sounds, and the actual object affirmed is the consciousness that ascribes impermanence to sound. This is the intention of Nāgārjuna's statement:[656]
[Such statements] make us understand that no nature exists; they do not, however, eliminate arising.

Reasons
The means of proof are the reasons (hetu, gtan tshigs). In Madhyamaka reasonings, generally speaking, the evidence (liṅga, rtags) is presented in two ways:
(1) by setting up negations (pratiṣheda, dgag pa), or
(2) by setting up affirmations (viddhi, sgrub pa).
First: Negations
(1) Negation through the analysis of causes is called the “vajra sliver [reasoning].”[657]
(2) Negation by means of analyzing results refutes the arising of [a result] existent [at the time of its cause] and the arising of [a result that is] nonexistent [at the time of its cause].[658]
(3) Negation that employs the analysis of both causes and their results refutes arising from the four possibilities.[659]
(4) Negation that analyzes a nature [demonstrates that a phenomenon] is neither a single unit nor a plurality.[660]
The first type of negation is taught in the Rice Seedling Sūtra[661] and the last kind is presented in the Descent into Laṅkā Sūtra. The two middle ones appear in certain sūtras.[662] These four eliminate the Realists'[663] inflated ascription of inherent existence to things, thereby removing [their belief in] the extreme of existence.
Now we will look at these four in order.[664]

(1) The analysis of causes When a sprout comes into being (skye ba), does it arise from itself? From something other than itself? From both? Or from no cause at all? This kind of analysis proves that, from a rational perspective, a sprout has no arising since it does not arise from anything at all.[665]

(2) The analysis of results
When a sprout arises, is this the arising of something that exists at the time of the seed? Or is this the arising of something that did not exist [at the time of its cause]?
If it were the arising of something that existed at the time of the seed, a sprout would not arise from the seed: its cause would serve no purpose, since the sprout already exists without depending on a cause. If it were the arising of something that did not exist [at the time of its cause], then it would be like the horns of a rabbit and its cause would have no potency (nus pa) at all.[666]
These reasonings refute [the possibility] that a combination of both is the case. It also is impossible [that a sprout arises] from neither being the case. [This analysis], therefore, proves that, in actuality, a sprout does not come into being.

<d e="2">
(3) The analysis of both causes and results
From a mistaken perspective, it is not contradictory to make statements such as the following: “One sprout develops from one seed.” “A single eye consciousness arises from the three conditions.”[667] “One father produces many children.” “A variety of crops grow from the combination of seeds, water, and manure.” Nevertheless, from a rational perspective, the following four possibilities [for arising] are not feasible:
(a) that only one result manifests from just a single cause;
(b) that numerous results are produced by only one cause;
(c) that a single result comes from many causes; and
(d) that many results could arise from many causes.
Thus, from a rational perspective, a unity is untenable, and that also negates that a plurality could truly exist; thus it is proven that there is no arising.
(4) The analysis of a nature
Reasons stating that a sprout and other things are devoid of both real unity and real plurality prove that such things have no reality (bden med). This reasoning that something is neither a single unit nor a plurality is the root of all reasonings that negate true existence, which all four Buddhist philosophical systems [consider] to be the object of negation. It is taught that the Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way is summarized by its refutation of eight points: arising and cessation, permanence and annihilation, going and coming, sameness and discreteness. The negations of the first six points depend upon the negation of sameness and discreteness (gcig dang tha dad), and the refutation of sameness and discreteness is simply [the argument] that no thing is a single unit or a plurality.[668]

[Second: Affirmations]
Affirmations are set up as evidence in the following way. The reasoning of dependent origination[669] is an analysis of mere appearances, and it is found in the Questions of the Nāga King Anavatapta Sūtra.[670] The reasoning that something is dependently originated proves that [the thing in question,] such as a sprout, has no reality. Its manner of presentation causes it to be categorized as an affirming reason; but, in fact, since it refutes reality, which is the object to be negated, it is a negating reason. This is the king of the reasonings used by Mādhyamikas to prove that things are empty of reality (bden stong), because it eliminates both the extreme of permanence and that of nihilism.
Since [phenomena] are dependently originated, they are not nonexistent as conventions; and thus the extreme of nihilism is avoided. [Phenomena also] are not objects that are permanent nor do they exist in terms of their own essence, because they depend on other causes and conditions. This establishes that [phenomena] have no nature and eliminates the extreme of permanence.
Questions of the Nāga King Anavatapta Sūtra says:
The wise realize that all phenomena are dependently originated.
They do not adhere to views involving extremes.
In the context of these [reasonings], it is impossible that a nature of things is a knowable object; and, therefore, there is no negative entailment,[671] since there is no link between what is to be pervaded and a pervader.[672]
Nevertheless, in general, [Mādhyamikas may make statements] such as, “If a pot were to exist, it would follow that it must be either a unitary pot or a plurality.” They also may use illusions, reflections, and so forth as concordant examples (mthun dpe). The object of comprehension (prameya, gzhal bya) for an inferential [cognition] based on such reasons is the probandum of these reasons [i.e., that all things have no nature].
Prāsaṅgikas and Svātantrikas do not disagree about these modes or the state of ultimate reality.

Differences Concerning Conventional Reality

They do disagree, however, about the presentation of conventional reality. Svātantrikas think that this should not be done according to the conventions of worldly people, because that would involve the possibility of error, as worldly people use conventions in a casual way without any rational analysis. Instead, they posit conventional [reality] in keeping with those who know how to apply reasonings, such as Proponents of Cognition (Vijñaptivādins) or Sautrāntikas. They maintain that even though Proponents of Cognition and the others have deviated from [a correct understanding of] ultimate reality, they have not done so with conventional reality.
Prāsaṅgikas say that someone who lacks the natural ability to climb trees and yet persists in doing so in a peculiar way—by letting go of a lower branch before grabbing hold of a higher one—will get nowhere, but will instead fall into the space between the branches. Similarly, Realists who, in their quest for suchness, put aside worldly conventions when they have not yet realized the true reality (yang dag pa'i don), will fall in between: into either the extreme of permanence or that of nihilism. Prāsaṅgikas state that Realists have deviated from [a correct understanding of] both truths, citing as their reason [Chandrakīrti's] statement in his Entrance to the Middle Way:[673]
Those outside the path of the master Nāgārjuna lack the means for [achieving] peace.
They have strayed from the conventional truth and that of suchness.
Having strayed from those two truths, they will not attain liberation.
Prāsaṅgika masters, therefore, think that conventional reality should be posited according to the conventions of worldly people, not according to the proponents of other philosophical systems. This is because, in the same way that noble beings are the only valid authorities (pramāṇa, tshad ma) for ultimate reality, worldly people are the only valid authorities for the positing of conventional reality.
In sum, worldly people say, “A result comes from a cause,” and understand it in just those [terms], without trying to analyze [whether the result arises] from itself, something other than itself, and so forth. Prāsaṅgikas' presentation of conventional [reality] accords with that [kind of general worldly understanding].

Differences Concerning the Acceptance of Conventions

Prāsaṅgikas and Svātantrikas differ regarding the acceptance of conventions (vyavahāra, tha snyad). Svātantrikas accept conventional reality as a [pragmatic] convention within their own system. Prāsaṅgikas, however, do not present anything as their own system either on the ultimate level or as a convention. Nevertheless, if it is called for, they will accept conventional reality—but only on the terms of worldly people. They do not accept it as part of their own system even as a mere [pragmatic] convention, citing the same text as their reason:[674]
We do not accept conventional [reality] in the way you [Chittamātras] assert dependent entities.
Nevertheless, we say, “Things exist,” even though they do not,
[deferring] to the world's perspective for the sake of the results.

When engaged in debate, Svātantrika masters assert that not presenting a system of one's own and only refuting others' systems is [sheer] sophistry[675] and, therefore, unacceptable. They say that if one does not establish one's own positions—emptiness, nonarising, and so forth—through valid forms of cognition,[676] one will be unable, simply by setting up consequences, to refute others' assertions that entities inherently arise. For these two reasons, they say that, as a convention, one should assert some points of one's own system that are established through valid forms of cognition; and such points would include the reasons and examples that prove one's own thesis (pratijñā, dam bca') that there is no arising. This must be done because one cannot prove the thesis of one's own system using the reasons asserted by others.
Prāsaṅgikas say, “Those who have a thesis but do not posit it out of the fear that they will be subjected to others' criticism, and those who refute another's system with aggressive intentions using only [absurd] consequences are involved in a deceptive practice of sophistry. However, given that the
Madhyamaka [system] does not have even the smallest position of its own to posit, what would be the point of troubling ourselves to search for a means to prove it? Actually, [the Madhyamaka approach] is not about refuting things. If we could observe a phenomenon to be negated, no matter how insignificant, it would be reasonable to refute it; but if we cannot observe a thing to be negated—not even the fragment left from splitting a hair's end a hundred times—how can we talk about negating it?” This accords with the opening statement in the Entrance to the Wisdom [of the Middle Way]:[677]
It is only negation and affirmation that are negated.
In fact, there is nothing to be negated or affirmed.
Prāsaṅgikas say that they present others' assertions in their treatises and analyze them rationally in numerous ways, not because they despise these other systems or take pleasure in debating, but for the sake of others: to overturn the reification of people trapped in conceptual nets. The Entrance to the Middle Way says:[678]
The analyses in the Treatise are not presented out of fondness for debate. Suchness is taught for the sake of liberation.
If others' scriptural systems collapse when suchness is presented, we are not to blame.

Each and every rational analysis found in the Madhyamaka treatises has the same objective: to overturn the concepts of superimposition or denial held by other parties.[679] But once their superimpositions and denials are eliminated, realization of the reality of the abiding nature will not arise through the force of analysis, because the abiding nature is not an object that can be analyzed by means of study or reflection. The same text states:[680]
Ordinary beings are bound by their concepts.
Yogins and yoginīs without concepts are liberated.
The wise, therefore, teach that the overturning of concepts is the fruit of analysis.
Not only is there nothing for others to challenge in the Prāsaṅgika system, this system can invalidate everyone else's positions (prakṣha, phyogs), because, in their attempts to dispel their faults, all the answers they give to the Prāsaṅgika's reasonings are ineffective since [their answers are proofs that] are equivalent to their probandum.[681]
In brief, Prāsaṅgikas do not assert that there are independently verifiable reasons that function by virtue of [their relationship to real] things, because [for them] there are no forms of valid cognition that function by virtue of [their relationship to real] things that could prove such [reasons]. When, for the sake of others, they engage in negations and affirmations as one of two parties in debate, they employ four types of reasons and four valid means of cognition that are commonly acknowledged in the world.[682]
Svātantrikas accept that there are reasons and forms of valid cognition that function by virtue of [their relationship to real] things, which [means that they are] independently verifiable.[683] Thus, the former [i.e., Prāsaṅgikas] have no probandum that is something [positively] determined;[684] they simply refute what others assert. Svātantrikas refute others' assertions by employing reasonings capable of cutting through conceptual elaborations, which are reasonings whose three modes are established by valid forms of cognition.

Further Differences
The phrase “other points” in this root verse refers to the numerous minor differences between these two systems.
• In the context of the ground, some points of difference are that Prāsaṅgikas do not assert that conventional [reality] is classified as either correct or mistaken, true or false, whereas Svātantrikas do.[685] Prāsaṅgikas assert that all objects are false and all states of minds (blo) are deluded, whereas Svātantrikas do not.
• In terms of the path, some of their minor differences include that during periods of study or reflection, Prāsaṅgikas do not prove a probandum that remains after an object of negation has been refuted, whereas
Svātantrikas do. Prāsaṅgikas do not state that they accept a view, Svātantrikas do.
• As for the result, some Svātantrikas believe that tathāgatas possess an illusionlike primordial wisdom that is a complete transformation (gnas gyur pa), and that conventional [reality] appears to them as illusionlike, but they are not deluded because they do not take [such appearances] to be real. Thus they say that impure karmic appearances exist for buddhas. Prāsaṅgikas assert that since appearances manifest from the habitual tendencies of unafflicted ignorance, they are delusive. Since tathāgatas have completely abandoned all delusions, all interactions with appearances have subsided; thus, no karmic appearances exist for buddhas.

[The Origin of the Svātantrika and Prāsangika Division]
In general, the thought expressed in the noble Nāgārjuna's Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way, Called Wisdom, was explained in many ways.[686]
Nevertheless, these [commentarial modes] are mainly split in two ways: Prāsaṅgika and Svātantrika.[687] The Fundamental Treatise begins:[688]
Entities do not arise at any time or any place: not from themselves nor from another, not from both, and not without cause.
The meaning of this verse has been discussed in a variety of ways. The master Buddhapālita[689] used the four theses (pratijñā, dam bca') that arising does not occur from any of the four extremes to invalidate incorrect positions, but he did not put forth any means to prove an actual position
(prakṣha, phyogs). Later, the master Bhāvaviveka criticized Buddhapālita's way of formulating his confutations. Bhāvaviveka set up the root statements[690] as independently [verifiable proof statements] and proved the subject property by independently [verifiable] means.[691]
After that, Chandrakīrti[692] demonstrated that Bhāvaviveka's criticisms of Buddhapālita were not applicable, and he explained that Bhāvaviveka's acceptance of independently [verifiable] reasons in the context of explaining the reasonings that analyze for ultimacy was flawed. Thus, Chandrakīrti is credited with being the one who delineated the system of Prāsaṅgika in a detailed manner.[693]

[The Divisions of Svātantrika]
The Svātantrika system was embraced by a great many masters, including Bhavya ([also known as] Bhāvaviveka),[694] Shrīgupta,[695] Jñānagarbha,[696] Shāntarakṣhita,[697] Kamalashīla,[698] Vimuktisena,[699] Haribhadra,[700] Buddhajñānapāda,[701] Dīpaṇkarabhadra ([also known as Atīsha]),[702] Vitapāda,[703] and Thagana.[704] If we group them according to [broad] types, there are two: Sautrāntika-[Svātantrika-]Mādhyamikas and Yogāchāra[Svātantrika-]Mādhyamikas.[705] Bhāvaviveka[706] provides the reasons for such classifications by saying that, in terms of Nāgārjuna's text, there are two types of Mādhyamikas:
(1) the broad, outer Mādhyamikas, who accept outer objects merely as conventions for the sake of others; and
(2) the subtle, inner Mādhyamikas, who accept mere consciousness as a convention, but not outer objects.
Sautrāntika-[Svātantrika-]Mādhyamikas
Sautrāntika-[Svātantrika-]Mādhyamikas are the broad, outer Mādhyamikas. Prime examples are Bhāvaviveka and his followers. They maintain that their own positions, such as emptiness and nonarising, can be proven by valid cognition. Because of that, they formulate probative reasons (sgrub byed kyi rtan tshig) in which the three modes are established through the power of [their relationship to real] things.[707] They accept outer referents simply as conventions and discuss them in ways that concur with Sautrāntikas.

[The Two Truths]
Mādhyamikas subsume all phenomena, which are knowable objects, into the two truths. Knowable objects are the basis for the classification (dbye gzhi), and the two truths are the way they are classified. The Svātantrika system presents the two truths as follows.
• Conventional [reality] is what exists from the perspective of a deluded state of mind. A basis for the definition (mtshan gzhi) is a pot.
• Ultimate [reality] is that [conventional phenomena], when analyzed, do not exist from the perspective of an undeluded mind. A basis for the definition is that a pot is empty of reality.
[Here,] the meaning of something being real [or true] is that it is undeceiving (mi bslu ba) as the object of a particular mind, either a deluded one or an undeluded one. Phenomena are without any nature: they are empty of reality in terms of their own essence. This is the definition of mere reality (bden pa tsam).

[The Two Truths: Definitions and Positions]
• The definition of conventional reality is whatever cannot withstand rational analysis and, therefore, can be negated.
• The definition of ultimate reality is whatever can withstand rational analysis and, thus, is unable to be refuted.
In general, there are four positions regarding the two truths.[708]
(1) The two truths are synonyms (ming gi rnam grang), such that even the isolates[709] for their defining characteristics are not discrete.
(2) They are discrete in their own natures (ngo bo tha dad pa).
(3) They are discrete simply in the sense that their sameness is negated (gcig pa bkag tsam gyi tha dad pa): they cannot be described as different entities nor can it be said that they are identical.
(4) They are identical in nature but are discrete isolates (ngo bo gcig la ldog pa tha dad pa).
In this system there are many who hold the latter position.

[Conventionalities]
Svātantrikas classify conventionalities as being either correct conventionalities (yang dag kun rdzob) or mistaken conventionalities (log pa'i kun rdzob):
(1) a correct conventionality is whatever is capable of performing a function[710] that is consistent with the way it appears [to its corresponding cognizer]; and
(2) a mistaken conventionality is whatever cannot perform a function consistent with its appearance.
(1) A correct conventionality is any phenomenon (such as a form) that has the following four characteristics:
(a) it performs a function consistent with its appearance;
(b) it has arisen from causes;
(c) it is not something imagined; and
(d) it appears [to its cognizing subject] in a way that is consistent with its respective class [of phenomena].[711]
Such phenomena exist as things capable of performing their respective functions.
(2) A mistaken conventionality is anything that appears but is unable to perform a function, such as the appearance of floaters [for the visually impaired][712] or the two moons [seen when you press your eyes]. Such appearances do not exist as things able to perform functions.
Svātantrikas consider that to be a thorough classification of conventionalities.

Svātantrikas prove a nonimplicative negation that excludes [the possibility that the subject] does not possess [the quality of emptiness],[713] which negates any way of perceiving knowable objects as real entities. This is the ultimate, which they classify as being of two types:
(1) the nominal ultimate (paryāyaparamārtha, rnam grangs pa'i don dam) is the mere negation of actual arising and so forth, but it is not free from the conceptual elaboration of nonarising; and
(2) the final ultimate (mthar thug gi don dam) is the complete pacification of all elaborations, such as arising and nonarising.
These classifications are presented [by Jñānagarbha] in [his Differentiation of] the Two Truths.[714]

[Other Points]
Most masters of this school do not posit an ālaya; they state that consciousness consists of the six modes of consciousness. There are some YogāchāraMādhyamikas, however, who take the position that there are eight modes of consciousness, which include the ālaya. [Svātantrikas, generally,] assert that fruition, which is the culmination of the path, is the independent (rang rgyud pa) appearances of the kāyas and primordial wisdoms, which exist in an illusionlike way.[715]

In order to refute the mistaken views of others, it accepts nonarising, emptiness, and so forth from the perspective of others, and it simply uses consequences to demonstrate to Realists their internal contradictions.

In Chandrakīrti's own system, therefore, there is nothing to be negated nor affirmed through either nonimplicative negations or implicative negations. Nevertheless, for others, [his system] does employ negations and affirmations using the four valid means of cognition and four types of reasons.
The following are the four valid means of cognition, which, from the perspective of others, are commonly acknowledged in the world:
(1) direct perception (pratyakṣha, mngon sum);
(2) inference (anumāṇa, rjes dpag);
(3) scriptural authority (āgama, lung); and
(4) analogy (upamāṇa, nye bar 'jal ba).[717]
The four types of reasons (liṅga, rtags) used for others are:
(a) inferences based on what is commonly acknowledged by others (gzhan la grags pa'i rjes dpag);[718]
(b) consequences that expose the [opponent's] contradictions ('gal ba brjod pa'i thal 'gyur);
(c) comparable applications of the [opponent's] reasons (rgyu mtshan mtshungs pa'i mgo snyoms); and
(d) [demonstrations to the opponent of] the irrelevance of proofs that are equivalent to the probandum (sgrub byed bsgrub bya dang mtshungs pa'i ma grub pa).[719]
The dharma lord Gorampa[720] explains [the application of these reasons] as follows:
Exposing contradictions (b) refutes that something arises from itself. Comparable applications of [the opponent's] reasons (c) refute arising from something other. [Demonstrations of the irrelevance of] proofs that are equivalent to the probandum (d) negate arising from both. Inferences based on what is commonly acknowledged by others (a) refute that things arise without any causes.
Serdokpa Dön-yö Pal[721] comments:
[Gorampa,] although you are omniscient, what you say indicates that you still need to study Madhyamaka. These [four reasons should be used] as follows.
Consequences that expose contradictions (b) create undesirable consequences for the reasons that the others accept.
Comparable applications of the [opponents'] reasons (c) cause certainty about the entailment of these consequences to arise in your opponents' minds by using examples. [Demonstrations of the irrelevance of] proofs that are equivalent to the probandum
(d) show [your opponents] that they cannot remove the difficulties that those consequences have created for them.
Those three consequences (b-d) will prove the subject property and the entailment (which are commonly acknowledged by others) for your opponents' minds. Now you can use reasons based on what is commonly acknowledged by others (a) to generate an inferential valid cognition in your opponents' minds.
As we can see, it is explained that these four reasonings, which are unique to Prāsaṅgikas, are related to the negation of arising from each of the four extremes.[722] Since they are the main reasonings, I will discuss them now in some detail.

[Refutation of arising from self]
First, we will look at the Sāṃkhyas'[723] belief that things arise from themselves. They assert that their statement, “Things arise from themselves,” means that only things that exist at the time of their cause arise and that things that do not exist [at the time of their cause] do not arise. Sesame oil, they say, serves as an illustration: the reason sesame oil appears is that it already exists within sesame seeds, and the reason sesame oil does not appear from sand is that it does not already exist within sand. Prāsaṅgikas use the four reasonings to negate their position as follows.
• Prāsaṅgikas begin by saying, “It follows that for things, the subject, arising is pointless, because they already exist at the time of their causes.” That is a consequence that exposes [the opponents'] contradictions (b).
• Sāṃkhyas then may say, “The entailment is not definite.”[724] Prāsaṅgikas would reply, “It follows that things would arise endlessly, because even though something is already present, it can arise.” That is a comparable application of [the opponents'] reason (c).
• Next, Sāṃkhyas may say, “Those two [cases] are not comparable for the following reason.[725] It is the pot that [is present] during the phase of the lump of clay that arises; [an already] manifestly perceptible pot does not arise [again]. These two are different: one is something manifestly perceptible and the other is not.” Prāsaṅgikas would reply, “Referring to the existence of ‘the pot not manifestly perceptible during the clay-lump phase' is equivalent to your original probandum.”[726] That is [a demonstration to the opponents of] the irrelevance of proofs that are equivalent to the probandum (d).
• Finally, Prāsaṅgikas say, “All outer and inner things, the subject, do not arise from themselves, because they [already] exist.” That is [the employment of] inferences based on what is commonly acknowledged by others (a).[727]

[Refutation of arising from other]
In our [Buddhist] schools, there are Realists[728] who accept that phenomena arise from something other than themselves.[729]
• Prāsaṅgikas start with, “It follows that a seed and its sprout are not inherently different from each other, because a sprout arises from a seed.” That is a consequence that exposes [the opponents'] contradictions (b).
• Realists may say, “The entailment is not definite.”[730] Prāsaṅgikas would reply, “In that case, it follows that pitch-darkness could arise from flames, because even though something is inherently different from something else, it can arise [from that other thing].” That is a comparable application of [the opponents'] reason (c).
• Realists may counter with, “There is a difference between something that has the potential to produce [a result] and something that does not.” Prāsaṅgikas would reply, “This is equivalent to your original probandum.”[731] That is [a demonstration to the opponents of] the irrelevance of proofs that are equivalent to the probandum (d).
• Finally, Prāsaṅgikas say, “A sprout does not arise from a seed, because a seed and a sprout are inherently different from each other.” That is [the employment of] inferences based on what is commonly acknowledged by others (a).

[Refutation of arising from both]
Nirgranthas [that is, Jains][732] assert that phenomena arise from both themselves and things other than themselves. They say that a clay pot's arising from the essential character of the clay is the sense in which it arises from itself. Its arising from the potter, a rope, water, and other factors is the sense in which it arises from something other than itself.

Arising from both is not reasonable, because the defects already explained apply.
[Refutation of arising without causes]
The Hedonists'[734] assertion that this world arises without causes is also negated in four steps.
• First Prāsaṅgikas say, “It follows that this world, the subject, is not perceived directly, because it is without causes.” That is a consequence that exposes [the opponents'] contradictions (b).
• Hedonists then may say, “The entailment is not definite.”[735] Prāsaṅgikas would reply, “It follows that the color and fragrance of a blue water lily [growing] in the sky[736] could be perceived, because even though something has no cause, it can be perceived.” That is a comparable application of [the opponents'] reason (c).
• Hedonists may reply, “Those two [cases, this world and a flower growing in the sky,] are different: one has an existent nature and the other does not. Prāsaṅgikas reply, “This is equivalent to your original probandum.”
That is [a demonstration to the opponents of] the irrelevance of proofs that are equivalent to the probandum (d).
• Finally, Prāsaṅgikas say, “This world, the subject, does not arise without causes, because it arises sometimes.”[737] That is [the employment of] inferences based on what is commonly acknowledged by others (a).

In this system, a mind that discerns conventions is necessarily a mistaken cognition. The Commentary on Bodhichitta says:[738]
When we awaken from a dream [we see that dream objects and waking objects] do not differ in their performance of functions.
As is said, horses and elephants in dreams or illusions and actual horses and elephants, as well as cows in drawings and actual cows, are equivalent in the way that they perform functions from a mistaken perspective.
They are also equivalent in not performing [functions] from a rational perspective. In terms of the things of worldly conventionality and yogic conventionality, [things are said] to be mistaken or correct; however, that is not [Chandrakīrti's] system.[739] His system asserts that there is nothing correct or mistaken in terms of yogic conventionality and, therefore, [yogic conventionality] is mere [conventionality].[740]
The criteria for positing the two truths is as follows.
• The essence of conventionality is the false appearances that [manifest] to a mind involved with delusion.
• The essence of the ultimate is what appears to an undeluded mind.
The first [conventional reality] is defined as the object found (rnyed don) by false seeing. The bases for this definition (mtshan gzhi) are, broadly, ignorance; specifically, taking [things] to be real; and, more particularly, the ignorance present in the mindstreams of ordinary beings.
The latter [ultimate reality] is defined as the object found by correct seeing. The basis for this definition is the opposite of ignorance: it is primordial wisdom, which directly realizes the absence of reality.
The Entrance [to the Middle Way] says:[741]
All entities found bear two natures, owing to being seen correctly or falsely.
It is taught that the object of correct seeing is suchness;
[the object of] false seeing is conventional reality.
The same [text] says:[742]
Those afflicted by eye diseases discern mistaken entities, such as floaters and so forth.
Perfect vision sees their nature.
This is the way to understand suchness here.
The meaning [of these verses] is as follows.
• Conventional reality is defined as what appears as the diversity of dependently originated [phenomena] through the power of ignorance.
• The ultimate is defined as the expanse of the noble ones' primordial wisdom, in which such appearances are not seen.
These are illustrated as follows: the appearance of floaters is an analogy for conventionality; that beings without eye diseases do not see those [floaters] in any way is an analogy for the ultimate.
To sum this up, most Tibetan scholars assert that this system is the final exegesis of the thought expressed in the Collection of Madhyamaka Reasonings.[743]

Tak-tsang Lotsāwa[744] and most scholars after him agree in saying, “The heart of the tathāgatas' dharma is the unerring fundamental topic of profound emptiness. When this is explained in the system of the noble father and son [Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva], which serves as the model (phyi mo) for the Madhyamaka textual tradition, it is related to three phases:
(1) the phase of no examination or analysis;
(2) the phase when rational minds[745] analyze slightly; and
(3) the phase of superb analysis, which goes beyond verbal expression.
Since this makes the explanation and practice [of emptiness] quite easy, it is a genuine key instruction.”

[Three perspectives can be distinguished] in the teachings of the middle wheel of dharma generally and in the texts of the father Nāgārjuna and his son specifically.
[First: No Analysis]
The ground (the aggregates, constituents, and sense spheres), the path (the sphere of conduct and methods), and the result (the kāyas, awakened activities, and so forth) are presented according to the expressions of worldly conventionality, that is, in terms of what is commonly understood from a perspective of no examination or analysis. Most of these topics accord with worldly conventionalities, either as things that are part of worldly consensus or as things that are suitable to become so.[746] Some topics, however, [only] accord with yogic conventionalities, such as the way things appear during meditative equipoise and the subsequent state of attainment.[747]
[Second: Slight Analysis]
The sections of teachings that refute the two self-entities (the objects to be negated) and then expound nonarising, emptiness, and ultimate reality are presented from the perspective of a rational mind that analyzes slightly.
[Third: Superb Analysis]
Many teachings, such as the majority of explicit statements in the Mother [Sūtras],[748] say that nothing exists in any way: not as something existent, nonexistent, permanent, impermanent, empty, not empty, or the like. They also say that nothing is suitable to be apprehended as anything at all. [This perspective is also expressed] in the first three lines of the following quotation from the Fundamental Treatise [on the Middle Way, Called] Wisdom:[749]
Do not say “it is empty”; do not state “it is not empty.” Also do not say that it is both nor neither.
[Such terms] should [only] be used as [conventional] designations.
By explaining these and the many similar passages in relationship to the phase of superb analysis, [the teachings] do not contradict each other in any way. The Entrance to the Wisdom of the Middle Way says:[750]
In the primordial, unborn state, there is nothing to be negated and nothing to be affirmed.
Transcending misery (nirvāṇa) and not are undifferentiated in the unborn state.
Even nonarising itself is not so, because arising things do not exist.
Conventionality does not exist, nor does the ultimate. Buddhas do not exist, nor do sentient beings. There is no view and no meditation; no conduct and no result.
The import of that is what is to be meditated upon. Let the nonconceptual mind remain in its own peace. Without identifying anything or being distracted, meditate with clarity, free from characteristics.
[That expresses] the phase of thorough analysis, which is the final position of Prāsaṅgika-Mādhyamikas.
It is necessary to relate [the teachings on emptiness] to three phases for the following reasons. To begin with, we counteract nonmeritorious acts and proceed on the path to the higher states by taking up what is virtuous and turning away from what is negative. This does not require examination or analysis. In the middle, we reverse our belief in the two types of self-entity and progress on the path to liberation through practice that involves slight analysis. Finally, we eliminate all conceptual elaborations associated with a view and reach the end of the path to omniscience through the practice of superb analysis. Thus it is explained.

The way of unifying [an understanding of] the two truths is described in the words of the early Tibetan [masters]:
Since there are appearances, we do not disregard the path of karma.
Since they are empty, fixations do not arise.
The unification of the two truths is the middle path.

The first type of valid cognizer to ascertain ultimate reality is an inferential [valid cognizer], which is a rational mind that is a special outcome of reflection. [Inferential valid cognition] is based on reasons,[752] of which there are many divisions. If we summarize these, [in this context,] they are, in fact, definitely only negating reasons: refutations of reality, which is the object to be negated. It is not possible that [Prāsaṅgikas] use affirming reasons as they are used in the field of logic (rtog ge). Even when they say, “[Phenomena] are illusionlike because they are dependently originated,” [it is a negating reason]. The manner of presentation may make it seem that that is an affirming reason, but [if it were used in that way,] it would not result in the ascertainment of the ultimate. What [this reason] proves, in actuality, is the emptiness of reality (bden stong nyid), [and, therefore, it is a negating reason].

Negating Reasons
There are two types of negating reasons (dgag rtags):
(1) reasons of the imperception of something connected [to the predicate of the negandum],[753] and
(2) reasons of the perception of something contradictory [to the predicate of the negandum].[754]
The reason of dependent origination is the second kind of reason, and the other [four reasons] are the first type. The five great reasons are common to both the Prāsaṅgika and Svātantrika systems.[755] Here [in the Prāsaṅgika system], only these five (which include the reason that a phenomenon is neither a single unit nor plurality by analyzing its nature) are used to prove the nonexistence of a self-entity of phenomena. There is one reason that proves the absence of a self of persons and brings ascertainment of the ultimate: the sevenfold reasoning that uses the analogy of a chariot. This is the king of reasonings that prove the nonexistence of a self of persons.

The Five Great Reasons
First we will look at the five reasons in detail.
(1) The analysis of a nature: the reason of being neither a unity nor a plurality
The analysis of a phenomenon's nature, which proves that it is neither a single unit nor a plurality, demonstrates emptiness as [one of three] doors to liberation.[756]
[First:] The formulation of the reason
All phenomena (such as sprouts), the subject, do not really exist, because they are devoid of real unity or plurality. An example of this is a reflection in a mirror.
[Second: The modes of the proof]
• The subject of this reason is a mere appearance that is neither examined nor analyzed.
• The subject property that applies to this [subject]: [a mere appearance] is not a real unity because it has parts. It is not a real plurality because there are no real single units that are the building blocks [of a plurality].
• The entailment: if something were real, it would necessarily be either a single unit or a plurality. This [entailment] is established because those two [possibilities] are mutually exclusive, something that is accepted by [all Realists].[757]

</d>
<d e="2">
(2) The analysis of causes: the vajra sliver reasoning
The analysis of a phenomenon's cause [employs] the vajra-sliver-like reason,[758] which shatters the Realists' rocky mountain of wrong views. It demonstrates the absence of characteristics (animitta, mtshan ma med pa) as a door to liberation.
First: The formulation of the reason
A sprout, the subject, does not really arise, because it does not arise from itself, from something other than itself, from both, or from neither. An example of this is a reflection.
Second: The modes of the proof The entailment will always pertain to one of the four extremes [for arising, regardless of whether the assertion being refuted states that a thing] arises owing to the power of [real] things (dngos stobs), arises from the side of the object, or arises from the perspective of analysis.[759] Since [Nāgārjuna] considered this easy to understand, [he] did not discuss it in great detail in his [Fundamental] Treatise [on the Middle Way].[760]

The proof of the subject property has four parts:
(a) Establishing the reason that things do not arise from themselves
Sāṃkhyas assert that a sprout is simply a manifestation of the principal substance (pradhāna, gtso bo), and that the principal substance is the primal matter (prakṛiti, rang bzhin).[761] Therefore, a sprout arises from its own primal matter, an already existing permanent entity. [Prāsaṅgikas refute this, saying that] if that were the case a seed would arise endlessly, since it would not be feasible that the force of a sprout's arising should cause a seed to cease. If [Sāṃkhyas] were to assert that a seed (the cause) does not cease, its result, that is, a sprout's arising and its own colors and shapes, could never materialize. If something were to arise from itself, agents and their effects would be the same.
(b) Establishing the reason that phenomena do not arise from something other than themselves
Realist scholars say, “The way the Sāṃkhya's assertion that things arise from themselves is refuted is fine, but it is established by valid forms of cognition that phenomena arise from things other than themselves. This is because object-consistent consciousnesses arise from the four conditions,[762] and because most [other] entities arise from their causal and dominant conditions.[763] Causes and their results are not simply conceptual designations, they exist from their own sides. [Results are seen] to arise [from causes even] when they are thoroughly examined and analyzed.”

Although there are many reasonings that negate this position, they come down to the following two points:
(i) It is impossible for things to arise from something other than themselves.
(ii) Otherness is impossible in [the framework of] arising.[764]

(i) [It is impossible for things to arise from something other than themselves]
[If phenomena were to arise from something other than themselves, it would follow that] from all things that are not causes of something, phenomena that are not their results would arise, because, [for example,] a barley seed and a rice seed are equivalent in being other than a rice sprout, [and this otherness] is established through their own natures (rang gi ngo bo nas grub pa).[765] [The reason] entails [the consequence,] because for things to be other, they [must] be present concurrently without depending upon each other, like [an animal's] left and right horns; and if such things were in a cause and result [relationship]—even while being [different from each other] in that way—there would be no reason why a rice seed, which is a substantial [cause],[766] should not produce a barley sprout.
(ii) Otherness is impossible in the framework of arising
Those who assert that a sprout arises from a seed cannot possibly also assert that those two are different, discrete substances, for the following [reasons]. The otherness of substances is established from the objects' own side, which is not possible when [two things] are not simultaneous; and the simultaneity of a cause and its result is logically refuted. The cessation of a cause and the arising of its result cannot possibly occur simultaneously, like the rising and falling of a scale's beam.[767] Furthermore, the simultaneity of a cause and its result is refuted by examining whether the result produced is existent [at the time of its cause] or not existent [at that time].[768]
(c) Establishing the reason that phenomena do not arise from both [themselves and things other than themselves]
Since the refutation [of arising from both self and other] is implicit in the [previous] two refutations, [the texts generally] do not present this in detail.
(d) The refutation of causeless [arising]
[The assertion that phenomena] arise without causes elicits the absurd consequences that entities would arise all the time, or that they would never arise. Like [other causeless phenomena, such as] lotuses [growing] in the sky, [which do not appear, all phenomena] would not be suitable to appear—but that contradicts our perception of causes and their effects as being clearly evident. Certain flawed philosophical systems maintain that the nonexistence of past and future lives has been proven, and thus they regard [both] body and mind to be of the nature of the elements. It is taught extensively that [such notions] are [merely] the product of mistaken direct perception that apprehends the elements.

(3) The analysis of results: the negation of the arising of an existent or a nonexistent
The analysis of results (which is an extension of the refutation of arising from something other) refutes the arising of [a result that is] existent [at the time of its cause] and the arising of [a result that is] nonexistent [at the time of its cause]. It demonstrates the absence of expectancy (apraṇihita, smon pa med pa) as a door to liberation.
Some may ask, “What is the result that arises: is it something that exists at the time of its cause or something that does not exist at such time?” Although Svātantrikas purportedly accept the latter [position] as a convention, [the refutations of these positions] are well established for the following reasons. If a result were to exist at the time of its cause, since it already exists in dependence on something else, what would its cause do?
If [a result] were something completely nonexistent, again its cause would do nothing, as in the case of the horns of a rabbit. A combination of both [possibilities] is also not tenable.

(4) The analysis of both causes and results: the negation of arising from the four possibilities
The analysis of both a cause and its result refutes arising from the four possibilities.[769] As was stated above,[770] from a mistaken perspective, it is not contradictory to make statements such as, “One sprout develops from one seed.” However, from a rational perspective, arising from any of the four possibilities—such as only one result manifesting from just a single cause—is untenable, since, in rational terms, a unity is not feasible, and that negates that a plurality could truly exist.

(5) The king of reasonings: the reason of dependent origination
The great reason of dependent origination is the king of reasonings used by
Mādhyamikas to prove the absence of any reality. The Fundamental Treatise [on the Middle Way] says:[771]
Whatever arises dependently is in its very nature a state of peace.
[An example of such reasoning is] the statement, “A sprout, the subject, does not truly exist, because it arises dependently.” This [reasoning is applied] in two ways: (1) to eliminate the extreme of permanence, and (2) to eliminate the extreme of nihilism.
(1) Outer and inner entities, the subject, do not exist ultimately, because they are dependently originated.
(2) Those [entities], the subject, are not nonexistent conventionally, because they are dependently originated.
Prāsaṅgikas assert that these five reasonings are commonly acknowledged by others, whereas Svātantrikas state that they are independently [verifiable] reasonings.
To state this briefly: in the [Prāsaṅgika] system, arising from any of the four ways (self, other, and so forth) does not exist in the slightest, but since it is commonly understood in the world that arising exists, [Prāsaṅgikas] explain it accordingly. The Entrance [to the Middle Way] says:[772]
Having simply sown a seed, worldly beings say, “I produced this boy,” or think, “I planted a tree.” Therefore, even in the world, arising from something other does not exist.

A chariot is not considered to be other than its parts.
It is not identical [with them,] nor does it possess them.
It is not in its parts, nor are the parts within it.
It is not the mere assembly nor the overall shape.
In addition to the fivefold [analysis[775] that begins with seeing that] a chariot is not something other than its parts (such as the nails), [Chandrakīrti] examines the collection [of parts] and the overall shape [of the chariot]. If we investigate [a chariot] using this sevenfold analysis, we will not find that it is the parts themselves nor will we find that it is something other than those [parts]. Similarly, if we look for a self using this sevenfold analysis, we will not find that it is something other than the aggregates nor will we find that it is the aggregates themselves. In this [analysis of the chariot], the overall shape and the collection are refuted implicitly, since they cannot be found apart from that which has the shape (dbyibs can) or that which is the collection (tshogs pa can).

What is proven by these reasons is not, for example, an affirmation of the ultimate through the process of other-exclusion[776] on a conventional level. This is because mental elaborations do not apply to the actual ultimate (don dam pa dngos nyid), since it is far beyond being an object of the intellect (blo), or an object of terms and concepts. Therefore, techniques[777] such as eliminating the elaborations of the eight extremes—arising and cessation, permanence and annihilation, going and coming, sameness and discreteness—are [themselves] elaborations. In order to cut through the elaborations of conventionality, they are used simply as conventional expressions in keeping with what is commonly acknowledged by others.

A thesis, whatever it may be, is the creation of the intellect, and the intellect is a conventional, mistaken cognition. Therefore, for Prāsaṅgikas, there are no independently [verifiable] theses or assertions. Even nonarising, freedom from elaborations, and so forth are not put forth as independently [verifiable] theses for the following [two] reasons. (1) Although phenomena, persons, and so forth (which are verbally stated) have never existed, non-Buddhist and Buddhist Realists fixate upon them as [real] entities, because they have fallen into the extremes of superimposition or denial.[778] [Reasonings that demonstrate nonarising and so forth are stated only] to banish such [unwarranted] reification. (2) Once that reification is overturned, the intellect that clings to nonentities also must be renounced; and thus it is taught that [the ultimate] is beyond the intellect and without any clinging. This corresponds to Shāntideva's statement [in his Entrance to the Bodhisattva's Way of Life]:[779]
Once neither entities nor nonentities are present for the intellect, there are no other possibilities.
This is complete peace, free from referents.

The master Chandrakīrti explains [the path] by bringing together the method (upāya, thabs) taught in the Sūtra on the Ten Bhūmis[780] and the wisdom (prajñā, shes rab) presented in the Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way. He describes the way [method and wisdom] are unified through the gradual cultivation of the ten pāramitās during the ten bhūmis.[781]
The essence of the ultimate is primordial wisdom that directly realizes dharmatā, which is free from all elaborations. As for the way in which dharmatā is realized: the primordial wisdom of noble beings does not see an essence of phenomena in any way. This is referred to with the conventional expression “realizing dharmatā.” As [Atīsha] says [in his Entrance to the Two Truths]:[782]
The most profound sūtras say it is the seeing of the unseen.
In the context of the subsequent states of attainment, primordial wisdom is divided slightly in that it is the support for the virtues of generosity and so forth.[783] The essence of primordial wisdom itself, however, has no divisions, because primordial wisdom and dharmatā are inseparable and the essence of dharmatā has no divisions.

I will discuss the dharmakāya and the form kāyas without differentiating them in terms of their actual and nominal types.[784] As for the identification of the first, the dharmakāya is the space-like expanse free from the two obscurations and their habitual tendencies. This accords with the statement in the Entrance to the Middle Way:[785]
When the dry wood of knowable objects is fully consumed, there is peace: the dharmakāya of the victorious ones.
At that point, there is neither arising nor cessation.
With the cessation of mind, the [sambhoga]kāya makes this [the dharmakāya] manifest.[786]
Given that, does primordial wisdom, in this system, exist at the bhūmi of a buddha or not? Jets Drakpa Gyaltsen[787] commented on this, saying:
The assertion that, in the tradition of the master Chandrakīrti, primordial wisdom does not exist on a buddha's bhūmi denigrates both the master and the buddhas.
The dharma lord Sakya Paṇḍita[788] states:
If you assert that, ultimately, on the bhūmi of a buddha, primordial wisdom is beyond existence and nonexistence and, conventionally, it is mind and mental events, then on the bhūmi of a buddha [primordial wisdom] does not exist, because a buddha has exhausted delusion.
The exalted Mikyö Dorjé, Silung Paṇchen [Shākya Chokden],[789] and others assert that, ultimately, on the bhūmi of a buddha, primordial wisdom is beyond existence or nonexistence, and, conventionally, primordial wisdom exists, because [the Entrance to the Middle Way] says:[790]
With your excellent omniscience, you comprehend all knowable objects in a single moment.
In that case, if buddha[hood] is identified as being space-like dharmatā, does it mean that buddhas do not benefit others? [No, it does not, because] the power of the buddhas' previous aspirations and the merit of the beings to be trained cause [the buddhas' activities] to appear uninterruptedly with their two form kāyas, [which manifest] for the sake of others. This is like the way wish-fulfilling gems and wish-granting trees[791] can fulfill the needs and desires of those who pray to them even though they do not have the idea of doing so. The Entrance [to the Middle Way] says:[792]
The kāya of peace is evident, like wish-granting trees, and, like wish-fulfilling gems, it is nonconceptual.
Until all beings are liberated, it remains constant for the sake of enriching the world. It appears to those free from conceptual elaborations.

What is logically imputed is rejected: entities are simply names. Conditioned phenomena are deceptive; nirvāṇa is not. Taking things to be real and what that produces is the afflictive obscuration, the root of cyclic existence. Because the three yānas' ways of seeing are similar, their paths of seeing are the same.
Since [from the perspective of buddhas] knowable objects have subsided, buddhas are simply appearances for others.

This philosophical tenet system has many distinctive features, but the following five are the main ones.
First: [Phenomena Exist Only Nominally]
[Prāsaṅgikas] reject all discussions of valid forms of cognition and invalid forms of cognition, which are the logical imputations (rtog ges btags pa) of [the other philosophical systems] up through the Svātantrika system. [Prāsaṅgikas] reject these for their own Madhyamaka system and as worldly systems, even as mere conventional expressions, without even considering that such things [could be established] from a rational perspective. All phenomena (inner and outer, as well as causes and their results) are what is imagined (blos brtags), which [means that], from their own side as objects, they do not exist even as conventions: they are simply names and are [only] imputedly existent (ming rkyang btags yod). [Prāsaṅgikas] state that horses and elephants in dreams and the waking state are equivalent in terms of being real or false.[793]

</d>
<d e="2">
Second: [Conditioned Phenomena Are Deceptive]
Whatever is conditioned is necessarily a false and deceptive phenomenon, since it does not remain for a second instant beyond its single instant of existence, and no agent and its object exist in that single instant. Not only are [conditioned phenomena] not able to withstand rational analysis, there is not even a trace of something that is established from a rational perspective. [Prāsaṅgikas,] therefore, maintain that there is no common locus (gzhi mthun) between conditioned phenomena and something established through valid forms of cognition. Although it is the case that when properly analyzed, nirvāṇa and any [hypothetically] superior phenomenon do not exist from their own side, [Prāsaṅgikas] assert that, from the perspective of slight analysis, the only thing that is undeceiving is nirvāṇa. This is stated in [the Sixty Verses on Reasoning]:[794]
The victors teach that nirvāṇa alone is true.

</d>
<d e="2">
Third: [The Afflictive Obscuration Is Taking Things to Be Real]
The root of cyclic existence is taking things to be real (satyagrāha, bden 'dzin). That [notion] and what it produces—the mental afflictions (such as attachment) and all their associated factors—are simply the afflictive obscuration (kleṣhāvaraṇa, nyon sgrib). Whereas [the cognitive obscuration (jñeyāvaraṇa, shes bya'i sgrib pa) is as the Highest Continuum says]:[795]
All concepts of the three spheres[796] are asserted to be the cognitive obscuration.
It is also said:
The cognitive obscuration is the one hundred [and eight] concepts concerned with percepts and perceivers.[797]
[Prāsaṅgikas] do not assert that there is a common locus between taking things to be real and the cognitive obscuration. Their assertion accords with statements such as [Nāgārjuna's in his Precious Garland]:[798]
As long as one clings to the aggregates, [one will cling to a self.]
And:
It is definite that the root of saṃsāra is taking things to be real.
This also establishes that it is impossible that shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas do not realize the absence of a self-entity of phenomena.[799]

<d e="2">
Fourth: [The Realization of Dharmatā Is the Same in the Three Yānas]
The three yānas' paths of seeing do not consist of many moments, such as sixteen, fifteen, twelve, or four. The Entrance [to the Middle Way] says:[800]
The intelligence that perceives suchness as its object is also not differentiated.
[Prāsaṅgikas] assert that the way dharmatā is seen is the same in all three yānas.

Fifth: [Buddhas' Manifestations Are Simply Appearances for Others]
The buddhas' unfathomable and indescribable form kāyas and activities are nonconceptual, just as are the achievements of wish-fulfilling gems and garuda stūpas.[801] Moreover, they are displays of appearances for others (gzhan snang) that do not require even the arousing of bodhichitta. Instead, their [manifestation] is attributable to the power of [the buddhas'] previous aspirations and the positive karma of those to be trained. Āryadeva describes the perspective of a buddha:[802]
When one wakens from the deluded sleep of ignorance, these [states of] saṃsāra are not observed.
[Prāsaṅgikas] say that since, [from the perspective of a buddha,] all appearances of consciousness and knowable objects have subsided, buddhas are simply appearances for others.

[The Eight Uncommon Theses]
A later generation of Tibetans explains that this system has eight great, uncommon theses: four theses associated with refutation and four theses associated with affirmation.[803]
[The four associated with refutation]
(A1) The existence of things by way of their own specific characteristics
(svalakṣhaṇasiddha, rang mtshan kyis grub pa) is not accepted even as a convention. (A2) Independently [verifiable] reasons are not accepted even as conventions.
(A3) Reflexive awareness is not accepted even as a convention. (A4) An ālaya is not accepted even as a convention.
[The four associated with affirmation]
(B1) External objects (bāhyārtha, phyi don) are accepted. (B2) Taking things to be real is necessarily the afflictive obscuration. (B3) Disintegration (zhig pa) is asserted to be a [functioning] thing
(dngos po).
(B4) Noble shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas realize the absence of a self-entity of phenomena.[804]
Regarding these [eight points], Serdok Paṇchen [Shākya Chokden] and his sons say, “[We can agree] only with the words of the statement ‘Noble shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas realize the absence of a self-entity of phenomena.' As for the other seven points, they are philosophical tenets that Prāsaṅgika-Mādhyamikas would not consider even in their dreams.” The assertions of the eighth lord [Karmapa Mikyö Dorjé] are for the most part similar to that.[805]

Maitreya's thought was explained by Asaṅga and his brother.
The two systems of Yogāchāra and Certainty about the Ultimate
do not differ in terms of the essence of their views.
However, in the system of the first Dharma Treatises there are three yānas [ultimately];
whereas the view of the Highest Continuum is that there is one yāna ultimately,
a bhūmi with the habitual tendencies of ignorance, and birth through undefiled karma.
These are ways for the common [disciples] to cut through conceptual elaborations and the uncommon [to become certain] about the ultimate.

The Dharma Treatises of the exalted Maitreya[807] were explained by Asaṅga and his brother [Vasubandhu].[808] The general philosophical tenet system of these [texts] was taught in detail by many excellent disciple lineages, such as [those originating with] Dignāga and Sthiramati.[809] The uncommon philosophical tenet system [of Maitreya's texts] remained with supreme disciples, who transmitted it orally. In Tibet, this [uncommon explanation] was transmitted by the lotsāwas Zu Gawé Dorjé[810] and Tsen Kawoché[811] and was first established as a system of standard texts (yig cha'i srol) by the mahāsiddha Yumo [Mikyö Dorjé][812] and others. The uncommon key points of this view were elucidated in the teachings of the lord of victors Rangjung Dorjé,[813] the omniscient [Longchen] Drimé Özer,[814] and others, who also clearly maintained that this [view] was the final definitive meaning. In particular, the omniscient dharma lord Dolpopa the Great[815] proclaimed the lion's roar of “Shentong-Madhyamaka.” Later, Serdok Paṇchen [Shākya Chokden],[816] the exalted Tāranātha,[817] and others clarified the uncommon key points of this system of philosophical tenets. [These are the masters who] appeared as the founders and promulgators of this great chariot-system.
The exegetical systems associated with those [treatises] differ in such a variety of ways that they could be [categorized] into subtler and broader subschools. Silung Paṇchen [Shākya Chokden]'s explanation is that principally there are two exegetical styles found in [Maitreya's Treatises]:[818]
(1) the exegetical style of the first three Dharma Treatises of Maitreya, which may be referred to as that of the Yogāchāra-Mādhyamikas, or
(2) the exegetical style of the Highest Continuum, which belongs to the Mādhyamikas with Certainty about the Ultimate (don dam rnam par nges pa'i dbu ma pa).
These two systems do not differ greatly in terms of the essence of their views, however, they do differ in the following specific ways:
(1) The system of the first Dharma Treatises of Maitreya explains that ultimately there are three yānas, and it does not make some points that are part of the presentation[819] found in the Highest Continuum.
(2) The thought of the Highest Continuum is expressed in the explanations that ultimately there is one yāna, that there is a bhūmi on which the habitual tendency of ignorance is present, and that birth can take place through undefiled karma.[820]
We should understand that these [two systems] are exegetical styles that are respectively (1) the means for common disciples to cut through conceptual elaborations by means of study and reflection;[821] and (2) the way for uncommon disciples to become definitively certain about the ultimate by means of meditation.

The majority of Tibetans say that [the first Dharma Treatises of Maitreya] are not Madhyamaka texts because they teach that ultimately there are three yānas. However, the masters who hold the positions [of the first Dharma Treatises] say that the explanation that shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas do not enter the Mahāyāna path after having attained nirvāṇa without remainder is itself not enough justification to say that [these texts] are not to be considered Madhyamaka: being considered Madhyamaka is [determined] on the basis of the view. Their point is that [the first Dharma Treatises of Maitreya are Madhyamaka] because [they teach] the following special features of the Madhyamaka, as specified by the lord of scholars Kamalashīla and others:
(1) all knowable objects are of one taste, emptiness;
(2) all sentient beings are pervaded by the element of sugatagarbha;[822] and
(3) all beings are capable of the awakening [of a buddha].
The great omniscient one of Jonang [Dolpopa] states:[823]
The five Dharma Treatises of Maitreya do not contain different views. The Ornament of Clear Realization does not explain the Rangtong view. None of these [texts] explain that ultimately there are three yānas and a cut-off potential.
Thus he does not subdivide Shentong-Madhyamaka into higher and lower
[schools].
There are Tibetans who say that the Madhyamaka system of three of the Treatises of Maitreya is [in fact] the False Image system of the Chittamātra.[824] However, in general Tibetans make free use of the conventions “Real Images” and “False Images,”[825] which [they always consider] to belong to the Chittamātra [system]. [They make their categorization] simply [because] there are two types [of statements] that appear in these treatises: the images appearing as objects for cognition (which is [itself] appearing as referents) are real or they are false; [however, neither statement constitutes grounds for these texts to be considered as belonging to either Chittamātra subschool]. The following passage from [Serdok] Paṇchen Shākya Chokden is of particular relevance:[826]
Those who assert that the view of the Highest Continuum is the Chittamātra view have no scriptures or reasonings to prove that, for the following reasons: In [the Highest Continuum's] own system there are no scriptural quotations or reasonings that validate
[such a categorization]. If they [instead] draw on scriptures and reasonings from other systems to prove [their point] and confute [other positions], they will never find a Mādhyamika who maintains the flawless Madhyamaka view.

If [the fact that] the exalted Maitreya and Asaṅga have explained that [the Highest Continuum] is Madhyamaka is not enough proof [for them], they will never find a valid authority for these teachings.
Bhāvaviveka and Kamalashīla prove that Nāgārjuna's scriptural tradition is Madhyamaka by using the argument that he was a noble being and was prophesied by the Sugata. Such [arguments] apply in this [case since both Maitreya and Asaṅga were noble beings and were prophesied by the Buddha]. If [the Highest Continuum] is not considered Madhyamaka because it explains that the consummate [nature] is ultimate reality, how could the many earlier and later Tibetans[827] who assert that ultimate reality is emptiness in its aspect of a nonimplicative negation be considered Mādhyamikas?
Thus, Maitreya's and Asaṅga's own system does not explain that there are teachings [of the Buddha] or treatises that reveal a Madhyamaka view that is not found in the Madhyamaka taught in the last Dharma Treatise of Maitreya [the Highest Continuum]. This can be understood by reading not only the root texts of Maitreya but also the four Synopses[828] and the two Compendia,[829] because this system states:
It is explained clearly that sūtras teaching that all phenomena have no inherent nature (niḥsvabhāva, ngo bo nyid med pa) are not to be taken literally. Anyone who accepts such [statements] as literal is a propounder of nihilism.

Imagination of what is unreal exists; within it, duality does not exist. Emptiness exists within it, and it exists within that [emptiness].
Thus all is explained as not empty and not non-empty.
Since [imagination] exists, [duality] does not exist, and [imagination of what is unreal] exists [within emptiness, and emptiness within it], this is the middle path.[832]
First, [the following is presented] from the perspective of cutting through conceptual elaborations concerning conventional [reality].[833] The mere imagination of what is unreal—cognition, which manifests as the variety of appearances—exists on a conventional [level]. The percepts and perceivers appearing to that [cognition] do not exist even conventionally, because they are simply imputed by the mind. Thus, conventional reality is free from the two extremes:
• It is free from the extreme of nonexistence, or nihilism, because the mere existence of imagination is accepted on the conventional level.
• It is free from the extreme of permanence, or existence, because it transcends superimposed, mutually dependent phenomena, such as percepts and perceivers.[834]
Primordial wisdom, emptiness free from conceptual elaborations, really exists (bden par yod) within that consciousness—i.e., within the imagination of what is unreal—in the sense that it is its dharmatā [its reality]. In the phase with stains, consciousness, “that which bears reality,”[835] exists within dharmatā as adventitious, removable stains; it is stains, [or] factors to be abandoned, which are of an unreal nature. Thus, ultimate reality is free from the two extremes:
• It transcends the extreme of nonexistence, or nihilism, because emptiness truly exists (bden grub).
• It transcends the extreme of existence, or permanence, because all phenomena comprising the duality of percept and perceiver (such as imagination) do not truly exist (bden med).

That being the case, the conventional [phenomena of] percepts and perceivers are simply the manifestations of delusive appearances—they are not things that exist by way of their own natures. Thus, they are empty of any nature of their own. [Looking at this in the context of] a dichotomy between self and other, it is also not possible that a knowable object exists with a nature that is other [than its own]. Thus, since [conventional phenomena] are empty in all regards, they are not non-empty.
Primordial wisdom, which is dharmatā, exists originally by way of its own nature and never changes; therefore, it is not empty of a nature of its own, and it always exists.

You might wonder, did the sūtras not teach that even the dharmadhātu is empty? Generally speaking, it is empty, or emptiness, but that does not necessitate that it is empty of its own nature. Primordial wisdom [the dharmadhātu] is called “emptiness” because it is empty of all characteristics that are other than itself, that is, it is empty of all conceptual elaborations of percepts and perceivers.
Now [I will discuss] the three characteristics (trilakṣhaṇa, mtshan nyid gsum): the imagined (parikalpita, kun brtags), dependent (paratantra, gzhan dbang), and consummate (pariniṣhpanna, yongs grub).
Imagined [characteristics] are
• all non-entities (such as space);
• what appears as an object, such as a form manifesting to thought;
• the linking of names and their referents, where a name is taken to be its referent or a referent is mistakenly taken to be its name; and
• all perceived objects that are superimposed conceptually: outer and inner; end and middle; large and small; good and bad; directions; time; and so forth.
The dependent [characteristic] is mere consciousness that manifests as the entities of percept and perceiver, because it is an appearance that is governed by something other than itself, i.e., the habitual tendencies of ignorance.
The consummate [characteristic] is reflexive awareness, self-illuminating and free from conceptual elaborations. Synonyms for it are dharmatā, dharmadhātu, thusness, and the ultimate.
The dependent and imagined [characteristics] are equal in that they do not really exist (bden par med); equal in being delusive appearances; and equal in being conventionalities and false. It is necessary, however, to distinguish them in terms of their respective characteristics: imagined
[characteristics] do not exist even on a conventional [level], whereas the dependent do exist conventionally. The consummate [characteristic] does not exist conventionally and does exist ultimately (don dam du yod pa), thus it really exists.

The three characteristics [are discussed in the following three ways].
[Three Modes of Existence]
Imagined [characteristics] are imputedly existent (btags pas yod pa). Dependent [characteristics] are substantially existent (rdzas su yod pa). The consummate [characteristic] does not exist in [either of] those two [ways]—it exists without conceptual elaborations (spros med du yod pa).
[Three Modes of Emptiness]
Imagined [characteristics] are “the emptiness of the nonexistent” (med pa'i stong nyid). Dependent [characteristics] are “the emptiness of the existent” (yod pa'i stong nyid). The consummate [characteristic] is “ultimate emptiness” (don dam stong nyid).[836] The exalted [Maitreya in the Ornament of the
Mahāyāna Sūtras] says:[837]
Those who know the emptiness of the nonexistent, the emptiness of the existent, and natural emptiness are said to “know emptiness.”
[Three Modes of Inherent Absence]
Imagined [characteristics] are the inherent absence of characteristics (mtshan nyid ngo bo nyid med pa).[838] Dependent [characteristics] are the inherent absence of arising (skye ba ngo bo nyid med pa).[839] The consummate [nature] is the ultimate inherent absence (don dam ngo bo nyid med pa).[840] [Vasubandhu's Thirty Verses] says:[841]
Thinking of the three types of inherent absence of the three kinds of natures, it is taught that all phenomena have no nature.

Consequently, [Shentong Proponents] assert that all knowable objects are pervaded by emptiness.

Consequently, this system asserts that all knowable objects are pervaded by emptiness and inherent absence. You may ask, “If the consummate
[nature] is truly existent, does it exist as something that arises, abides, and ceases? Does it come or go? Change or disappear? Does it have spatial or temporal dimensions? Is it singular or is it a plurality?” It is none of those.
If something were to have those [characteristics], it would follow that it does not really exist. This [consummate nature] has no connection to any such conventional phenomena: it is not something that arises, abides, and ceases, comes or goes. It is not singular nor is it a plurality; it is neither a cause nor a result. In terms of its own nature, it precludes the triad of definition, definiendum, and illustration. Since it is free from all conceptual elaborations, such as being something with spatial or temporal dimensions,
[the consummate nature] is inherently permanent. Because it cannot be divided into discrete pieces, it is partless. Since it is the dharmatā of all phenomena, it is said to be omnipresent and all-pervading.[842]
[Shentong Proponents'] presentations of other [topics related to] ground, path, and result[843] are said for the most part to be in accord with the
Chittamātra [system].

The two Madhyamaka [systems] renowned as Shentong and Rangtong do not differ in the way they determine all conventional phenomena to be empty, nor do they disagree that the extremes of conceptual elaborations cease during meditative equipoise. Nevertheless, they do differ in terms of the way they use conventional cognitive and verbal expressions during the subsequent state of attainment,[844] which is when philosophical tenet systems are distinguished. Simply as a conventional position, [Shentong Proponents] say that dharmatā or thusness exists, and [Rangtong Proponents] say that it does not exist. They also differ in their views of whether nondual primordial wisdom is truly established or not at the time of final analysis by means of reasonings that analyze for ultimacy.
Shentong Proponents, therefore, assert that imagined and dependent [characteristics] are conventionalities, and the consummate [characteristic] is ultimate reality. They also maintain that to view [ultimate reality] as being simply a nonimplicative negation, whereby its reality is not established, is [to regard ultimate reality as] an inanimate emptiness.[845] That is the way conventionalities are empty, but it is not the abiding nature of ultimate emptiness. Concisely put, that [ultimate] is primordial wisdom empty of the duality of percept and perceiver; it is intuitive reflexive awareness (so so rang rig pa). They state that since this way of presenting [the ultimate] is in complete harmony with the thought of the great tantras, it is the profound view linking the Sūtra and Mantra [systems], the pinnacle of Madhyamaka systems.
Now [we will look at] the summary of the essential points in the elimination of the extremes imputed by others [to the Shentong system] as presented by the exalted Tāranātha [in his Essence of Shentong]:[846]
There are those who quote the following passage from the Descent into Laṅkā Sūtra:[847]
[Mahāmati] asked, “If sugatagarbha were to exist with its major and minor marks, would it not be similar to the self of [non-Buddhist] tīrthikas?”[848] [The Buddha] replied, “It is not similar because it is emptiness.”
They say, “Sugatagarbha, therefore, does not really exist. If it had the major and minor marks and the like, this would be a tīrthika's system. The space-like complete absence of any existence is called sugatagarbha.”
Such claims [limit] emptiness to mean the absence of reality and identify it as just the complete and utter absence of any existence. [Such ideas] belong to a flawed intellect that is attached to its inferior philosophical tenets.

The sūtra states, as the reason why [sugatagarbha] is not similar to the tīrthikas' [self], that [sugatagarbha] is emptiness, but it does not say that [the reason it is not similar to the tīrthikas' self] is that it lacks the major and minor marks. Those who claim that sugatagarbha with its clearly evident and perfect major and minor marks is explained to be the provisional meaning are simply deceiving the world with their lies.
The statement that the assertion of [sugata]garbha as permanent belongs to the tīrthikas' systems again amounts to nothing more than a refutation of the sūtras on [sugata]garbha. It is not feasible to assert that the meaning of permanence [here] is the permanence of being continuous, because saṃsāra and all percepts and perceivers are the mere permanence of being continuous. Also, if the mere permanence of being continuous were sufficient [to qualify as] permanence, all conditioned phenomena would be permanent.
Some think, “[Sugatagarbha] is impermanent since first it has stains and later it becomes stainless.” From the perspective of the dharmadhātu, it does not have stains at first, nor does it later become stainless. Nevertheless, the mode of having stains and becoming stainless is [simply something that appears] in relationship to the mindstreams of individuals. Thus, it is not the case that changes in the state of a sentient being result in changes to the state of dharmatā.
Others think, “It is not logical that the primordial wisdom of buddha[hood] exists within the mindstreams of sentient beings.”
This, however, contradicts the explicit statement [in the Highest Continuum]:[849]
Because the primordial wisdom of buddha[hood] is present in all sentient beings . . .
Some say, “It is not feasible that the excellent qualities of buddha[hood] exist within the mindstreams of sentient beings.
For example, if the strength of knowing what is the case and what is not the case[850] were to exist within the mindstreams of sentient beings, it would follow [absurdly] that sentient beings know what is the case and what is not the case.” This statement is incorrect, because we do not say “Whatever is part of the mindstreams of sentient beings is buddha[hood].” If that were the consequence of saying that buddha[hood] and its excellent qualities reside in the mindstreams of sentient beings, would it also follow that when a buddha resides on a throne, the throne cognizes all knowable objects? Therefore, how could the mind-streams of sentient beings—that is, the eight modes of consciousness—be buddha[hood]? The buddha[hood] that resides [in the mindstreams of sentient beings] does not do so in the manner of a conventional support and something supported, [where buddhahood would be what is supported by a sentient being's mind-stream]. It abides in the manner of being ultimate dharmatā.

The judicious thing is to give up fixed positions in which one repeatedly echoes the constellation[-like] minor texts, and engage [these two systems] in an equal way.

Most earlier and later Tibetan teachers and some ordinary Indian paṇḍitas say, “This system is the Chittamātra philosophical tenet system,” and thus they exclude it from the ranks of Madhyamaka. Many of them go further by conceitedly claiming to have fathomed the thought of the scholars [of this system], when [in fact] all they are doing is [simply] repeating [their own] exegetical system. By stating, “The exalted Maitreya's scriptural tradition and the noble Asaṅga and his brother are Chittamātra,” they take them to be greatly inferior and the noble Nāgārjuna and others to be greatly superior. On the basis of that, they amass an infinite amount of the [bad] karma of rejecting the dharma.
What equal the sun and moon—which alone ornament the sky of the Sage's teachings—are none other than the scriptural traditions of the two great chariot[-systems].[851] Therefore, if we align ourselves with those, we will avoid repeatedly echoing the constellation-like minor texts of ordinary paṇḍitas, which involves devoting ourselves to the elaborations of refutations and proofs that rely on many spurious scriptures and reasonings. We will also avoid fixating on biased positions and providing limited explanations, the results of which will only bring ourselves and others into a pit of numerous faults. The supreme traditions of these two chariots do not contradict each other: one emphasizes outer principles, the other inner principles.[852] Therefore, the judicious thing to do is equally engage their points for study, reflection, and meditation.

The mahāpaṇḍita Shākya Chokden states:[853]
Without the dharma system of the ālaya and the presentation of the three emptinesses found in the texts of Asaṅga's positions, how would we explain the bases for purification and the means of purifications, and the presentations of outer, inner, and other found in the texts of the great approach [i.e., the tantras]?
Without [the explanations of] the way nondual primordial wisdom is empty of a nature that are delineated by Prāsaṅgika and Svātantrika texts, how would we give up taking profound and clear primordial wisdom to be real and our conceptual clinging to the sublime deities?
He also says:[854]
In this doctrine, there are two types of Madhyamaka:
(1) the ultimate essence of the definitive meaning of the texts of the exalted Maitreya; and
(2) the ultimate essence of the definitive meaning of the texts of the venerable Nāgārjuna.
(1) [The ultimate definitive meaning in Maitreya's teachings] is primordial wisdom, which is devoid of the duality of percepts and perceivers. The sources for this are [Maitreya's five Treatises:] the two Ornaments, two Differentiations, and Highest Continuum Shāstra. The Differentiation of the Middle and the Extremes Shāstra establishes this view as the Madhyamaka path, and the Differentiation of Phenomena and Their Nature Shāstra presents the stages by which the mind engages that [view and path].
(2) [The ultimate definitive meaning in Nāgārjuna's teachings] is a mere nonimplicative negation, which refutes all conceptually elaborated extremes. The sources for this are [Nāgārjuna's] Collection of Reasonings.[855] What is found in his Collection of Praises[856] is in keeping with Maitreya's Dharma Treatises.
Who were the establishing founders of these [systems]? The two: the venerable Nāgārjuna and the venerable Asaṅga. In what way were these established? As twofold: as the Rangtong system, which determines that both [conventional and ultimate] reality are empty of an essence; and as the Shentong system, which determines that only the nature of conventional [phenomena] is intrinsically empty (rang stong), and thereby eliminates conceptual elaborations concerning the ultimate.

Further, there are two [other systems]:
(1) the system of Āryavimuktisena[857] and Haribhadra,[858] which explains the thought of the Ornament of Clear Realization according to the Rangtong [perspective]; and (2) the system of Abhayākaragupta[859] and Dharmapāla,[860] which explains the thought of [Nāgārjuna's] Collection of Reasonings according to the Shentong.
In sum, all four of these pioneering systems are equal in being Madhyamaka paths, because they are clearly stated to be Madhyamaka systems in the authentic scriptural traditions.
The Rangtong mode is explained to be the Madhyamaka path by masters who are Prāsaṅgika or Svātantrika proponents, because they explain emptiness in terms of the Rangtong-Madhyamaka, [following Nāgārjuna's] statement:[861]
Whatever is dependently arisen is explained to be empty. It is a dependent designation and is itself the middle way.
The Shentong mode is asserted to be the Madhyamaka path by Asaṅga and his brother [Vasubandhu], because they assert emptiness in the Shentong style, [following the Differentiation of the Middle and the Extremes]:[862]
Since [imagination] exists, [duality] does not exist, and [imagination of what is unreal] exists [within emptiness, and emptiness within it], this is the middle path.
In this regard, some in the Land of Snows [i.e., Tibet] think, “Madhyamaka, which is one of the four philosophical tenet systems, generally [consists of] the Prāsaṅgika and Svātantrika systems. [A system] superior to those could only be a path that is classified as Prāsaṅgika, since [the Entrance to the Middle Way] says:[863]
This profound and frightening suchness will definitely be realized by those who have previously familiarized themselves with it; but others, even with their vast learning, will not be able to comprehend it.
[I will answer] that [by showing] the comparable application of [the opponent's reason] (mgo mtshungs) and the actual state of things (rnal ma).

First, [the comparable application of the opponent's reason]:
In that case, it would be [equally] reasonable to explain that the supreme type of Madhyamaka is only found in the Shentong mode, because the venerable Asaṅga explained it in that [way], and because he explained that the view of the Rangtong mode is a view of denial (skur ba 'debs pa) and a view for those of lesser acumen.[864] In this context of identifying the definitive meaning,[865] the venerable Asaṅga's scriptures are equally capable of negating or proving the same points that Chandrakīrti's scriptures are capable of negating or proving, because [the Buddha] prophesied that [Asaṅga] would be the master who would distinguish the provisional and definitive meanings in the sūtras. In brief, it is a matter of dispute who represents the Madhyamaka that is the pinnacle of the four systems of philosophical tenets propounded in the noble land [of India], because the Mahāyāna master Chandrakīrti did not explain the Shentong mode as Madhyamaka, and the noble Asaṅga—whose [stature] as a Mahāyāna master of the [Buddhist] doctrine is undisputed and unrivaled—explained that the Rang-tong mode is not the scriptural tradition of the Madhyamaka.
Second, [the actual state of things]:
For explaining the thought of Nāgārjuna, the Rangtong exegetical system is superior; and for elucidating the thought of the exalted Maitreya, the Shentong mode is most profound. The scriptures and reasonings of one, therefore, are not able to negate the other.
If we do not look at it that way, we have [to regard] the venerable Asaṅga's scriptures and reasonings as predominant (dbang btsan pa), because he was prophesied as one who would attain the level of a noble being and delineate the definitive meaning, and he was [one of] the first founders of a system of the Mahāyāna.

Chandrakīrti did explain that the venerable Asaṅga's exegetical style was not [in keeping with] the thought of Nāgārjuna, but he did not explain that the venerable Asaṅga had not internalized the meaning of Madhyamaka.
These masters [that is, Tāranātha and Shākya Chokden] make a distinction between Chittamātras and Proponents of Cognition (Vijñaptivādins), as is discussed in [Distinguishing the] Two Modes [and] Establishing the Unity [of the Definitive Meaning].[866] [The latter] states this in detail:
The explanation that Proponents of Cognition (Vijñaptivādins) and Chittamātras are the same is derived from:
(1) the confusion of the many Tibetans who accept that all
[forms of] awareness and primordial wisdom are necessarily mind and mental events;
(2) their mistake of not distinguishing primordial wisdom from consciousness; and
(3) their failure to train properly in dharma terminology of the final teachings [of the Buddha, that is, the teachings of the third dharma wheel].
You who assert that Proponents of Cognition (Vijñaptivādins) and Chittamātras are the same can understand that your position is not logical by simply reflecting on the meaning of passages that you chant, such as the following: From scriptures, [such as the Differentiation of the Middle and the Extremes]:[867]
No phenomenon exists apart from the dharmadhātu.
From sūtras, [such as the Abhidharma Sūtra]:[868]
The expanse of beginningless time is the source of all phenomena.
From tantras, [the Hevajra Tantra]:[869]
I pervade all these.
[I] do not see another nature in beings.
Also from tantras:[870]
Outside of the precious mind there are no buddhas or sentient beings.
[When you reflect on] these sources, the expressions “dharmadhātu” and so on found in such scriptures must be explained as nondual primordial wisdom and the natural dharmakāya, because the scriptural traditions [of those texts] clearly state that.
This system of philosophical tenets is also called by the name “Madhyamaka” in the sūtras. The Sūtra on Ultimate Emptiness says:[871]
The absence of one thing in something else is [that latter thing's] emptiness of that [first thing]. What remains there [i.e., emptiness] exists there. This is the middle path, the correct, unerring view about emptiness.
There are many such statements [in the sūtras]. The Ornament of the Middle Way states:[872]
Therefore, forms and so forth are the mind itself; they are not asserted to be something external.
On the basis of [knowing that appearances are] merely mind, know that external entities do not exist.
On the basis of the mode [of reasoning explained] here, know that even that [mind] is utterly devoid of self-entity.
Nāgāmitra's Entrance to the Three Kāyas says:[873]
The “middle path” is mere cognition.
If we analyze logically, nothing else is feasible.
Ratnākarashānti's [Instructions that] Ornament the Middle Way begins:[874]
Here I will discuss the two truths by means of the logic (pramāṇa) and scriptures taught by Maitreya and Asaṅga and presented by Nāgārjuna.

The Madhyamaka of the profound Mantra [approach] is the basic state of all phenomena.
It is natural luminosity distinguished by great bliss; it is primordial wisdom, the union of clarity and emptiness, bliss and emptiness. This is taught clearly in the Five Stages, Commentaries by Bodhisattvas, and other texts.

Since the Madhyamaka found in the approach of the profound Secret Mantra places a strong emphasis on nondual primordial wisdom, it is very much in harmony with Yogāchāra-Madhyamaka. This is because [Secret Mantra] primarily ascertains and takes as its practice the nature of mind as it is taught extensively in the final wheel [of dharma], which is as follows:
The nature of mind is natural luminosity, empty of all conceptual elaborations and characteristics. Its essence is that it is dharmatā-awareness, with the quality of being reflexive awareness. From the start, it is spontaneously present as the basic state of all phenomena. This natural luminosity is distinguished by great bliss. It is emptiness (the letter e) and great compassion (the letter vam.).[875] It is primordial wisdom, which is the unification of clarity and emptiness, bliss and emptiness, and so forth. Since this subject is explained clearly and extensively in the Five Stages,[876] the Three Commentaries by Bodhisattvas,[877] and other texts, those texts should be consulted.
Here I will summarize [the key points of] a shared style of explanation.
There are two points: Madhyamaka as it relates to the generation stage and Madhyamaka as it relates to the completion stage.[878]

Madhyamaka as It Relates to the Generation Stage
This has two modes:
(1) the mode [relating to] the ground for the creation of the deities; and
(2) the mode for the created deity to arise without conceptual elaborations.
(1) The Shentong mode of explanation [applies to how the deities] are created within nondual primordial wisdom, because [it clarifies how] the seed syllables and emblems that arise within emptiness are not beyond the primordial wisdom of the dharmadhātu.
(2) The way those created deities arise without conceptual elaborations is first ascertained by [being aware of the deities'] clarity and emptiness.
Their clarity is the vivid appearance of the characteristics and attributes of the maṇḍalas of deities (the support and supported).[879] Their emptiness is that we do not cling to them in any way nor do we conceptualize them as anything, because if we fixate on the characteristics of those vivid appearances we will not transcend saṃsāra.
The mere cessation of concepts may be considered nirvāṇa, but it is not the transcendence of all flaws, because one has not reached the state of unification.[880] Therefore, we practice by unifying [clarity and emptiness]: while the appearances of the deities are vivid, they are empty; while they are empty, they appear clearly. This is the unification of clarity and emptiness. In the key instructions, it is called “the inseparability of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.” In this context, objects manifest as the unification of appearances and emptiness, and cognition as the unification of clarity and emptiness.
During the subsequent state of attainment,[881] which occurs when we arise from that [samādhi], we maintain the pride of being the deity and, therefore, we are engaged in a yoga with characteristics.

Madhyamaka as It Relates to the Completion Stage
This has two aspects:
(1) abandoning all fixations to the generation stage; and
(2) the actual completion-stage primordial wisdom.
(1) [The first aspect of the completion stage is] to gather [i.e., dissolve] the entire maṇḍala, both support and supported, using either a process of
“grasping the whole” or “successive destruction,”[882] and then rest in a state without any reference points. [During] this [phase], the Rangtong mode[883] is the best for stopping the elaborations of thoughts. However, because it is not taught that [resting without reference points] is what is experienced by reflexively aware primordial wisdom, [simply resting without reference points] is not [the practice of] the actual completion-stage primordial wisdom.
(2) The actual primordial wisdom of the completion stage [is discussed] in terms of what is to be experienced in practice, the methods that bring about that experience, and the process by which [primordial wisdom] becomes fully manifest.
• What is to be experienced is the primordial wisdom of connate great bliss, which is reflexive awareness.[884]
• The means of experience are the stages of self-blessing[885] and reflexively aware primordial wisdom.
• [The actual completion-stage primordial wisdom] is nonconceptual, unmistaken primordial wisdom, and thus it is the view free from flaws. Nevertheless, at first when [primordial wisdom] simply manifests, one has not arrived at the bhūmis of noble beings, because [wisdom at this point] is simply illustrative primordial wisdom, which points [to the actual wisdom]. This is also called the “primordial wisdom of unified bliss and emptiness” and the “connate primordial wisdom of melting bliss.”[886]
I have presented this topic from the perspective of the shared abridged tantras (laghu-tantra, bsdus rgyud). For the distinctive and profound key points that correlate to the unique view of the Kālachakra Tantra, one must look elsewhere.
It is taught that the distinction between Sūtra-Madhyamaka and Mantra-Madhyamaka is based on their differences with regard to the subjective agent, that is, the qualities of their realizations; they do not differ in terms of the object [of their realization]: freedom from conceptual elaborations.[887]

As its ground, [Madhyamaka] does not denigrate conventionalities just as they appear,
and it is free from conceptually elaborated extremes regarding the abiding nature.
Its path is to relinquish the apprehension of characteristics through profound wisdom,
and to amass merit for the sake of others out of compassion.
Its result is the perfection of the dharmakāya, a state of peace,
and that the form kāyas nonconceptually benefit others.
These [three points] contain all that is taught in
Madhyamaka.

Everything that is taught in all the Madhyamaka systems is summarized by the following: Since [all Madhyamaka systems] do not denigrate conventionalities (saṃvṛiti, kun rdzob) just as they appear, they are free from the extreme of nihilism. Since they are free from any conceptually elaborated extremes regarding the ultimate abiding nature (don dam pa'i gnas lugs), they are liberated from the extreme of permanence. This is ground Madhyamaka: the union of the two truths.
[Mādhyamikas] are free from the extreme of permanence because, owing to their wisdom, they do not apprehend phenomena in terms of characteristics [that is, they do not reify phenomena in any way]. They are free from the extreme of nihilism because, out of compassion, they amass vast stores
[of merit, which enable] them to benefit others. This is path Madhyamaka: the union of the two stores [i.e., primordial wisdom and merit].
[Mādhyamikas] are free from the extreme of permanence because they attain the dharmakāya, the state in which all conceptually elaborated characteristics have been pacified. They are free from the extreme of nihilism because their two form kāyas [that is, the sambhogakāya and nirmāṇakāya] benefit all those to be trained, both high and low, until saṃsāra is emptied. This is resultant Madhyamaka: the union of the two kāyas.
The point of all that is taught in the Madhyamaka is contained within these three [ground, path, and fruition].

[Some systems] place this indestructible way within the three collections of Buddhist teachings [of the vinaya (discipline), sutra (discourses), and abhidharma (phenomenology)].[2] [In other systems,] the indestructible way is not included within these but is classified separately. Of the different ways that do include it within the three collections, some place it solely in the sutra collection;[3] others, in all [three].
The omniscient Rangjung Dorjé[4] [as stated in his Profound Inner Reality] considers the collection of teachings of the awareness-holders[5] [to belong to] the three collections equally because it reveals in equal proportions the inner forms of discipline, discourses, and phenomenology.[6] Similarly, the master Shraddhakaravarman [in his Short Guide to the Meaning of Highest Yoga Tantra] states:[7]
An alternative position holds that the collection of teachings of the way of secret mantra is included in equal proportions within the three collections of Buddhist teachings. The rationale for this assertion is as follows: the nine branches of the Buddha's words[8] constitute the collection of teachings of the universal way (mahayana); the collection of teachings of the secret mantra way is itself included within these nine branches and teaches the three trainings [of ethics, contemplation, and wisdom]. Hence, it is considered [to belong to] the three collections.
In addition, Abhayakara's view accords with this explanation for the teachings of the indestructible way being included equally in the three collections of teachings.
Another perspective is found in the Dialogue with Subahu Tantra:[9]
In order to benefit gods, demi-gods, and humans, Various types of secret and awareness mantras, Thirty million in number, plus five hundred thousand, Were declared by the Buddha to be the awareness-holder
collection of teachings.
On this point, Shraddhakaravarman states:[10]
It is asserted that the collection of teachings of the secret mantra way does not belong to those of the three ways [of the proclaimers, solitary sages, and bodhisattvas]. Instead, it is known as the awareness-holder collection of teachings and is another bodhisattva collection. As is said,
Uphold in its entirety the sacred doctrine of the three ways [to realization]:
The outer way, the inner way, and the secret way.[11]

Furthermore, the master Buddhaguhya [in his Extensive Commentary on the Vajravidarana Tantra] states:[12]
The doctrine taught by the supreme Buddha
Forms four collections: discourses, discipline,
Phenomenology, and the awareness-holder teachings.
Thus, secret mantra is considered to be a fourth collection, that of the awareness-holder. This is due to secret mantra's marked superiority over the teach
ings of the outer way of characteristics[13] in that it is a scriptural tradition that reveals vast and profound means of swiftly gaining the resultant state of awareness-holder[14] during this life or a future one.
Some scholars contend that all twelve branches of the Buddha's words[15] must be included within the three collections. This represents the perspective of the common way [i.e., the individual way]. However, in [the context of] the universal way, that is not necessarily so, as stated in Chandrakirti's Seventy Verses on the [Triple] Refuge:[16]
According to the viewpoint of the proclaimers
There are three collections of teachings.
In the context of the bodhisattvas' [doctrine],
This is not necessarily the case.
and:[17]
From the perspective of the bodhisattvas
There are seven collections of teachings:
The bodhisattvas' collection of teachings,
The collection of the awareness-holders,[18]
The discourses, phenomenology, discipline,
Extensive teachings, and stories of the Buddha's previous lives.
These seven collections of teachings...
Thus, the mantra collection of teachings is asserted to be a separate collection.

Tantra has many different names. It is called the “mantra collection of teachings” and the “way of mantra” since it yields powers through the use of
mantras and mudras; and the “awareness-holder collection of teachings” since the deity, mantra, and pristine awareness of great bliss are all [of the nature of] awareness, and it is by these profound means that awareness is “grasped.”
According to an alternative perspective, tantra is the “way of the awareness-holder” because its collection of mantric practices leads to the attainment of the resultant state of awareness-holder within this same life; and the “indestructible way” since the three indestructible states [of awakened body, speech, and mind] are actualized through the indestructible path of the indivisibility of method and wisdom.
Tantra uses the causes for the attainment of full enlightenment, such as the thirty-seven factors conducive to awakening,[19] as means of cultivating the path. Hence, it is designated as “causal way” in terms of [the way of] characteristics. Moreover, tantra uses on the path, right from the present time, the forms of the result [awakening], such as the celestial palace, deities, and their sense enjoyments. Hence, it is designated as “resultant way” in terms of the mantra [way].
Another perspective is this: In tantra, the emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects[20] serves as the cause [of immutable bliss]. This emptiness is the principal teaching of the way of the perfections. Hence, tantra is designated as “causal way” in terms of that way. Moreover, immutable great bliss abides in the nature of the result [produced by the emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects]. This immutable bliss is the principal teaching of the mantra way. Hence, tantra is designated as “resultant way” in terms of the mantra way.
Other synonyms include the “way of method” because it has greater and more numerous techniques than the way of the perfections; “secret way” since it must be hidden from proclaimers and others who are not suitable recipients; and “continuum” because it is unceasingly present throughout the ground, path, and result.
Mantras and tantras [created] by worldly beings are ordinary mantra and tantra and therefore not included here within the indestructible way, or within its collection of teachings.

The nature of the way of mantra is to teach principally the path of application of awareness mantras[21] and the ensuing result. Therefore, if one cultivates the path through mantra, one must certainly do so relying on mantra and tantra application.[22]

Tantra in the mantra way may be divided into two general categories: the mundane way and the supramundane way. These differ in that the former is a nominal mantra way because its culmination is not a stable one; it does not represent definite assurance; and its time and place are ephemeral. The latter, the supramundane mantra, is the authentic way because it is endowed with characteristics opposite to those of the mundane way.
Tantra of the mundane way category is of three types: the mundane mantra per se; the mantra that leads to definite assurance; and the mantra that is the support for the mind.
The first, the mundane mantra way per se, was created by Maheshvara, anchorites, gods, elemental spirits, secretive yakshas,[23] mantric adepts, and other ordinary beings. This is the actual mundane way. The second is the mundane mantra way that leads to definite assurance—that of the states of awareness-holders of the desire and form realms,[24] and the formless states which are highest within the three realms—reached through application of mantras. [This way] is derived from the awareness-holder collection of teachings. The third is the mundane way as the support for the mind [of higher paths][25] consisting in the tantric path of accumulation and path of preparation.[26]
The latter two types belong also to the supramundane category, and all of the tantras that transmit these teachings belong to the collection of teachings of the supramundane category. Even tantras created by exalted beings through their own inspiration do indeed belong to the supramundane category. Those tantras are not, however, designated [part of] the collection of teachings of the supramundane category.

What distinguishes the mantra way from the way of sutra? Their ultimate result or goal—dynamic perfect peace27—is identical. However, the mantra way is distinctive due to the clarity of its methods, the abundance of these methods, and the freedom from hardships in the practice of them.
To explain, the way of mantra is one of clarity in its methods, such as meditation on the deity and mantra recitation, which have been preceded by the conferral of initiation as entrance to the [tantric] path.
Mantra offers not only clear methods, but also an abundance of them, not simply one method. This is due to there being an infinity of approaches within the different sets of tantra— action, conduct, and so forth—appropriate to the level of the practitioner's faculties.
The sutra way as well could be considered to have numerous methods, but it is a path that necessitates undergoing hardships such as asceticism and [the observance of] vows and is therefore a difficult one. In contrast, the methods of the mantra way, when applied according to one's own inclinations, lead to the attainment of bliss by means of bliss. Thus, [mantra] is superior in that it is a path travelled with little difficulty, free of hardship.
If tantric methods are so clear, abundant, and free from hardship, why did the Buddha not reveal [the way of mantra] to all his followers? [The answer is that] the Buddha did not teach [simply] because he possessed the knowledge, but imparted teachings suited to [the disciples'] faculties.
Students who would be qualified to receive instructions on the mantra way are the sharpest of the sharp, while someone suited to being taught the way of the perfections is of low faculties compared to a practitioner of mantra, and thus not worthy of being a student of the mantra way. In the course of time, however, everyone without exception will qualify to be a practitioner of mantra, according to the logic expressed in the words of [Dharmakirti's] Treatise on Valid Cognition, which states:[28]
Since [the inference] is indirectly related To the object....[29]
Similarly, Tripitakamala's Lamp of the Three Modes states:[30]
Though the aim is identical, the way of mantra Is superior by virtue of being clear, Abundant in methods, devoid of hardships, And intended for persons of sharp faculties.[31]

Other distinctions between mantra and sutra are specified by the master Jnanashri [in his Dispelling the Two Extremes in the Indestructible Way]:[32]
Tantra is superior by virtue of its eleven forms of skillful methods: the methods that rely on unsurpassable scriptures; unsurpassable practice; unsurpassable pristine awareness; and unsurpassable diligence; the power to uplift all of one's followers; the methods to bless [transform] emotional afflictions; to swiftly impart blessing; to swiftly attain liberation; to overcome emotional afflictions; the methods of unsurpassable disposition; and unsurpassable conduct.[33]
Indrabhuti maintains that mantra's distinctiveness lies in seven special features: the teacher, the recipient [of the teachings], rituals, activations, pledges, views, and conduct.[34] The master Buddhajnanapada states:[35]
The way of mantra is extraordinary in three aspects: practitioner, path, and result.
Furthermore, the master Shantipa [in his Presentation of the Three Ways] states that the way of mantra and that of the perfections do not differ in terms of ultimate truth. The two ways differ, however, in that the relative truth has comparatively greater depth and vastness in the mantra way. He explains:[36]
Its focus is vast in that whatever appears is meditated upon as divine. Its support is vast because exceptional blessing occurs when one conscientiously upholds the pledges prescribed by the buddhas of the three times. Its conduct is vast, being modelled on the altruistic activities of buddhas and bodhisattvas and their purificatory blessing of realms.[37]
The ways followed by centrists and experientialists, as well as by proclaimers and solitary sages, lack these three special features of focus, support, and conduct. Therefore, centrists and experientialists can attain awakening only after three inestimably long aeons; and proclaimers and solitary sages, only after four. Because mantra does have these special features, its practitioners can attain awakening in a short time. Thus, mantra is profoundly different.

On this subject, Atisha, in his Summation of Pledges, states:[38]
Mantra is superior to all other ways, greater than even the universal way. In answer to why this is so, the venerable Nagarjuna[39] describes seven features that distinguish it:
Mantra bears the seal of Samantabhadra in that everything is understood to be the dimension of reality.[40] It is possessed of blessing, being made the object of veneration by the oathbound great worldly gods and their host of attendants. It leads to the swift attainment of powers since the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the three times are aware [of the practitioner] and impart their blessings. It provides relief and freedom from the perils of cyclic existence and the lower forms of life since its sphere of experience is identical to that of the joyful ones. It allows no hindrances whatsoever since a [mantric] practitioner possesses an indestructible mind of awakening, with body, speech, and mind being undifferentiated from those of a buddha. Its pledges are never violated due to the practitioner's conviction in the intrinsic purity of all outer and inner phenomena. Should a violation occur, the pledge is naturally restored. These are the distinctions of the mantra way.
As to the general distinction between the two ways, the mantra and the perfections have the same object: [emptiness] which transcends concepts. The difference lies in the subject [that apprehends emptiness]. In mantra, the subject is [the mind of] great bliss used as method. The majority [of Indian scholars] agree on this point. At the same time, there seem to be many different specifications of the distinctions between the two that have been posited by various masters.[41]

</d>
<d e="2">
Any of the different specifications based on those perspectives is certainly acceptable. The intrepid master Karma Trinlé[42] and others, encapsulating those various viewpoints, set forth three features that distinguish mantra from the perfections: the individual who will be its practitioner; the path to be travelled; and the result or goal.
First, the practitioner of mantra is distinguished by three qualifications: sharpness of faculties in that he or she enters a path that swiftly yields its result; a mental continuum ripened by the appropriate initiation; and [conscientiousness in] safeguarding the pledges from their root and branch downfalls. A mantra practitioner must definitely possess these three qualifications, whereas this is not required of followers of other ways.
Second, the path of mantra is distinguished in three ways: its methods are abundant; they are clear; and they are free from hardships.
As to the first, its abundance of methods, mantra does not dispense with any of the different methods taught in the way of the perfections, such as the awakening mind and the six perfections. In addition to those methods, mantra sets forth techniques connected to the four sets of tantra that are far more numerous and profound than those of the perfections. These include ways to gain inconceivable powers through the various practices of an infinite [number] of deity yogas: familiarization with, and attainment of, [the state of the deity], implementation of activations, methods to elicit results if these are not forthcoming, and activities to enhance realizations.[43]
The second, the clarity of its methods, is due to these methods being not in the least obscure. Every aspect of practice—the object of familiarization [i.e., the deity], the practitioner of familiarization, the forms of familiarization, recitation [of mantras], food offerings, fire-offering rituals, and so forth—is explained in detail and with utmost clarity.
The third, freedom from hardships in [the practice of ] the methods, is because the mantra way produces its result within one lifetime or in just a few lifetimes while practice of the sutra way leads to accomplishment only after such periods of time as three inestimably long aeons.
Concerning the third feature, that of the goal or result of mantra, a direct result will be distinguished according to the particular quality of its direct cause. The culmination of the path of training in the way of the perfections gives rise to none other than the mantric path of training in the mind of its practitioner.[44] Therefore, the ultimate direct result of the perfections is not full awakening. The culmination of all aspects of the path of training in the mantra way directly yields the result of full awakening. That being the case, the fully awakened state is the direct result solely of the culmination of the mantric path of training since full awakening is the ultimate [state] of the path of mantra: union beyond training.[45]
This completes Karma Trinlé's encapsulation of the distinctions between sutra and tantra.

A general classification based on sutra and tantra content yields four categories: sutra, tantra, both sutra and tantra, and neither sutra nor tantra. The sutra category largely includes such texts as the increasing-by-one scriptures class.[46] The tantra category includes the application of the garuda class of scriptures and others.[47] The both-sutra-and-tantra category comprises the mantra collection of teachings. The neither-sutra-nor-tantra category includes [treatises on] sophistic debates, and similar works.
Of these, the mantra collection of teachings, known as “that which uses the result in the path” because it applies the specialty of deity yoga, should alone be considered as endowed with the distinctive features explained above. This discussion on the four categories is an ancillary topic.

Of all the distinctions between sutra and mantra that have been drawn by Tibetan masters, whatever their number, the main ones are described in the oral teachings of the great adept Buddhagupta.[48] These are expressed by the venerable master of Jonang [Taranata] in this way:[49]
Due to its swiftness, bliss, and skillful methods, it is said to be
superior.
To expand on this, mantra is superior to sutra in swiftness. It is swift in that [through mantra], enlightenment is achieved in the time [period] of the present lifetime or within seven lifetimes, and so forth. Furthermore, it is swift by virtue of the following five reasons: the presence of merits acquired through special [tantric] rituals whereby deities actually receive and enjoy offerings made to them;[50] the creation, through the power of mantras, of merits equal to the grains of sand in the Ganges River through just a single “water-drop” [of practice]; the manifest [application of] contemplation whereby [even] beginners stop impure appearances and create pure realms; the ripening of sentient beings by means of each of the single features of mantra or contemplation (these special reasons apply even to someone who has merely embarked on the way of mantra); and the wisdom that, through the principles of both relative and ultimate truth, focuses upon the aspect of the result [of awakening], the form of which is the sphere of experience of contemplation (these are present from the beginning until the end [of the mantra way]).
Mantra is superior to sutra in bliss, which means the absence of any coarse physical or mental feelings. There are four [sources of] bliss: the attainment of a body possessed of six fortunes;[51] the development of many miraculous powers and contemplations; the buddhas' manifest presence [near the practitioner] due to the power of mantras; and the fulfillment of all the wishes of beings by means of mantra and tantra application.[52]
Mantra is superior to sutra by virtue of its skillful methods, which are applied to the three trainings [of ethics, contemplation, and wisdom], as well as to all spheres of experience. Specifically, the ethics of mantra delights the deities, being equal to that of awareness-holders. Contemplation in the mantra way is connected to a superior sphere of experience. The wisdom of mantra is distinguished by its profundity and vastness both in common and extraordinary [aspects], as are the other two trainings. Furthermore, the skillful methods of deity and mantra are applied to all spheres of experience. Hence, mantra is said to be extraordinary.

<d e="2">
From an etymological perspective, the meaning of the [Sanskrit] term mantra is explained as follows: man [the first syllable] means “mind” and traya, “to protect,” hence “mantra” (sngags), since it protects the mind from conceptual objectification. The Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra states:[54]
Whatever mind arises in dependence on The sense powers and their objects: That mind is referred to as “man” And “tra” means that which protects it.
Whatever vows and pledges are considered To be completely free from worldly conduct And safeguarded by all of the vajras: Those are referred to as “mantric conduct.”[55]
From the perspective of a direct translation, mantra means “secret utterance” because it is accomplished with secrecy and in concealment; or, from another perspective, because it cannot be understood by those unqualified to be its practitioners. Thus, it is called “secret mantra” (gsang sngags). Accordingly, the master Shraddhakaravarman's Short Guide to the Meaning of Highest Yoga Tantra explains:[56]
It is secret because its practices are accomplished with secrecy and in concealment, or because it cannot be understood by unqualified persons.

There are three forms of mantra [practice], the best, the lesser, and the secondary. The essence of the best form is great bliss; that of the lesser, the pride of being the deity; and that of the secondary, mere mantric rituals and applications. The first is exemplified by the phase of completion; the second, by the phase of generation; and the third, by the means for accomplishing minor activations.[57]
The best and lesser forms represent the authentic mantra way because they pertain to the principles, or vows, of the mantra way and the awareness-holder. The latter is merely nominal.
Alternatively, seven forms of mantra are explained: the complete path, the partial one, the special one, initial bliss, almost complete great bliss, some measure of great bliss, and slight great bliss. All these forms are indeed designated as great bliss, and since this great bliss is the complete path itself, these do not need to be distinguished as separate [forms].

How does one differentiate between mantra and tantra? All aspects of secret mantra and the pristine awareness of great bliss are referred to as mantra.
Applications of secret mantra (the collections of [rituals] for activations and powers) are known as tantra. However, the tantras (continuums) of the ground, path, and result (the content of mantra), as well as the collection of teachings that express and expound [the meaning of mantra], are referred to as tantra. Thus, there are contexts in which no distinction is made between mantra and tantra.

<d e="2">
In answer to how many divisions exist within the tantric [system] of the secret mantra way, there are ways of dividing tantra into two sets (outer and inner) right up to a division into seven.
First, reference to the division into two sets is found in the Indestructible Essence Ornament Tantra:[1]
The divisions of tantra are to be understood By knowing its distinction into outer and inner.
Moreover, the master Abhayakara states:
Hold in your heart the outer and inner tantras of Vajradhara
That have been transmitted in a successive lineage.
The Teacher expanded methods such as mandala
Into two separate sets of tantra.
It is clear from his Awn of Esoteric Instructions that Abhayakara maintains that, of the two sets of tantra spoken of, outer and inner, outer tantra refers to action and conduct tantras, and inner, to the yoga and highest yoga tantras.
The master Buddhaguhya presents an alternative viewpoint: the twofold division of tantra refers to action tantra and yoga tantra. Action tantra comprises the Trisamayavyuha and other tantras up to and including the Vairochanabhisambodhi; and yoga tantra, the Summation of Essential Principles and other tantras up to and including the Guhyasamaja. These two sets are also called outer and inner. Buddhaguhya states:
Two sets of tantra, the outer and the inner, are explained.
Certain scholars of Tibet differentiate these two sets of tantra on the basis of six factors, namely, teacher, place [where the tantra was taught], students, articles for offering, path, and essential principles.[2]
The rationale for the division into outer tantra and inner tantra is that conduct tantra and the tantra below emphasize ablution and other outer physical and verbal activities, and are therefore considered outer tantras. Yoga tantra and the tantra above emphasize contemplation and other inner (mental) practices, and are therefore included within the inner set. This accounts for the division of tantra into two sets.

Reference to the division of tantra into three sets is found in the Indestructible Essence Ornament Tantra:[3]
Action tantra, tantra of both, and yoga tantra
Which were spoken expressly are not like that.
Buddhaguhya, Lilavajra, and Anandagarbha[4] all explain that tantra has the three divisions of action, conduct (or tantra of both), and yoga tantra. The rationale is that yoga and great yoga tantras are alike in their emphasis on contemplation, which is an inner practice, and are therefore subsumed under yoga tantra. This accounts for the division of tantra into three sets.
[Gunabhadra's] Indestructible Nectar Commentary[5] presents an alternative way to divide tantra into three sets:
Action, union (or yoga tantra), and secret tantra...
Reference to the division of tantra into four sets is found in the Indestructible Tent:[6]
Action tantra is for those of lesser [faculties]; Yoga without action, for those with greater [faculties]; Yoga tantra, for superior sentient beings And highest yoga tantra, for those even greater.
In addition, [Shraddhakaravarman's] Short Guide to the Meaning of Highest Yoga Tantra states:[7]
There are four entrances to the resultant indestructible way of secret mantra. These are generally known as action tantra, conduct tantra, yoga tantra, and highest yoga tantra.
Similar statements are found in most tantras and commentaries. Essentially the same way of division occasionally appears under a number of different names. The Samputa Tantra [for example] states:[8]
The four [sexual pleasures of ] laughing, gazing,
Holding hands, and union are contained in the four tantras,
Compared to the way of worms [in wood].[9]
A similar reference is found in [Pundarika's] Stainless Light.[10] The rationale for this [division] will be discussed below.

Reference to the division of tantra into five is found in the Compendium on the Indestructible Pristine Awareness [Tantra]:[11]
O Blessed One, what is the extent of the yoga tantra, tantra of both, conduct tantra, action tantra, and skills tantra?
The rationale for this division is as follows: The basis for the division is action tantra in general, which is split into two. Action tantras that are concerned with attainment principally of the supreme power [awakening] are collectively designated as “action tantra.” Action tantras concerned with the attainment principally of ordinary powers[12] are collectively designated as “skills tantra.” Although “tantra of both” generally refers to conduct tantra, Shraddhakaravarman considers yoga tantra to be the tantra of both since, in yoga tantra, inner contemplative yoga and outer activity both serve as auxiliaries to contemplation. Accordingly, here yoga tantra is given the designation of “tantra of both,” and the name “yoga tantra” is applied to the highest yoga tantra. This accounts for the division of tantra into five sets. This particular way of division of tantra is the one adhered to by Nagarjuna and other masters.
The patriarchs of the Sakya school[13] place what is referred to as the “sutra skills tantra” into a set separate from action tantra. All of the sutra teachings that are concerned with retention mantras (dharani) and related rites, the Blue Beryl Light Discourse and its Dharani,[14] for example, constitute this set.
An alternative way of dividing tantra into five sets has as its source the Ocean of Sky-Farers Tantra, as well as Shantipa's Presentation of the Three Ways,[15] and other works. Here, the five sets are action tantra, conduct tantra, yoga tantra, great yoga tantra, and highest great yoga tantra. Great yoga tantra refers to the highest father tantra; and highest great yoga tantra, the highest mother tantra.

A division of tantra into six sets places the skills tantra in a set separate from action tantra, and splits yoga tantra into two, father yoga tantra and mother yoga tantra. The basis for this way of division is the Indestructible Tent:[16]
The yogini tantra is known as the sixth tantra.
Another way of dividing tantra into six is explained in [Tripitakamala's] Lamp of the Three Modes.[17] The six are action tantra, root tantra, conduct tantra, yoga tantra, high yoga tantra, and highest yoga tantra. In this system, action tantra is subdivided: tantras that emphasize outer activity are considered action tantra; and those that do not, root tantra. As in the previous [Ocean of Sky-Farers Tantra's] way of division, the father tantra and mother tantra are considered to be high yoga tantra and highest yoga tantra, respectively. This accounts for the division of tantra into six sets.
Reference to the division into seven sets is found in Lord Atisha's Commentary on the Lamp for the Path:[18]
The names action tantra, conduct tantra, and so on, refer to action
tantra, conduct tantra, skills tantra, tantra of both, yoga tantra,
great yoga tantra, and highest yoga tantra.
The rationale for this way of dividing tantra is that the action and conduct tantras that have as their major subject-matter the minor rites performed to gain [powers of] the pills, eye-elixir, and so on, are considered to be of a separate set, skills tantra. Hence, the Compendium of Skills and other tantras are considered as skills tantra.[19] Tantras that have components of both conduct tantra (and the tantra set below) and the yoga tantra, such as the Net of Magical Manifestation and the Lord of the Lotus Dancers, are considered to be the tantra of both.[20] Father tantra and mother tantra are considered to be the great yoga tantra and highest yoga tantra, respectively.[21] This accounts for the division of tantra into seven sets. In addition, there are many ways in which further subdivision of these sets is asserted.

Of those [different ways of division], the one well known as “the four sets of tantra” is found in the words of the majority of Indian and Tibetan tantric masters. The rationale for the division of tantra in this way [is explained as follows]:
Four sets of tantra were taught in consideration of the four different kinds of recipients of the teachings. A person whose inclination is [the performing of] many outer actions, such as ablution, cleanliness, and so on, is the intended practitioner of action tantra. Someone who is interested in essential reality and who prefers few outer rites is the intended practitioner of conduct tantra. One who considers many outer rites to be a source of distraction and is interested solely in meditation on essential reality is the intended practitioner of yoga tantra. A person interested in enjoying everything in the state of pristine awareness wherein method and wisdom are inseparable is the intended practitioner of highest yoga tantra.
Additionally, the four sets of tantra were taught in order to convert four kinds of followers of mistaken paths. By presenting the tantric teachings in accordance with the emotional patterns particular to these four kinds, individuals would be uplifted spiritually and led to the true path. To convert the devotees of Shiva who are dominated by desire, the highest yoga tantra was taught. To convert the devotees of Vishnu who are dominated by aversion, conduct tantra was taught. To convert the devotees of Brahma who are dominated by delusion, action tantra was taught. To convert persons with uncertain emotional patterns who accept the tenets of whichever of the three [Hindu religious trends] they come in contact with, yoga tantra was taught. Nagarjuna, Subhutipalita, [Anandagarbha,] and other masters are known to have asserted this rationale as found in the Summation of Essential Principles.[22]

Moreover, tantra was taught in four sets to accommodate recipients who are members of the four castes, or who share their traits: Brahmins dominated by delusion who practice the doctrine of Brahma and who delight in a path involving cleanliness, recitation [of mantras] and liturgy, fire-offering rituals, and austerity; members of the merchant caste, dominated by pride, who practice the doctrine of the demi-gods and who delight in physical, verbal, and mental disciplines; members of the royal caste, [also dominated by pride,] who follow the doctrine of the gods and who are incapable of [leading] an austere life, indulging instead in the many pleasures of court life, and who delight in exercising dominion over their kingdoms through sealed edicts; and persons belonging to the menial caste, dominated by both anger and desire, who practice sexual union and ritual killing in the cults of Maheshvara and other deities, and delight in engaging in various base acts, such as ingesting feces and urine, without any notions of purity and impurity. The four sets, action tantra, and so on, were taught for practitioners who are members of these four castes, respectively, principally to spiritually nurture those who among them are of superior faculties. Accordingly, the Marvellous Cemetery [Ornament] states:[23]
To convert the brahmin caste, the merchant caste,
The royal caste, and the menial caste or outcastes,
Tantra was presented in four parts:
Action, conduct, yoga, and highest yoga.
Furthermore, tantra's division into four sets takes into consideration the faculties [of the recipients]. Action tantra was taught for those of low faculties; conduct tantra, for the average; yoga tantra, for the sharp; and highest yoga tantra, for the very sharp. This is stated in the Indestructible Tent.
Another consideration in tantra's fourfold division is the object of purification, the emotional afflictions, which may be slight, moderate, strong, and exceedingly strong in intensity. Accordingly, the Bright Lamp states:
Action tantra is intended for the type of person with major or average delusion; conduct tantra, minimal delusion; yoga tantra, minimal or moderate desire, aversion, and delusion; higher yoga tantra, intense desire, aversion, and delusion; and yogini tantra, the most intense desire, aversion, and delusion.

The higher yoga tantra and yogini tantra mentioned in this citation are both highest yoga tantra, and the emotional afflictions to be purified all belong to the category of exceedingly strong afflictions. Thus, there are actually just four [sets] being referred to.
Furthermore, division into four sets is based on four forms of desire to be purified. These four desires which are experienced in the desire realm are mentioned in [Vasubandhu's] Treasury [of Phenomenology]:[24]
Sexual satisfaction is gained through intercourse,
Holding hands, laughter, and gazing [at one's partner].
To explain, gods of the desire realm in the heaven of Mastery over Others' Creations experience sexual desire that is satisfied by gazing at the partner; gods in Enjoying Creations, by laughing; gods in Joyful and Free from Conflict, by holding hands; gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-three and below, as well as men and animals,[25] by sexual intercourse. As remedies for sexual desire, the four sets of tantra were taught, each set providing a deity yoga that uses one of these particular forms of desire in the path.[26]
Tantra's division is posited in a [fourfold] order that also reflects the three aspects of the path, namely, the [different types of] view, meditation, and conduct that serve as purificatory means. The views are represented by the four major trends of Buddhist philosophy [that of the analysts, traditionists, idealists, and centrists] to which the action tantras and the other [three] tantras respectively correspond.[27]
The meditations comprise four deity yogas, with distinctions in the meditations on the deity [according to the tantra]: Action tantra involves meditation on an external deity only; conduct tantra, in addition, involves meditation on an inner, naturally present deity;[28] yoga tantra, meditation on a deity that is the essence of oneself [as the deity] inseparable from [the external deity] in front; and the highest yoga tantra, meditation on the deity [as for yoga tantra] based on the knowledge that oneself [as the deity] and [the external deity in] front are inseparable in every respect.

The types of conduct comprise different degrees of physical, verbal, and mental [inner] activity. Conduct involving mainly engagement in physical and verbal activity is considered to be action tantra; equal proportions of engagement in physical and verbal activity and inner contemplation, conduct tantra; engagement principally in inner contemplation, yoga tantra; and engagement principally in pristine awareness, highest yoga tantra.
As pointed out in Kalachakra, the division of tantra into four sets takes into consideration the purified aspect of the four states of waking, dream, deep sleep, and sexual union;[29] the four eras, which refers to the era of completeness, the era of three quarters, the era of two quarters, and the era of turmoil; and the four periods of the day and night.[30] There are yet other bases for the fourfold division.
Thus, tantra has been taught in consideration of various factors, the recipients [of the teachings], and so forth, and therefore, [the division of tantra into] the “four sets of tantra” is widely accepted. As well, the four sets represent demarcations in sequence, caliber, and subtlety. Accordingly, the tantras state:
Based on the former, the latter arises.
Because of levels from inferior to superior,
And from the gross to the subtle...
The statement “Based on the former, the latter arises” is explained in [Hevajra Tantra] Two Examinations:[31]
Teach the student the analysts' philosophy
And then the traditionists' philosophy.
After that, teach the experientialists'.
Following that, teach the central way.
Once all methods of mantra are known,
Teach [the tantra of ] Hevajra.
Thus, one should understand that just as the four philosophies are learned sequentially, the four sets of tantra which nurture followers of these philosophies are also practiced in sequence. The nondual highest tantra should be cultivated at the end of [the training in] the two highest tantras, that of method [father] and that of wisdom [mother].

The words “inferior to superior” are explained in the Indestructible Tent:[32]
Action tantra is for those of lesser [faculties];
[Yoga without action, for those with greater faculties;
Yoga tantra, for superior sentient beings
And highest yoga tantra, for those even greater.]
The phrase “gross to the subtle” is understood from these words of the tantra:
More secret than the secret, extremely secret, supremely secret...
The distinctive features particular to each of the four sets of tantra, such as the persons who are recipients [of the teachings], the initiations that constitute the entrances to the path, and so forth, will be [discussed] in detail below. What follow are the main features in a concise form:
The distinctive features of action tantra are principally the physical performance of mudras whereby the practitioner swiftly accomplishes an awakened body; the verbal recitation of mantras to swiftly accomplish awakened speech; and inner meditation on the deity, to swiftly accomplish awakened mind and qualities.
The distinctive features of conduct tantra are principally the viewing of one's body as the body of a perfect buddha, whereby the blessing of awakened body swiftly enters [one's being]; viewing one's speech as mantra, whereby the blessing of awakened speech swiftly enters; viewing one's own mind as pristine awareness, whereby the blessing of awakened mind is swiftly received; and other features. [These blessings are received] because, by using in the path [the practice of ] imagining oneself as a buddha, awakened qualities are easily developed, and by using the result [of awakening] in the path, the two accumulations [of merit and pristine awareness] are swiftly brought to perfection. Furthermore, while methods that [require] complex preparations such as veneration of depictions of deities on cloth do perfect the two accumulations, making offerings to oneself [as the deity] and similar methods are performed more easily, and certainly bring about the perfection of the accumulations.
The distinctive features of yoga tantra are principally the sealing of one's body with the great seal of the body [of the deity]; the sealing of one's speech with the doctrine seal of the [deity's] speech; the sealing of one's mind with the pledge seal of the [deity's] mind; and the sealing of one's actions with the seal of the [deity's] activity,[33] all of which lead to the practitioner's swift achievement of [the state of] all the transcendent ones.
The distinctive features of highest yoga tantra are principally its clarity in the profound meaning of the phase of completion; its infinity of profound methods in the phase of generation; its absence of hardships in the achievement of awakening through the practice of these two [phases]; and its being intended for persons of exceptionally sharp faculties by virtue of these features. Consequently, the yogas of the two phases [of generation and completion] are distinctive features of highest yoga tantra only, not to be found in the other tantra sets. This is the case because other tantras do not set forth a path that corresponds to the complete process of birth in cyclic existence, nor do they set forth a path of training that brings to perfection the authentic luminous clarity of death.[34]

Action tantra is so named because one engages in mantric practice based on teachings that emphasize outer conduct such as ablution, cleanliness, and purity.
The essence of action tantra is as stated in the Compendium on the Indestructible Pristine Awareness Tantra:[1]
To view [the profound truth] with apprehension and to observe utmost cleanliness; to be without the supreme bliss of the pristine awareness being; to lack the pride of oneself as the deity; not to be a receptacle for what is sublime; and due to that shortcoming, to be conditioned by concepts about [the purity and impurity of] things; to train thoroughly [in rituals of ablution, etc.] and thereby practice [deity yoga]: these [elements] are found in action tantra.
To practice in order to develop mastery of the eight great powers—mantra, medicine, fire-offering ritual, powder, eye-salve, swiftness of foot, and so forth2—this [element] is found in skills tantra.
To provide some clarification of those points, the following elements are said to apply to, or be contained within, action tantra: to view the profound truth with fear and apprehension[3] due to an inferior intellect and to observe utmost cleanliness and purity, ablution, asceticism, and so forth; to not [develop] the pride of being the deity since there is no generation of oneself as the pledge deity;[4] to be without the supreme bliss of the pristine awareness deity since the pristine awareness deity has not been invoked to merge into the pledge deity; not to be a receptacle for the sublime [teachings][5] since one is unqualified to receive teachings on what is sublime and extraordinary, the deep meanings that were spoken with specific intention; and due to the shortcoming of being unable to fathom the sublime, being conditioned by concepts about the purity or impurity of things, to train thoroughly in [rituals of ] ablution, and so forth, and thereby to practice [deity yoga] in a subject-to-lord relationship with the deity.[6]
Skills tantra is to practice by means of asceticism, recitation [of mantra and liturgy], and so on, in order to develop mastery of the eight great mundane powers, such as [the power of] mantra and eye-salve. (Skills tantra is an offshoot of action tantra; thus, it is included within the category of action tantra and should be considered one with it.)

Action tantra may be divided into what are known as the six families (or “six approaches”), three supramundane families and three mundane ones. The supramundane families are the transcendent family, the lotus family, and the vajra family. The mundane families are the jewel [wealthy] family, the family of playing with five dice [or prosperity], and the family of ordinary worldlings.[7]
Tantras that exemplify the [three supramundane] families are the tantra of Trisamayavyuha, lord of the transcendent family, and tantras of [other] buddhas; the tantra of Avalokiteshvara, lord of the lotus family; and the tantra of Vajrapani, lord of the vajra family. Each has its own divisions of [tantras of] the lord of the family, master, mother, ushnisha [class of deities], male and female wrathful deities, male and female messengers, and male and female servants.[8]
The wealthy family [tantras] are those taught by the yaksha Manibhadra; the family of playing with five dice [or prosperity] [tantras], taught by the yaksha Panchika, [his wife] Mekhala, Nandikaraputra, and others; and the ordinary worldlings family [tantras], taught by Brahma, Maheshvara, Vishnu, Garuda, Sun, Moon, and countless other gods.
The six families taken collectively are contained within the categories of the three supramundane families. [Buddhaguhya's] Commentarial Notes Epitomizing the Dialogue with Subahu Tantra states:[9]
The wealthy family is contained within the lotus family. The prosperity family is contained within the vajra family. One should know that the family of worldlings is generally included under these two.
Any not included within these does not arise from the blessing of the Transcendent One and has not been born into the family of transcendent ones as have bodhisattvas who abide on stages [of awakening]. They are therefore designated “dependent on the transcendent family.” On this point, the [Subahu] Tantra states:[10]
Moreover, some do not belong here But are wanderers who depend on the Joyful One.
That being the case, it would seem that those who were tamed by the Buddha and who abide by pledges are included within the three [supramundane] families.
The above citation implicitly points out that even the ordinary mundane families known as “wanderers” are included within the transcendent family because they are “dependent on the transcendent family.” Thus, all six families are included within the three supramundane families.
All six families are included as well in the two categories of secret mantra and awareness mantra. [Buddhaguhya's] Commentary on the Dhyanottara Tantra states:[11]
Awareness mantra comprises the female deity, her shape, the utterances associated with her method, and seals [mudras, insignia,] and so on. The opposite to that, [the male deity, and so on,] is characteristic of secret mantra.[12]

The Essence of Pristine Awareness states:[13]
It is widely known that in action tantra There are the water and crown initiations.
This citation indicates that, as initiations serving as entrances to action tantra, the water and diadem are widely held to be the only two. These two initiations serve to ripen [the student's mind] in that the water initiation establishes the potential for [the attainment of ] the reality dimension of awakening, and the diadem initiation, the form dimension. Concerning the water initiation, the Manjushri Root Tantra states:[14]
Each [student] should be conferred the initiation five [times]
according to the desired method.
Here it is specified that the water initiation is given five times: [first, with] the vase [dedicated to all beings] at the entrance outside the mandala; [second, with] the vase [dedicated] to all deities in the second mandala; [third, with] the vase [dedicated] to proclaimers and solitary sages in the third mandala; [fourth, with] the vase [dedicated] to bodhisattvas; and [fifth, with] the victory vase [dedicated] to buddhas. Such procedure is clearly mentioned in [the tantras of ] all the [other] families as well.[15] For the diadem initiation, [use of ] a crown is not specified. It is explained, however, that the act of touching the crown of the head [of the student] with the hands clasped in the mudra [representing the diadem] is to confer the initiation.
In that way, the water and diadem initiations, which form the main part [of an action tantra initiation], are received, after which the pledges of action tantra must be observed. The actual ripening process is contained in that alone. However, when subdivided to serve specific purposes, there are four parts to the conferral of initiation, as explained in the General Tantra:[16] the water and diadem initiations to gain the status of vajra master in the action tantra's own system; [the appended] vajra student initiation to bestow transmission of the mantra (of the deity on which the flower has fallen17) in order to gain power from awareness mantras; the initiation of protection through [purificatory] ablution, the activity to overcome negative influences and to pacify obstacles; and the initiation of the eight auspicious substances[18] to increase wealth.
The vajra master initiation in the action tantra's own system is accomplished by the water and diadem initiations in themselves. Nevertheless, as stated in the General Tantra, the initiation is properly accomplished by conferring, in addition to those two, the authorization to draw and teach mandala. The same tantra also states that through receiving initiation into a mandala of the transcendent family, one becomes a vajra master of all the three families; through the Avalokiteshvara initiation [of the lotus family], a vajra master of the lotus and vajra families; and through the Vajrapani initiation [of the vajra family], a vajra master of just that family. In action tantra, the mandala used for the conferral of an initiation is said to be exclusively one of colored powders.

It is said:
The root [of attainment] is to observe one's pledges.
While this point is mentioned incidentally, the way one assumes pledges is explained as follows: The occasion for assuming pledges is, as stated in the Trisamayavyuha Tantra, at the conclusion of the preparatory ritual [of an initiation]. The procedure for assuming them is as described in the same tantra:[19]
One begins with the supplication, “Buddhas and bodhisattvas, please heed me!” and continues, “I offer myself to you. Please bless me, guard and protect me, and bestow on me the power of the great pledges.” These words repeated three times constitute the ritual for assuming the pledges.
One makes an offering of oneself in order to assume the pledges. The reason for doing so is explained in this way: A person is considered to exist on two levels, subtle and coarse. By offering body, speech, and mind—the coarse person—these three become owned by buddhas and bodhisattvas. At that point, one is possessed of the disposition of all buddhas and bodhisattvas, a disposition that is one of shunning the ten unwholesome deeds and practicing the ten wholesome ones.[20] Thus, one comes to assume [the ethics of the buddhas] as the very essence of the commitment of relative awakening mind. By offering the subtle person which, as the essence of emptiness, is inseparable from the reality dimension, one comes to assume ultimate awakening mind.[21] On the basis of those two, one assumes the other remaining pledges by repeating the last three phrases of the above supplication. This explanation is that of Buddhaguhya, as found in his Commentary [Epitomizing] the Vairochanabhisambodhi Tantra.[22]
The nature of the vows and pledges to be safeguarded in action tantra is discussed in detail in a prior [book, Buddhist Ethics] of this [Infinite Ocean of Knowledge].[23]

Generally, what is received of the initiation's mind-ripening process would be used in meditation on the stages of the path, and even the result attained would be a concordant one. This is the case in all four sets of tantra. Thus, here [in action tantra] as well, this applies to the main methods in the path, the practice with signs, which uses in the path [the content of] the diadem initiation, and the practice without signs, which uses in the path [the content of] the water initiation. The method of meditation in this path may be subdivided into four essential principles: oneself, deity, recitation, and meditative absorption.[26]

[The preliminary to] the meditation on the essential principle of oneself includes ablution and observing other forms of cleanliness; performing the rituals of protecting oneself and the place;[27] invoking the deity to merge into a painting or a statue in front and then making offerings;[28] and in the presence of the deity, remaining in the meditation posture appropriate to one's family.[29]
Next, the dimension of reality is used in the path to cultivate pristine awareness: The base to be ascertained by means of the view is the essence of enlightenment itself. This is done by meditating on the essential principle of oneself, which is the absence of intrinsic existence of the aggregates, and so on. [This meditation] includes six qualities: the absence of concepts related to an apprehender and the apprehended; absence of appearances in the nonconceptual state; absence of forms [composed] of the most subtle particles of matter; absence of the fluctuations of conceptual characteristics; being of the nature of luminous clarity, which transcends emptiness as a mere negation due to these [four] qualities; and one's essence having the characteristic of intrinsic self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own nature].

For this, the manifest dimension of awakening is used in the path to cultivate merit. It comprises three deities: the deity as form, as letter, and as nature.
The deity as form is of two kinds: deity as form complete with face and arms and distinguished by particular eyes, and so forth; and deity as seal, such as a wheel or vajra. The deity as letter is also of two kinds: deity as the forms of letters [of the mantra], and deity as the sound [of the mantra]. The deity as nature, also of two kinds, comprises the deity as the emptiness nature (the object) and the deity as nonconceptual pristine awareness (the subject).
All of these, when used as the essence of contemplation, are included within the six characteristic deities, which are stated [in the Vajravidarana Tantra]:[30]
Emptiness, letter, sound, form,
Seal, and sign are the six.
First, the deity as emptiness is to remain absorbed in emptiness, the essence of ultimate awakening mind, in which the essential principle of oneself and that of the deity are of an inseparability beyond concepts.
Second, the deity as letter is to meditate on the particular deity [one is practicing] in the form of the written letters of the [deity's] mantra resting on a moon disk (representing one's mind) visualized in space [in front]. Also considered to be the letter deity is to meditate simply on the moon [omitting the letters].
Third, the deity as sound is to meditate on the resonant sounds of the mantra (on the moon) associated with one of the [three] deities of the three families[31] to which the recitation practice for complete familiarization is directed.
Fourth, the deity as form is to meditate on the complete form of the deity. [The first step involves] meditating that light radiating from the letters of the mantra fulfills two aims;[32] then, [as the light reconverges, the letters] transform into the deity's complete form.
Fifth, the deity as seal is to perform the hand mudras for blessing, such as the mudra of the crown protrusion,[33] and while reciting the appropriate mantra, to touch the corresponding places of the body with the mudra. Alternatively, one makes the pledge mudra of that particular [family].
Sixth, the deity as sign is to recall, in all circumstances, the form of the deity as meditated in the state of equipoise so that the appearances of the outer world and its inhabitants are regarded as pure visions, imagined as the deity's residence, form, and resources.
These meditations are practiced without allowing the mind to become distracted from its focuses and while holding the life [wind][34] until the branches of the recitation are completed,[35] or for as long as possible. Thus, one remains single-mindedly absorbed in the experience of oneself visualized in the form of the deity: This constitutes the essential principle of the deity.

The essential principle of mantra recitation has a number of prescriptions: the tool for recitation (the chaplet used for counting); the place of recitation; the time when one should recite; the extent of [time, number, etc., required to complete] recitation; and the rules followed during the period of recitation. These prescriptions, as set forth in the Susiddhi and other tantras,[36] should be applied impeccably to [the following two forms of ] recitation.
The ordinary recitation for familiarization is carried out as follows: A moon disk, [symbol of ] relative awakening mind, is imagined in the heart of the particular deity of one of the three families [generated in front]. Located upon the moon disk is the mantra to be recited, with a sonorous quality of sound, arranged in its respective place.[37] The mantra is regarded as being like the secret mantra deities in actuality. The uninterrupted mindfulness that recalls this again and again dispels mistaken bad thoughts toward one's focus of practice [i.e., the deity], and leads to single-minded practice: This is the recitation of the secret mantras of the masters of the three families.[38]
The special recitation leads to the attainment of powers. The Dhyanottara Tantra states:[39]
Immerse yourself in sound, mind, and base.
Dwell in the immutable base of the secret mantra.
Recite the secret mantra without imperfections.
When tired, rest in [the principle of] oneself.
In this citation, “base” refers to the contemplation of the [form of the] deity. “Mind” refers to the visualization of the moon disk (the nature of relative awakening mind) in the heart of the deity. “Sound” refers to the contemplation of the syllables of the mantra, possessed of a sonorous quality, on the moon disk. “Immerse yourself” means that when practicing these three contemplations, while retaining the life [wind], one focuses with undivided attention on the form of the deity in front, the moon, and [syllables of] the mantra; and performs mental or whispered recitation of the mantra. Following that, when one cannot hold the breath and exhales,[40] to remain in the pride of oneself as the deity, [the subjective] “base” is to “dwell in the immutable base of the secret mantra.” “Recite the secret mantra without imperfections” means that these recitations of mantras are done without such imperfections as elongating some letters or clipping off others, reciting too quickly or too slowly, or [disregarding] the bent and curved[shaped] vowel signs.[41] “When tired, rest in [the principle of] oneself ” means that when recitation has led to discouragement or fatigue, to rest in a state free of any concept, which is the essential principle of oneself.
This latter mode of recitation, the special, is one characterized by single-mindedness, through which mental quiescence is accomplished.[42] Except for periods of resting [in one's essential nature], one directs undivided attention to the deity in front, and recitation is continued until the impression of separateness of the deity in front and oneself subsides, and a vivid experience of the inseparability of the deity and oneself occurs. By this standard, the former recitation is termed ordinary; and this latter one, special. These two constitute the essential principle of mantra recitation.

In the heart of [oneself as] the deity, one imagines a very still fire, like the flame of a butter lamp, within which is a moon disk with the syllables of the mantra arranged in a string of one following the other. One visualizes this with undivided attention and, while holding the life [wind], cultivates this meditation until the experience of vivid appearance occurs. This practice serves as the basis for the performance of all forms of activations, such as appeasement.[44]

At the heart of oneself [as the deity] is a moon disk, inside of which is the deity as base. [In the deity's heart] is a flame within which is a string of syllables of the mantra. Alternatively, the string of syllables is visualized on the moon disk alone. One examines the syllables closely. Once the contemplation has become perfectly vivid for at least a short while, one no longer focuses on the shape of the letters but maintains attention solely on the sonority of the spontaneously arising sounds of the mantra, resonating like the chimes of a bell.[45] One focuses on this single-mindedly while holding the life [wind], and trains in this until an experience of vivid appearance occurs. This meditation serves as the basis for the attainment of mental quiescence.

Analysis and precise examination of the mantra's sound alone leads to the understanding that its essence is without origin, cessation, or abiding. Based on that, [the practitioner] rests in contemplation within the state of pristine awareness, which is devoid of any concepts, the essential principle of oneself. From that contemplation arises the pristine awareness of insight,[46] which serves as the direct substantial cause of liberation.
The above three constitute the essential principle of meditative absorption.
To practice the various activations [of appeasement, etc.] related to special powers successfully, one must first meditate on those [four essential principles] as they have been explained. (This is not a definite requirement for the development of minor powers and activations,[47] which are effected even by common recitation alone.) Accordingly, first one must perfect familiarization for which the deity generated in front is regarded as superior, like a lord, and oneself as inferior, like a subject; afterwards, one works for the attainment of powers.
On this subject, Venerable [Taranata] of Jonang and his followers assert that in action tantra, as a general rule, the practice with signs involves no generation of oneself as the deity as part of the deity yoga meditation; nor does the generation of the deity in front involve [the prior] generation of the pledge deity. [The practice with signs] comprises only the invitation of the pristine awareness deity, exhibition of mudras, making offerings, recitation of the mantra, and finally the request for the deity's departure. The second practice, without signs, is contemplation on emptiness and solely that which is in common with the sutra [tradition].[48] The explanation of the six deities and attendant points, they say, is distinctively that of the conduct tantra, and certainly not the system of action tantra.
Most of the earlier masters of Tibet adhered to the system of the six deities and the other aspects [of familiarization] as mentioned above but maintained that there is no generation of oneself as the deity. Others have established conclusively that [action tantra] does involve the generation of oneself as the deity.[49] Karma Trinlé and others say that the ordinary forms of action tantra do not include generation of oneself as the deity, whereas the special forms do.[50] The class [of action tantra] that teaches generation of oneself as an action tantra deity through all the four branches of self-generation,[51] they say, represents a system of practice of action tantra like that of the highest yoga tantra, not the system of action tantra itself.
In whichever way the practice of this set of tantra is done, [with or without self-generation,] it is said to require [these elements]: austerities such as ablution, cleanliness and purity, and fasting, as well as strict purity in offering articles [to the deity], which must be untouched by the flesh of animals (except on a few occasions of performing fierce activations and for a few special practices such as that of Krodha Uchusma and Mahabala52); conformity to the vows of a celibate layperson or to higher monastic vows when doing familiarization or effecting powers. Apart from some subsections in the tantra, the path using desire is exclusively that of the practitioner looking at the male and female deities (generated in front) gazing at one another.

Once one has seen signs of one's nearness to the deity through the yoga of familiarization, one begins to develop powers, the essence of which is to attain [the state of] awareness-holder or sky-farer, whose status in terms of articles, body, and wealth is equal in fortune to that of the desire realm gods.
The articles include sword and eye elixir, which enable one to traverse celestial dimensions.
The body is one that is purified of the coarseness of the aggregates, and so forth, and manifests eight qualities of lordliness, such as subtleness and lightness, enabling one to traverse celestial dimensions.
The wealth ranges from human wealth like that of a universal [monarch] to the wealth in celestial dimensions which is equal to that of the desire realm gods.

The uncommon aspect is the attainment of the result of [the path of] proclaimers and solitary sages through having engaged in a mantric practice without the [altruistic] motivation of the universal way.
The ultimate goal, which depends on the support of awareness-holder or sky-farer status, is the actualization of awakening characterized by three dimensions as described in action tantra, accomplished through application of the perfections in the practice of the secret mantra system.

The powers to be effected are categorized in this system [action tantra] according to principal considerations [of essence, family, etc.], each of which comprises three types.
The three types of powers categorized according to essence are the highest powers, which include the attainment of awareness-holder status, supernormal cognitive powers, and perfect knowledge of treatises; the middling powers, invisibility, youthfulness, and speed-walking; and the lowest powers, ability to control, kill, and drive away [harmful beings];[53] or, alternatively, as explained above, the three of articles, body, and wealth.
The three types of powers categorized according to family are the transcendent family power, which is the power of appeasement; the enriching power of the lotus family; and the fierce power of the vajra family.
The three types of powers categorized according to the deity [who grants them] are the power of appeasement granted by the lord of the family deity; the power of enriching, by the mother deity; and the power of the fierce activation, by the wrathful deity.
The three types of powers categorized according to the indication [of the attainment of powers] are [the powers gained when] substances [used to gain powers] blaze with fire; give off smoke; and give off heat.
The three types of powers categorized according to the promulgator are [the powers gained from] mantras [spoken] by exalted ones [buddhas and bodhisattvas]; by gods; and by beings living above the earth [such as yakshas].
Although the bestower of a power [the deity] may be of highest rank, there are known to be cases of a low power being granted owing to the familiarization not being carried out with proper diligence on the part of the practitioner. However, if familiarization is done correctly, even a low-ranking deity, having petitioned other [higher-ranking ones], may grant supreme power.

As to the way powers are effected, this is pointed out by [the words of the root verses] “effected in the appropriate manner.” To begin with, one should examine portents that indicate whether or not there will be success [in achieving powers].[54] If the signs are favorable, one should apply the many methods taught [in action tantra] such as effecting powers by means of fire-offering rituals or doing so simply by recitation of the mantra and meditation. [While doing so,] three times [each day], one should make offerings [to the deity], confess [unwholesome deeds], rejoice [in virtue], make noble aspirations, read the Transcendent Wisdom scriptures, make mandalas, observe precepts, and perform rites of protection [of oneself and the place]. For each of the three times, one should be wearing a fresh change of clothes.
On these occasions, it is not sufficient to invite the deity in front; [the deity] must be newly generated. [Then, when reciting the mantra] one does whichever is appropriate of the first two of the four-branched recitation [i.e., observing the form of the letters at the heart of the deity in front or at one's heart]. If light is seen radiating from a statue, reliquary, or other object, or a diminishment of hunger is experienced, and so forth, these are said to be indications of success in recitation and meditation and that the deity is nearly actualized.[55] At that point, one abjures all the faults associated with the effecting of powers as mentioned in the Dhyanottara Tantra,[56] and applies oneself with diligence. In that way, one actualizes the consummate result.

It is generally asserted that eight aeons is the time required for a person of sharp faculties to attain the result. To elaborate on [the words in the root verses] “or other times,” the Manjushri Root Tantra says that one of superior faculties will perfect the result in one lifetime; and the Indestructible Peak,[57] that a mediocre person will do so in sixteen lifetimes. As for the least adept, the Venerable Rangjung Dorjé states [in his Profound Inner Reality]:[58]
Even with simply the skillful methods of the action and conduct ways,
[One will attain the result] in sixty human lifetimes.
According to this, in six thousand years [considering one human lifetime to be one hundred years], a practitioner will perfect the stages and paths and attain the state of awakening of whichever of the three families he or she has practiced to effect that state.
It is taught that generally when one reaches the great stage of the path of accumulation through meditation on the path of action tantra, one meets the manifest dimension of a buddha and thereby becomes an awareness-holder of either the desire or form realm.[59] On that basis, one then traverses the remaining paths, thereby actualizing the state of union.[60] However, this explanation, according to which one can reach perfection through the path of action tantra alone, is considered to be a provisional one since to actually enter the state of union it is indispensable to rely on highest yoga tantra.

This system is called “tantra of both” or “conduct tantra” because it emphasizes conduct that involves equal proportions of outer (physical and verbal) deeds and inner (mental) contemplation, or alternatively, because it emphasizes deliberate behavior.[1]
The essence of conduct tantra is as stated in the Compendium [on the Indestructible Pristine Awareness Tantra]:[2]
To train thoroughly in a vast range of deeds related to activations— mudras and other characteristic focuses of action tantra—as one's objects of practice, and to practice [inner contemplation]: these [elements] are found in conduct tantra.
To clarify this passage, the following elements are said to apply to, or be contained within, conduct tantra: to practice and train thoroughly in a vast range of deeds related to activations, which are sets of outer (physical and verbal) [actions] such as mudras and other characteristic focuses as taught in action tantra, and thus [to have] objects of practice that accord with that tantra; to cultivate inner (mental) contemplation that accords with yoga tantra and to practice [deity yoga] in what is like a friend-to-friend relationship with the deity.

Conduct tantra is divided into three families of tantras: the family of awakened body, that of awakened speech, and that of awakened mind.[3] Of the three, the family of awakened body is the principal one. The families of deities of those [three] families are the same as the three supramundane families of action tantra [transcendent, lotus, and vajra], respectively. It is said that conduct tantra may also be divided into five families without contradicting the threefold division.[4]

Conduct tantra consists of the three practices of entering, effecting powers, and using powers. The entering practice is twofold, the outer and the inner. The outer practice of entering has two parts: initiations and pledges.
Concerning the initiations, the Essence of Pristine Awareness states:[5]
It is clearly evident that conduct tantra
Has the two initiations of action tantra,
As well as those of the vajra, bell, and name.
As stated in this passage, conduct tantra is known to have five initiations: water, diadem, vajra, bell, and name. The Vairochanabhisambodhi Tantra mentions only the water initiation, plus the authorizations [given with the symbols] of the chirurgical eye-spoon and the mirror and the authorization to teach.[6] Even [Buddhaguhya's] commentary on this tantra[7] does not refer explicitly to the diadem and the other initiations. However, the five initiations are clearly taught in the Vajrapani Initiation, as well as in a few other [conduct tantras]. Thus, in this system, one receives the vajra master initiation of the conduct tantra upon receiving the five initiations.
Taking the Vairochanabhisambodhi as example, the first initiation of the vase purifies the stains that cause lower forms of life. The second washes away the seeds of cyclic existence. The third creates the seeds of the two accumulations associated with the first to the tenth stage of awakening.[8] The fourth plants the seeds for becoming a regent of a buddha. The diadem initiation plants the seeds for the [thirty-two] major and [eighty] minor marks of the body of a buddha; the bell initiation, the seeds for the sixty qualities of the melodious speech of a buddha;[9] the vajra initiation, the seeds for the twofold omniscience of the mind of a buddha; and the name initiation, the seeds for having one's name known throughout the three realms. The authorizations of the chirurgical eye-spoon and the mirror, the authorization to teach the doctrine, and other rites grant permission to carry out awakened activity for the benefit of others. Although the five initiations of awareness [water, diadem, bell, vajra, and name][10] bear the same names as [those comprised by the vase initiation of ] the higher tantra sets, they differ in meaning.
The Vairochanabhisambodhi Tantra states that initiations in conduct tantra are conferred within mandalas that are elaborate, unelaborate, or extremely unelaborate. Furthermore, initiation within the elaborate mandala is of [two] types: conferral using an outer mandala made of colored powders; and conferral using the inner mandala of one's body. The above three mandalas may also be subsumed under elaborate and unelaborate, or inner and outer initiations.

</d>
<d e="2">
How are the pledges and vows assumed in conduct tantra? According to the Vairochanabhisambodhi Tantra, the pledges and vows are assumed at three different moments of the initiation: during the preparatory ritual [of an initiation]; upon entry to the mandala; and at the conclusion of the initiation by making a promise [to maintain them].
The first, taken during the preparatory ritual, is the vow [known as] unobscured throughout the three times. To take this vow, one makes an offering of one's own body [to the buddhas and bodhisattvas]. Through this act, one comes to hold the very essence of the commitment of relative awakening mind, in the way explained above in the context of the action tantra.
The second, taken upon entry to the mandala, is the formation of the ultimate awakening mind in accordance with ritual. For this, one is blessed by the mantra and hand mudra of the ultimate dimension of phenomena and meditates on [the meaning of] emptiness. Then, one is blessed with the mantra and hand mudra of the wheel of the doctrine,[11] whereupon one imagines oneself in the form of Vajrasattva, which is the appearance aspect of emptiness. This vow is thereby distinguished by virtue of its vast and profound aspects, or by the methods with signs and without signs.[12]
The third, taken at the conclusion of the initiation by making a conscious promise repeated after the master, is to assume [the pledges] never to forsake the sacred doctrine, and so on, for which one guards against root downfalls and secondary infractions, as explained in conduct tantra's own system.[13]

The inner practice of entering has two aspects, with signs and without signs.[14] Tibetan masters present a number of different perspectives on these two and ways to identify them. According to the Venerable Taranata, practice with signs consists of the meditations of the yoga of six deities with generation of oneself as the deity and generation of the deity in front. The [Vajravidarana] Tantra states:[15]
The yogin, having first bathed,
Takes his place on the vajra mat,
Then offers, prays, and meditates on six deities.
Emptiness, letter, sound, form,
Seal, and sign are said to be the six.
Accordingly, once the outer and inner cleansing [rituals] have been performed, a circle of protection is imagined, the pristine awareness deities invited, hand mudras exhibited, and then offerings and petitions made.[16] That is followed by meditation on the authentic condition [of things], known as the deity as emptiness; then, in sequence, meditation on the syllables of the mantra and on the seed [syllable], known as the deity as letter; meditation on the sound of the mantra along with its light, which radiates forth and reconverges, known as the deity as sound; meditation on the body of the deity, known as the deity as form; meditation on the insignia, and so forth, at the heart [of the deity], known as the deity as seal; and meditation on one's own body, blessed by mantra, as being the body of the deity, known as the deity as sign. [These steps] represent the general meditation using the six deities.
For the special meditation, the Vairochanabhisambodhi Tantra states[17] that the deity to be meditated upon comprises three deities: the deity as letter, as seal, and as form. Each is divided into two aspects. The two aspects of the deity as letter are the deity as awakening mind and the deity as sound. The two aspects of the deity as seal are the deity depicted in a form and shape, such as the wheel [of the doctrine]; and the deity without form or shape, emptiness, symbolized by the azure [triangular] source of phenomena.[18] The two aspects of the deity as form are the deity as utterly pure form and the deity as impure form. The deity as utterly pure form is the very essence of realization in which all conceptual characteristics are totally pacified, a direct experience of the essence of enlightenment by one's intrinsic self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own nature]. The deity as impure form is meditation on [the deity as] a form that has color, face, hands, and so forth, by means of conceptual thought.

As preliminary steps, one performs [the rituals] of protecting oneself, the place, and the yoga.[19] Following these is meditation on [the two aspects of] the deity as letter. For the first aspect of the deity as letter, the relative manifestation of ultimate awakening mind is visualized as a moon disk. For the second aspect of the deity as letter, [the syllables of] the mantra to be recited, which are standing on the moon disk, are imagined to be resonating with their sounds.
Next is meditation on the [deity as] base. For the first aspect, the [subjective] base, one imagines that the utterly pure nature of everything [syllables and moon] is oneself as the deity, and one performs blessings with mantras, mudras, and so on. For the second aspect, the [objective] base, one visualizes the deity in front, which manifests from oneself as the deity like a reflection in a mirror. Then, one focuses on [the syllables of] the mantra on the moon disk at the heart of the deity in front and retains the life [wind]. With single-minded application, one mentally recites the mantra, training [in this way] until an experience of vivid appearance occurs. Throughout this phase, one regards [the relationship between] the deity and oneself to be simply like that of siblings or friends.
Ngorchen Dorjé Chang[20] and others, taking the Vairochanabhisambodhi as an example, present [the two practices in this way]: The practice with signs, explained in accordance with the Sadhana [of Vairochana],[21] includes the generation on the ground of the mandala of the reflected form [i.e., the deity in front] along with its “life” [i.e., the moon and mantra] on the basis of an external mandala, and the imagining of the ultimate mandala [of the wisdom deities] in the sky, and so on. Practice without signs has both real and nominal [aspects]. The real aspect consists of training in the union of emptiness (freedom from concepts) and compassion. The nominal aspect includes the generation of the deity in its two aspects as letter and the two bases, the performance of the mental recitation while retaining the life wind, and so on.

The common yoga without signs includes contemplation of [the deity's] insignia and syllable at the heart of the deity; blocking the life wind; and the use in the path of [sexual] desire [related to] the laughter of the male and female deities, and so on.[22]
The special yoga without signs is cultivated in conjunction with three minds: the minds of entering, abiding, and emerging, the essence of which is the ultimate awakening mind itself. The mind of entering is the realization of the unborn nature of all phenomena (the aggregates, etc.) gained by examining them in terms of the four extremes;[23] the mind of abiding, the direct realization of the unborn nature as the essence of the nonconceptual state; and the mind of emerging, the ensuing great compassion directed toward suffering beings who lack such realization.
Proficiency in those two kinds of yogas, with and without signs, produces resultant powers which are also of two kinds: by means of the former are attained powers with signs [i.e., the form dimensions of awakening]; and by means of the latter, both powers with signs and without signs [i.e., the reality dimension and the form dimensions of awakening]. Accordingly, the Vairochanabhisambodhi states:[24]
The sublime Victor declared that [yoga] with signs
Brings about powers with signs.
But persevering in the signless [yoga]
Also leads to powers with signs;
Since that is the case,
Adhere to the signless in all ways.

The common practice of approaching has two aspects: with signs and without signs. The first has two aspects, the outer and the inner.
The outer practice with signs is to familiarize oneself with the deity by means of the four-branched recitation [as explained in the entering practice] in conjunction with the retention of the life wind, until one has completed the recitation of the requisite number [of mantras], one hundred thousand, or however many are prescribed.
The inner practice with signs is to clearly imagine oneself as Buddha Shakyamuni, at whose heart is a moon disk on which is [the form of] Vairochana. In the heart of Vairochana on a moon disk is the arrangement [of the syllables] of the mantra. Retaining the life wind, one does the recitation [as before].[25]
The practice without signs is to thoroughly analyze the very nature of the color and other features of the deity's form (which is inseparable from oneself) by breaking down these imagined appearances into their most subtle particles. In accordance with what one has thereby realized, one experiences mind as simply self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own nature], released of oneself as the form of the deity, devoid of [dualistic] appearances. Then, one mentally recites [the mantra] as appropriate. (This description of the practice without signs accords with that given by some learned masters.[26] Essentially, it is contained in the yoga without signs explained above, and therefore many would not consider it a separate part of this topic.)

After perfecting familiarization with the deity, one engages in practices to effect powers. By relying on outer and inner mandalas, one gains ordinary and special powers in the following ways:
For the ordinary powers, one draws the outer mandala used to effect powers, places within it a sword or other ritual object [such as noose, wheel, iron arrow, or hammer], and then recites [the given numbers of mantras]. When the object blazes [with light] and one grasps it in one's hand, one attains the state of awareness-holder (or another power).
For the special powers, one relies on the inner mandalas of the four elements [visualized within the body][27] and thereby gains proficiency in breath control. This effects inner powers which depend on the mind alone, the five supernormal cognitive powers such as that of performing miracles,[28] and the powers to greatly effect the welfare of oneself and others, plus accompanying powers, accrued from having entered the ranks of awareness-holders.
According to this tantra, the supreme state [of awakening] can be attained through the use of articles as an awareness-holder [whose status is] equal in fortune to the gods of the realm of desire and form up to the highest gods of Unsurpassed;[29] through a body purified of its coarse elements (aggregates, etc.) and endowed with the eight qualities of physical lordliness, subtle [form], and so on; through the [mental body] support in the intermediate state [between lives]; and through experience in a future life.

The way to effect powers is included in the above discussion and will not be elaborated on separately. Regarding this, Venerable [Taranata] of Jonang speaks of four practices: the practice of entering, which is initiation and pledges; the practice of yoga, which is familiarization [with the deity] by means of the two yogas [with and without signs]; the practice to effect powers in which, having gained stability in the focus of meditation, the yogin makes offerings to a drawn representation of the deity or a constructed mandala and then practices [to attain powers], as a result of which he experiences a vision of the deity in the waking state or in dream [who confers power]; and the practice to effect great powers, which includes practices related to the sets of activations and powers as explained in the individual tantras.
While cultivating these four, a practitioner must maintain purity and cleanliness. However, except for special purposes, to undergo the rigors of asceticism is not necessary since [in conduct tantra] one is required to meditate on oneself as the deity.

In this [system of] tantra, persons of the families who have entered the way of the perfections and those who have not entered that way both initially engage in mantra practice based on eight dispositions: the seed-like disposition of being motivated by faith, and the sprout-like disposition, root-like, trunk-like, branch-like, leaf-like, flower-like, and fruit-like dispositions.[30] In addition to these eight is the disposition that is attended by desire, which motivates one to strive for simply the happiness of humans and gods of the desire realm; and the disposition that is free of the desire [characteristic of the desire realm], which motivates one to strive for the happiness of the higher realms. These [ten] dispositions, which when subdivided include one hundred and sixty dispositions, constitute what is taught as the mundane path leading to the result of higher rebirth.[31]
On the supramundane path, a person of low faculties will take six great aeons to progress through the stages associated with the different degrees of realization of the two [aspects of ] no-self[32] and enter the stage of “practice with appreciation of the universal way.” A person of sharp faculties will take one aeon to enter [the same stage]. This stage represents the great level of the path of accumulation in this system.[33]
Subsequent to that, by means of the three minds of entering, abiding, and emerging, in one aeon [one reaches] the stage of pristine awareness, which is the culmination of the ten stages of “practice with appreciation.”[34] At that point, one receives oceans of teachings from oceans of buddhas, whereupon one realizes the pristine awareness of [the stage] “conducive to definitive separation.”[35] One moves through the stages of awakening, the first, and so on, and upon reaching the end of the tenth stage, becomes a buddha by contemplating the five [seed] syllables of the great hero as the very essence of realization.[36] It is said that the stage of omniscience, the great enjoyment dimension of full awakening,[37] will definitely be reached by a person of low faculties in eight aeons at the most, and by one of sharp faculties, despite hindrances of any kind, in three great aeons.
This [progression through stages] is designated by Ngorchen and others as “practice to effect [powers].” According to their view, having once attained the state of awareness-holder of the sword by means of practice to effect powers, in that [same] body of an awareness-holder, one engages in deeds of excellence such as moving throughout oceans of buddha realms. As a result, the state of Great Vairochana is realized.

Yoga tantra is so named because it emphasizes the inner yoga meditation of method and wisdom; or, alternatively, because based on knowledge and understanding of all aspects of the profound ultimate truth and the vast relative truth, it emphasizes contemplation that inseparably unites these two truths.
The essence of yoga tantra is as stated in the Compendium [on the Indestructible Pristine Awareness Tantra]:[1]
To have an arrangement of all the awareness goddesses together in the mandala circle; and to train in the ten essential principles, such as practices, activations, and powers, based on that arrangement, and thereby to practice [deity yoga] to effect [powers]: these apply to the tantra of both [i.e., yoga tantra].
To clarify this passage, the following elements are said to apply to, or be contained within, yoga tantra: to have an arrangement within the mandala circle of all the awareness goddesses together, such as goddesses who perform the secret offering, the chief serving goddess who is the Incense Bearer, and the others;[2] to train by means of the ten essential principles, which include the practices (contemplation, mantras, and seals), activations (such as those of a [tantric] master, leading students [into the mandala], etc.), and the gaining of powers (that of wealth, etc.) based on that arrangement [of the awareness goddesses] or, alternatively, gaining powers associated with activations, and so forth, based on that arrangement; and thereby practice [deity yoga] to effect the two powers [ordinary and supreme]. The ten essential principles are set forth in [Anandagarbha's] Illumination of the Summation of Essential Principles:[3]
What are the ten essential principles? They are the mandala; mantra; seals; protection of oneself, the place, and so forth; the ritual of inviting the deities; recitation; meditation; fire-offering rituals (incorporating inner and outer aspects); dissolution [of the seals]; and request for departure [of the pristine awareness deities].
These ten essential principles form two divisions: the relative principles, distinguished by method (conduct); and the ultimate, distinguished by wisdom (meditation on the ultimate).[4] Included in these principles are both the inner yoga of contemplation[5] and outer deeds (as branch practices of the contemplation), owing to which yoga tantra is known as “tantra of both.”

Division of yoga tantra according to family yields five root families; hence, there are also five tantras. These [five] become one hundred when split into subdivisions. The Indestructible Peak states:[6]
Families refers to the different types,
Namely, permanence, stability, precious power,
Measureless light, and unfailing accomplishment.
The families are said to be of one hundred types
All of which are included in five types.
The five types are the buddha, vajra,
Jewel, doctrine, and action families.
The five major families are subdivided, with each major family comprising five minor families, and each of the five minor ones split into the four divisions of heart, seal, secret mantra, and awareness mantra. This yields one hundred families. These families are all contained within the two [groups of tantras] of method and wisdom. The tantras of method emphasize awakening mind; and the tantras of wisdom emphasize transcendent wisdom.[7]

The preliminary steps include entering the particular mandala for one of the five families; assuming the pledges and vows; the descent of the [invoked] pristine awareness deities; and determining one's special deity[8] by the tossing of a flower [into the mandala]. Subsequent to this is the conferral of the five initiations of the student.
The first, the initiation of water, begins with ablution performed with the action vase, followed by conferral with [the water of] the vases [held by] the deities, principally the vase of the practitioner's special deity and the victorious vase.[9]
The second, the diadem initiation, is conferred with the diadems of the respective families: the diadem formed by the five buddhas in the case of the transcendent family,[10] and so forth.
The third, the vajra initiation, is conferred with the vajras of the respective families: the transcendent vajra in the case of the transcendent family,[11] and so forth.
The fourth, the bell initiation, is conferred with a bell, the handle of which symbolizes the particular family: [a five-pronged vajra handle] in the case of the transcendent family, and so forth.
The fifth, the initiation of the name, is conferred by the giving of a name [indicative] of the family [of the deity] on which the flower has dropped.
In addition to these is the initiation of the master which comprises six initiations: the irreversible initiation, secret initiation, authorization, prophecy, encouragement, and praise. All together, eleven initiations are to be received in the yoga tantra.
On this subject of initiation, the Essence of Pristine Awareness[12] states that in addition to the five initiations of the five families,
The initiation of irreversibility
Is clearly specified in yoga tantra.
This initiation has six distinct parts
Together known as the master's initiation.
Based on what is stated in this citation, it should be pointed out that yoga tantra has the five initiations of the student (water, etc.) and six initiations within the initiation of the master, a total of eleven. This is evident in sources such as this tantra [just cited], as well as the Indestructible Garland and others.
With regard to these initiations, a person may merely enter the mandala [but not be initiated];[13] or enter the mandala [and be initiated]. [In the latter case], the person who does not assume the vows of the five families but does assume those of the bodhisattva will be given only the student initiations; while one who assumes both vows will be given the initiations in their entirety (including those of the vajra master). These specifications are made in [Anandagarbha's] [Illumination] Commentary on the Summation of Essential Principles.[14]
The secret initiation in this context is unlike that of the highest yoga tantra. What is called secret initiation in yoga tantra refers to the student secretly entering the mandala, and having entered, viewing it, followed by the [master's] revealing of the essential principles of the mandala and deity, the ten essential principles such as the mandala, and the different activations [performed by a vajra master].
Some yoga tantras also speak of a “conferral of the pristine awareness through wisdom initiation.” However, this is simply a name applied to the setting [of the student] in the training in the four seals after the transmission of mantra.

The Indestructible Peak states:[15]
Having taken refuge in the Three Jewels,
The Buddha, his teachings, and his followers...
With this formula, the vows are proclaimed. Then, the candidate is examined, and one deemed qualified [to receive the initiation] enters the mandala. At that point, one repeats the following words:
Just as the protectors throughout the three times...
up to:
...and set all beings in the state of perfect peace.[16]
When one has repeated this formula three times, it is said that one has assumed, according to ritual, the mantric vows to avoid the fourteen defeating transgressions and to fulfill the prescriptions of the fourteen branch pledges.[17] Although this is indeed the case, for mantric vows to be complete depends upon receiving [the main part of ] the initiation. Thus, as is stated in the section on the three types of ethics [in the Infinite Ocean of Knowledge], “the assuming of vows is complete at the conclusion of the initiation ritual.”
The pledges and vows that are to be safeguarded in yoga tantra have been presented previously [in the Buddhist Ethics section of the Infinite Ocean of Knowledge].

The master Anandagarbha [in his Illumination] asserts that all the stages of yoga tantra's path are contained in these four elements: the individual qualified to enter [yoga tantra], the result to be achieved, the fundamental cause, and the means whereby the result is achieved.
The first, the recipient [of the teachings] qualified to enter [yoga tantra] is an individual who has overcome the four shortcomings of not having engendered an awakening mind, and so on; and is endowed with [their opposites,] the four qualifications: having formed in the proper way both the aspiring and venturing aspects of an awakening mind, which is the entrance to the universal way; freedom from hesitations and doubts by virtue of one's great confidence in tantra; following the precepts of the Buddha by virtue of one's ability to observe the pledges as taught by the Transcendent One, inclusive of the points of training with respect to prohibitions and injunctions; and faith in the path and the teacher of the path [the Buddha], in the deity and in the master. In addition, the Indestructible Peak specifies that practitioners are required to follow the tantric path while observing either lay or monk vows.
The second, the result to be achieved, is the great enjoyment dimension of Buddha Vairochana, the embodiment of the four dimensions of awakening,[18] free from all obscurations and endowed with perfect qualities.
On this subject, most yoga tantra masters speak of there being a minor Vairochana, the one who emanated as the mandala on the summit of Mount Meru and other locations and taught [yoga tantra]; and Great Vairochana, possessed of the five certainties, who dwells in the Great Unsurpassed Realm[19] and who is the basis for [all other] emanations.
[Shakyamitra's] Ornament of Kosala[20] and [Anandagarbha's] Illumination of the Summation of Essential Principles explain that Vairochana is a form dimension, the essence of the dimensions of the five transcendent ones,[21] who resides in the Unsurpassed Realm; and Great Vairochana is the beginningless and endless ultimate dimension of phenomena, the nature of pristine awareness, free from the two obscurations.[22]

The third, the fundamental cause for achieving the result, is the awakening mind, Ever-Perfect (Samantabhadra), which has neither beginning nor end, in nature is luminous clarity and is characterized as one's intrinsic self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own nature]. It serves as the manifestation ground of all the deities, mantras, and seals, being the essential reality of one's own mind, utterly pure from the beginning of time.
The fourth, the means whereby the result is achieved, comprises the following yogas: the yoga of the great seal of awakened body which serves to dispel the adventitious deceptions of the ground-of-all consciousness and thereby to actualize its nature, mirror-like pristine awareness; the yoga of the pledge seal of awakened mind, to dispel the adventitious deceptions of afflicted consciousness and thereby to actualize its nature, the pristine awareness of total sameness; the yoga of the doctrine seal of awakened speech, to dispel the adventitious deceptions of mental consciousness and thereby to actualize its nature, discerning pristine awareness; and the yoga of the action seal of awakened activity,[23] to dispel the adventitious deceptions of the five sense consciousnesses[24] and thereby to actualize their natures, the pristine awareness of accomplishment. The pristine awareness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena is present in the natures of the other four.[25]
In summation, the means whereby one achieves the result consists of both method and wisdom. Method, which effects purification of deceptions, refers to deity yoga meditation related to the four seals, plus attendant practices.[26] Wisdom refers to the pristine awareness of one's intrinsic self-awareness, which directly knows mind's essential reality. The latter, the wisdom aspect, is realized by a person of low faculties in a gradual way by means of study, reflection, and so on; and by one of sharp faculties instantaneously through the power of blessing and meditation.

A person of sharp faculties practices deity yoga meditation on the basis of three contemplations that conform to early events: the way the Buddha first became fully enlightened; the way the Buddha, in the interim, emanated the mandalas for the root and explanatory [yoga tantras] and set in motion the wheel of teachings of yoga tantra on the summit of Mount Meru and at other locations;[27] the way the Buddha, in the end, as the all-powerful sovereign of each [yoga tantra] family,[28] enacted activities such as guiding students; and related secondary events. These events applied as forms of yoga by later followers [of the Buddha] [constitute the three contemplations of] the initial union, supremely triumphant mandala, and supremely triumphant act.[29]
Since a person of low faculties would be unable to practice the three contemplations, he or she should practice the meditations of the four yogas: the yoga of generating oneself as the pledge deity of one's family; the subsequent yoga of merging the pristine awareness deity with the pledge deity and experiencing this [union] as one flavor; the all-inclusive yoga of meditation on this [union] as the very nature of the animate and inanimate world; and upon completion of the first three yogas, the supreme yoga in which the state of single-minded contemplation is attained. These contemplations are called “attention on the coarse [form of the] deity.”

Once a practitioner has cultivated deity yoga by means of the three contemplations or the four yogas, whichever appropriate, he or she engages in what is called “attention on the minute insignia of the deity,” explained as follows:
With the tongue positioned against the palate, one visualizes at the navel a minute five-pronged vajra no larger than a hair's tip or a sesame seed, the same color as the deity. One imagines that this vajra exits through the nostrils and stands erect on the tip of the nose.[30] One's mind then remains fixed on the vajra by means of both mindfulness and vigilance. When concentration has become stable, a distinct sensation of bliss will arise at the tip of the nose or in other parts of the body. As a result, one will achieve great serviceability of body and mind.[31]
Once concentration on the features of the minute vajra has become stable, one imagines that many minute vajras emanate forth and pervade everything from the inside and surroundings of one's body to all parts of the universe. Finally, one draws in all these emanated [vajras], from the tip of the nose and into the heart. This meditation yields great benefits, such as achievement of the special contemplation of mental quiescence.
These forms of yoga are trained in and brought to realization through the methods of the ten essential principles [of tantric expertise]:
The two mandalas (form and formless)... fire-offering rituals (in
ner and outer); dissolution; and the request for departure.
This passage refers to the following ten: the mandala, which is twofold, that of reflected images [i.e., with form] and the formless one;[32] mantra, outer and inner; four seals [the great seal, pledge seal, doctrine seal, and action seal] applied to the deities; [rituals of ] protection of oneself, the place, and the yoga; the invitation that gathers the pristine awareness deities; [whispered] recitation of vajra words and mental recitation of mantra; meditation comprising the three contemplations, and so forth; fire-offering rituals, both outer and inner, performed for the sake of mandala worship or other purposes; dissolution, which is the release of the seals [to interrupt the contemplation of oneself as the deity]; and request for the [deity's] departure after making offerings.

The Summation of Essential Principles states:[33]
With an understanding of the syllable a
One meditates on the forms of all syllables.
Through meditation from one's mouth to another's,
One comes to attain the powers.
The meaning of the syllable a in this citation is understood to be the unborn [nature]. Applying that understanding, one examines all the syllables of mantras by breaking them down into parts, and meditates on their selfless nature. The meaning of “mouth” is understood to be the door [to liberation]. Applying that understanding, one penetrates [the meaning of] emptiness, the door to liberation,[34] with regard to oneself [as the deity], and likewise with regard to the deities in front and the mantras. Here, what is taught involves primarily wisdom that is conceptual. Furthermore, the same tantra states:[35]
That which is called perfect penetrating wisdom
Is known to be contemplation.
The seals should be practiced in that state:
Meditation [in this way] brings rapid success.
The perfect penetrating wisdom spoken of in this citation is the view of the unborn [nature]; it denotes contemplative equanimity in a state without any concept whatsoever, based on knowledge of the lack of intrinsic nature of things.
The Indestructible Peak presents extensive teachings on the forms of signless meditations in the transcendent family, vajra family, and the other families, for which is emphasized analytical insight by means of discerning wisdom. [The signless yoga] taught in the Summation of Essential Principles, on the other hand, comprises both mental quiescence and insight. Meditation in which mental quiescence and insight are alternated depending on conditions of mental agitation, fogginess, and other [impediments] that arise in practice is taught in [Shakyamitra's] Ornament of Kosala.[36]

There are three [methods] in the process of effecting powers: reliance on meditative absorption, which brings about mainly supramundane powers; recitation of the mantra, effecting both [mundane and supramundane] powers; and fire-offering rituals, effecting mainly mundane powers. The ultimate result of all [three] is attainment of the supreme [power]: pristine awareness of the seals [of awakened body, speech, mind, and activities].

Having completed familiarization, one applies oneself to the practice of effecting powers [with understanding] of the utter purity [emptiness] of the three spheres [meditator, meditation, and object meditated upon]. Subsequently, one cultivates the seals [of awakened body, speech, mind, and activities] for the benefit of others and attends to the infinite activations associated with those [four] seals, thereby experiencing [favorable] signs and developing supernormal cognitive powers. Having succeeded in that, one effects powers through collective practice[37] according to the procedure set out in the subsequent-practice section of the Glorious Supreme Original Being Tantra.[38] If this does not lead to success, the practice must be repeated seven times. If success is still not forthcoming, one relies on the enhancement practice called “the rite of killing the deity.”[39] These instructions are intended for the person of sharp faculties.
The general familiarization and the special contemplation of the minute vajra are intended for someone of low faculties and for practitioners in common. Once those are mastered, one engages in the various special meditative absorptions taught [in this tantra] and thereby attains ordinary powers, such as the skill [to find] treasure [underground], walk on water, possess [the knowledge] of awareness mantras and so forth; and the supreme power [attainment of awakening].

Powers are effected through two types of recitation, vajra [mental] recitation and word [whispered] recitation. A person of sharp faculties relies on vajra recitation of two forms: the relative, for which there is a focus; and the ultimate, which is without focus.
For the relative vajra recitation with focus, one first cultivates the vivid appearance of the deity in front and oneself as the deity. Having drawn in the wind and sense powers, one [mentally] recites the mantra while recollecting its meaning. Then, while exhaling and right until the end of the exhalation, one continues reciting the mantra, observing the deity in front. Again, one [inhales], blocking the life wind, thoughts, and senses; focuses on the form of the deity which is undifferentiated from oneself; and continues the [mental] recitation of the mantra.
For the ultimate vajra recitation with no focus, first one meditates on the unborn [nature] of the deity in front, oneself [as the deity], and the mantra, and considers everything to be emptiness. While blocking [the movement of] the life [wind], with a mind free from grasping to anything at all, one regards the deity, oneself, and the mantra as being [empty] like the sky and mentally recites the mantra with attention on the reality dimension of the deity. When releasing the breath, one brings to mind the form [of the deity endowed] with its attributes. Again, one [inhales,] drawing in the life [wind], and so on. Thus, one continues the mental recitation, alternating between those two modes.
Persons of low faculties effect powers through the recitation of words. With one's legs in the position particular to the deity of one's family, one meditates on the deity in front and oneself [as the deity]. With the left hand in a fist [position appropriate to] the family, one holds the insignia of the family. With the right hand, one holds at the heart the family's chaplet (for counting numbers of mantras). One recites the mantra for a period of four months in a style particular to the family (silently in the case of the transcendent family [of Vairochana], and so on.) When that is completed, one recites the mantra for another four months, four sessions a day, in front of a representation of one's deity. At the conclusion [of the four months], one exerts oneself fervently in the recitation for the entirety of one night. It is taught that as a result, at daybreak, one gains powers from the representation of one's deity.
In these ways, a practitioner effects the supreme power [awakening], as well as the mundane powers associated with external articles, [the state of ] sky-farer awareness-holder, and so on. The former (supreme) is the power [accrued] mainly through vajra recitation; the latter (mundane), the powers [accrued] mainly through word recitation. However, the powers effected by word recitation eventually lead to the supramundane power.

On the particular fire-platform appropriate for the purpose (purification of negativities, enhancement of the [family and spiritual] lineage, or other purpose), one performs the fire-offering ritual[40] every day preceded by the deity yoga. This is continued until signs indicating success (in, for example, purification of negativities) have manifested to oneself or to another. Then, one performs each of the [four] activations [appeasement, enrichment, domination, and the fierce form]. [In addition to] these explanations of various procedures to effect powers, the use in the path of the bliss derived from [the male and female] holding hands is also found in this tantra.

Once the path of this [tantra] has been entered, a person of sharp faculties is said to traverse all the stages and paths of yoga tantra within one lifetime, while one of low faculties does so in up to sixteen lifetimes. Thus, in comparison to the previous [tantras], the time one takes is extremely brief.
To expand, at the tenth stage of awakening, a practitioner, whether of sharp or low faculties, will receive the initiation of great light [from all the buddhas], and thereupon practice the contemplation that is the perfect end of the fourth meditative absorption.[41] One who has attained such absorption is known as “one endowed with a mental body,”[42] “a bodhisattva in the last existence,” and “a bodhisattva accomplisher of all intentions” since [at that stage] to accomplish all of one's [intended] deeds depends merely upon one's wish to do so.
Such an “accomplisher of all intentions” attains enlightenment in the realm of Unsurpassed [called] Richly Adorned, doing so in the following way: Dwelling in the heart of awakening,[43] through the force of having actualized the mind of unsurpassable awakening, one remains in equanimity in the unstirring contemplation possessed of six qualities.[44] At that time, all the transcendent ones of the ten directions arouse one from that contemplation and impart the instructions on the five awakenings.[45] Thereupon, by contemplating these five awakenings [in sequence], one attains perfect awakening, in essence the five pristine awarenesses.[46]
This state of enlightenment possesses the characteristics of the three dimensions of awakening: the reality dimension, in flavor identical to the four pristine awarenesses, in essence the pristine awareness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena; the enjoyment dimension in its major aspect, the manifestation in the Great Unsurpassed Realm as form endowed with five certainties, and the enjoyment dimension in its minor aspect, which, as the all-powerful sovereign, emanates the mandala, teaches [yoga tantra], and so forth, on the summit of Mount Meru and at other locations; and the manifest dimension which demonstrates the twelve deeds,[47] such as dwelling in the Joyful Realm, and so forth.
Thus, although [traversing the stages and paths in] yoga tantra does take a long time, ultimate buddhahood will be achieved within one minor aeon.

The name of this system is “highest yoga tantra” (or “great yoga tantra”), “yoga” because it inseparably unites method and wisdom; “great,” being supreme among all tantras; and “highest” since there is no other tantra above it. This is substantiated by the following passage from the Kalachakra Root Tantra:
Yoga is not composed of method alone, Nor is it exclusively wisdom.
The Transcendent One taught yoga As the union of method and wisdom.
and this statement in the Commentary on the Indestructible Tent:[1]
That which is known as “highest of all tantras” is the highest yoga tantra because it surpasses action, conduct, and yoga tantras.
The essence of highest yoga tantra is as described in the Compendium [on the Indestructible Pristine Awareness Tantra]:[2]
In the midst of an entourage of queens, in the form of an all-powerful sovereign, and by means of the contemplation of great bliss, to dwell perfectly in the bhaga of the queen; to train in accordance with sublime vajra words, the statements of six parameters, contrary to worldly customs; and to practice [deity yoga] to effect the objects of practice [(i.e., powers)]: these apply to great yoga tantra.
To clarify this passage, the following elements are said to apply to, or be contained within, highest (great) yoga tantra: In the midst of an entourage of queens, in the form of an all-powerful sovereign such as Heruka (in mother tantra) or Vairochana (in father tantra);[3] and by means of the contemplation of the great bliss of the male and female [deities'] union, to be the “king who resides in the castle” (as is said in the tantras), which means to dwell perfectly in the queen's bhaga,[4] that is, in the divine palace in the source of phenomena; to train according to the sublime vajra words,[5] the statements of six parameters—interpretable, non-interpretable, provisional, definitive, standard, and coined terminology6—which are contrary to worldly human customs (as is said in the tantras, “Success is rapidly achieved by relying on one's mother, sister, or daughter”7) by performing extremely base acts; and thereby to effect ordinary and supreme powers.

There seem to be a few ways of condensing the meaning of the highest yoga tantra from the perspectives of the different sets of tantra and individual masters. Of these, the main one is as found in the Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra:[8]
Tantra denotes continuousness.
It is composed of three aspects:
Ground, nature, and inalienableness.
When distinguished in this way,
The nature aspect is the cause;
The ground aspect refers to the method;
And inalienableness, the result.
These three contain tantra's meaning.
Since [this tantra's] composition of three continuums is widely known, it will be presented according to that format.
The term “tantra” [“continuum”] denotes the mind of awakening, Ever-Perfect (Samantabhadra), which has neither beginning nor end, in nature luminous clarity. It is “continuous” since, from time without beginning up to the attainment of enlightenment, it has always been present without any interruption.
Tantra has “three [aspects]”: the “nature” or causal continuum, from the perspective of being the fundamental cause [for awakening]; “ground” or continuum of method, from the perspective of being the contributory condition [for awakening]; and “inalienableness” or resultant continuum, from the perspective of being the awakening that is the perfect fulfillment of the two goals [of one's own and others' welfare].[9]
The meaning of this alone is of crucial importance in understanding this tantra and will therefore be explained here in a concise form.

The causal continuum denotes the natural condition of mind from the level of a sentient being to the state of a buddha, which abides, like the sky, without ever changing. There are any number of expressions for this, such as “nature,” “essence of enlightenment,” and “naturally present affinity,” found in the sutras; and “essential principle of oneself,” “awakening mind,” and “mind of Ever-Perfect,” found in the lower tantras. In this system of highest yoga tantra, however, the causal continuum may be explained in conjunction with the meaning of the union of e and vam.
The natural condition of the mind is possessed of three features: remaining unchanged from the level of a sentient being until the state of a buddha; being an inner knowing, whose characteristic nature is one's intrinsic self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own nature];[10] and being supreme immutable great bliss. This natural condition itself, called by various names such as “reality as it is,” “causal Vajradhara,” “original buddha,” and so forth, is represented by the syllable vam.
That reality, owing to the crucial fact of being the mind which is the very nature of things, presents itself with form or appearance.[11] In the impure state, its appearance manifests as the aggregates and other constituents of an ordinary being in cyclic existence. In the both-pure-and-impure state, it arises as the infinite visions of the contemplation of a yogin. In the utterly pure state,[12] it appears in the form of a wheel of inexhaustible ornaments of the body, speech, and mind of a buddha. That which has the nature of these manifold forms is called “emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects,” or “totality of forms,” “totality of faculties,” and so forth, and is represented by the syllable e.
The union of what is represented by e and by vam is referred to as the “causal continuum,” “cause” in terms of being the fundamental stuff of awakening and “continuum,” because it exists from time without beginning as the nature of the mind and continues from the level of a sentient being until the state of a buddha. [Maitreya's] Jewel Affinity states:[13]
From beginningless time, unfettered
By the shell of beings' emotions,
The nature of mind is stainless
And is said to have no beginning.
Another reference to “nature” is found in [Nagarjuna's] Fundamental Verses Called Wisdom:[14]
The nature is pure and unmodified And does not depend on anything else.
As stated here, the nature is not something created anew by causes and conditions or some reification but is the authentic condition of mind's very essence.

In a broad sense, the term “ground” refers to all possible aspects of the path which allow one to progress from [first] awakening one's affinity [for the universal way][15] until realization of the [fully] awakened state; and, in a strict sense, to the initiations which ripen one and the path which effects liberation, along with all its branches. These aspects constitute the “ground” because they serve as the support for the attaining of and abiding in the result, which is awakening, just as the earth provides the ground for the growth of new shoots.
“Continuum” refers to the connectedness of all aspects of the path. The two powers (provisional and ultimate) are connected to the two phases of the path [generation and completion]; the two phases, connected to the pledges and vows as their support; and the pledges and vows, connected to initiations, which provide the entrance [to the highest yoga tantra].
The term “method” is used because the path itself serves as the contributory condition in the actualization of the result of awakening. Method includes both the distant method and the close. The distant method comprises all aspects of the path, from the three ways of the perfections [i.e., the ways of the proclaimers, solitary sages, and bodhisattvas] up to and including yoga tantra; and the close method, the two phases of the path of the great yoga tantra, as well as the branches, which are practiced after having received the initiation.

The “resultant continuum” denotes becoming the foundation for others' welfare when the fundamental cause, freed from all adventitious stains, transforms into the state of full awakening as the dimension endowed with the two purities.[16]
Such a foundation would deteriorate or be lost if the result [of awakening] meant a state of temporary reversal of the obstacles caused by obscurations, or the perfect peace [that is the goal] of inferior [spiritual pursuits,] characterized as the cessation of the stream of consciousness.[17] This is not the case here, where the result means a permanent and continuous state, and is therefore referred to as “inalienableness.”
As long as space exists, there will be sentient beings, and as long as sentient beings exist, the awakened state continues without interruption. The result is therefore called “continuum” owing to its permanent character. It is called “result” since it is the final main goal yearned for by all bodhisattvas who practice according to the method of mantra.
The above discussion of the three continuums is based on [Abhayakara's] elucidation in Awn of Esoteric Instructions.
What follows now is an explanation of this subject that is very easily understood: All of the distinct appearances (such as environments, bodies, resources, [notions of ] time, perceptions, mentations, and conceptual constructs) that are experienced by these [beings] widely known as “sentient beings of five classes”[18] are produced by the inconceivable force of actions perpetrated by each one of them. Like falling hairs seen by someone with a cataract, these appearances are merely deceptive visions, which seem to be separate from oneself but in fact are not, arising due to the habitual tendencies of beginningless ignorance.
Even at the very moment of the exuberance of these appearances, the ground of their manifestation, the mind which is by nature luminous clarity, is present without the tarnish of the habitual tendencies [that create] deceptive visions: This mind of luminous clarity is called the causal continuum.

By means of the esoteric instructions of an authentic master, one develops familiarity with [the understanding that] whatever appears is the very essence of luminous clarity, with nothing to be eliminated or added. Alternatively, persons incapable of that practice would cultivate the method whereby all appearances are freely enjoyed as the various displays of gods and goddesses within the limitlessly ornamented palace of the transcendent ones. Having approached the pristine awareness of luminous clarity in either of those ways, one stabilizes the practice of familiarization with this pristine awareness [so that it is] continuous like the current of a river. This is called the continuum of the path.
One develops continuous familiarization in that way, and at some point, although one's mind manifests freely in the form of the entire range of the knowable, since the stains of deception have then been totally exhausted, dualistic impressions are absent, and the mind [is realized] as great pristine awareness of self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own nature], the very essence of the state of union[19] free from all obscurations.
As this state is undefiled by even the slightest concept, construct, or subject and object duality, there manifests spontaneously the awakened activity that completely and fortuitously fulfills all aspirations of sentient beings throughout the infinity of space, without partiality and in accordance with their interests, intentions, and faculties. This awakened activity is called the resultant continuum.

The causal continuum has been described by Tibetan philosophers in a number of contradictory ways. However, the prevalent view on this subject has been mentioned above. Here, the causal continuum will be discussed according to the elucidation of Shantigupta, a heruka in this age of conflict, and his lineage:[1]
Essence, principal nature, characteristics,
Synonyms, attributes, temporal states, and immutability:
These epitomize the causal continuum.
Accordingly, the causal continuum is explained in seven points, the first of which is its essence:

Its synonyms include terms such as continuum of cause, ground of purification, ground-of-all, and original buddha. Each of these has several distinctions.
“Cause” [in “continuum of cause”] comprises the following fourteen causes: the cause of emotional afflictions; the cause of karma; the cause of thorough affliction (suffering), the environment, and the inhabitants; the cause of the path; the cause of emptiness, bliss, and their union; the cause of the coarse, the subtle, and the very subtle; the cause of the two form dimensions, and the cause of the reality dimension of awakening.
“Ground” [in “ground of purification”] comprises the following fifteen grounds: the ground of the purity of the environment, the ground of the purity of the inhabitants, the ground of the purity of offerings, the ground of the purity of the transformations, and the ground of the purity of their natures; the ground of cyclic existence, the ground of perfect peace, and the ground of their natures; the ground of the partial, and the ground of the final; the ground of the relative, and the ground of the ultimate; the ground of the coarse, the ground of the subtle, and the ground of the very subtle.
The first five, beginning with the purity of the environment, are distinctions in the basis of purification in terms of karmic actions and activities. The next three, beginning with the ground of cyclic existence, are distinctions in terms of liberation and bondage. The next two, the grounds of the partial and the final, are distinctions in terms of what is nominal and what is real. The next two, the grounds of the relative and the ultimate, are distinctions in terms of substantial and designative existence. The last three are distinctions in terms of the manner of realization.
Moreover, the ground of the coarse comprises nine [aspects], distinguished according to characteristics and types of persons. Sandalwood, utpala flower, lotus, red lotus, and jewel-like persons represent five distinctions based on characteristics.[2] Differentiations in emotional afflictions, karma, physical traits, and family represent four distinctions based on types. These [last four] are conceptual designations applied to persons.
The “ground-of-all”[3] corresponds to the way it is explained in the context of the way of characteristics. The “original buddha” is twofold: the intrinsic original buddha and the sudden original buddha.[4]

The causal continuum is possessed of interrelated flaws and qualities, or causes and results, [explained as follows]:
In the causal continuum are obscurations of the four states (waking, dream, deep sleep, and sexual union) present as flaws or causes, together with qualities or results, which are the four joys and the four [stages of experience of ] light.[5]
Similarly, that which has the meaning of evam maya,[6] the four channel-wheels, as well as the four winds and four vital essences,[7] are accompanied by stains and dispersion,[8] owing to which these are reified as the “four families,” “four tantras,” “four beings,” “four qualities,” “four periods,” and so on,[9] and are present as flaws or causes. At the same time, four habitual tendencies generate four notions: the notion that everything truly exists, the notion that everything is subtle particles, the notion that everything is mind only, and the notion that not even the mind has true existence. From these notions originate the views associated with the four [Buddhist] philosophies, the four [original Buddhist] schools, the four moments [of an act], the four joys, the four truths, and so on.[10]
These views, along with the four seals,[11] serve to purify stains. When a certain degree of freedom from stains and absence of dispersion is achieved, both flaws and qualities, or causes and results, come to be present mutually related.
[As the very nature of the causal continuum is] perfectly realized just as it is, a total freedom from stains and absence of dispersion is achieved. Consequently, the causal continuum manifests solely as qualities and results, such as the four dimensions of awakening or the four indestructible states.[12]

The immutability of the causal continuum refers to its essence, which remains unaffected when passing from a former to a later state. Thus, the causal continuum is neither destroyed nor modified by birth, old age, sickness, death, migration, [twelve] links of dependent origination, logical investigation, truths, absorption in the nonconceptual state, or the resultant indestructible contemplation.
The causal continuum should be understood by means of these seven points.

This exceptional system of exposition [originates with] the lord of attainment, Tilopa, who directly received from a pristine awareness sky-farer the esoteric instructions [contained in] the tantra Perfect Words.[1] The tantra states:
The [three] stages: the authentic condition of things,
The path, and the arising of the result.
Accordingly, all of the content of the path of highest yoga tantra is included in three stages: the ground or authentic condition of things; the path; and the arising of the result [of awakening]. On the first, [Tilopa] states:[2]
The authentic condition of phenomena is twofold:
That of the body and that of the mind.
To explain, “authentic condition” denotes the nature, or way of being, of all phenomena, inclusive of everything from form to omniscience. The authentic condition is also called the “total seal at the ground stage,” “primordial reality,” “original lord,” “affinity for enlightenment,” and “essence of enlightenment.” On that basis of division, there are two authentic conditions of things, that of the body and that of the mind, when distinguished in terms of the way the authentic condition manifests.[3]

The causal continuum, the essence of enlightenment, is commonly known as an “affinity.” This affinity seems to be described in a number of different ways by philosophers. Therefore, it is important to have at least a partial understanding of their views.
Analysts maintain that the mental factor of detachment with regard to worldly life and worldly possessions, with few desires and an attitude of contentment, is the affinity of an exalted person.
Traditionists consider affinity to be a mental seed, the potency that can give rise to immaculate pristine awareness.
Idealists or experientialists consider affinity to be the potency that generates immaculate qualities, which has always been present in mind's continuum from time without beginning. This potency is asserted to exist due to the very nature of reality.
In the centrist tradition, there is agreement, for the most part, in asserting that the affinity is the true nature [of mind], just as it is, attended by stains. However, the different ways of identifying that true nature are extremely numerous. This has given rise, here in Tibet, to arguments over the various distinct views [on the affinity], with a countless number of persons speaking only nonsense.
In the context of the indestructible way, the essence of enlightenment is defined in different ways. The patriarchs of the magnificent Sakya [tradition] explain that [the essence of enlightenment] is mind's nature, which is intrinsically pure. They state that although the qualities [of enlightenment] are not actually manifest in that essence, they are nevertheless inherently present as seeds. When the result [of enlightenment] is actualized by means of the contributory factors of the two accumulations [merit and wisdom] or practice of the two phases [generation and completion], the qualities of enlightenment are attained through a transformation of those seeds.
The great omniscient one of Jomonang[4] [distinguishes two types of affinity], the naturally present and the evolving. He maintains that the naturally present affinity endowed with the thirty-two qualities of the reality dimension of awakening[5] is present in all sentient beings as a natural attribute and has always been since the beginning of time. This affinity is a real buddha that is concealed in adventitious stains. The evolving affinity, on the other hand, is acquired anew, generated through the contributory factors of propensities developed in hearing the teachings, and so forth.

The outstanding Tibetan master Sangwé Jin [Bodong Choklé Namgyal][6] describes affinity as the most refined essence of body, speech, and mind, known as “the indestructible refined essence possessed of three features.”
Lord Tsongkapa and his followers explain affinity in terms of negation only, as the “emptiness of mind being devoid of true existence.”
The magnificent [Third Karmapa] Rangjung Dorjé maintains that the essence of enlightenment is ordinary awareness itself,[7] which transcends definition and conceptual characteristics. It is, in nature, the indivisibility of pristine awareness and the ultimate dimension of phenomena; like the moon's reflection on water, it is neither true nor false.[8]
The omniscient Longchenpa makes the following statement in his Commentary on the Wish-Fulfilling Treasury:
That which is primordially uncompounded, the pristine awareness that is one's intrinsic self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own nature], ineffable emptiness and clarity: this is the essence of enlightenment. The Jewel Affinity says:[9]
As it was, so it shall be:
It is the unchanging nature of reality.
Explanations on the part of followers of these masters are given solely in accordance with the above traditions, apart from minor degrees of refinement in their presentations.
This concludes an overview of the ways of defining the causal continuum.

Mind's nature, which is undifferentiable from the sixty-four qualities of enlightenment,[10] is intrinsically pure, in itself luminous clarity, the empti
ness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena. This nature of mind, referred to as the “naturally present affinity,” is the ground of everything in both cyclic life and perfect peace. It is described as having three distinguishing features: its arisal in a continuous stream from time without beginning; its presence due to the very nature of reality; and its resemblance to the six superior sense fields.
The first feature indicates that since this affinity has arisen continuously since beginningless time, it is not one that is acquired anew.
The second feature indicates that the affinity is present, with no distinctions, in every sentient being, as the very nature of reality.
The third feature indicates that the affinity bears seeds that are virtually identical, and equal in fortune, to the six immaculate sense fields [of a buddha] inherent in the six sense fields of a sentient being.[11]
The perfectly acquired evolving affinity, according to the omniscient one of Jonang, is one that has not existed previously, but arises anew. Rangjung Dorjé describes this affinity as the mind's nature, which is intrinsically pure, undifferentiable from the emptiness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena. Being the stainless essence of the eightfold group of consciousnesses,[12] it exists as the nature of the four pristine awarenesses. [The evolving affinity is so called] because it is an affinity that serves as the base from which evolve the two form dimensions of awakening.
What this means is that as a result of having perfectly developed wholesome qualities, the stain of not recognizing the very essence of the eightfold group of consciousnesses is overcome. The eightfold group of consciousnesses are thereby liberated as self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own nature]. When this occurs—[a process] called “transformation of the eightfold group of consciousnesses into the four pristine awarenesses”—the pristine awarenesses appear to others' perception as the form dimensions of awakening.
Expressed concisely, the victorious Rangjung Dorjé and others [define] the nature of mind attended by stains [in this way]: Its unborn essence is the naturally present affinity, and its unimpeded nature, the evolving affinity. Hence, mind's nature attended by stains is called the “union of the two dimensions of awakening [formless and form] attended by stains.” As for the nature of mind purified of stains, its unborn essence is the reality dimension of awakening, which serves one's own welfare, and its unimpeded nature manifests as the form dimension, which serves others' welfare. Hence, the nature of mind cleansed of stains is called the “union of the two dimensions of awakening devoid of stains.”

The continuum of the ground, or essence of enlightenment, as has just been described, pervades the minds of all embodied beings. It is, however, concealed by adventitious stains (as elucidated in the Jewel Affinity using nine metaphors). As is said:
Not seeing what is; seeing what is not.
Thus, there [arises] deception which misapprehends the essence. [What follows now is an explanation of] the stains that conceal the essence of enlightenment, illustrated by nine metaphors.
The stains present in the mind of a mere sentient being who has not yet entered the path are the [karmic traces of ] wholesome and unwholesome actions which serve solely as the cause of cyclic existence. These stains, characterized by strong or rough mental states, are of four types—attachment, aversion, delusion, and the three mixed in equal proportions—and are illustrated by four metaphors, that of a lotus, [a swarm of] honeybees, a husk, and a swamp.
The habitual tendencies of ignorance present in the mind of an arhat, either a proclaimer or solitary sage, are the obscurations that conceal the essence of enlightenment. The nature [of these stains] is illustrated by the metaphor of the earth covering a treasure buried below [the dwelling of] a pauper.
The stains to be forsaken on the path of seeing in the universal way which are present in the mind of an ordinary person[13] who is training [on the path] are illustrated by the metaphor of [a shoot's] skins.
The stains to be forsaken on the [universal way's] path of meditation which are [still] present in the mind of an exalted being [who has attained the path of seeing] are illustrated by the metaphor of an old rag.
Of the stains [to be forsaken] on the ten stages of awakening which are present in beings who dwell on those stages, stains that apply to the first seven impure stages are illustrated by the metaphor of a womb, and those that apply to the three pure stages, by the metaphor of a clay mold holding a golden image.
The essence [of enlightenment] in each of the above cases is illustrated by the metaphors, respectively, of a buddha concealed in the hollow of a lotus; honey [guarded] by honeybees; a kernel within its husk; gold in a swamp; treasure buried in the earth; a shoot in its skins; a buddha statue wrapped in an old rag; a [future] ruler [still] in the womb; and a golden image [still] in its clay mold.[14]

When the essence of enlightenment is thoroughly impure due to adventitious stains, it is designated “sentient being.” When it is possessed of both the pure and the impure, it is called “bodhisattva dwelling on the path.” When it is utterly pure, it is called “transcendent one.”
To explain, the impure state denotes that state of being subject to cyclic existence created by karmic actions and emotional afflictions. The bodhisattva state denotes the state at which there is freedom from karma and emotional afflictions but not yet freedom from the level of the habitual tendencies of ignorance. The state of a transcendent one denotes the state at which there is freedom from karma and emotional afflictions as well as freedom from the habitual tendencies of ignorance.
These three temporal states [of the essence of enlightenment] are asserted from the perspective of relative deception, while the essence of enlightenment itself, in being the nature of the ultimate dimension of reality, never changes.

The [Mahayana] Phenomenology Scripture states:[15]
The dimension with no beginning in time
Is the abode of all phenomena.
Owing to its being, cyclic life
And perfect peace are experienced.
Accordingly, that known as the “essence of enlightenment” has been present since time without beginning and serves as the basis upon which phenomena of cyclic life and perfect peace are conceived as deception or liberation. This essence is extremely difficult to fathom by anyone other than a buddha. Because it is entwined by four paradoxes, it is said to be taught to bodhisattvas of exceptionally sharp faculties. The Jewel Affinity states the four paradoxes in the following way:[16]
Because it is pure, yet possessed of emotional afflictions, Because it is without thorough affliction, yet [regains] purity,
Because it has no disparity, yet [attains] qualities,
Because it is spontaneous, yet without concepts....
To expand, the true nature [of the essence of enlightenment] attended by stains is, at exactly the same time, utterly pure, and yet attended by the stains of thorough affliction. This paradox signifies its nature.
The true nature [of the essence of enlightenment] free from stains has never in the past been sullied by the stains that produce thorough affliction, and yet through the subsequent cultivation of the path, it regains its purity. This paradox signifies its awakening.

The essence of enlightenment is possessed of the stainless qualities of a buddha, such as the ten powers, as its very nature for which there is no disparity [even] in the state of an ordinary being; hence, it does not differ in this respect from a previous phase to a later one. Nonetheless, through the subsequent clearing away of stains, it attains these qualities anew. This paradox signifies its qualities.
The essence of enlightenment is the activity of a buddha, effortlessly and spontaneously fulfilling the hopes and objectives of those to be guided, in accordance with their individual good fortunes. Nonetheless, it is not subject to conceptuality such as resolving to do one thing or another. This paradox signifies its activity.
The intrinsically pure nature of the essence of enlightenment is the source to be realized and the base to be purified. Awakening is the very essence of the realization of one's intrinsically pure nature and the qualities that are the result arising from that realization. Awakened activity in various forms is the means through which this nature comes to be realized by others. These last three—realization, qualities, and activity—function as purificatory factors. From the base and those [three] factors arises the result, the Three Jewels. Thus, [the Jewel Affinity] says:[17]
This affinity for the Three Jewels
Is the domain of the omniscient ones.
Only a buddha fully comprehends the unobscured authentic condition of the affinity; others do not. Accordingly, [the Jewel Affinity] states:[18]
The inconceivable [essence] that is realized
By those embodying pristine awareness,
Being subtle, is not an object of study;
Being ultimate, is not an object of reflection; Being of a profound nature, is not an object Of meditation such as the mundane kind. Like form to the congenitally blind, It has never been seen by the childish. Like the sun to a newborn still inside his home, It is seen not even by the exalted ones.
Next is the uncommon explanation of the essence of enlightenment enhanced by a special feature [found] in the system of highest yoga tantra.

The common perspective on the authentic condition of mind [as discussed above] is enhanced in the highest system of mantra by an additional special feature. There are several ways in which this explanation is given. However, the essence of enlightenment as spoken of in the way of the perfections can be considered to be the causal continuum in the system of the great yoga tantra, in which case the uncommon and special feature is what is known as self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own nature], the nature of great bliss. An extensive discussion of this now follows.
[Tilopa's] Perfect Words states:[19]
Evam, the nature of method and wisdom, Abides in the center of the body As total pristine awareness present in the body.
The method [aspect] referred to in this verse is emphasized in the father tantra, while the wisdom [aspect] is emphasized in the mother tantra. Each has its own way of elucidating the union [of method and wisdom], the nature of evam. Simply put, the father tantra speaks of the “ultimate dimension of phenomena,” which is indivisible profundity [emptiness] and clarity [pristine awareness]. As to the way it is described, [Buddhashrijnana's] Liberative Essence states:[20]
Totally free from any kind of concept,
Utterly inconceivable and inexpressible,
Like space, the stainless source of everything:
It is known as profundity beyond scrutiny.
Bearing the form of the total seal,
It is like a magical illusion or a rainbow,
Purifying one's own and others' minds:
It is known as sublime clarity.
The supreme nature of their indivisibility
Is the essence that pervades all things,
Utterly untouched by cyclic existence:
It is known as the ultimate dimension of phenomena.[21]

According to the mother tantra, the natural glow of primordially pure pristine awareness is present as “semen” [white vital essence] and “ovum” [red vital essence]. The element of “semen” generates the body, while the element of “ovum” generates speech, which is of the nature of wind. [Body and speech] are each referred to as a “body.” That which depends on, or abides in, these two bodies is known as the “pristine awareness dimension of great bliss nature.” In this system, this represents the essence of enlightenment. The Hevajra Tantra states:[22]
Great pristine awareness is present in the body.
Totally devoid of all conceptuality,
It is that which pervades all things.
Although abiding in the body, it did not arise from it.[23]
The Kalachakra [Condensed] Tantra says:[24]
That being the case, the Foremost One [Kalachakra] explained
the body's innate bliss[25] of non-emission in the way of [secret] mantra.
The mind in its aspect of not recognizing the very essence of such bliss is termed “darkness.” Accordingly, “buoyancy” [white vital essence], “motility” [red vital essence], and “darkness” [ignorance] denote body, speech, and mind[26] in the impure phase, and the three indestructible states of awakened body, speech, and mind in the pure phase. As is said in the Kalachakra [Root Tantra]:[27]
[Vam] is declared to be a sphere, moon, “semen,” and awakened body;
[E is] the aspiration sign, “ovum,” sun, and awakened speech;
The syllable a is Rahu, awakened mind.
The element of space exists as e.
The effect of not realizing that great bliss is the unfolding of cyclic existence. The effect of realization of great bliss is becoming a buddha. Thus, bliss is also called the natural condition of, nature of, or affinity for, both cyclic existence and perfect peace.
When bliss has not been realized, all phenomena of the state of cyclic existence—the outer environment, the bodies, voices, and minds of the inhabitants [sentient beings], and so on—arise from the qualities of “motility,” “darkness,” and “buoyancy.” When bliss has been realized, all the dimensions of buddhas and their realms manifest from the nature of that great bliss.
The darkness aspect of bliss is designated as the “luminous clarity of the total empty” and the “indestructible vital essence which is the root of cyclic existence.” This constitutes the final [impediment] to be overcome by innate pristine awareness. [Aryadeva's] [Lamp] Summary of Tantric Practices states:[28]
All beings are without freedom
As they are not born out of free will.
The cause of their condition is luminous clarity:
The luminous clarity of the total empty.
The luminous clarity referred to in this verse exists within the same collection as “semen” [white vital essence], “ovum” [red vital essence], and wind; this collection is also present in the formless realm comprising very subtle elements.[29] It encompasses all the states of mind within cyclic existence. Therefore, in Kalachakra, such a collection is taught using expressions such as the “ground-of-all consciousness,” “habitual tendency for emission,” “mind of the fourth state” and “obscuration of dispersion.”[30]

Many expressions such as “suchness” and “perfect end” are found in [Buddhashrijnana's] Oral Teachings of Manjushri.[32] In other sources, the ground continuum is taught using many synonyms such as evam, aham, and nada.[33]

The essence of enlightenment, or ground-of-all,[34] does not fall to the side of either cyclic existence or perfect peace, nor can it be partitioned. Nonetheless, it serves as the ground for the unimpeded manifestation of all appearances of cyclic existence and perfect peace; hence, it is a support. Supported by it are the ground-of-all consciousness (which is simply [a collection of] habitual tendencies), the instigative [subjective] mind, the sixth or mental consciousness, and the five sense consciousnesses.[35] This eightfold group [of consciousnesses] and attendant mental factors are adventitious stains that can be shed. Therefore, it is this latter appropriating consciousness,[36] or ground-of-all at the level of the habitual tendencies based on ignorance, which was declared [by the Buddha] to be the root of cyclic existence. Reference to this is found in discourses and commentaries that pertain to the last cycle of [Buddha's] teachings.[37]
That being the case, coemergent with [mind's] true nature, just as it is— the primordial, or root, indestructible great vital essence38—is ignorance of it. Owing to this ignorance, wind that is as though mixed with that very [vital essence] activates the subjective mind. When this movement is not recognized for what it is, due to the influence of the red aspect [vital essence] of manifestation, there arise the appearances of cyclic existence and perfect peace: this is the conception of other. Due to the influence of the white aspect [vital essence], there arises the sense of self,[39] and thus the eightfold group of consciousnesses unfolds.[40]
In brief, stirred by the movement of wind, the red and white [vital essences] initiate the dualistic split into apprehended and apprehender, or appearances and mind, self and other, subject and object, and so on. All conceptions of self are the unborn essence that is [mind's] true nature, or emptiness aspect; all conceptions of other arise as the unimpeded nature, or appearance aspect: This represents the manifestation of the various deceptive appearances of both cyclic existence and perfect peace.
In that [process], of what is there ignorance? Of one's true nature, just as it is, the intrinsically pure essence.
Due to what is there ignorance? Due to the unimpeded creative energy through which the essence of that true nature falsely manifests as subject-object duality.
In what way does ignorance unfold? The cause for ignorance and deception regarding immutable great bliss is the habitual tendency for mutable [bliss].[41] From this tendency, the twelve links of dependent origination again arise. As stated in Pundarika's Great Commentary on the Kalachakra Tantra, cyclic existence arises from habitual tendency; and habitual tendency, from cyclic existence, in a circular way.

Still within the uncommon system of mantra, next is explained the manner of deception in cyclic existence according to the father tantra system.
The four empties (the luminous clarity of the total empty, [great empty, very empty, and empty]) give rise to the four elemental properties [wind, fire, water, and earth].[42] The group of these together is considered to be the root that determines beings' migration [in cyclic existence]. Accordingly, Aryadeva [in his Stages of Self-Blessing] states:[43]
One should understand that the eight constituents— The four elements, earth, and so on, And, likewise, the four empties–Are the causes of creation and destruction.
To explain, first, from the luminous clarity ground-of-all [at death], the total empty, emerges only the afflicted mind of ignorance, which is the great empty, or “full culmination.” From that emerges the variety of mental events, the very empty, or “increase of light.” From that arises “light” as [the duality of ] apprehended and apprehender, manifesting as the six [sense] consciousnesses in their coarse aspects; this is the empty.[44] From that arise the four elements and other constituents. The way this process occurs is described in the Compendium on the [Indestructible] Pristine Awareness [Tantra]:[45]
The consciousness that arises from luminous clarity is called mind, [afflicted] mind, and [sense] consciousnesses.[46] That is the root of all phenomena. It is possessed of a nature that is both thoroughly afflicted and utterly pure. From that consciousness, two conceptions develop, that of self and that of other. From that consciousness, wind arises; from wind, fire; from fire, water; and from water, earth. From these elements arise the five aggregates, the six sense fields, and the five objects, all of which are mixed with consciousness.
In this way is explained the unfolding of the wheel of cyclic existence as consciousness arises from ignorance of luminous clarity, and so on.

According to the mother tantra system, cyclic existence arises from mundane innate bliss.[47] [Pundarika's] Great Commentary [on the Kalachakra Tantra] states:
The creator is that which possesses the characteristic of the ground-
of-all consciousness: the relative and mundane innate joy [at] the
moment of the emission of semen.
“That which possesses the characteristic of the ground-of-all consciousness” serves as the cause of ignorance. When “semen” [white vital essence] and “ovum” [red vital essence] meet, the mind experiences bliss. Through this experience, the ground-of-all is “blessed”[48] and becomes of one flavor with the bliss, as though unconscious. Such bliss is the agent of a being's emergence into life (conception) and withdrawal from life (death).
To explain, at death, the white [vital essence], red [vital essence], and mind mix at the heart, and at conception they mix in the womb. Since nothing but the pristine awareness of a buddha can split [such a union], it is called the “indestructible vital essence.” This is what is referred to as the “evam” of the causal continuum, the nature or the root of the thirty-six [psychophysical constituents], the aggregates, elements, and so on.[49]
Holders of esoteric instructions point out that mental states of the same type are also called the ground-of-all, examples being the fourth state and the dazed state of mind when one is physically exhausted.

The highest mantra system teaches that deception arises from the three [stages of experience of ] light [i.e., the “three lights”— light, increase of light, and culmination of light]; or from the white and red [aspects] being moved by wind. The way of the perfections teaches that the ground-of-all consciousness is drawn by the afflicted mind and the force of karma created by adhering to a self, and takes birth in the three worlds. These two views are basically identical.
Within the tantra sets are found several different estimations [of the number of elements in the process of deception], such as a threefold mode [of enumeration] based on the differentiation of “semen” [white vital essence] and “ovum” [red vital essence] into apprehended and apprehender, plus wind; a fourfold mode, when pristine awareness is considered separate from ovum; and so on. Despite these distinctions, the crucial point [which will now be presented] is the same.
When the great root indestructible [essence] is not recognized, there is movement [of ignorance]. Owing to the influence of the white vital essence (the apprehending quality), there arise the three lights which have as their root a conception of intrinsic reality. The “doors” of manifestation of the three lights arise as follows:
The definitive quality of wind (whose nature is the unborn essence) manifesting as objects gives rise to the appearances of the formless realm.
The definitive quality of ovum [red vital essence] (whose nature is the unimpeded nature) manifesting as objects gives rise to the appearances of the form realm.
The definitive quality of semen [white vital essence] (whose nature is the manifold expression) manifesting as objects gives rise to the appearances of the desire realm.
By grasping to these appearances as existent in themselves, the [process of] taking birth in the three realms is gradually initiated. What is experienced [i.e., which of the three realms] is determined by how subtle or coarse is the dispersion of the elemental properties [of earth, water, fire, wind, and space]; and which of the four modes of birth occurs depends on which of earth, water, fire, or wind is predominant.[1]
Among these possibilities, the best [form of life, or] “support,” for being a suitable recipient of the indestructible way of secret mantra is birth in [one of] the three continents, the eastern, southern, or western. Any of those births has all the characteristics of the manifest dimension of awakening [although still] attended by stains. Of those, the most exceptional is birth here in [the southern continent called] the Land of Jambu, place of actions. Such a birth is best because one is thereby endowed with the six elements [space, wind, fire, water, earth, and pristine awareness], and replete with all features of the vajra body which is the ground where purification [through tantric practice] is effected.[2]

Accordingly, the aggregates, elements, and sense fields are all formed from the channels, winds, and vital essences; and these three, from mind nature, the essence of enlightenment, attended by stains. For this reason, birth in the world in itself is taught to be the supreme manifest dimension of awakening, attended by stains. Accordingly, the Hevajra Tantra states:[3]
The womb's wall is one's monastic robe;
One's mother, the preceptor;
Palms together touching the head, an act of homage;
And life's activities, the observance of ethics.
The recitation of mantra, a and ham;
The form of the mandala at the womb, a;
And the aspect of great bliss, ham;
With a naked body and hairless head and face,
One is a monk who is born while reciting mantras.
Owing to these conditions, all sentient beings
Are buddhas, there is no doubt.
Moreover, the ten months are the stages of awakening;
Beings are already lords of the ten stages.[4]
The meaning of this passage is that of the three dimensions at the ground phase when the mind is attended by stains, birth is appearance as the manifest dimension. This impure dimension itself is the ground which becomes the supreme manifest dimension when stains are purified.
Of the six elements, [some] beings are possessed of only one element, that of space, as in the four [levels of the] formless realm; [others] have up to five elements (space, wind, fire, water, and earth), as in the first level of meditative absorption [of the form realm].[5] Beings of the six classes within the desire realm[6] have not only all five elements but also the element of pristine awareness, which is the release of regenerative fluid,[7] and are thereby possessed of six elements.
The term “body” denotes a collection, which in this case comprises the following: marrow, bone, and sinew (or hair) produced by semen; and skin, flesh, and blood produced by ovum,[8] together referred to as the “six treasuries.” The vajra body is the collection of these six, plus the thirty-six psychophysical constituents.
The thirty-six psychophysical constituents are the six aggregates (forms, feelings, discriminations, compositional factors, consciousnesses, and pristine awarenesses); the six elements (earth, water, fire, wind, space, and consciousness); the six sense powers (eye sense power, ear sense power, nose sense power, tongue sense power, body sense power, and mental sense power); their six objects (visible forms, sounds, odors, tastes, tangible objects, and [mental] phenomena); the six action faculties (mouth faculty, arms faculty, legs faculty, anus faculty, urinary faculty, and regenerative faculty); and their six activities (speaking, taking, going, discharging faeces, discharging urine, and emitting regenerative fluid).

According to the highest yoga tantras, the arising of pristine awareness in the mind depends upon the functioning of the channels of the body.[9] It is therefore important to understand their authentic condition. To mention only names, the principal of all channels, the central one, is known by several synonyms, such as avadhuti and Brahma's cane; its upper end is called Rahu, its lower end, conch-shell (shankhini ), and so on.[10]
There are a number of assertions about the central channel: that there are two [types of] central channel, the abiding one and the one imagined in meditation (the assertion of the majority);[11] that the central channel is actually the spinal cord; that it is only the thickness of a horse-hair, located in the center of the spinal cord; that it does not exist in reality, and so forth.
The perspective of the magnificent Rangjung Dorjé is as follows: The central channel is located in the middle part of the body. It is the nonduality of the apprehended and apprehender and thus the indivisibility of method and wisdom. The root of all pristine awarenesses is the ground-of-all pristine awareness; the root of all consciousnesses, the ground-of-all consciousness. Hence, the inseparability of these two, ordinary awareness, is referred to as the “essence of enlightenment” from the perspective of its serving as the basis of enlightenment. Similarly, the root of all pristine awareness channels is the central channel; the root of all cyclic existence channels, the life channel. Hence, the inseparability of those two, the channel of Rahu, is referred to as the “life channel” from the perpective of its being the support for life.
Concisely stated, the “central channel of the ground” denotes the central channel of the body in the impure state pervaded by the dimension, or affinity, of the central channel in the pure state at the time of the result.
Through the meditations of withdrawal and the other branches [of the sixfold yoga], wind and mind enter the central channel of the body to some degree, the result of which is the manifestation externally of an empty image in the form of a black line. This is referred to as the “central channel of the path.”[12]
The “central channel of the result” abides in the supreme vajra body, which is the alternative [purified] dimension [the mandala]. It is of a nature free from obscurations. This [threefold] differentiation is made by the Eighth Karmapa [Mikyö Dorjé].

Owing to [the duality of] apprehended and apprehender, the rasana [right channel] and the lalana [left channel] branch off from the central channel. Above the navel, the three channels [right, left, and central] serve, respectively, as pathways for the threefold life [wind], the solar, lunar, and Rahu, and below the navel, as pathways for the movement of the threefold downward voiding of feces, urine, and regenerative fluids.[13]
There are twenty-four major channels which branch off from those three [principal] channels. Within the body, the twenty-four are the channels themselves; in the outer world, [these correspond to] the twenty-four [power] places; and in the alternative dimension of the mandala, these are the natures of the twenty-four yoginis of awakened mind, speech, and body.[14]
Adding to those twenty-four the five channels of the heart, which are supports for the [five] branch winds,[15] plus the three principal channels, yields thirty-two channels. [Thirty] are explained as being the fifteen goddesses of Nairatmya [in the mandala of Hevajra], the utter purity of the fifteen parts of the waxing moon and fifteen parts of the waning moon.[16] The [remaining two] are the conch-shell channel, which serves as the support for the sixteen white parts, and the free-from-demons channel, the support for the sixteen black parts.[17]
Adding the five channels that are the supports for the five root winds[18] to the above thirty-two makes a total of thirty-seven channels. At the ground [phase], these thirty-seven channels are associated with the thirty-six constituents [of the vajra body], plus the vajra mind [of pristine awareness] which pervades these constituents. At the path phase, they are associated with the thirty-seven factors conducive to awakening.[19]

Moreover, there are what are known as the five hidden channels: the triple-circle channel, which reaches the center of the eyes; the desire channel, which reaches the center of the ears; the female-householder channel, which reaches the center of nose; the fierce channel, which reaches the center of the tongue; and free-from-demons channel, which reaches the center of the uvula.[20] These five hidden channels are connected to the central one since their roots meet in the channel in the center of the heart. They emerge from indestructible luminous clarity at the heart [region] of the central channel and enter into objective experience, the perception of forms, and so on. During the phase of the path, these channels are bound and consequently become the source through which ten signs manifest.[21] Thus, they are “hidden” in being like hidden treasures or seeds.
Supported by the central channel are four (or six) channel-wheels (chakra). The term “wheel” is used because the configuration of channel[spokes] (“petals”) resembles a wheel, or, alternatively, because [like a wheel which shatters what lies in its path,] by binding crucial points and striking crucial points at these places,[22] the deceptions of the four states are shattered.
In the system of four channel-wheels, at the navel are sixty-four channel-spokes which are the purity[23] of the sixty-four winds of the [twelve] time conjunctions.[24] By binding crucial points [through the method of inner heat], one causes the waking state to arise as the realization of the manifest dimension of awakening.
At the heart are the eight channel-spokes which are the purity [of the winds] of the eight major sessions[25] of the day and night. By binding crucial points [through the method of luminous clarity], one causes the deep sleep state to arise as the realization of the reality dimension of awakening, luminous clarity.
At the throat are sixteen channel-spokes which are the purity [of the winds] of the sixteen transits.[26] By binding crucial points [through the method of dream yoga], one causes the dream state to arise as the realization of the enjoyment dimension of awakening.
At the head are thirty-two channel-spokes which are the purity [of the winds] of the [thirty-two] major clepsydra measures.[27] By binding crucial points [related to] vital essence, one causes the sexual union state to arise as the realization of the pristine awareness dimension of awakening.[28]
The Kalachakra Tantra states that there are six channel-wheels: the channel-wheel at the crown of the head [with four spokes], which is of the nature of the four major sessions; the channel-wheel at the head [with sixteen spokes], the nature of the sixteen lunar days; the channel-wheel at the throat [with thirty-two spokes], the nature of the twenty-eight constellations and the four stars [of the constellation Lyra]; the channel-wheel at the heart [with eight channels], the nature of the eight planets;[29] the channel-wheel at the navel [with sixty-four channels], the nature of the sixty-four danda measures;[30] the channel-wheel at the secret place [with thirty-two channels], the nature of the thirty-two white and black lunar days.

The system of esoteric instructions speaks of secondary channel-wheels which branch off from those major ones: the twelve in the twelve major joints [of the limbs]; and the sixty in the sixty minor joints.[31] From those [branch off ] 72,[000] subtle channels,[32] as stated in the Indestructible Garland. Concerning these, Rangjung Dorjé [in his Profound Inner Reality] says:[33]
The twenty-four thousand through which flow
The lunar [wind and white vital essence] are called the lalana type.
The twenty-four thousand through which flow
The solar [wind and red vital essence] are called the rasana type.
The twenty-four thousand through which moves
Wind [only] are called the central channel type.
Moreover, by being present in the body
The channels that are the twenty-four,
From Undivided to Noble-Hearted,[34]
Are divided into dissolved, engaged, and dominant.
That threefold split yields a total of seventy-two,
Each with a circle of a thousand channels.[35]
One hundred and fifty-six channels are said to give rise to diseases.[36] Further, the Teaching to Nanda states:[37]
There are eighty thousand channels in all [of the body].
Although there are many such enumerations [of channels], only those mentioned above need be known by practitioners on the path.
As to the sequence of formation of the channels in the womb, the central channel is the first to form, providing a support for the life wind. There, the rasana and lalana manifest due to the force of the conception of self [generated] by the afflicted mind, and the conception of other [generated] by the sixfold group [of consciousnesses]. These three principal channels are merely divisions into distinct entities owing to their mode of appearance and actually come into existence simultaneously.
From the points where the three meet with a common interior, the three channels branch off as spokes of the channel-wheels. Thus, the formation of the three principal channels is followed by the sequential formation of the one hundred and twenty spokes of the four channel-wheels (or the one hundred and fifty-six spokes of the six channel-wheels). Next form the seventy-two thousand secondary channels, followed by the thirty-five million subtle channels connected to the pores of the skin.
These channels exist as the nature of letters. What follows now is an explanation of how the channels form as letters. [Chanting the Names of Manjushri] states:[38]
A is the supreme of all letters.
Initially [at conception], the [letter] a forms in the upright position at the navel. Through the interrelationship of method [ham] and wisdom [a], ham forms upside-down at the head.[39] As a result, evam comes into being as the external world in the nature of method and wisdom.[40] Next develop the bhrum, am, dzim, kham, and hum at the heart, which are the supports for the five emotional afflictions and the five nectars.[41] Subsequently form the sixteen, ra, hya, sya, and so on, followed by the formation of the twenty-four [initial] letters of the twenty-four [power] places.[42] After that, an inconceivable number of letters develop, such as the one hundred and twenty letters [consonants].[43] Within all of these [channels in the shape of letters] is the movement of winds, through which is produced speech that carries the sound of letters.

The channels described above are created by winds. To strike the crucial points with respect to winds forms the basis of all aspects of the phase of completion of the highest yoga tantra. The term “wind” (rlung) denotes that which is possessed of potency or strength.
The wind that serves as the ground for everything in cyclic existence and perfect peace is that which is great, primordial, and indestructible. To designate it as a “wind” indicates that it is life; and since it exists as the nature of the short a,[44] it is the source of all verbal expression, the speech. From it are derived [such measures as] breath, minor clepsydra measure, danda measure, time conjunction,[45] and so on. Furthermore, from this originate all letters, the vowels and consonants. Thus, although itself inexpressible, it serves as the ground for all forms of verbal expression.
With regard to letters, the root of all vowels and consonants is a. With regard to winds, the root of all the ten winds is the life wind in the form of
a. With regard to pristine awareness, supreme immutable great bliss itself is termed “a”. Therefore, the wind that serves as the ground or source of all phenomena is this very a, referred to as “life.” Hence, all phenomena of cyclic life and perfect peace manifest from it.
Accordingly, during the formation of this vajra body, the great life wind is the first to come into being. This wind is supported by the ground-of-all consciousness, which has entered the midst of the white and red [regenerative fluids].[46] Of the five syllables, its shape is the form of the short a. Of the five elements, its nature is that of the element of space.
From the life wind emanates the downward-voiding wind. Of the five elements, its nature is that of earth; of the five syllables, its form is that of the syllable li. In a similar way is generated the upward-moving wind, whose nature is fire, and form, the syllable ri; the fire-accompanying wind, whose nature is wind, and form, the syllable i; and the pervading wind, whose nature is water, and form, the syllable u. These are the five root winds.[47]
The five branch winds are the serpent wind of the earth element, the long syllable a; the turtle wind of the wind element, the syllable e; the lizard wind of the fire element, the syllable ar; the gift-of-the-gods wind of the water element, the syllable o; and the victorious-in-wealth wind of the earth element, the syllable al. These branch winds, together with the root winds, constitute the ten winds.[48]

To expand, that which is indestructible, the totality of everything, is designated as wind from the perspective of the aspect of movement. Winds exist as a blend of karma and pristine awareness.[49] Wind dominated by [the quality of] “darkness” is said to be the wind of Rahu; wind dominated by “motility,” solar wind; and wind dominated by “buoyancy,” lunar wind.[50] These are therefore known as the “three winds,” Rahu, solar, and lunar. The five root winds, [called “root”] since they are of the natures of the five elements, and the five branch winds, winds produced through the five elemental transformations [the five sense objects],[51] together make a total of ten coarse winds. When these ten are formed, the winds of the time conjunctions, which have the characteristics of inhalation and exhalation, move in and out 21,[600] times daily.
From conception of the vajra body in the womb until the tenth month, the ten winds arise and develop. After [birth], their powers gradually dissolve over a period of [up to] one hundred years. During the development [of the body] in the womb, the first of the winds to form is the life wind, in the form of a. Then, from the second month [until the tenth], the other winds, beginning with the downward-voiding wind, arise sequentially until all ten are present.[52]
During the course of life, the life [wind] abides within the central channel as the dominant factor in determining the [cycles of] increase and decrease of winds.[53] The winds that emanate from the life wind flow at the heart [channel-wheel] as the nature of the eight periods. Each has the essential nature of five, or six, elements; when exhaled, they flow in the order of dissolution [of the elements], and when inhaled, in the order of generation.[54]
Likewise, at the head, [the winds flow as the nature of] the sixteen phases of the moon, divided in terms of the white and red aspects into thirty-two.[55]
At the throat, with the sixteen channels divided into method and wisdom, [the winds flow as the nature of] the thirty-two periods in [the mode of] the course of the constellations, or as the sixteen transits.[56]
At the navel, [they flow as the nature of ] the sixty danda measures (with the twelve houses of the zodiac each divided into five sectors), along with the four winds [of the element] of emptiness which flow in the central channel, moving in phases of generation and dissolution.[57]
[Winds flow] through the seventy-two thousand subtle channels. The movement of wind alone [takes place] in the central channel type; movement of wind together with the white aspect, in the lalana type; and movement of wind together with the red aspect, in the rasana type. The winds comprising 21,[600] [breaths] complete their movements in all of the three [types of ] channels in the period of one day. Moreover, in each exhalation and inhalation, [the winds] shift and move to the extremities of the pores [of the skin].

In short, the way the wind flows internally parallels the wind's movement externally, and can therefore be understood from astrology. Externally, there are twelve months in one year, while internally there are twelve transits. Externally, each house of the zodiac has five danda measures, while internally each [breath's cycle] has five mandalas [elements].[58] Externally, one year is composed of 21,[600] major clepsydra measures, while internally, there are [21,600] daily breaths.
The main activity of the external movement of the winds is that of the winds passing from the mandalas [elements] of the navel into the rasana and lalana channels and then being exhaled through the nostrils.[59] The wind that passes through the right nostril is the solar wind. Because it flows through stages when the potency [of the elements] is being exhausted, it is called “poison wind.” Its nature is that of method; its essence is indestructible awakened speech. The solar wind flows through the right nostril at a rate of 10,462.[5] times per day. The wind that passes through the left nostril is the lunar wind. Because it flows through stages when the elements are increasing, it is called “nectar wind.” Its nature is that of wisdom; its essence, indestructible awakened body. The lunar wind flows through the left nostril at a rate of 10,462.[5] times per day.[60]
Wind flows equally through the center [of both nostrils] at a rate of 675 [times] per day. It is possessed of power resembling that of the external [planet] Rahu and is therefore called “element of Rahu.”[61] It creates openness like space and is therefore called “wind of space.” Since it enters the central channel, it is also called “wind of pristine awareness.” Its nature is indivisible method and wisdom; its essence, indestructible awakened mind.[62]
Three hundred and sixty movements of each one of the winds of the elements (earth, water, fire, wind, and space) through both the left and right nostrils constitute what is termed a “minor transit.” All of these movements [of all five winds] together, a total of eighteen hundred, is termed a “major transit.” Every day, twelve of the major transits occur, a total of 21,[600] movements. Within these, there are 675 [movements] of the wind of pristine awareness. In each of the twelve major transits of the day, the pristine awareness wind flows fifty-six and one quarter times; and in each of the minor cycles, eleven and one quarter times, or, in short, one thirty-second of each breath.

Moreover, half of the pristine awareness wind flows externally, and half flows internally. In the external world, the increase and decrease caused by the winds of the phases[63] of the planets' [movement throughout the constellations] is posited as the course of time. Similarly, this pristine awareness wind [is the basis for the internal increase and decrease and thereby] determines the phases of the [movement of] planets [i.e., winds] internally. Thus, it is called the “inner wheel of time [kalachakra].”[64]
When the external movement [of pristine awareness wind] increases, there occur signs of eventual death; when [this wind] is retained internally, immortality is attained.[65]
In [a lifetime of ] one hundred years, the total time taken by the movements of pristine awareness wind equals three years and three fortnights. If during that period, one were to transform all karmic wind into pristine awareness wind, one would attain enlightenment. That is the meaning of the Buddha's statement [in the Kalachakra tantra] that “the state of vajraholder is attained in three years and three fortnights.”[66]
One should study works such as Rangjung Dorjé's Profound Inner Reality to learn about the colors of the winds, their qualities, strengths, functions, entrances, wind retention methods, the advantages of retention, and disadvantages of non-retention.[67]
Concisely stated, everything of cyclic existence and perfect peace was declared by the Buddha to be of the nature of wind. All winds fall into the categories of the wind of karma and the wind of pristine awareness. Karmic wind is wind that is inseparable from thought. There are two karmic winds, karmic wind to be relinquished and remedial karmic wind.
Karmic wind to be relinquished [is threefold]. The conception of self, which has been present in the ground-of-all, is the wind of delusion. Not knowing the five lights (which are the appearance aspect of pristine awareness) to be self-manifestation, conceiving [the lights] to be “other,” and the craving that develops is the wind of desire. Based on that previous wind, the discrimination of phenomena in terms of what to accept and what to reject and the fixation that develops is the wind of aversion. The nature of those three poisons is ignorance, the power of which creates cyclic existence.[68]
The second karmic wind is remedial wind which stops the course of cyclic existence; this is correct thought, such as the view of the absence of self. Nevertheless, it is still designated as karmic wind.
In short, that which is called “karmic wind” is [equivalent to] thought in that it stirs [things], [is involved with] the subtle, and moves from one [thing] to the next.[69] The great wind of pristine awareness is mind nature, that of bliss, clarity, and non-thought. When pristine awareness wind is directly cognized, all the movements of karmic wind are overcome.

The term “vital essence” (thig le) ([Sanskrit] tilaka) denotes the essence or seed of great bliss.
The “ineffable root vital essence” refers to one's own mind, an invincible presence from time without beginning, the essential nature of the three dimensions of awakening. The “vital essence of deceptive ignorance” refers to the arising of the deception of dualistic apprehension as a result of the disturbance caused by the three “minds” (the white aspect [giving rise to the conception of apprehender]; the red aspect [the conception of the apprehended]; and wind [ignorance, the basis of the two]). The “imputed vital essence of mantra” refers to the four names [i.e., the aggregates of feelings, discriminations, compositional factors, and consciousnesses], as well as the nominal [remedies in the practice of mantra]. The “dependent vital essence of wind” refers to the wind and the binding of it as a remedy. The “vital essence of substance” refers to the white and red vital essences, along with the methods for binding them. This categorization [of five different types of vital essence] is set forth by Rangjung Dorjé [in his Profound Inner Reality].[70]
An alternative way of presenting vital essences speaks of two: one, the vital essence imputed as the relative, and two, the ultimate vital essence of pristine awareness. What follows now is a discussion on the vital essence imputed as the relative, or vital essence of substance.[71]
Thirty-six refined and residual vital essences abide within the channels. These exist like riches owned by the winds and are supported by them. The refined essence of the white aspect of the vital essence of substance is located at the upper end of the central channel in the nature of the syllable ham.[72] On this, the Equal to the Sky Tantra says:[73]
The indestructible in the shape of ham
Is a gem white as a jasmine flower
Moist with luster and radiance.

The refined essence of the red aspect in the form of a short a[74] is located at the junction of the three [principal] channels below the navel. The Samvarodaya Tantra states:[75]
Its very essence resembles the fire of the Mare-Head.[76]
The names of these [two refined essences, white and red] are, respectively, “spring” and “vital essence.” Krishna says [in his Vital Essence of Spring (Vasantatilaka)]:[77]
The invincible ham, the seed,
Is that which drips like frost.
It gladdens all creatures' hearts.
And thus is known as “spring.”
The fire, by virtue of its great form,
Is called Varahi, the “vital essence.”
Fanned by the winds of karma,
It blazes at the mandala of the navel.
As it reaches spring, it gives pleasure.
Resting in union [with Varahi]
Is the hero, the glorious Heruka,
Called “vital essence of spring.”[78]
In the midst of the white and red aspects is the ground-of-all, accompanied by the great life wind supported by it. Thus, when represented by an outer location, [the red and white], in essence, are the Indestructible Seat, or heart of awakening.[79]
In short, because the white aspect yields bliss, it is said to be “spring”; and because the red aspect stabilizes bliss, it is said to be “vital essence.”[80] [The white and red aspects], being the place where awakening is actualized, are considered to be the Indestructible Seat.
The refined vital essences support corresponding residual essences, which also have refined and residual parts.[81] The refined part gives strength and radiance to the body; the residual part is emitted through the [regenerative] faculties and other orifices.[82]
It is those refined and residual parts which become the element of “regenerative fluid” at the end of the sevenfold [process of] refinement of the refined essences from the [inner] fire offering of food. [This process] is therefore known as the “seven births.”[83]
The vital essences derived from the “seven births” [process] are very numerous. However, the principal among them are twelve refined and twenty-four residual, thirty-six in all.
The twelve refined vital essences [are enumerated as follows]: Five vital essences are connected to the five branch winds.[84] Five are connected to the five root winds. Three vital essences are supported by the lunar, solar, and Rahu winds [flowing in the channels] above [the navel], but because the life [wind] bears the attributes of the sun, the three are considered as one, the solar vital essence. Three vital essences are supported by the channels below [the navel, which allow voiding of] feces, urine, and semen, but because the down-ward-voiding [wind] bears the attributes of the moon, the three are considered as one, the lunar vital essence. That makes twelve refined vital essences.

The twenty-four residual vital essences are supported by twenty-four major channels of the body. These channels are differentiated in terms of the eight places of awakened body and sky-farers below the earth; the eight places of awakened speech and sky-farers on the earth; and the eight places of awakened mind and sky-farers in space.[85]
Depending on whether the vital essences [in the body] and the sky-farers [in the external world] are always or occasionally present, and due to various other considerations, there exist, externally and internally, the principal and related [power] places, the two each divided into four, constituting the eight places that are the sphere of awakened mind; the fields, related fields, meeting places, and related meeting places, the four each divided into two, constituting the eight places that are the sphere of awakened speech; and the assembling places, related assembling places, charnel grounds, and related charnel grounds, the four each divided into two, constituting the eight places that are the sphere of awakened body. In the inner places [the channels], the white aspect descends, while in the outer places, the sky-farers gather.[86]
The twenty-four vital essences which descend through the twenty-four major channels are each divided into three [types], the dissolved, the engaged, and the dominant. This yields a total of seventy-two. The dissolved refers to the past aspect, when the vital essence has fully completed its function and has become residual. The engaged refers to the present aspect, the refined vital essence, principally the white aspect, which is currently performing its function. The dominant agent in the generation [of vital essence] refers to the future aspect, the cause or root of both the refined and the residual, and therefore a mixture of wind and blood.[87]
The twenty-four vital essences are also each divided into three thousand, a total of seventy-two thousand. Twenty-four thousand of these are the dissolved, mainly wind; twenty-four thousand, the engaged, mainly the white aspect; and twenty-four thousand, the dominant, mainly the red aspect.
These are the essential natures of the three elements, Rahu [wind], moon [white essence], and sun [red essence]. They flow pervasively throughout the entire network of channels, right down to the pores.
This work will not cover certain other related topics, such as the descent of bodhichitta (the principal of the refined vital essences) in sixteen [parts] and in halves of that [eight parts and four parts]; movement [according to] the essential natures of the lunar days; and techniques for retention of bodhichitta.[88]

When the channels, winds, and vital essences have formed completely in that way [as described above], the four states occur. [Each stems] from not recognizing the very natures of the channels, winds, and vital essences, and adhering to them in terms of apprehended and apprehender.
When the sixfold group of consciousnesses becomes unclear and withdraws into the ground-of-all, there occurs the state of deep sleep.
The emergence of a mental consciousness attended by compositional factors is the state of dream.
The emergence of active consciousnesses in the aspects of apprehended and apprehender through which the sixfold group [of consciousnesses] enters into objective experience is the ordinary [waking] state.
The experience of the habitual tendency for emission is the state of sexual union.
Connected to the particular period of those four states is a predominant consciousness. The very essence of each consciousness exists as the nature of [one of ] the five pristine awarenesses. Therefore, it is necessary to have an unmistaken understanding of the authentic modes of these four states and to use on the path all deceptions related to them.
At the four channel-wheels are present the vital essences of body, speech, mind, and pristine awareness as instigators of the deception related to the four states.[89] Just as the potency of medicine must penetrate the area of the illness, the [practices for] binding the crucial points—the four ripening initiations and the completion phase practices of inner heat, illusory form, dream, and luminous clarity90—must be [applied] at those times [the four states] and places [the four channel-wheels].
That being the case, the four states are said to be the fundamental cause for both the pure and impure [states]. On the subject of these four states, one should study [Rangjung Dorjé's] Profound Inner Reality to understand the sphere or ground of purification, the stains to be purified, the means of purification (the four seals), the process of purification, and the way to attain the result of purification, the dimensions of awakening and pristine awarenesses.[91]

The vajra body, comprising the refined elements of the channels, winds, and vital essences, transcends the nature of particles [of matter].[92] It comes into being and manifests from relative bodhichitta, termed in the tantras “regenerative fluid.” This very support for supreme immutable bliss,[93] whose essence is that of pristine awareness, is called the “innate body.” The [Hevajra Tantra] Two Examinations says:[94]
In the great bliss of the queen's bhaga
The teacher with thirty-two major marks,
A lord with eighty minor marks,
Abides in the aspect of “seminal fluid,” without which
There would be no bliss, due to lack of potency:
They are mutually dependent.
The bliss that arises from deity yoga
Is a buddha existing neither as tangible
Nor as [simply] intangible [emptiness].
Possessed of a form with arms and faces,
It is the form of supreme immutable bliss
And therefore innate to all beings.[95]

Tantras teach the causal continuum by using the syllables evam to symbolize it. Evam epitomizes all unions of twofold phenomena not only of the causal continuum but also the path continuum and result continuum.[1]
On this subject of evam, the Net of Magical Manifestation of Manjushri: King of Tantras states:[2]
There are the five letters of the great emptinesses
And six letters of the empty essences.
The union of these two sets of letters forms the shape of evam.[3] What follows now is a brief description based on [Pundarika's] Stainless Light: Great Commentary [on the Kalachakra Tantra] of the composition of evam, the word that serves as a symbolic sign.

The syllable vam represents the essential natures of the five immutable great emptinesses. The first immutable great emptiness is the alternative [purified] dimension of the following [psychophysical constituents]: the aggregate of pristine awarenesses and the aggregate of consciousnesses (of the six aggregates); the element of pristine awareness and that of space (of the six elements); the mental sense power and the ear sense power (of the six sense powers); [mental] phenomena and sounds (of the six objects); the male regenerative faculty and the female regenerative faculty (of the six action faculties); and the discharging of urine and the emission of regenerative fluid (of the six activities).[4] [This emptiness] is the essential nature of the letter a, symbolized by an inexpressible figure in the shape of a curved knife in the central position,[5] and is possessed of the essential nature of the pristine awareness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena.
The second immutable great emptiness is the alternative dimension of the aggregate of compositional factors, the element of wind, the sense power of the nose, the object of odors, the action faculty of the mouth, and the activity of speaking. [This emptiness] is the essential nature of the letter i, symbolized by a figure in the shape of a staff in the eastern position [in front of the curved knife], and is possessed of the essential nature of the pristine awareness of accomplishment.

The fourth immutable great emptiness is the alternative dimension of the aggregate of discriminations, the element of water, the sense power of the eyes, the object of visible forms, the action faculty of the legs, and the activity of going. [This emptiness] is the essential nature of the letter u, symbolized by a figure in the shape of a sphere[7] in the northern position, and is possessed of the essential nature of pristine awareness of discernment. The fifth immutable great emptiness is the alternative dimension of the aggregate of forms, the element of earth, the sense power of the body, the object of touch, the action faculty of the anus, and the activity of discharging feces. [This emptiness] is the essential nature of the letter èi, symbolized by a figure in the shape of a plough in the western position, and is possessed of the essential nature of mirror-like pristine awareness. The assemblage of these five figures, which cannot be expressed as either vowels or consonants, creates the [vam] character, the trunk of which is formed by the figure of the curved knife; the head, by the plough; the limbs, by the staff; the crescent moon, by the [crescent moon] aspiration sign; and the sphere marked by the tip[8] above the crescent moon, by the sphere. Thus, through the definitive qualities of body and mind,[9] the syllable vam, with the body of a consonant, is complete as the essential natures of the root vowels a, i, æi, u, and èi.[10] Accordingly, the meaning symbolized by the syllable vam, the alternative dimension of the thirty-six psychophysical constituents, the essential natures of the five pristine awarenesses, is revealed to be that of great bliss, which holds the vajra of the invincible nature.[11]
In [vam], which represents those five immutable great emptinesses, are symbolized the following: the five mandalas of space, earth, water, fire, and wind; the five of space, moon, sun, Rahu, and Kalagni; the five aggregates (forms, etc.); the five internal [directions] of the center, front, back, right, and left of the body; the five of the causal continuum and the four states; the five channel-wheels; the five root and the five branch winds; the five limbs of the body; in the alternative dimension, the five colors (of the center and each direction of the mandala); its five walls; the five awakenings;[12] the five transcendent ones;[13] the five signs of the [yoga of the] day and the five signs of the [yoga of the] night, distinguished in terms of the body and the mind [method and wisdom]; and the resultant five pristine awarenesses.

Next is a discussion of the syllable e, which represents the essential natures of the six immutable empty essences. Although the five great emptinesses are indistinguishable in terms of substance, the appearance aspect of those is posited [as six immutable empty essences] from the perspective of their unobscured aspect, that of the emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects.[14]
To clarify the above, the first empty essence is the unobscured aspect, that of the emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects, of the following [psychophysical constituents]: the aggregate of the consciousnesses (of the six aggregates); the element of space (of the six elements): the sense power of the ears (of the six sense powers); the object of sounds (of the six objects); the female regenerative faculty (of the six faculties of action); and the emission of regenerative fluid (of the six activities of the action faculties). This empty essence is the essential nature of the ka group [of consonants], symbolized by the inexpressible figure positioned above the central curved knife.
Similarly, the second empty essence is the unobscured aspect of the aggregate of compositional factors, the element of wind, the sense power of the nose, the object of odors, the action faculty of the mouth, and its activity of talking. This empty essence is the cha group, [symbolized by] the figure positioned east of the staff in the east.

The third empty essence is the unobscured aspect of the aggregate of feelings, the element of fire, the sense power of the tongue, the object of tastes, the action faculty of the arms, and their activity of taking. This [empty] essence is the îa group, [symbolized by] the figure positioned south of the [crescent moon] aspiration sign in the south.
The fourth empty essence is the unobscured aspect of the aggregate of discriminations, the element of water, the sense power of the eyes, the object of visible forms, the action faculty of the legs, and their activity of going. This [empty] essence is the pa group, [symbolized by] the figure positioned north of the sphere in the north.
The fifth empty essence is the unobscured aspect of the aggregate of forms, the element of earth, the sense power of the body, the object of touch, the action faculty of the anus, and its activity of discharging feces. This empty essence is the ta group, [symbolized by] the figure positioned west of the plough in the west.
The sixth empty essence is the unobscured aspect of the aggregate of pristine awarenesses, the element of pristine awareness, the mental sense power, the object of [mental] phenomena, the action faculty of the male regenerative faculty, and the activity of discharging urine. This [empty] essence is the essential nature of the sa group, [symbolized by] the inexpressible figure positioned directly below the curved knife in the center.[15]

The six inexpressible figures, which symbolize the six immutable empty essences, drawn in sets of two with one part outside and one inside, form three sides. By drawing the right and left tips of the former [upper set] and latter [lower set] touching to create a triangle, there is formed a support for the syllable vam, that is, the syllable e in the shape of a triangular source of phenomena.[16] The assemblage of the [six] groups of consonants completes the body of the syllable e, owing to the definitive qualities of body and mind. The Indestructible Garland says:[17]
Evam, the seal of the transcendent ones,
Is the symbol for nonduality;
It denotes the inseparability
Of emptiness and compassion.
and the Samputa Tantra states:[18]
E is said to be wisdom;
Vam, the nature of method.
As expressed in those lines, the two [syllables] e and vam represent the natures of wisdom and method and are primordially unified or connected. Therefore, each of the three (e, vam, and their union) alone is endowed with the following three attributes: the unobscured nature of the thirty-six psychophysical constituents; the same flavor as the thirty-six; and the unification of the thirty-six. However, with respect to which is the principal, the syllable e (the six immutable [empty essences]) is explained to be principal in terms of unobscured nature; the syllable vam (the five immutable [emptinesses]), principal in terms of the same flavor; and the union of e and vam, principal in terms of unification. To each of e, vam, and their union, the expressions “indestructible,” “invincible,” “holder of the vajra,” and others are applied; the terms “ultimate” or “great” are considered applicable [only] to their union.
By virtue of the crucial point of the nonduality of method and wisdom, the assemblage of the thirty consonants completes the body of the vowel e, which serves as the support; and the assemblage of the [five] vowels, the body of the consonant vam, which is supported. The unification of [e as] the support and [vam as] the supported represents the sameness of flavor of the union of evam, the symbolic sign.

[Next is a discussion of] what is represented by the symbolic sign [evam]: In the context of the causal continuum, evam symbolizes “semen” [white vital essence] and “ovum” [red vital essence], or the moon and sun; at the path phase, it symbolizes the attributes of method and wisdom; and at the result phase, it symbolizes vajra and sattva,[19] and being the union of those, evam therefore represents the source of all tantras (both the meaning to be expressed and the words that express it). The Kalachakra Root Tantra states:[20]
In the midst of the space element of syllable e
The bliss of all buddhas, syllable vam,
Is captured. Vajra and sattva,
Through the yogas of awakened body, speech, and mind,
Are proclaimed as the sphere, moon, “semen,” and awakened body;
And the aspiration sign, “ovum,” sun, and awakened speech;
The syllable a is proclaimed as Rahu, awakened mind,
And the element of space exists as e.
Through the yogas of awakened body, speech, and mind,
Through awakened body, speech, mind, and passion,
The essential natures of the three worlds exist
In the mandalas of awakened body, speech, and mind.
According to this passage, great bliss itself [symbolized by vam] is, ultimately, transcendent wisdom, emptiness [symbolized by e]. Transcendent wisdom itself is Ever-Perfect, supreme, immutable pristine awareness. Therefore, the syllable vam, the five immutable great emptinesses, and the syllable e, the six immutable empty essences, are primordially connected as a union.
To expand, with respect to method and wisdom as the roots [of the five immutable great emptinesses and of the six immutable empty essences], the syllable vam pertains to method, the male [deity], “semen” [white vital essence], and moon; the syllable e, wisdom, the female [deity], “ovum” [red vital essence], and sun.
With respect to the six elements [of the vajra body], all elements arise [together]. Therefore, normally, when one element is present, all the others are present too. However, in terms of which is the principal, water, wind, and space are posited as method, the male deity's body, speech, and mind; and earth, fire, and pristine awareness, as wisdom, the female deity's body, speech, and mind.
In the relative system of the world, such associations [of elements] as method and wisdom would be inimical ones.[21] In the ultimate sense, however, the associations arise as [complementary] method and wisdom: earth and wind as method and wisdom, respectively; water and fire as method and wisdom; and space and pristine awareness as method and wisdom. These associations are made from the perspective common [to the highest tantras].

In the context of the unified method and wisdom of body and mind as found in this tantra [Kalachakra], in the case of water, wind, and space being the body, then earth, fire, and pristine awareness will certainly be the mind. In the case of earth, fire, and pristine awareness being the body, then water, wind, and space will certainly be the mind. Accordingly, the relative way of the world would also be included in unified method and wisdom.
That being the case, as explained above, e and vam are essentially inseparable. They are, however, differentiated in the expressions applied to them, such as “vajra” and “sattva”; “vajra” and “vajra-holder”; and “method” and “wisdom,” indicating a distinction between them.
As to this distinction, vam is designated as the five immutable great emptinesses since in the pristine awareness of immutable bliss (method), all of the psychophysical constituents are of the same flavor and inseparable. E is designated as the six great empty [essences] since in the emptiness of all aspects (wisdom), the psychophysical constituents are of an unobscured [nature]. The five and six reflect divisions in terms of the numbers of the grounds of purification. Both [e and vam] are termed empty because they are free of the obscurations of the [dualistic] phenomena of cyclic existence, such as the psychophysical constituents.
The essence of vam is the [aspect of] knowing, which serves as the apprehending subject, immutable great bliss: the resultant great seal. The essence of e is the knowable, which serves as the apprehended object, images empty of all aspects: the causal great seal.[22]
The two are referred to by various names:
The syllable e is known as empty image, appearance, lotus,
Sattva, source of phenomena, element of space,
Abode of great bliss, lion throne, and bhaga;
And syllable vam, as great bliss, innate, supreme, immutable,
Vajra, vital essence, essential reality,
Pristine awareness, and utterly pure mind.
Moreover, the syllable e is the appearance aspect of the syllable vam. Thus, in actuality, the root of all phenomena is [the nature of vam,] the five immutable great emptinesses. In that lies the knowledge of all the common abridged [highest yoga] tantras.[23]

Accordingly, the [Hevajra Tantra] Two Examinations states:[24]
The mind, the great single reality,
Is symbolized in form by the five.[25]
Further, the Essence of the Great Seal, a tantra of the same class [as Hevajra], considers the root of all phenomena to be the indestructible vital essence. It states that the indestructible vital essence, when differentiated according to its presence in the centers of the six channel-wheels, comprises six unions: the potential for manifestation,[26] the vital essence, the nature, the mere nature, the supreme, and the other supreme alternative; and further states that the potential for manifestation and vital essence are considered as one when these six are condensed into a fivefold mode.[27]
The father tantra Guhyasamaja explains that the root of all phenomena is the four empties,[28] from which the coarse appearances of cyclic existence and perfect peace are said to arise. The Indestructible Garland, an explanatory tantra of Guhyasamaja, considers the root of all phenomena to be the indestructible [vital essence], which, it states, is differentiated according to its presence in the centers of the six channel-wheels into the following six [aspects]: life, vital essence, the indestructible, the invincible, the original supreme, and the second supreme. These statements [on the root of all phenomena] are identical in meaning. Similarly, according to this tantra [Kalachakra], [the root of all phenomena] is considered to be the union, or equalness of flavor, of e and vam, the causal continuum.
All of the appearances of cyclic life and perfect peace manifest from the very nature of the causal continuum. As this occurs, the cyclic existence aspect of the unobscured appearance aspect of that nature manifests as the impure environment and inhabitants; and the nature aspect, as the pure state of perfect peace. Even the resultant manifestation as the impure environment and inhabitants is one that accords with the appearances of the impure environment and inhabitants as grounded in the true nature of the causal continuum. In other words, it is a manifestation that is due to the existence of that single true nature. That this is so is logically sound in terms of the dependent arising of the result following its cause.

The true-nature aspect of the impure environment and its inhabitants, which exists grounded in the causal continuum, is the pervading agent, the indestructible awakened body, present as the nature of the powerful [mantra] of ten letters. The powerful ten-letter [mantra], which serves as the symbol of the causal continuum, is formed of the following: a, i, ri, u, li (the five root vowels); ma (seed of the collection of the inanimate); kshah (seed of the collection of the animate); ha (seed of the four formless realms) (these form the connection to [vowels known as] qualities); the simple sign of aspiration (the crescent moon);[30] and the sphere and tip of pristine awareness which stand above them.[31] Thus is formed [the mantra] called ham kshah ma la va ra ya [written one above the other].[32]

The causal continuum, the luminous clarity nature of mind itself, cannot be divided into separate substances or parts. However, when distinguished from the standpoint of conceptual categories, the unobscured aspect of that luminous clarity nature exists as the essence of the ten letters or signs, or “ten visions.”[33] This aspect serves as the ground for the arising of the impure environment and its inhabitants, which are manifestations of the powerful ten-letter [mantra].

The sphere of pervasion from the perspective of the ground represents both the outer [world] and the inner [body]. As to the first, the outer [world], a, which is the “life” [of the consonants], symbolizes outer space; the four letters ya, ra, va, la, the mandalas of wind, fire, water, and earth,[34] respectively; ma, Mount Meru, the essential nature of the five elements; kshah, the collection of the animate life contained within the desire and form realms; ha, [the animate life within] the four levels of the formless realm; and the crescent moon, sphere, and tip symbolize the moon, sun, and Rahu, which are the ornaments of the outer world system. Thus, the outer world system exists in the nature of the powerful ten-letter [mantra].
As to the second, the inner body, ya, ra, va, and la symbolize, respectively, the soles of the feet of a person, the calves, the knees, and the hips [corresponding to] the four [mandalas] of wind, fire, water, and earth; ma symbolizes the backbone, Mount Meru; kshah, the area from the throat channel-wheel to that of the forehead, the desire and form realms; ha, the crown protuberance, the formless realm; and the crescent moon, sphere, and tip, respectively, the channels lalana, rasana, and central, the moon, sun, and Rahu. In this way, the vajra body exists as the essence of the powerful ten-letter [mantra].

The sphere of pervasion from the perspective of the path represents both the phase of generation and the phase of completion. With regard to the first, ya, ra, va, and la represent the support, the four mandalas of wind, fire, water, and earth, which form the lower foundations of the divine palace; ma, Mount Meru and the celestial palace; kshah, the supported, the deities of awakened body, speech, and mind; ha, the deities of the awakened mind mandala; the crescent moon, sphere, and tip, the awakened body, speech, and mind of the deities of the great bliss mandala. Thus, even the support for the deities and the supported deities of the generation phase exist as the nature of the powerful ten-letter [mantra].[35]
With regard to the completion phase of the path, the ten signs such as smoke[36] [occurring] in the withdrawal and meditative absorption branches of the sixfold yoga[37] are the powerful ten-letter [mantra]. Likewise, the following aspects of the completion phase are the powerful ten-letter [mantra] and are therefore symbolized by it: the blocking of the ten mandalas [which flow with wind] in the right and left channels[38] in the branches of wind retention; the use in the path of the ten states of love[39] during subsequent application [the fifth branch]; and causing the ten (the five aggregates and the five elements) to be free from obscurations during contemplation [the last of the sixfold yoga].

There are extensive expositions on how the essence of the meaning of the name [Kalachakra], the causal continuum itself, manifests as Kalachakra in its three dimensions of outer, inner, and alternative. At this point, however, will be provided a synopsis, noting only the essence [of this topic].
The ground-of-all causal continuum, the union of e and vam in its complete form [of the deity's body], is called “Shri Kalachakra (Wheel of Time),” wherein “time” (kala) refers to immutable bliss [method], and “wheel” (chakra), the emptiness [wisdom] endowed with the supreme of all aspects.[41] By virtue of being the inseparability of bliss and emptiness, [Kalachakra] is said to be “glorious” (shri). That Kalachakra itself manifests as the attributes of the outer world, the inner vajra body, and the alternative circle of [deities of] the [Kalachakra] mandala.

Whether one has entered this path [of highest yoga tantra] after having trained in the general path of the universal way (as in the case of ordinary individuals), or at the very beginning [of one's spiritual journey] (as in the case of exceptional individuals), a person on this path [must be] possessed of three special qualities: [one,] inalienable faith in the principles of the cause, path, and result [as set forth] in the indestructible way [i.e., the causal continuum, method continuum, and resultant continuum]; [two,] intense, unremitting diligence in [pursuing] areas of study, reflection, and meditation, with the wish to realize enlightenment within the same lifetime, or at least within the intermediate period before rebirth, for the sake of all beings; and [three,] the supreme good fortune of being naturally endowed with wisdom, as well as other qualities, which comes from having awakened the special potency of the affinity for the universal way.
Furthermore, such an individual must have three types of confidence, the first two of which are the prerequisites for the third: [one,] confidence in what one is embarking upon, the profound tantra of the mantra way, which is the condition related to one's focus; [two,] confidence in the person who leads one onto the path, a magnificent master, the causal condition; and [three], based on those two, confidence in oneself as a practitioner of the path. Regarding these three, [Pundarika's] glorious Stainless Light states:
The Blessed One spoke of three types of confidence in [the context of ] this way of mantra. First is the period of confidence in the tantras; next is confidence in the teacher; and after that, confidence in oneself. These three confidences become the perfect path to complete and perfect enlightenment.
Otherwise, without these three confidences, regardless of which path the master reveals to the student, it will not yield the result of complete and perfect enlightenment. This is due to the student being of blind faith, whereby superficial truth leads [only] to a mundane result.

To expand, confidence in tantra is to have gained certainty [in it] since tantra was definitely taught by the Buddha and therefore is valid. Confidence in the teacher is to have gained certainty [in him or her] since [the teacher holds] an unbroken transmission from Vajradhara right up to himself or herself and has not sullied the tantric pledges. Confidence in oneself is to have gained certainty [in oneself] since the strength of the practice of what one has learned has given rise to various experiences.
That being the case, a person who possesses the [first] two types of confidence initially must learn the meaning of tantra. He or she therefore studies the tantras and their commentaries. Once a sound understanding has been achieved, that student should next begin cultivation of the two phases [of practice] of the meaning of tantra, the precondition for which is to receive, in an appropriate manner, an authentic initiation and to assume properly the pledges and vows. All the stages of the mantric path are thereby included in [two steps]: first, receiving an initiation to ripen oneself and assuming pledges; then, the main element [of the practice], the cultivation of the two phases of the path that effects liberation. [Tilopa's] Perfect Words states:[1]
The path is said to both ripen and liberate.
Revealed by the teacher, such a path
Ripens the student to the fullest.
The doctrine taught by Vajradhara
Depends entirely on the two phases:
The phase that is one of generation
And the phase that is of completion.
Abiding in these two phases equally,
The vajra master expounds the doctrine.

An initiation conferred according to an authentic procedure is what makes the [student's] mind fully ripened by planting the special seeds of the resultant four dimensions of awakening[2] in the aggregates, elements, and sense fields [of the recipient]. As to what constitutes “ripened,” the Ornament of the Scriptures states:[3]
Food is considered ripe when conditions make it
Ready to eat; a boil is ripe when it's ready to burst.
Likewise, one is said to be ripe when, in this life,
One is ready to pacify and fully apply the two sides.[4]
As an example, at a given time, the [necessary] conditions for barley or another food to be consumed may not yet have ripened. However, once conditions are complete, before long, the food is considered ripe for eating. As [another] example, once the conditions for a boil to burst are complete, soon pus will emerge, which is taken to be the ripened [state].
Likewise, in the way of the perfections, the ripened [state] is considered to be that same life in which one is ready to relinquish what is to be relinquished [on the path of] seeing and to develop the remedy, the path of seeing. Similarly, in this context [of highest yoga tantra], to be ripened is to become someone who is ready to relinquish what is to be relinquished (the two obscurations) and to achieve the goal of the supreme power [awakening]; or, alternatively, to become someone of good fortune with the capacity to explain the profound meaning of the two phases and to cultivate them.

The term for initiation[5] is derived from [the Sanskrit] abhishimcha, of which shimcha means to cast (or sprinkle). Symbolized by the casting of water in order to clean, [the student is] initiated by the casting [of water] on obscurations so that the mind is cleansed to a state of purity. Also, the word shikta, from abhishikta, means to pour into a mold. Thus, one is initiated when the potency of pristine awareness is “poured” into the clean vessel of a pure mind. The second part of the [Hevajra Tantra] Two Examinations states:[6]
Because it is performed by “casting” and “pouring”
It should be referred to as “initiation.”
[Buddhashrijnana's] Oral Teachings of Manjushri states:[7]
As a result of undergoing pouring and casting, and becoming pure,
one becomes a great master.
[Vitapada's] Commentary [on the Oral Teachings of Manjushri] states:[8]
“Pouring” is the pouring of pristine awareness [symbolized by] water and so forth into the clean vessel [of one's mind] purified by the common vows and other vows. By having that “cast” onto one's mind, one gains the seeds for the purification of habitual tendencies of the ground-of-all [consciousness] and so on. That being the case, one “becomes pure,” by means of which one becomes a suitable recipient. “Becomes a great master” means one has received the vajra master initiation.
Alternatively, abhishimcha means to confer authority. Through the four initiations, the student is authorized to cultivate [the four paths], respectively, of the phase of generation, inner heat, the circle of the mandala [i.e., the practice with a consort], and the great seal, which is the path of the fourth [initiation]; to teach action, conduct, and the other tantras; and to perform the activities for gaining ordinary and other types of powers. This is comparable to authorizing a person to perform royal duties by means of a coronation ceremony. Accordingly, [Rahulashrimitra's] Light on the State of Union states:[9]
The conferral of initiation authorizes one to hear about and teach mantra and tantra; and to practice [the way of] mantra.
Another etymology is as given in the [Hevajra Tantra] Two Examinations:[10]
...because it washes away stains and bestows good fortune.
Accordingly, the four initiations cleanse the stains of the [student's] body, speech, mind, and the three together; and bestow the good fortune of cultivation of the four paths, the generation phase and the others.
Moreover, numerous etymologies of the term for initiation are found in the sets of tantras,[11] their essential meaning summarized by the omniscient Butn:
It is called “empowerment” because it washes away stains, Empowers one to engage in [tantric] activities, Establishes potencies, effects attainment of the result, Permits [mantric] conduct, and grants liberation.

Initiations are of three types: the first, the causal initiation, which ripens the unripened [student]; that of the intermediate phase, the initiation of the path, which consists in the application of what has ripened in the initiation; and the final one, the resultant initiation, which consists in the attainment of the supreme result ensuing from [tantric] practice.
The first type, which comprises the procedures for the ripening initiation conferred by the master on the student, is the one that will be discussed below. The second, the initiation of the path, refers to contemplations done subsequent to the causal initiation. While this does include [initiation] taken by oneself by means of one's own contemplation, the principal aspect is that of cultivation of contemplation on the meaning of the initiation until the result is reached. The third, the resultant initiation, is the actualization of unsurpassable awakening; it consists in the attainment of the supreme initiation and the symbolic initiation exemplified by the initiation of great light.

If one has not received initiation, despite possessing a faultless knowledge of the tantras and applying however great an effort in the [tantric] path, it is impossible for one to attain exceptional powers, and therefore the expenditure of one's energies will have been futile. Not only will one not achieve exceptional powers (even though some minor power might have been achieved), but also both oneself and one's master will suffer extremely heavy consequences, such as birth in hell. There are countless references to such consequences as in the following passage from the Kalachakra Root Tantra:
To teach tantra and contemplate its profound reality
Without the conferral of initiation,
Despite a sound knowledge of the subject,
Will lead to hell, not to freedom.
Furthermore, when an initiation is being given, it is essential that it be conferred according to authentic ritual as taught in tantra, and not be one's own invention. If such details as the drawing of lines, the colors, and placement of symbols [of the mandala] are not carried out as prescribed in tantra, the consequences are said to be extremely serious. That being the case, it is needless to speak of the heavy consequences incurred should the ritual used for the actual initiation be contrary to tantra and of one's own invention. Hence, the authenticity of the procedure is of utmost importance, as noted in the Essence of Pristine Awareness:[12]
The initiation complete in all its rituals,
Inclusive of the branch essential principle
And transmitted in a lineage from one to the next,
Is received from the words of the supreme master.[13]
In addition, the Kalachakra Root Tantra states:
Carry out the rituals as taught in the tantras.
In that way, the deities will be propitiated;
They will grant powers to all mantric adepts
And secure for them the supreme and other goals.
To engage in rituals other than those,
Whether of another lineage, activity, occasion,
Type of mantra, place, direction, or deity,
Will bring the performers no result.
and the Susiddhi states:[14]
The wise do not invent their own
Secret mantric methods or secret mantras.

To become qualified to study the tantras and their commentaries and to cultivate the two phases; to purify the three obscurations;[15] and to attain the two [types of ] powers—all are dependent upon having received an authentic initiation. Thus, the benefits of initiation are inconceivable. There are extensive references to this effect, such as the following from the Indestructible Garland, an explanatory tantra [of the Guhyasamaja]:[16]
Conferral of initiation is most important
As therein all powers always lie.
As I now explain its real meaning,
[Vajrapani,] first listen carefully!
When the master begins with conferral
Of authentic initiation on intelligent persons,[17]
The recipients thereupon become qualified
For the yoga of the completion phase.
and Krishnacharya states:
Once students have received these initiations,
They become possessed of good qualities
And are revered by all buddhas; even perpetrators
Of evil deeds or acts of immediate retribution
Are freed upon seeing the [mandala's] colors
And simply by actually entering the mandala
Come to be reborn in the pure heavens.
[Chandrakirti's] extensive commentary on Guhyasamaja, the Illuminating Lamp, states:[18]
Conferral of initiation into the mandala in itself brings about the attainment of all powers.

In order for an initiation to be conferred, a mandala[19] must first be entered. To that end, prior preparation of the particular mandala that will be entered is necessary. Ghantapa [in his Synopsis of the Initiation Procedure for Chakrasamvara] states:[20]
Vajradhara has taught that the initiation Is preceded by [the preparation of] the mandala.
Mandalas are said to be of eight types, down to [as few as] two types. Nagabodhi [in his Twenty Rituals of the Guhyasamaja Mandala] speaks of eight:[21]
To fulfill all the aims of your students Prepare the eight types of mandalas: The mandala of jewels, one of grains, One made of flowers, one of colors, The painted one, one of colored powders, The mandala of mind, and that of reality.
Some great [tantric] pioneers of India taught seven types of mandalas: painted on cloth, [made of] colored powders, [created by] contemplation, the body mandala, the bhaga, relative awakening mind, and ultimate awakening mind.[22]
The Abhidhana Tantra presents six types:[23]
The mandala of letters is the first,
The second is the mandala of the insignia,
The mudra of the hands is the third,
The arrangement of the image is the fourth,
The display of flowers is the fifth,
The sixth is the mandala of gathered [deities].
Once the mandalas have been prepared,
Always venerate and actualize them.[24]

Alternatively, the following six types are spoken of: the mandala of pristine awareness, the emanated, [created by] contemplation, [drawn with] colored powders, painted on cloth, and that of the body.
According to very profound esoteric instructions, With veneration, one creates the five mandalas.
The five mandalas referred to here are the colored powders (the outer shape), the body, the bhaga, the awakening mind, and the wind and pristine awareness (the essence). The same text also explains mandalas as being of four types: colored powders, painted cloth, mind-[created], and the body mandala.
Another [system], that of the exceptional esoteric instructions, speaks of two categories [of mandalas]: four mandalas used for conferral, from which one receives the particular initiation; and four mandalas that serve as bases of purification, upon which initiation is conferred.
The first four are the mandala made of colored powders (the outer shape); the mandala of bodhichitta (the secret substance); the mandala of the bhaga (the consort); and the mandala of ultimate bodhichitta. The second four are the mandala of the channels of the student's body; the mandala of letters, the bhaga;[25] the mandala of nectar-[like] element [white vital essence]; and the mandala of wind and pristine awareness (the essence).
Moreover, the Kalachakra and other tantras expound four mandalas:[26] three mandalas used for supreme initiations and the mandala of colored powders used for worldly [initiations].[27]
Ghantapa[28] speaks of three types of mandalas: the mandala painted on cloth for [initiation of ] persons of low faculties; the colored powders mandala for those of average faculties; and the body as mandala for persons of sharp faculties.
Three mandalas are mentioned in the Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra and the Continuation of the Samputa Tantra:[29] the body mandala, the bhaga, and awakening mind. To these, some apply the expression “the three mandalas of the secret entities.”
The master Buddhaguhya [in his Commentary on the Purification of All Evil Destinies Tantra][30] discusses three types of mandalas: that of the natural condition, that of contemplation, and the [outer] reflected-image mandala [made of colored powders].[31] Moreover, the Awakened Body, Speech, and Mind Tantra [belonging to the] Rali [class of tantras] states:[32]
The [mandala] levels—contemplation, flowers, and colored powders— Correspond to differences in the faculties of recipients.
Referred to here are three mandalas: [created by] contemplation, [one formed of] heaps of flowers, and one of colored powders. Chandrakirti presents a similar classification in his Commentary on the Ornament of the Realization of Guhyasamaja[33] and states that mandalas made of heaps [of flowers] are intended for persons of sharp faculties. Thus, the present-day practice of using heaps of flowers as the mandala has valid sources.
The Samputa Tantra states that there are two [kinds of mandalas]: the artificial outer mandala and the real inner mandala.
[Nagarjuna's] Five Stages also speaks of two mandalas, that of colored powders [to empower a student] as a master of the phase of generation, and the mandala of illusion, as a master of the phase of completion.

Those [mandalas referred to in the root verses] may be explained concisely as follows: In the past, on the occasion of promulgating tantra, the Buddha Vajradhara emanated the mandala of pristine awareness, and thereupon conferred initiation on bodhisattvas on the tenth stage of awakening and expounded the tantra. Moreover, the manifest dimension of the Buddha emanated the mandala of the supreme manifest dimension and thereby initiated those who had reached stages of realization. These types of mandalas are the spheres of experience exclusively of exalted beings and are beyond the comprehension of ordinary individuals. Therefore, this limited description of them cannot encompass them.
The mandalas that are appropriate for ripening the student's mind are said to be four: colored powders, painted cloth, mind mandala, and body mandala.[34] Nonetheless, in the systems of most [Indian] masters (with the exception of that of the greatly accomplished Ghantapa), initiation in the body mandala must not be conferred on someone who has not previously received initiation [into a major mandala of the highest yoga tantra]. In addition, in the case of initiation conferred in a mind[created] mandala, the master must be one who is exceptionally qualified. As a result, these two mandalas are not commonly used. Moreover, the mandala formed of heaps of flowers is said to be for persons of sharp faculties. Thus, these three mandalas are to be entered by [only] a few special individuals.

The mandalas that are appropriate for persons of all three levels of faculties (low, average, or sharp) to first enter or be led into are those of colored powders, painted cloth, or tridimensional ones. Each of these has three mandalas which serve as bases for conferral of the initiation: the mandala known as the “pledge deity,” newly generated; the mandala of the “pristine awareness deity,” primordially present, who is invoked and then melts [into the pledge deity]; and the mandala of “the myriad manifestations of a buddha,” the union [of the first two]. Of those, the colored-powders mandala is widely known. In some classifications (as in [Nagabodhi's] eightfold division given above and others), it is differentiated according to the substance of the colored powders and the way the [deity's] insignia are arranged. The mandala painted on cloth is elucidated in the Achala Tantra, which belongs to the highest yoga tantra system, as well as [in the works of ] numerous Indian masters.[35]
Although not explicit in the above classifications of mandalas, a ripening initiation in a tridimensional mandala built as the celestial palace is definitely valid. In fact, it is said that the Lord of the Lineage, Manjushri-yashas,[36] conferred the ripening initiation in a tridimensional [mandala] of Kalachakra on thirty-five million seers and that the subsequent lords of the lineage [of Shambhala] conferred [the Kalachakra initiation] in the same mandala. An additional reason for its suitability is that it is easier for persons of low faculties to imagine the form of a celestial palace with a tridimensional mandala than with a mandala made of colored powders. Nevertheless, the reason that this method is not followed is due to such a mandala being difficult to build and therefore not normally available. Furthermore, the tantras and commentaries, with some special exceptions, emphasize the use of mandalas of colored powders in the majority of cases. Moreover, the scriptures on discipline state:[37]
If secure rituals are available, one should not rely on a loose
procedure.
Consistent with this statement, it is generally not proper for one to use special [mandalas just] because one has the ability to actualize them. Furthermore, it is advisable for an ordinary master who cannot discern the minds of students to adopt the gradual approach [appropriate] for those of lesser fortune. In addition, if one has the means to do so, [to construct mandalas of colored powders] is a source of great merit. Consequently, an excellent system is that of the present day whereby masters first confer on students the ripening initiation using mandalas of colored powders.[38]

Highest yoga tantra is divided into tantras that emphasize method and those that emphasize wisdom to form two sets, father tantra and mother tantra, both of which may be subdivided. Father tantra, as explained in the Indestructible Essence Ornament Tantra, is split into three tantras: the family of desire [tantras], family of aversion [tantras], and family of delusion [tantras].[39] The Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra mentions [six]:[40]
The seals of the six universal sovereigns, Who are vajra-holders, kings of the families...
Referred to in that citation are [the tantras of ] the six families: Akshobhya, Vairochana, Ratnasambhava, Amitabha, Amoghasiddhi, and the sixth, Vajradhara.[41] Mother tantra also has six subdivisions, as set forth in the Abhidhanottara Tantra using their different names:[42]
Alternatively, they are Vajrasattva, Vairochana, Vajraditya, Padmanarteshvararaja, Ashvottama, and Heruka.
The ultimate of those six, the king of the tantras, is Kalachakra.[43] The subdivisions of the two [father and mother tantras] constitute the twelve subdivisions of [highest yoga] tantras. The twelve can be further split into several thousands, as is stated in the Samputa Tantra:[44]
Those five families themselves Become many thousands of families. Thus, they are of a single nature Serving as supreme great bliss.[45]
The sixth family, that of Vajradhara, encompasses all other families, and thus there are five families, which are divided into many.
As to the distinction between the father tantra [“method tantras”] and mother tantra [“wisdom tantras”], “method tantras” refers to sadhanas of the deities of the mandala that emphasize the different aspects of the phase of generation, mantras, and methods associated principally with male [deities who symbolize] method, and do not emphasize the supreme attainment or the mantras and methods of female deities [who symbolize] wisdom.

The distinguishing features of the method tantras are all present in the wisdom tantras, as are numerous crucial points that method tantras lack. Wisdom tantras are therefore more profound than the method tantras. That being so, “mother tantras” refers to the particular sadhanas of the mandala deities that extensively present the mandalas, mantras, and rituals of a host of vajra female deities [who symbolize] wisdom.
Mother tantras are of two families: tantras that teach in equal proportions both male and female deities [such as Chakrasamvara, Hevajra, and Kalachakra]; and tantras that teach primarily the female type [such as Chatuhpita].
Other sources classify [highest yoga tantras] according to whether they represent method or wisdom. There is also an explanation that father tantras represent method alone; mother tantras, wisdom alone; and nondual tantras, the union of method and wisdom.
The countless divisions all reflect the ways in which [all highest yoga tantras] are contained within the tantras of method or wisdom, or father and mother tantras, as well as the many ways in which they all pertain to the vast and profound meaning [of the tantra]. This is the case because all pertain to the path of the phase of generation and that of completion, and so on. Accordingly, Shraddhakaravarman [in his Short Guide to the Meaning of Highest Yoga Tantra] states:[46]
The tantras of method and wisdom should be differentiated with
respect to the essential principles they present, [students] to be
trained, purity, and whether [the aspects of the deities] conform to
the ways of the world, and so on.
To expand, tantras that emphasize the essential principle of vast
ness are designated as “method tantras,” and those that emphasize
profundity, as “wisdom tantras.”
Tantras that reveal, for the purpose of training men and Bud
dhist practitioners, mandalas largely consisting of forms of male
deities are designated as “method tantras.” Tantras that reveal, for the sake of training women and persons of non-Buddhist traditions, mandalas largely consisting of forms of female deities (whose forms conform to those traditions) are “wisdom tantras.”[47]
Tantras that reveal deities [the five buddhas, etc.,] as the purity of the outer and inner aggregates, elements, and sense fields are designated as “method tantras.” Those that reveal deities as the purity of the outer and inner channels and vital essences are “wisdom tantras.”
Those that reveal deities in forms that conform to the ways of the world are designated as “method tantras.” Those that reveal deities in forms that are contrary to the ways of the world are designated as “wisdom tantras,”[48] and so on. Moreover, it is said:
Owing to distinctions in wisdom,
One speaks of two types of yogins.[49]
All of those, in essence, are included in [the category of ] nondual tantras, as is stated in many sources such as the following from [Pundarika's] Stainless Light:
By virtue of their essence, all are tantras of yoga, possessed of the essential natures of wisdom and method.

Each of the individual tantras sets forth its own procedure [for initiation], some elaborate and others condensed. There are, as well, many systems found in the commentaries. However, the following explanation is based on sources that are very renowned, such as the major works of the exalted [Nagarjuna] and his spiritual heirs [Aryadeva and Chandrakirti] and those of Abhayakara.
To begin with, it is a serious failing for a master to confer initiation, perform consecration, and so on, without having first completed familiarization [with the deity]. Therefore, prior to the initiation, the master engages in familiarization for a [prescribed] time-period or number [of mantra recitations],[1] or [until] signs [of the deity arise]. When the time for conferral has come, the student makes a formal request, whereupon the master should again engage in familiarization for seven days or more to seek permission [from the deity] and should also perform the protection of the student. Following that is the initiation in the mandala of colored powders, explained in three parts: the ritual of the site, the preparatory ritual, and the main part.
Concerning the first, the ritual of the site, Acharya Nagarjuna's [Ritual of the Mandala of Guhyasamaja] states:[2]
Clearing the site, blessing it,
Taking possession of it, and protecting it.
The ritual of the site is said to comprise four parts, prior to which the site must be examined [as to its suitability] and permission requested [to use the site].

The second, the preparatory ritual, is explained in four parts:
The earth goddess, the mandala's deities,
The pure vases, and pure students:
These belong to the ritual of preparatory acts.
Concerning the third, the main part, [Nagarjuna] says:[3]
The ritual of pitching the lines,
Spreading of the colored powders, and...
The procedure for the mandala prescribes the pitching of lines and spreading of colored powders, in addition to which is required the arrangement of the vases, the decoration of the mandala, and so on.[4]
[Nagarjuna's Ritual of the Mandala of Guhyasamaja states]:[5]
The blessing of the mandala,
The various acts of worship,
The master's own entry, and...
This passage prescribes the actualization of the mandala, worship of it, offering of food, and the master's entry into the mandala and receiving initiation therein. Prior to these must be cultivated the yoga of self-generation as the deity and, as appropriate, the generation [of the deities] in the vases.[6] [The master then directs] the student to enter the mandala, as stated by Nagarjuna:[7]
Next is prescribed that the student be made to enter
And be fully conferred with the four initiations:
The vase initiation, the secret initiation,
The pristine awareness [through] wisdom initiation,[8]
And, in turn, the fourth initiation.
And:[9]
Consecration and fire-offering rituals
Are excellent branches of the mandala.
These constitute the twenty-part ritual.
As stated here, rituals of consecration and fire offering are also prescribed, [thereby completing] the twenty-part [mandala] ritual as explained by Nagarjuna. To understand the points that are not explicitly mentioned in Nagarjuna's work [Ritual of the Mandala of Guhyasamaja], one must consult the works of Nagabodhi and Abhayakara.

The extensive applications, significance, and sequence of meditation associated with the above mandala rituals should be learned from major works [on this subject]. What follows here provides simply a synopsis.
Concerning the ritual of the site, most of the major tantras omit some of the parts associated with it, such as the examination of the site, in consideration of cases where the place has already been used for that purpose.[10] The Vajradaka and the General Tantra do teach the examination of the site and other rituals in consideration of such factors as the mandala being built at a new site. Accordingly, Abhayakara extensively discusses the ritual,[11] which is to be carried out in the following way:
Examination of the site means analysis in terms of its directions, colors, characteristics, earth, and water.[12]
Requesting the site involves the request [for permission to use it] made to a manifest being, the owner of the place such as a king; and to a non-manifest being such as the local guardian, the earth goddess, or both.[13]
Clearing the site is carried out by digging up the site [commencing at the armpit] of the uraga [naga] after having determined [its position].[14] Once the impurities [of the earth][15] are removed, a platform that meets prescribed specifications is erected, and rituals of purification of the site through substances, mantras, contemplation, and the highest [purification of emptiness] are performed.[16]
Taking possession of the site involves these steps: Once the house [or platform] for the mandala has been constructed, in that place, the master contemplates the mandala [of the deities] and then seeks their permission [to draw the mandala]. Then, in response to the students' request, the master, in order to raise the mandala [into the sky] and to subjugate demonic forces, separates himself from the chief [deity of the mandala] and assumes the pride of being the appropriate [wrathful] deity,[17] issues commands to the obstructing forces [to leave], and expels them by performing the vajra dance and stances.[18]
Protecting [and blessing] the site is performed by generating the vajra dagger, trapping all the obstructing forces that did not heed the commands [to leave] and striking with the dagger [in the four cardinal and four intermediate directions].[19] In order to prevent the obstructing forces from encroaching later, [the master] imagines a protective circle and then blesses [the site as vajra nature].[20]

In a place that has already been used [for that purpose], examination of the site, digging [the earth], elimination of impurities, and so on, may be dispensed with. This does not mean that the ritual of the site is always unnecessary; it is explained that the rituals for the site ought to be performed when appropriate. Therefore, on the right occasion, it is best to do all the other parts of the ritual as well. The ritual of the site is unnecessary when the mandala is one painted on cloth, the mind mandala, or the body mandala.[21]
The second part, the preparatory ritual, comprises the three latter aspects [mentioned above: mandala deities, vase, and students], which are set forth in most of the major tantras. The Samputa and the Net of Magical Manifestation,[22] and masters such as Nagarjuna and his spiritual heirs teach in addition the preparatory ritual of the earth goddess.
As to the sequence [of these preparatory acts], various systems have developed, such as the preparation of the deities done after the preparation of the vases; the preparation of the students done once the mandala is drawn, and so on. The best order, however, would be the preparation of the earth goddess first, then that of the deities of the mandala, followed by that of the vase, and then that of the students. Within this [order], it is good do the preparation related to the earth goddess prior to [pitching] the action lines.
Nonetheless, Nagabodhi advocates performing [that preparation] after the pitching of the action lines [of the mandala].[23]
The method for the preparation of the earth goddess comprises several steps. In the middle of [the site upon which] the mandala [will be drawn], one generates the earth goddess [of the pledge] and [imagines that] the pristine awareness deity merges with her. One then makes offerings and presents food to the deity, asks permission [to draw the mandala], and [imagines that] she consents. Thereupon, one contemplates that she [dissolves into the site and] remains present as the essence of the earth.[24]
The preparation of the mandala deities has been explained by many to be done prior to pitching the action lines. However, the explanation by Nagabodhi that it should be done after the pitching of the action lines is a good one. As to the method for doing this, the material, measurement, and blessing of the strings for pitching the lines should meet the specifications prescribed for the ritual of the threads. One then pitches the action lines.[25] Once the spots where the deities [will be] have been determined, drops of scented water are placed there. The mandala of the pledge [deities] is contemplated there, the mandala that was raised into the sky invited [to descend and merge with it], and initiation conferred [on the deities of the mandala]. [The preparation is completed by] offering, praise, and supplication [to the deities of the mandala].

The preparation of the vase must be carried out according to the specifications prescribed for their material, dimensions, number, insignia on the vase, substances contained, neck and mouth ornaments, and so forth.[26] Once the vases are prepared, the pledge deities are generated within the vase, the pristine awareness deities merge with them, and initiation conferred on the deities in the vase. The making of offerings, uttering of praise, reciting of mantras, and so forth, must then be performed. Some tantric scriptures do not mention the insignia attached to the vase, their generation as deities,[27] and so on, owing to a difference between the extensive and concise treatments.
The preparation of students must be performed according to the specifications concerning the qualifications of the students, their number, purification with water, offering of the universe (mandala), and so on.[28] These are the steps to be followed: To inspire students' interest in mantra and to make them fit for initiation, [the master] adjusts their motivation and confers on them the inner initiation.[29] Students make [a threefold] supplication to the master, who enjoins them to maintain a firm interest in mantra, and assume the vows so that their minds become receptive. The master then blesses their three places [forehead, throat, and heart].[30] In order to analyze signs of [forthcoming] powers, each throws a tooth-stick [onto a square board].[31] To purify faults of speech, handfuls of water are given [for rinsing the mouth and drinking]. Kusha grass is given [to be slept upon] in order that dreams be clear; and a protection string is tied [to the arm], that obstacles be eliminated. The master expounds the doctrine in order to generate enthusiasm. [The next day] dreams are analyzed to determine signs [relevant to the initiation]. Some [tantras] do not mention the adjusting of motivation, the inner initiation, and so forth, owing to a difference between the extensive and concise treatments.[32]
According to some expositions, initiation rituals [based on] mandalas painted on cloth, the mind mandala, or body as mandala are performed with none of the preparatory rituals, while according to others, the preparation of the vase and that of the students are done. However, it is good if the two preparations [of vase and students] are considered mandatory for mandalas painted on cloth and the mind mandala, but dispensed with for the mandala of the body.

Next is the main part, which begins with the procedure for [drawing] the mandala. The principal component of this ritual is the pitching of the pristine awareness lines in order to consecrate action lines which have been pitched with a string [to which] colored [powders have been applied].[33] The action lines are lines that have been pitched in advance [during the preparation of the deities], or, as explained by many great tantric adepts, [the action lines] may be also pitched at this point.
The pristine awareness lines are to be pitched while fulfilling special requirements concerning the thread's material, number, color, and consecration, as well as the place where one stands [to pitch the lines], stance, way of moving around [the mandala], and so forth. The ritual for preparing the colors, the substances of the colored powders, the colors, their consecration, way of spreading the color, and so on, must meet the specifications prescribed [in the tantras].[34] When the mandala is finished, the vases are arranged, the mandala is decorated, the offerings items displayed, and so on. For [an initiation that uses a mandala] painted on cloth, one must know how to spread out the canvas, and other details; similarly, for mandalas of mind and of body, [correct] placement of the vases must be known.
What follow now are [the activities of the initiating master, which involve] the actualization and worship of the mandala and the performing of self entry into the mandala. For all mandalas (with the exception of that of the body mandala), one cultivates the yoga of self-generation as the deity, recitation [of the mantra], and [at the end] the dissolution [of oneself as the deity]. Then, having generated the entire mandala in front, the preparatory ritual mandala [that was raised into space] is merged with the mandala of colored powders. The [mandala of the] pristine awareness deities merges with all of that, at which point one makes offerings, utters praise, and so forth, to the deities therein. Then, having completed the recitation of the mantra associated with the deities generated in the vase, one presents the offerings of food to [the deities of ] the mandala and to the elemental spirits. Following these steps, one enters the mandala, takes the [four] initiations, and requests permission to have one's students enter the mandala.[35]
As to the method of conferring initiation in the body mandala, one visualizes the body mandala (according to the sadhana) and generates the deities in the vase and so forth. Next, one imagines that from one's body mandala, a replica separates; one enters that mandala and therein takes initiation. At the time of initiating the students, the two [mandalas] are unified.
Some masters maintain that in front of the body mandala of oneself is visualized what is like an outer mandala into which one enters and from there confers initiation on students. This procedure is not the one taught in tantric scriptures.

For the actual conferral of initiation, the procedure for the student's entry into the mandala is a close preliminary for initiation.[36] First is the outer entry. In order to become a candidate fit for entering the mandala, the [blindfolded] student enters [the space] outside the curtain [or the house] of the mandala. To do that, one makes a request, dons the apparel [of the deity], and, visualizing oneself as the deity, positions oneself at the eastern door [having been enjoined to do so].[37] There, one assumes the common [awakening mind commitments] and the uncommon [tantric] vows. One is asked [by the master who is inseparable from the deity] about one's affinity and interest. Then, one generates the [awakening] mind of all-encompassing yoga and is sworn to secrecy.[38]
Next is the inner entry. In order to gain divine fortune, the student enters [the space] inside the curtain of the mandala.[39] First, in order to gain outer divine fortune, one actually enters [the space] inside the curtain while imagining to enter the divine palace through the eastern door, feels inspired with faith in the deities, circumambulates the deities of the mandala, and [imagines oneself] prostrating to them. Then, in order to gain inner divine fortune, as it is necessary to safeguard the pledges which are the root [of attainment] of powers, one becomes bound by oath by [assuming] the four oaths.[40] Following that is the descent of the pristine awareness deities [invoked by the master] into the student and the procedure that stabilizes them within oneself.[41]
Next is the examination of what is seen [by the student] [in the space above] the mandala to ascertain signs indicating what kind of power will be attained. The student is then examined as to his or her suitability for being revealed the mandala and receiving initiation. If deemed a fit candidate, in order to determine affiliation with one or the other of the [five] buddha families, he or she casts a flower [onto the square board which symbolizes the mandala] while repeating words of truth [after the master]. Thereupon, to create an auspicious connection so that the deity of the particular family will favor one, the student is initiated with a garland of flowers.
Finally, in order to inspire enthusiasm and give rise to great perseverance in the attainment of mantric powers, one enters the mandala and actually sees it. This is done by the master's directing one to remove the blindfold and look at the mandala, which is then described, whereupon one rejoices.

Highest yoga tantra is generally considered to have four initiations. The Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra[42] states:
The first is the initiation of the vase;
And the second, the secret initiation;
The third, pristine awareness [through] wisdom,
And the fourth itself, the same as that.[43]
That citation serves as an example with which all sets of [highest yoga] tantras are in accord. There are said to be fourteen initiations in total, with the vase initiation divided into eleven initiations, plus the three high initiations. As to the way the vase initiation is divided into eleven, five are initiations of the student, and six, of the master. The five of the student are the water, diadem, vajra, bell, and name initiations.
As for the six initiations of the master, there seem to be various ways of enumerating them. Ghantapa[44] considers the six to consist of the main part of the master's initiation, plus [five] appendages: the initiation of the mantra; the prophecy [of one's enlightenment] and the assurance [that one will be free from the suffering of cyclic existence] (considered as one); the initiation of vajra deliberate behavior; the initiation of the deliberate behavior of [tantric] conduct; and the permission [to work for all beings through tantric means].
Others explain that the six consist of the main part of the master's initiation, preceded by the assuming of the three kinds of pledges [the mind pledge of the vajra, the speech pledge of the bell, the body pledge of the seal];[45] the initiation of [the ten] essential principles [of tantric expertise] and their procedures; permission; deliberate behavior; prophecy; and assurance.
Yet others consider the six to consist of the main part of the master's initiation; the transmission of the mantra; plus the latter four, permission, [deliberate behavior, prophecy, and assurance]. Another assertion mentions bestowal of the three pledges; the main part of the master's initiation; plus the latter four, the permission, and so on.
Although in many explanations, the permission, [deliberate behavior, prophecy, and assurance] are considered to be parts of the master's initiation, this is not so in all cases. In some systems, they are attached to the end of the initiations of the student, and in others, they are considered to be the appendage to the four initiations.
Masters of the Ngog clan[46] divide the vase initiation into eighteen parts which in this case consist of five initiations of awareness, [conferral] of the three pledges, five permissions related to the five families, prophecy, praise, assurance, master's initiation, and deliberate behavior.
This completes what is merely a synopsis of the different types of initiations.

The initiation known as vase initiation, which relates to the ritual acts performed with the vase, comprises the common initiations of the student and the uncommon initiations of the master. The first are explained as follows:
The water initiation [of Akshobhya] is conferred to establish the potency [for the recipient] to wash away the stains of ignorance.
The diadem initiation [of Ratnasambhava] is conferred to establish the potency to perform the seal impression by acting as the lord of the buddha family and to produce the crown protuberance, a major sign [of a buddha].
The vajra initiation [of Amitabha] is conferred to establish the potency to realize pristine awareness, which is indivisible from essential reality.
The bell (or lord) initiation [of Amoghasiddhi] is conferred in order to realize the source of reality [emptiness], lord of the arising of the pristine awareness of indivisible emptiness and compassion.
The name initiation [of Vairochana] is conferred to plant the seed for [receiving] the name of a buddha in the future.[47]
The functions of the initiations of the student are explained as follows:
The initiation of the flower garland [blessed by] mantra allows the student to know the buddha family to which he or she belongs.
The water initiation establishes the potency for washing away the stains of ignorance that create obscurations to the attainment of the state of a buddha of that family.
The diadem initiation establishes the potency to be crowned with the buddha who is lord of that family.
The vajra initiation establishes the potency [to realize] the nondual pristine awareness which is the mind of the buddha in that family.
The bell initiation establishes the potency for expounding, as a buddha of that family, the 84,[000] aspects of the doctrine.
The name initiation establishes the potency, as a buddha in that family, for one's name to be that of a buddha.
The above explanation is that of Abhayakara. These are called “awareness initiations” because they lead to the attainment of the goal of awareness, the five pristine awarenesses, through relinquishment of the five emotional afflictions of ignorance (the object to be relinquished).[48]

The uncommon initiations of the master are explained as follows:
The pledge of the vajra is bestowed in order that [the student] not be separated from nondual pristine awareness, the minds of all buddhas, or, alternatively, in order that he or she realize such pristine awareness.
The pledge of the bell is bestowed so that one reaches the understanding that all things are devoid of intrinsic nature.
The pledge of the seal is bestowed so that one may attain the state that is never separate from the great seal of the deity's body.
The actual master's initiation is bestowed so that one may attain [the status of] “sovereign over the domain of the doctrine in the three realms.”[49]
The water initiation in this context is bestowed to wash away the stains that create obscurations to the attainment of the state of Vajrasattva.
The [set of] essential principles [of tantric expertise] is revealed so that one may realize all aspects of the mandala of the support and the supported [deities] as the nature of the qualities of enlightenment; the procedure of rituals is revealed so that one may perform the activities of a vajra master.
The mantra is transmitted in order to establish the seeds of the powers associated with the four activations [of appeasement, etc.] and so that one may create one's own pure realm, which is the power of ultimate mantra.[50]
The eye elixir is applied in order that the obscurations of the film of unknowing be removed and the supernormal cognition of the divine eye be attained.[51]

The mirror is given so that one may reach the understanding that all things are devoid of intrinsic nature, like images reflected in a mirror.
The bow and arrow are given to plant the seed [of the capacity] to strike the target of the ultimate dimension of phenomena upon conquering the four demonic forces.[52]
The permission is given in order to create the potency for gaining powers through the proper rituals and performing deeds and activities that benefit both oneself and others, such as teaching the doctrine.
The deliberate behavior is given so that, on the basis of such factors as never being separated from the awakening mind which is of the natures of the five pristine awarenesses, one may engage in mantric conduct.
The prophecy is made in order to praise and uplift [the recipient] with the words “As you are never without the established potency [to attain] a buddha's name, you will be victorious on the earth, below, and in the realms above.”
The assurance is given that [each of ] the different stages in the conferral of the initiation establishes a potency to attain buddhahood, which causes one to rejoice over the respective potency.
The above explanations are, for the most part, that of Abhayakara. This set of initiations is called the “master's initiation” since it leads one to [the state of] sovereignty over the teachings; or the “irreversible initiation” since it establishes the irreversible seed [of the attainment of awakening].
The mandala used for conferral of this [vase] initiation is one that comprises the supporting mandala and the supported deities, a drawn one (such as the colored powders or painted cloth), the body as mandala, and so forth. The basis for the initiation here is primarily the student's body, which is purified by removing its stains. The objective of the initiation is to establish a special potency for attaining the manifest dimension of a buddha and the performance of its deeds and to actualize the body as the nature of the indestructible body of a buddha.

In the exceptional system of the glorious Kalachakra, the vase initiation is called the “seven initiations in the pattern of childhood.”[53] As to their precise number and order, the Primordial Buddha Tantra[54] states:
O King, the sevenfold initiation
Includes, in their entirety, the initiations
Of water, diadem, silk ribbons, vajra and bell,
Deliberate behavior, name, and permission.
[The same tantra] states concisely:[55]
Moreover, the elements and other constituents are purified.
and then describes the purpose of the seven initiations in the following words:[56]
The water [initiation] purifies the elements;
The diadem [initiation] purifies the aggregates;
The silk ribbons [initiation] effects the purity of the perfections;
The vajra of the great immutable [bliss]
And the bell of the continuous words of a buddha
Purify the solar and lunar [channels] as one;
Through purification of the objects and sense powers,
The vajra deliberate behavior of non-emission is developed;
The name effects the purity of love and other qualities; The permission effects the purity of enlightenment itself; These are the seven initiations.[57]
The Hevajra Tantra Five Hundred Thousand presents the analogies related to the “seven initiations in the pattern of childhood”:[58]
[As if washing] their newborns, the mothers confer The initiation of cleansing with water.
The child's hair bound on his head Is to securely fix the diadem.
The piercing of his ears and adorning him Is called the initiation of the silk ribbons.
The child's talking and laughing Is the initiation of vajra and bell.
His enjoyment is the deliberate behavior. Being named is the name initiation.
Reading and writing is the permission Always given by the fathers.
These seven parts, thus described, Are known as the seven initiations.[59]

The secret initiation is conferred for the sake of creating the conditions for faith and wisdom [in the student's mind].
To create the conditions for faith, one clearly imagines the master [and consort] as the male and female deities and tastes the nectar of the bodhichitta [white and red vital essences] from their union. At that time, through the deity's power, one experiences an exceptional bliss, and thereby reverses doubts and misconceptions about mantric practices.
To create the conditions for wisdom, the secret substances [of bodhichitta], essence of all the buddhas, are placed [by the master] in one's mouth, from where they descend to the lotus of one's heart. That causes one to realize illusory body, which is pointed out by the twelve examples of illusion.[61]
The essence of the secret initiation is that of the blissful contemplative state which arises upon tasting the bodhichitta.
Concerning the meaning of its name, “secret initiation,” it is so called owing to it being an initiation conferred by means of the secret substances, the bodhichitta of the master and consort in union.
As to the mandala for this initiation, conferral depends on the mandala of the relative bodhichitta of the master and consort [in union], which is the essence of all the buddhas melted. This initiation is primarily conferred on one's speech, which is made pure by removing its stains. The objective of the secret initiation is to establish a special potency for attainment of the enjoyment dimension of awakening and to actualize speech as the nature of the indestructible speech of a buddha.

The pristine awareness [through] wisdom initiation provides the example that indicates the actual innate [pristine awareness of bliss][62] introduced in the fourth initiation. This initiation is conferred in dependence on a real consort for the sake of entering the states of the four joys,[63] innate pristine awareness in particular, through union with her.[64] The student and consort unite as the male and female deities, and through the ensuing inner heat of passion, bodhichitta melts and flows to the various places [channel-wheels], generating the four descendent and four ascendent joys.[65]
In the case of a student who is a monk, [instead of uniting with a real woman,] he visualizes a pristine awareness consort,[66] and imagines himself as the male and female deities in union. Then, by applying the phases of controlling the winds, he ignites the fire of inner heat, the warmth of which melts the bodhichitta, thus bringing about the experience of the four joys.
The essence of the third initiation is considered to be the experience of innate pristine awareness as the bodhichitta flows into the gem [tip of the penis].
As to the meaning of its name, “pristine awareness [through] wisdom initiation,” it is so called owing to it being an initiation that depends on a wisdom woman—a real consort or an imaginary one—so that, through the finest mind devoid of concepts [that arises], one is empowered in innate pristine awareness in dependence [on the consort].
Concerning the mandala for this initiation, conferral depends on the mandala of the bhaga of the consort. Initiation is conferred on the mind, which is made pure by removing its stains. The objective of the third initiation is to establish a special potency for attaining the reality dimension of awakening and to actualize the mind as the nature of the indestructible mind of a buddha.[67]

[On the basis of] the innate pristine awareness [ensuing] from the union of the male and female favored deities that occurs at the time of the third initiation and serves as an example [for actual innate pristine awareness], the fourth (word) initiation is conferred in order to point out the actual innate pristine awareness, the great seal possessing seven features.[68]
To expand, what is principally introduced [in the fourth initiation] is the selflessness of all phenomena, the nature of total sameness, the unborn, the essence of emptiness, or ultimate truth of luminous clarity. However, the aspect of the relative illusory body of the deity, the bliss of the [male and female deities in] union, and so forth, should not be held to be solely non-referential emptiness. In fact, the very pristine awareness [pointed out] during the fourth initiation is explained as the state of Vajradhara endowed with seven features.
That being the case, it would amount to a partial [understanding] to maintain that the meaning [of this initiation] is the bliss of [the male and female deities in] union [pointed out] in the fourth initiation sealed by emptiness; or the bliss of the four joys, and so forth, as merely ungraspable awareness-emptiness; or the great seal of the deity's form as merely the non-referential clarity-emptiness of one's mind.
Hence, the essence of the fourth initiation should be considered to be the dimension of the union of bliss and emptiness of one's body in the aspect of the enjoyment dimension of awakening; or the innate reality which is the indivisibility of the bliss and emptiness of that dimension.
As to the meaning of its name, “word initiation,” it is so called owing to it being an initiation that is conferred through words alone on those inclined to both the profound and vast truths. It is also known as “precious” because it is superior to the relative initiations.
As to the mandala for this initiation, conferral depends on the mandala of the ultimate mind of awakening. Initiation is conferred on the body, speech, and mind, whose stains and karmic traces are removed. Its objective is to establish [in the student's mind] a special potency for attaining the dimension which is the very essence of the indivisibility of the three indestructible states [of body, speech, and mind].
The above explanation [of the four higher initiations] is from the perspective of the common abridged tantras.[69] The three supreme initiations [secret, pristine awareness through wisdom, and word] taught in the exceptional Kalachakra tantra do have the same names [as those taught in other tantras], but are more profound and vast. They are distinguished in terms of their provisional and definitive meanings, and thus greatly superior by virtue of their many different aspects. These will not be elaborated on at this point for fear of [the explanation] being too lengthy. Likewise, in the Kalachakra system, the initiation [to confer] the rank of the sovereign vajra master and the initiation [to confer] the rank of the great sovereign vajra master are known, respectively, as the high initiation and the supremely high initiation. However, these are not to be conferred on individuals in common but on those who have succeeded in the withdrawal and retention [branches of the sixfold yoga] onward, at the appropriate time.[70]

The four initiations serve the following functions: to purify the obscurations of each of body, speech, mind, and the three together; to establish potencies for [attaining] the four indestructible states of awakened body, speech, mind, and pristine awareness; to ripen [the student] so that he or she becomes fit to cultivate the path, which comprises the generation phase, self-blessing,[73] the example pristine awareness and actual pristine awareness.[74] The permission and other parts of the initiations bring about the attainment of the rank of a vajra master of the highest tantra system.
To expand, in general, the main goal of the path of the highest yoga tantra is the dimension of union possessing seven features. Throughout the stages that accomplish that goal, one must first relinquish [the conception of] one's ordinary form and train in [self-generation as] the body of the deity. To that end, one must receive the vase initiation which [has the function of] cleansing the body of its stains and establishing the potency for the indestructible awakened body. To receive the vase initiation makes one fit to cultivate the generation phase by way of the three contemplations and their branches.[75]
Subsequent to that, it is necessary to train in the illusory body[76] associated with relative [truth]. To that end, one must receive the secret initiation [which has the function of] removing the stains of speech and establishing a potency for indestructible awakened speech. By receiving the secret initiation, one becomes fit to cultivate the phase of completion, which comprises the vajra recitation and other wind yogas, and self-blessing.[77]

Next, one must train in luminous clarity emptiness. To that end, one must receive the pristine awareness [through] wisdom initiation [which has the function of ] removing the stains of mind and establishing a potency for indestructible awakened mind. By receiving this third initiation, one becomes fit to cultivate the phase of completion of ultimate luminous clarity devoid of subject and object [duality].
Finally, one trains in the union of the two [truths]: the illusory body associated with the relative truth and the luminous clarity that has merged with essential reality[78] associated with the ultimate truth. To that end, one must receive the fourth initiation [which has the function of] removing karmic traces which are the stains of body, speech, and mind, and establishing a potency for the intrinsic dimension of awakening, which is the indivisibility of three indestructible dimensions. By obtaining that initiation, one becomes fit to cultivate the phase of completion of the union of the two truths.
Concisely stated, these initiations serve to remove the stains consisting of the faults that hinder meditation in the two liberative phases [of generation and completion] one is cultivating and to establish the potencies to accomplish whatever are one's objectives. [This explains] the necessity of first receiving initiation, which is the root of the [tantric] path.[79]
On occasions, one actualizes an emanation mandala [i.e., a mind-created one] and from that receives initiation. Such a procedure is one that generates a greater potency for the accomplishment of objectives through the contemplation of the two phases while removing the faults that hinder accomplishment. It is known as the “initiation in the context of the path.”

The seven initiations on the pattern of childhood in the Kalachakra Tantra have as their grounds of purification the aggregates, elements, action faculties, sense powers, and their objects, and as their means of purification, the purity of the thirty-seven elements (transcendent ones, bodhisattvas, shaktis, wrathful deities, and so forth).[80] The correspondences between the grounds of purification and their purificatory means will not be elaborated upon at this point, nor will the exceptionally profound meaning of the three high initiations.
Upon the completion of the rituals of initiation, the following activities are to be performed as the conclusion to the mandala, as explained by
Abhayakara: the appeasing and enriching forms of the fire-offering rituals (to make amends for mistakes of excess or omission in the rituals and to please the deity); worship of the mandala; accepting remuneration [for the initiation]; making food offerings to the guardians of the directions, and so forth, outside [the mandala]; prostration to the mandala followed by the dedication of merit; circumambulation of the mandala; asking forgiveness [for mistakes]; departure of the pristine awareness deity; dissolution of the emanated [i.e., pledge] deities; destroying the mandala of colored powders; extraction of the dagger [fixed in the ten directions]; carrying the colored powders to a river; and celebrating the occasion with a tantric feast gathering or by other means.[81]

Once an initiation has been received, one must train in the pledges which are the “life” of the initiation. Pledges belong, according to their essence, to one of two categories: prohibitions and injunctions. Pledges that are prohibitions concern the fourteen root downfalls and eight (or nine) secondary ones.[82] The injunctions concern the vows of the five [buddha] families,[83] the pledges of contemplation, conduct, and sustenance, and the pledges regarding ritual articles not to be apart from.[84]
Alternatively, the pledges may be included within the following set of three categories: pledges for beginners, pledges for adepts of stable realization, and pledges for adepts of highly stable realization;[85] or included within the set of three pledges of the indestructible states of awakened body, speech, and mind.[86] The “so forth” [in the root text] above refers to the set of three categories of pledges of the vase, secret, and pristine awareness [through] wisdom initiations;[87] or, alternatively, the pledges of familiarization [with the state of the deity], pledges related to the practices of individual mundane [deities], and pledges related to individual activations, practices of supramundane [deities], and attainment of great power [awakening].[88] Each set of pledges in itself is inclusive of the entire range of pledges of the highest yoga tantra.
In general, those [pledges] derived from [tantric] procedures that have not been taught by the buddhas are not actually vows but merely deliberate behavior. The ideal [tantric] procedures [for assuming the pledges and vows] are the initiations set forth in the awareness-holders' collection of teachings. Once one has received such initiations, it is mandatory to carefully observe all the pledges one has made. The way to do so is presented in detail in the Buddhist Ethics section of the Infinite Ocean of Knowledge, based on which one should gain an understanding of the subject.

The phase of generation [is treated in five parts]: its essence, branches, divisions, stages, and the distinction between actual and nominal phases of generation.
The essence of the phase of generation is the contemplation of bliss [arising] from the melting [of the vital essence] in meditation focused on the form of the deity's body, which is conceptually created anew, in accordance with the three existences [of birth, death, and the intermediate state].[1]
Its branches include the offering and praises performed in the periods between meditation sessions, the eight branches of yoga, and so forth.[2] These are called “branches” because, owing to their natures, they do not use aspects of existence or the result [of buddhahood] in the path.
The divisions include [the three contemplations of ] initial union, supremely triumphant mandala, and supremely triumphant act;[3] [the four branches of] familiarization [ritual service], near attainment, attainment, and great attainment [of the state of the deity]; and yoga, subsequent yoga, intense yoga, and great yoga.[4]
The stages refer to the practitioner's level of development in yoga [contemplation]: beginner's level; level of one who has experienced [a slight] descent of pristine awareness; of one who has gained [a minimal degree of ] mastery with respect to pristine awareness; and of one who has attained total mastery with respect to pristine awareness.[5]
The actual phase of generation is one comprising seven branches,[6] while the other aspects of the phase of generation are nominal.
The six topics of analysis of the phase of generation are the following: the ground of purification of each aspect of the phase of generation; final result; how [the various aspects of the phase of generation] become ripening factors for [various aspects of] the phase of completion; purpose; essence; and measure of perfection.[7] These six are to be considered with regard to all branches of practice [of the generation phase].

The phase of completion is contained in three parts: essence, types, and natures of the particular types.
Its essence is the bliss-emptiness which manifests when mind [groundof-all consciousness], [afflicted] mind, and winds dissolve in the central channel.
Its types, in terms of nature, are the actual and nominal phases of completion; in terms of aspect, the phases of completion with and without signs; and in terms of designation, the pervading and pervaded phases of completion.
The nature of each of these will now be elucidated. The actual phase of completion comprises innate great bliss born from the melting [of vital essence];[9] the illusory body [of the deity];[10] the innate nature;[11] the dimension of the state of union;[12] that which is attained at the end of the dissolution of the winds in the central channel, the three thoroughly afflicted lights and the three purified lights;[13] the three joys;[14] and the paths [that lead] directly to their attainment.
The nominal phase of completion comprises the yoga of the channels, yoga of the winds, the subtle yoga, yoga of vital essence,[15] and [practices with] a real or imaginary consort, which serve the function of making the winds enter, dwell, and dissolve in the central channel.
The completion phase with signs comprises the three lights with signs of intrinsic reality, characterized by mind and mental events, and not yet fully transformed into luminous clarity. This phase is present in all ordinary beings and others. The nominal completion phase with signs includes whatever [aspects] are correlated with the conceptual mind associated with [generic images of] words and meanings. This phase is present in various degrees up to the point at which the actual luminous clarity is attained.

The signless phase of completion comprises that which is without signs of intrinsic reality and is present only in [the minds of] exalted beings. The nominal signless phase of completion is present in [the minds of] ordinary beings as well.
The pervading phase of completion comprises the branches of the sixfold yoga[16] (withdrawal of the senses, etc.); the four joys; the four empties; and the absence of the appearance side, the emptiness side, and the bliss side. It is [so called] because this phase pervades all those [types of] phase of completion.
The pervaded phase of completion comprises the five stages of the Guhyasamaja;[17] the four stages of the Chakrasamvara;[18] the three of shape, mantra, and reality;[19] the channels, winds, and vital essences;[20] the four seals;[21] and the four yogas.[22]
All aspects of the phase of completion are to be understood by means of the following eleven points of analysis: the essence of the [above] types of completion phase; where in the body to strike crucial points; methods whereby one strikes crucial points; ensuing experiences and signs; which qualities are produced from these experiences and signs; reasons for such experiences; direct and indirect relinquishment of what is to be relinquished; measure of perfection; delineation of stages and paths; activities for overcoming obstructive forces and enhancing [realization]; and the distinction between the principal and auxiliary [practices].
The above points concerning the two phases of generation and completion are, for the most part, covered in previous and subsequent sections [of the Infinite Ocean of Knowledge], such as those that treat the subject of meditation,[23] and therefore will not be elaborated upon at this point. Earlier in this book, for instance, is presented [the nature of] the body, which serves as support, and its channels, winds, and vital essences, wherein one strikes crucial points for different forms of the phase of completion. The stages and paths are discussed in the relevant chapters.[24]

Self-blessing denotes meditation for which the principal focuses—a flame, sphere, syllable, and so on—are visualized within the central channel (regardless of whether or not one actually visualizes the central channel).
It is natural that winds gather wherever the mind is focused. Through practice of this meditation, the winds gather, whereupon they first enter, then dwell, and finally dissolve in the middle of the particular channelwheel one is focused on in meditation. When the winds dissolve, the process of dissolution of the different levels of subtle and coarse [psychophysical] constituents[25] occurs, along with many [experiences of] extraordinary bliss [ensuing from] the melting [of vital essence].

The mandala circle denotes action-seal (consort) practice and an auxiliary practice [using an imaginary seal].
For the first, through controlling the life [wind that flows] in the upper part [of the body],[26] the sequence of the entering, dwelling, and dissolving of the winds [in the central channel] occurs. When in union with an [actual] consort, the point at which the winds are stopped is reached. At that time, through the aid of the consort, the entering, dwelling, and dissolving occur simultaneously. As a result, great bliss, which is a bliss generated by the melting of bodhichitta and its descending in the central channel, is swiftly induced.
The four joys, which occur by way of striking the crucial points of one's body, can indicate in an approximate and partial way the different aspects of bliss, emptiness, natures, and the lights. However, to indicate these experiences in a subtle and complete way requires that one rely on a real consort. To explain, when one strikes the crucial points at various places of one's body, the pristine awarenesses that manifest are dissimilar, each having a distinct mode of realization. There is also a difference depending on the kind of consort, the difference being whether or not it is possible to bring about the perfect pristine awareness of the four lights and the four joys.
The best among the consorts are the emissaries of the three places taught in the Chakrasamvara tantra.[27] Once one has gathered a special assembly of those consorts, in general, powers are bestowed with extreme swiftness. In particular, the channel-knots of the 21,[000] channels are thereby released; the winds of the twenty-four transits cease;[28] and the twenty-four residual vital essences transform into refined ones.[29] Through the power of these supports [consorts], that which is supported by them, the pristine awareness of nondual bliss and emptiness, free from the wave[-like agitation of conceptuality], expands to infinity. Indeed other kinds of consorts will gradually bring this about, but the consorts [taught in Chakrasamvara] produce this result immediately, and are therefore the best among consorts.
The auxiliary practice involves an imaginary consort, also known as “pristine awareness consort,” which serves the purpose of stabilizing the pristine awareness [of bliss and emptiness], and is an appearance in the form of a consort created in one's imagination. [This means] a thought-projected image which appears although without concrete reality, referred to as the “selfmanifesting awareness woman” or “great seal with form.”

The great seal is of two [types]: the great seal that elicits bliss and the great seal that directs the mind inward.
In the first, once familiarization with pristine awareness coemergent with the bliss of the melted [vital essence] has become very stable, [the adept] remains in a state of even contemplation of the bliss-emptiness pristine awareness alone. Such contemplation itself serves as the condition for the winds and mind to gather [enter, dwell, and dissolve] again, whereupon a special bliss of the melted [vital essence] is experienced repeatedly: This is called “great seal without form.”
In the second, the great seal that directs the mind inward, “mind” refers to both vital essence and discursive thought. Bodhichitta is directed into the central channel, and discursive thought is caused to enter luminous clarity, whereupon, in a way greatly superior to meditation on emptiness alone, the dualistic impressions of apprehended and apprehender cease. As a result, one becomes enveloped in the causal great seal which brings about the supreme power, which is one's desired power: the great seal of the nondual pristine awareness dimension of awakening.
All these aspects of the phase of completion [self-blessing, mandala circle, and great seal] are called “causal phase of completion” since they serve as causes of the pristine awareness of great bliss.

All of the completion phase [practices] in highest yoga tantra are in accord in having as their objective the pristine awareness of the union of bliss and emptiness. Of the various presentations, extensive and condensed, of methods to bring forth such pristine awareness, what follows now is in keeping with the special synopsis just given.
It is generally taught that there are four seals—the action seal, doctrine seal, pledge seal, and the great seal—and this [system of four] is very widely accepted. These seals are defined in a number of different ways. [In his Awn of Esoteric Instructions],[30] the master Abhayakara relies on many tantras in his presentation [of the four seals] as they apply to three [stages]: the generation phase, the completion phase, and the resultant [awakened stage].
First, in the phase of generation, meditation on the manifest form of a female deity is the action seal; the arrangement of syllables, the seal of the doctrine; the performance of awakened activity through the emanation and reconvergence of light, and so forth, the pledge seal; and the appearance and emptiness of the form of the deity, the great seal.
Second, in the phase of completion, a real awareness woman is the action seal since she bestows joy through the action of embracing, and so forth. The central channel is the seal of the doctrine since it bestows the special innate joy. The pristine awareness of nondual bliss and emptiness is the great seal since it is the unsurpassable mind of awakening. The imaginary consort, an appearance in the form of a female deity, is the pledge seal.[31]

Third, at the resultant stage, the manifest dimension of awakening is the pledge seal; the dimension of great bliss, the great seal; the reality dimension of awakening, the doctrine seal; and the enjoyment dimension of awakening, the action seal.
Alternatively, the four dimensions of awakening (manifest, enjoyment, reality, plus the great bliss dimension) are explained as being, respectively, the action, great, doctrine, and pledge seals. This is held to be the system of the Chakrasamvara tantra.
On this subject of the four seals, the lordly Maitripa[32] and his lineage base their explanation on Nagarjuna[garbha]'s Ascertainment of the Four Seals,[33] which they consider to express the view of the Hevajra tantra. The action seal is posited as both the actual action seal (the principal one) and the pristine awareness seal, an imaginary seal (an auxiliary). The doctrine seal comprises the yogas of the winds, the vital essences, and the inner heat, and the [yoga practiced] by persons of superior faculties, that of the indestructible [state], the focus of which is solely mind's bliss. Accordingly, Sahajavajra's Compendium of Tenets says:[34]
The doctrine seal is cultivated
By the less capable at the level of channels and letters;
By the middling as the distinctive inner heat;
And by the best as the indestructible state.
It is said to be the awareness that comprises
Vital essences and subtle yogas.
The great seal is natural, authentic pristine awareness, free from all conceptual constructs. The pledge seal is the deity's form which manifests without being mentally projected. This last has as its cause the enhancement and sealing practice in the generation phase,[35] which is a concordant [seal].

The expression “phase of completion on the emptiness side” denotes the direct realization of the naturally stainless mind of innate pristine awareness, the indivisibility of bliss and emptiness, [which is actualized] when the eighty conceptions and the three lights[1] dissolve in sequence.
Here, “the three lights” signifies their root, awareness, and the transformation of that awareness into what are called “three lights.” The three are not of an essence different [from awareness]. Taking as an example three images made of gold, their root, or nature, would be said to be the gold itself, and the transformation of the gold, the three images. The gold that forms the three images and the images themselves are not separable. Similarly, in this case, self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own nature] and the three lights are in no way separable.
To expand, the three lights (without considering the distinction between the real and the nominal) form two sets: the ultimate three lights of essential reality and the relative three lights of interdependence.[2]

The ultimate three lights of essential reality refer to the root, the ultimate dimension of phenomena, mind itself, immutable great bliss, ultimate and total self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own nature].
Their essence is the mode of arising of the very form of that great bliss in its own appearing aspect. [Such is] the inconceivable secret of awakened body, speech, and mind: light, increase of light, and culmination of light, respectively, and the luminous clarity of total emptiness, all-pervasive great bliss.
Those three lights represent an inseparable and total sameness. They constitute the ground, primordial reality; the result to be attained; and the reference for the cultivation of the path. They encompass all phenomena of cyclic existence, perfect peace, and the path. Nonetheless, their essence transcends ground, path, and result.
These three lights are not the actual ones but are called the three lights because they are the very nature of the actual three lights.

The three lights of essential reality explained above are inherent to all sentient beings, and yet, like an encrustation over them, the continuous three lights arise from the minds of each and every being.
To expand, there is a habitual tendency to crave bliss which is possessed of a potency whereby mind is attracted to objects. Its three transformations, the appearances of body, speech, and mind, manifest through the potency of mind's self-cognizance, and are, respectively, light, increase of light, and culmination of light. The three are none other than the relative self-cognizant quality of mind and the aspect that looks inward.
In other tantras [i.e., Kalachakra], these three lights are spoken of as the seed of mutable bliss or the bliss of emission [of vital essence]. The essential nature of all of the three lights is that of the ground-of-all consciousness. However, in this context, light serves as the cause that produces the mental consciousness and the sense consciousnesses. The increase of light serves as the cause for the afflicted mind. These two lights are thereby posited, respectively, [as the mental consciousness and sense consciousnesses; and afflicted mind]. The culmination of light, in a categorical sense, is simply of the nature of the ground-of-all, and only in an indirect way produces the [other] seven consciousnesses, not directly. It is therefore posited solely as the ground-ofall. Thus, the three lights are taught to be mind [ground-of-all consciousness], [afflicted] mind, and [sixfold group of] sense consciousnesses.[5]
These three lights, in essence not divisible and unified as one, remain continuously present as long as cyclic existence endures. They are designated as the “three root lights.”

Prior to the actual time of death, the twenty-five gross constituents[7] dissolve entirely. This process is accompanied by five signs, such as the mirage [indicating their dissolution].[8]
[In particular,] when the winds dissolve into light, there occurs an inner whitish radiance related to the white element [descending from the head to the heart]. This is the pristine awareness of light.
When that dissolves into the increase of light, there occurs a reddish radiance, [reddish] since it is related to the red element [ascending from the navel to the heart]. This is the pristine awareness of the increase of light.
As that dissolves into the culmination of light, the potencies of the white and red elements vanish into the totality [of space], and there remains only a fraction of the life wind, owing to which there occurs a blackish radiance. This is the pristine awareness of the culmination of light.
[What is described] here is the dissolution of the three lights associated with the particular time of death, not the dissolution of the root [continuous] three lights. [This is because] at the time of death, the luminous clarity nature of mind is [still] covered by the encrustation of the ground-of-all consciousness. Through the dissolution of the appearances of objects, that ground-of-all arises as the nature of bliss and clarity. From that arise the three lights in reverse order, each in a momentary and subtle way, from which occurs the intermediate state [between one life and the next].

When one is asleep, there is no separation between the support, the body with its channels, winds, and vital essences, and that which is supported, the mind. Consequently, just a fraction of the subtle and gross [constituents] dissolve, not the entirety. In this case, at the stage of the ground, the threefold [sequence] of light, increase of light, and culmination of light, which occurs in the forward order, is extremely subtle and therefore difficult to recognize.
When dreams occur, they do so from a subtle manifestation of the [three] lights in the reverse order. It is explained that in waking from the dream state, the lights do not again manifest in the reverse order, while in waking from deep sleep, they do.

During sexual union, first is experienced pleasure [based on] the four elemental properties. Physical contact represents the earth element; moistness, water; warmth, fire; and movement, wind.[9] Then, as the bodhichitta present in the different channels reaches the secret channel-wheel, light occurs. As it reaches the groin region, the increase of light occurs. As it reaches, in the case of a male (method), the extremity of the “lord of the family” channel inside the gem [tip of the penis], or, in the case of a female (wisdom), the extremity of the right channel [rasana], the culmination of light occurs. At the instant bodhichitta is emitted, there is luminous clarity. Following emission, the red aspect ascends, and the three lights manifest in the reverse order.

To use an example, by the force of the mind being directed toward an object, initially there is simply a perception of the gross form: this is posited as light. Next, there is ascertainment of the fine details of the form: this is the increase of light. Then, as the mind becomes satiated by, or tired of, the object, there occurs a slight diminishment of its clarity: this is the culmination of light. Following that, the object no longer appears: this is the fourth, luminous clarity.
Those are thereby posited as the three lights with respect to the mind's clarity and cognizance components in one or another occasion. The three lights that occur during sexual union are likewise posited with respect to the clarity and cognizance aspects of the mind. That being the case, since thoughts arise in dependence on the appearances of objects, and, as well, each and every appearance of an object manifests from the winds' mode of stirring the mind, therefore, in relation to [the arising of] all objects [and thoughts], there exists a fraction of the three lights present at the time of the ground, which must be realized by means of the path. Hence, there are five occasions for the arising of the three lights at the ground stage [continuous, at death, during sleep, sexual union, and at the manifestation of all objects].

[During initiation,] the example pristine awareness is used in the path and thereby becomes a special method for ascertaining the authentic condition. It should be understood that, except for [that difference], these three lights are similar to the three lights at the time of sexual union, and arise in the same way.
There are four different kinds of pristine awareness [of initiation]: the pristine awareness of the initiation that is introduced to persons of low faculties (beginners); the pristine awareness [of the initiation] that ripens persons of sharp faculties, who fathom [pristine awareness] without going through stages; the pristine awareness of the initiation in the context of the path consisting of the two phases [of generation and completion]; and the pristine awareness of the initiation that serves as the proximate cause for the result [awakening].[11]
Of these four, in this context, the pristine awareness of the initiation [introduced to] the beginner with low faculties should be considered to be the three lights at the time of initiation.

Practitioners at the stages of mind isolation, illusory body, and luminous clarity[13] will attain the three lights through the stages of applying the practices. Except for differences in intensity and refinement, the ways the lights manifest will be the same as those [of body isolation and vajra recitation]. The three lights that occur as the result of [having perfected] practice represent the actual stages of the three lights.
At the mind isolation stage, during each session of equipoise, the eighty manifest conceptions are stopped. As a result, the practitioner has the impression that the pristine awareness [experienced] during that session encompasses all phenomena, but in fact it does not do so. In addition [to that experience of pristine awareness], a practitioner at the stage of illusory body will experience an infinity of appearances of mandalas. A person at the stage of luminous clarity will have a similar experience and, in addition to the appearance of all the [infinite] mandalas, will realize everything to be of the nature of bliss. The three lights of actual awakening encompass all phenomena (as will be explained below).
Concerning the way to practice those, during the manifestation of the three lights at the stage of the ground, in accordance with the way they exist at the ground, it is necessary to strike the crucial points by means of [techniques of] the path. Therefore, one cultivates bliss [in practice] with an action seal (real consort) or pristine awareness seal (imaginary consort); cultivates the state of non-thought through the yoga of sleep; and cultivates the pristine awareness of clarity by relying on methods complementary to the first two, such as yogas involving syllables, spheres, vajra recitations, and winds. Except for differences in which is the main experience, the three [experiences of] bliss, [non-thought, and clarity] all ensue from the three methods (the action seal, [yoga of sleep, and yogas of syllables, etc.]).
The ability to use the luminous clarity of death on the path is gained by integrating the meditative absorption of luminous clarity with sleep in the present life. Although one may not gain powers in this lifetime, when death comes, one will be able to use the moment [of death] in the path. The three lights that manifest at every object's appearance in the ordinary state are to be cultivated in the post-contemplation period of [everyday] activities.

By means of the methods mentioned above, the three lights of instants are repeatedly elicited and contemplated. As a result, the pristine awareness of bliss and emptiness that has been cultivated in relation to the three lights at the ground stage is firmly stabilized. This process is comparable to treating copper with mercury and cow dung to produce gold.
To explain, through repeated practice related to the three lights of instants, one first ripens the potency for the meditative experience of light, then that of increase of light, and then that of the culmination of light. One thereby gradually progresses from the stage of light to the stage of increase of light, from that to the culmination of light (inclusive of the subparts of each stage), and [finally] experiences the total emptiness stage.

The three lights at the stage of actual awakening[14] constitute the [meditative] application directed to relinquishment of the seeds of the conceptions of the eighty natures. The seeds have therefore not yet been relinquished.
However, these three lights are included in this set of three lights that are devoid of conceptions because they are conducive to [the attainment of] them.
The [actual] three lights devoid of conceptions refers to the three lights that occur in the reverse order when one has emerged from [the equipoise of] the path of seeing and to the lights that manifest as a result of the passion of great pristine awareness from the attainment of the stage of union onward (which belong to the category of three lights of instants). These lights consist in the repeated cultivation of great bliss which is “moistened” by a subtle bliss derived from the melting [of the vital essence]. Their characteristics bear only a resemblance to those of the three lights of mind isolation.
Moreover, it should be understood that, in terms of their principal characteristics at least, the three lights at the ground stage that occur at particular times are considered to be similar in that [light] is mainly concordant bliss, [increase of light,] mainly clarity, and [culmination of light,] mainly non-thought.
Thus are delineated fifteen sets of three lights: the one set of the ultimate three lights of essential reality; and the relative, the five at the ground stage, the seven plus the one comprising stages at the path stage, and the one of the three lights devoid of conceptions.

There are many synonyms for the three lights, some common to both sutras and tantras, and others exclusive to the tantras. The following are examples of just some of the terms used to designate light, increase of light, and culmination of light, respectively: method, wisdom, and androgyne; mind [ground-of-all consciousness], [afflicted] mind, and [the sixfold group of] consciousnesses; desire, aversion, and delusion; imaginary, dependent, and absolute. [These are in common with the sutras.]
[The next are terms used in tantra]: appearance side, emptiness side, and their union; mind, mental events, and ignorance; absence of desire [aversion], desire, and middling desire; empty, very empty, and total empty (these are not actual synonyms but just names given in consideration of their similarities); three lights, three emptinesses, and three consciousnesses; and pristine awareness, mind, and consciousness (these are actual synonyms).[15]
Next, to explain the meanings of some of those names, since light has the smallest component of the bliss of desire, it is called absence of desire [aversion]. Since the increase of light has a greater component of bliss, it is called “desire.” Since the culmination of light has equal proportions of bliss and emptiness, it is called “middling desire.”
To explain some other synonyms, light is posited as wisdom since, of the two aspects of emptiness and bliss, it has a greater component of emptiness.
The increase of light is posited as method since it has a greater component of bliss. The culmination of light is considered as androgyne since it has both equally.
Moreover, light is referred to by the following symbolic [terms]:[16] [the syllable] om, moon, lotus, woman, left side, night, smoothness; the increase of light, by [the syllable] a, sun, vajra, jewel, day, man, right side, and roughness; and the culmination of light, by neuter, points between [night and day], center [of left and right], middle [of a space], androgyne, and union.

The conceptions arising from the three lights[17] generally amount to all types of discursive thoughts. To establish their exact number is therefore difficult. There are many enumerations, such as that of the Indestructible Garland Tantra, which names one hundred and eight winds, the nature of which is conceptions.18. The root source for the particular associations of the conceptions with the three lights is found in the Compendium on the Pristine Awareness Tantra, which sets forth seven conceptions related to the culmination of light; four associated with the increase of light; and only [the one] absence of desire [aversion] associated with light (although there are actually seven associated with light). There are various ways of pointing out how [the conceptions and the three lights] are associated. However, since the explanation in terms of eighty conceptions as found in the exalted Nagarjuna's Five Stages is so well known, what follows will be in keeping with that. Nagarjuna's work sets forth the thirty-three conceptions associated with light, [beginning with the words]:[19]
Aversion, middling aversion...[20]

Here, the first is the absence of desire, in essence, aversion, which means apprehending an object as unpleasant. This is differentiated into three types according to the degrees of intensity of the aversion. [The thirty-three are as follows:]
(1) Small aversion, whose mode of apprehension [of the object] is slightly unclear;
(2) Middling aversion, whose mode of apprehension is clear, but owing to its being brief, and to other factors, is not capable of initiating a conditioned action;
(3) Great aversion, whose mode of apprehension is clear and lasts some time and therefore is capable of initiating a conditioned action;
(4) Mental coming and going: mind directed outward towards an object and then directed inward (both refer to mind being directed);
(5) Sorrow,
(6) Middling sorrow,
(7) Great sorrow: three degrees of distress caused by being separated froma pleasing object;
(8) Quietude: a dazed state resembling that of fatigue or exhaustion which lacks mindfulness;
(9) Conceptuality: discrimination that apprehends attributes by mixing [the generic image based on] names with that [derived from a sense perception] of an object;
(10) Fear,
(11) Middling fear,
(12) Great fear or fright;
(13) Craving,
(14) Middling craving,
(15) Great craving: three degrees of longing for what is pleasing to one in the past, present, and future;
(16) Grasping: the wish to indulge in what is craved for;
(17) Hunger and thirst: mental discomfort caused by these;
(18) Feeling,
(19) Middling feeling,
(20) Great feeling: in essence, pleasure, pain, and neutrality, distinguished into three types based on the different degrees of intensity.
(21) Conception of knowing,
(22) Conception of a knower,
(23) Conception of an object known: the mistaken cognitions that apprehend the three (actual knowing, the agent of knowing, and the ground of apprehension) for what they are not;
(24) Discernment: analyzing what is suitable and unsuitable;
(25) Shame: of being immoral, or not wishing to become immoral;
(26) Shunning unwholesome deeds out of concern about others' disapproval. [The mental factor of ] embarrassment is also included in this.
(27) Compassion: the wish that others be free from suffering;
(28) Loving-kindness,
(29) Middling loving-kindness,
(30) Great loving-kindness: three degrees of love and affection whereby one wishes for the happiness of other sentient beings whom one finds pleasing. These are also explained as three degrees of wishing for the happiness of attractive beings and wanting to protect them from harm.
(31) Qualm: an unsteady disposition related to uncertainty and characterized by anxiety.
(32) Accumulation: wanting to collect [things] and reluctance to give [things] away out of avarice.
(33) Jealousy: a mind disturbed by others' prosperity.

[Next are] the forty conceptions associated with the increase of light:
(1) Desire for an object not yet acquired;
(2) Attachment to an object already acquired;
(3) Joy,
(4) Middling joy,
(5) Great joy: different degrees of delight at the mere sight of a pleasing object;
(6) Rejoicing: joy at having achieved what one desires;
(7) Rapture: repeated enjoyment of the desired object;
(8) Amazement: elation over something newly attained;
(9) Excitement: mind pursuing what is pleasing;
(10) Satisfaction: being content with pleasure;
(11) Desiring to embrace (this stands for the wish to engage in physical and verbal actions motivated by desire for an object);
(12) Desiring to kiss: (this stands for the wish to engage repeatedly in actions [motivated by] desire);
(13) Desiring to cling: (this stands for the wish not to give up these actions motivated by desire);[21]
(14) Stability: an stable disposition that cannot be changed;
(15) Diligence: enthusiasm for the practice of virtue;
(16) Pride: considering oneself to be superior due to family or other factors; this includes the seven types of pride;[22]
(17) Activity: the will not to relinquish the effort to bring tasks to completion;
(18) Robbery: wanting to possess the things of others;
(19) Force: wanting to suppress others;

(23) Great forbearance of hardship: different degrees of indomitable courage when it is necessary to apply oneself to difficult tasks. (For this, [the translators of Nagarjuna's Five Stages], based on a corrupted [Sanskrit] text, have mistakenly taken sahasa (hardship) for sahaja (innate).[23] Therefore, [in choosing] between a doubtful translation and an edited [but meaningful] one, the second is preferable).

The seven conceptions associated with the culmination of light are as follows:
(1) Ignorance that is a medium veil of desire: the result of the mind being clouded by desire (the cause); it is “ignorance” since its aspect is unclear;
(2) Forgetfulness: a diminishment in mindfulness;
(3) Confusion: apprehending what is big as small, form as sound, and so forth;
(4) Disinterest in speaking: not inclined to speak;
(5) Discouragement: overwhelmed by circumstances of any kind;
(6) Indolence: lack of interest in what is wholesome;
(7) Doubt: oscillating between two possibilities. These are the seven instants of ignorance.
The eighty conceptions have as their [primary] causes the three root consciousnesses and the three root winds,[25] and, as their contributory conditions, the three lights that occur at particular times, accompanied by their winds. When these [causes and conditions] encounter the contributory conditions of external objects, concordant conceptions arise. However, these do not arise from the three lights of the path. All of the various conceptions arise from potencies which are nurtured by winds. Although potencies ripe [for producing conceptions] are always present, the numerous manifest conceptions do not arise simultaneously, nor do they necessarily arise all in one day. The conception that arises is the one closely related to the contributory condition.
These conceptions are exactly what are to be relinquished [on the path]. Therefore, the main conceptions [to be relinquished] are not the virtuous ones; the main ones are the emotional afflictions. Of those, the principal ones amount to the three poisons [of aversion, desire, and ignorance]. Aversion is the principal of the conceptions attendant to light; desire, the principal of the conceptions attendant to the increase of light; and ignorance, the principal of the conceptions attendant to the culmination of light. Their mode of dissolution is therefore the most important aspect of which to gain experience, as is explained in the authentic esoteric instructions.
In the first group [of conceptions], aversion appears at the beginning, and since many [conceptions of this group] are similar to aversion, earlier masters spoke of these as the thirty-three conceptions of aversion. In the second group, since many of the conceptions are related to desire, they were termed the forty conceptions of desire. In the third group, most of the conceptions are similar to ignorance; thus, they were termed the seven conceptions related to ignorance.

Division of the eighty conceptions in terms of day and night yields one hundred and sixty. The terms “day” and “night” refer to the division into method and wisdom, which is the distinction in terms of the relative and the ultimate.
Of those conceptions, the principal are ones that have the natures of the six root emotional afflictions.[26] They are perpetrators of the karmic actions that propel and complete,[27] and therefore serve as the root of birth in cyclic existence. From the stage of the ground, the conceptions are in nature empty in that they originate from and dissolve into bliss and luminous clarity. When such nature is used in the path and [these same conceptions] dissolve into luminous clarity, they become the special cause for [the attainment of] liberation. Consequently, they represent the border where cyclic existence is either entered or shunned. Thus, one should exert oneself in [using their nature in] the path.

This is explained in two parts: the actual way pristine awareness manifests; and the conditions contributing to its manifestation.
Concerning the first, when the winds that serve as mounts for the thirty-three conceptions dissolve, the conceptions themselves dissolve, at which point light manifests. Next, the forty conceptions and their winds dissolve, whereupon the increase of light manifests. Then, the seven conceptions associated with delusion, along with their winds, dissolve, and the culmination of light manifests. That dissolves into full culmination,[28] the fourth moment of which dissolves into luminous clarity.
The conceptions associated with the increase of light are said to dissolve as soon as light manifests; conceptions associated with the culmination of light dissolve at the time of the increase of light. Some scholars assert that first the conceptions dissolve and then the three lights manifest. As to their manner of dissolution, they posit that initially the twenty-five gross constituents (in groups of five each) dissolve. Many of the earlier masters maintain that first the twenty gross constituents dissolve, followed by the dissolving of the five elemental properties. At the end of the dissolution of all these elements, the process of dissolution of the conceptions and the lights occurs. One should gain an understanding [of these points] from the other extensive works that examine this subject conclusively.
As for the second, the conditions contributing to its manifestation, pristine awareness arises from the gathering of the winds and mind in vital essence primarily within the central channel at the heart center. [Related to this are two points:] first, the way pristine awareness is brought forth by means of external and internal techniques; and second, based on that, the way bliss and emptiness are integrated.

First, all of the [techniques in the] phase of completion related to the upper door [of the central channel] can cause the winds to enter, dwell, and dissolve in the central channel, and thereby bring forth the three lights that are concordant with [the actual ones]. This is because these [techniques] are capable of eliciting all of the actual four joys [arising] from the vital essence melting within the avadhuti.
To manifest the actual three lights, one must use [a technique] to strike the crucial points at the heart, such as the vajra recitation, inner heat [yoga], vital essence [yoga], and the vase[-like breath retention]. This is because the dissolution of the winds and vital essence at the heart serves as the cause for the manifestation of the actual three lights. Nevertheless, the three lights that are mind's focus[29] cannot be generated until the channel-knots [that constrict] the central channel at the heart are released. Once the knots are released, there occurs the three minds of pristine awareness cultivated by the various aspects of the phase of completion: these are the three lights that are mind's focus.
One may wonder whether or not these [methods] alone have the capacity to perfect the mind isolation [stage of the completion phase]. The answer is that they do not. To perfect that one must rely on an external consort, as pointed out in the Compendium on the Indestructible Pristine Awareness [Tantra]. The clear indication of the dissolution of all conceptions, the full manifestation of the three lights, and the full manifestation of the four joys absolutely require a consort.
One should understand that, generally, to attain a body [made only] of wind and mind is dependent on the three lights; and to transform the gross [twenty-five] elements is dependent on the descent and reversal [of vital essence].
Second is the integration of bliss and emptiness with all three lights and four joys. The full culmination of light, a state of unconsciousness, is a mind that does not arise in the form of any conceptual construct, and that absence of constructs in itself is emptiness. Thus, the full culmination of light represents the completeness of bliss and emptiness. One should gain an understanding of this and related points from other extensive works that examine this subject conclusively.

The essence of the appearance side is the form of a deity [which manifests] in the phase of completion, along with a [form] concordant to that, of which there are three [aspects]. [First is] the completion yoga: through the contributory condition of the mind being blessed by the ordinary bliss from the melting [of vital essence] and by the force of deity meditation, while in a state of non-thought, there manifests the form of a deity as a vivid appearance. [Second is] the illusory body self-blessing, the form of the deity composed of wind and mind only. [Third is] the yoga with signs, which consists in visions such as smoke.[30]
Of those, it is necessary that the illusory body be understood in detail and will therefore be treated in a subsequent section [of the Infinite Ocean of Knowledge]. What follows now is simply an overview of the subject.
As a general explanation of the nature of cyclic existence, eight factors— the four lights of the mind and the four elemental properties of the body— determine the unfolding and the ceasing of cyclic existence. When a being with a body of gross constituents dies, the elemental properties, in their sequence of the subtle and gross, dissolve, whereupon the three lights also gradually dissolve, and the being enters luminous clarity. As one emerges from the luminous clarity, the culmination of light, increase of light, and light arise as the four elemental properties, wind, and so forth, and thus, the gross appearances of this [life] arise. Accordingly, as soon as one emerges from the luminous clarity of death, the intermediate state begins. After that, one enters the next existence, turning in an unceasing circle.
The subtle and gross constituents created by those causes and contributory conditions [are set forth] from the perspectives of body, mind, and both.
The first, body, comprises one's own body of flesh, bones, blood, and so forth (the gross constituents); the stationary channels, moving winds, and the sited vital essences (bodhichitta) (the subtle); and winds of five-colored lights (the very subtle).
The second, mind, comprises the five sense consciousnesses (the gross); mental conceptual [consciousness] and the eighty conceptions (the subtle); and the four lights (the very subtle).
The third, both mind and body, comprises the twenty-five “natures,” which refers to the five aggregates (form, etc.), the five elements (earth, etc.), the five sense faculties (the eyes, etc.), the five objects (visual forms, etc.), and the five pristine awarenesses at the ground stage (mirror-like, etc.) (the twenty-five gross); the conceptions and the winds that serve as their mounts (the subtle); and the four lights and the winds that serve as their mounts (the very subtle).
Of the five pristine awarenesses, the mirror-like pristine awareness [of the ground] is considered to be the radiant clarity of the mind; the pristine awareness of total sameness, the awareness of feelings; discerning pristine awareness, the understanding of terms and their meanings; the pristine awareness of accomplishment, the desire to undertake activities; and the pristine awareness of the ultimate dimension of phenomena, objects not appearing clearly. Consciousness [in the context of the five aggregates] is identified as the consciousnesses of the five doors [sense faculties].

The gross body made from those constituents is repeatedly discarded [within cyclic existence] and is therefore not the innate body. The unceasing and innate body is that of wind and mind; that is to say, the unimpeded clarity aspect of the mind, along with its support or mount, wind. Owing to the presence of this very subtle body, gross forms of body are assumed. When a gross body is discarded [dies], the subtle body remains. Again, a gross body is assumed, [a pattern] like a turning wheel. All of the subtle and gross constituents [mentioned above] follow the same pattern. That being the case, the ground for the attainment of the illusory body is the innate body itself. The causal condition that contributes to its attainment is stated in the Five Stages:[31]
The pure body, which is like a rainbow,
Is attained by contemplation of reality.
Thus, it is taught that, generally, the illusory body is attained through contemplation of essential reality, which is the inseparability of bliss and emptiness. The agent that directly effects the attainment of the illusory body is the final example luminous clarity, termed the “final luminous clarity of mind isolation.”
When such luminous clarity is experienced, in the second moment, the awakened body of mind and wind is attained. That final example luminous clarity manifests just like the luminous clarity does in the process of dissolution at death. The luminous clarity of death causes the separation of the “fully ripened” [karmic] body from wind and mind. Likewise, the final example luminous clarity is designated as “that which separates the two.” Its essence, the indivisibility of one's own life wind and mind, actually becomes the body of the deity. What kind of mind is this? It is the ground-ofall [consciousness], along with the mental [consciousness], blessed by the three lights.
The essence of the illusory body is defined as the combination of two: [one,] the special mind (the supported) which, transformed by the bliss of the three consciousnesses [i.e., the three lights], manifests as the appearance of the deity; and [two,] wind (the support for this mind), which, through such manifestation, also becomes the form of the deity. This is termed “impure illusory body” since at the present time the obscurations of emotional afflictions have not yet been overcome. It is illustrated by twelve examples, the magical illusion, moon reflected in water, and so forth.[32]

[There are several points] concerning the completion phase of union: its cause, that of actual awakening; support, the impure illusory body; essence, the pristine awareness that has relinquished the seeds of the eighty conceptions, the essential nature of the path of seeing, which is seeing anew what had not been seen, the true nature of reality, the pristine awareness wherein dualistic appearances have ceased; the way of entering [this state of union] by relying on the outer and inner actual awakenings;[33] and the resultant attainment of the state of union of training and beyond training. These topics will be treated in detail in subsequent sections [of the Infinite Ocean of Knowledge].[34]
In summation, the pristine awareness of bliss and emptiness [which arises] upon the dissolution of winds and mind in the central channel is the completion phase on the emptiness side. The appearance of the deity's body, blessed by such pristine awareness, is the completion phase on the appearance side. These two [pristine awareness and the body of the deity] being of one essence is the state of union.
The appearance side comprises three [aspects]: [the deity's body] that manifests only to the mental consciousness; the body composed of wind and mind; and the pure body of pristine awareness. The emptiness side comprises three [aspects]: the three lights that appear to a beginner in the context of the path; mind isolation; and luminous clarity.
These represent very important points in all highest yoga tantras. In particular, in the Guhyasamaja Tantra, the principal topics whose meanings are as vast as space are the three: illusory body, luminous clarity, and state of union. These are somewhat elaborated upon, where appropriate, in previous and subsequent sections [of the Infinite Ocean of Knowledge].

Tantric application comprises both the tantras of activations and tantras of powers. The first includes the twelve great activations[35] and other activations. The second includes both common and supreme powers. The common are the minor powers such as the eight powers; middling powers, that of the status of an ordinary awareness-holder in the desire realm; and great powers, one's life span, body, and wealth experienced for an infinite number of aeons in the status of an awareness-holder of the realm of desire; and the status of an awareness-holder in the form realm.[36]
The main tantric applications to carry out those [activations and powers] are of four [types]: meditative absorption activations, fire-offering activations, yantra[37] activations, and the activations of the preliminary preparations.[38] The practice to achieve the four ordinary powers, the objectives of those activations, includes ten features: direction, time, deity, necessary articles, disposition, place, meditation object, food, ritual, and mantras. Two features, that of the uncommon substances and that of special pledge articles, are superior ones for developing powers. In all, there are twelve features.

The tantric scriptures that express [the meaning of ] the four sets of tantra are classified as follows:[1] In action tantra, the scriptures are classified on the basis of their content, such as the six families[2] and other divisions. The action and conduct tantras
are distinguished as five types according to style of presentation alone: sutras, tantras, skills, detailed rituals, and retention mantras (dharani).
The first type, exemplified by the Sacred Golden Light Scripture, refers to a single group comprising [texts that set forth] concise rituals and numerous descriptions of the stages, paths, and result.
The second comprises extensive rituals and concise [presentations of] the stages and paths and includes the three general tantras and the Dharani of the Eleven-Faced Avalokiteshvara. (The three general [action] tantras are the Secret General Tantra, Dialogue with Subahu Tantra, and Susiddhi.)
The third, exemplified by the Yakshini's Kalpa,[3] reveals in great detail only one ritual or sadhana procedure.
The fourth, exemplified by the Manjushri Root Tantra and the Supreme Knowledge of Vajrapani Tantra, comprises texts wherein both rituals and the stages and paths are extensively treated.
The fifth, exemplified by the Marichi Dharani, expounds only dharani and the benefits [of reciting them].

Additionally, conduct tantras may be divided into the three families [of awakened body, speech, and mind]. In that case, the tantra of the family of awakened body [or tathagata family] is the Vairochanabhisambodhi [Tantra]. No tantras of the family of awakened speech [or lotus family] have been translated into Tibetan. The tantra of the family of awakened mind [or vajra family] is the Vajrapani Initiation Tantra.
Yoga tantras are classified into four types: root tantras, explanatory tantras, subsidiary tantras, and tantras concordant with particular aspects [of the root tantra]. The first is represented by the Summation of Essential Principles; the second, by the Indestructible Peak; the third, by the special All-Secret Tantra and Victorious in the Three Worlds Tantra; and the fourth, by the [Glorious] Supreme Original Being, together known as the “four families of yoga.” The inclusion of accessory tantras makes [a total of ] five, which is the way of identifying yoga tantras that is most well known in Tibet.

<d e="2">
Highest yoga tantras [are classified into four types: root, subsidiary, explanatory, and tantras concordant with particular aspects].
The root tantras are of two types, extensive and concise.[4] The first is exemplified by the Kalachakra Root Tantra in Twelve Thousand Stanzas and the Hevajra Tantra Five Hundred Thousand; the second, by the [Kalachakra] Condensed Tantra and [Hevajra Tantra] Two Examinations.
The subsidiary tantras are of two types: continuation tantras, and continuation of the continuation tantras. The first is exemplified by the Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra and the Continuation of the Summation
of Essential Principles; the second, by the Continuation of the Continuation [of the Summation of Essential Principles].[5]
The explanatory tantras[6] are of five types: clarifications of what is obscure [in the root tantra]; supplements to incomplete [topics]; systematizations of scattered [topics]; synopses of material extensively treated [in the root tantra]; and instructions on methods of teaching [the tantra].
To elaborate on these five using the Guhyasamaja [Tantra] as an example, the first type includes texts like the Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra, which clarifies obscure and difficult points concerning both the words and meaning of the root tantra; the Prophetic Declaration of Intention Tantra, which illuminates all of the profound aspects [of the root tantra]; and the Dialogue with Four Goddesses Tantra, which clarifies what is obscure concerning the essential meaning [of the root tantra].
The second, supplements to incomplete topics, includes texts like the Indestructible Garland, which fills in details that are not provided in the root tantra of Guhyasamaja, such as the number of deities, the details of twenty rituals [of the mandala], and so on.

The third, systematizations of scattered topics, comprises what is set forth in the Indestructible Garland, which organizes and puts in order the rituals, stages, and so forth, that are presented in a dispersed fashion in the root tantra of Guhyasamaja.
The fourth, synopses of material treated extensively [in the root tantra], includes summaries of major expositions that detail [every aspect] starting with each of the letters of the words of the introductory remarks [of the root tantra]; summaries of major expositions that enumerate the initiations which serve to ripen [the recipient]; summaries of major expositions on the contemplations in the two phases [of generation and completion] that effect liberation; and summaries of major expositions on subjects such as the five stages, exemplified by the Indestructible Garland. Inherent to this type are all of the characteristics of the previous types of explanatory tantras.
The fifth, instructions on methods of teaching, includes texts like the Compendium on the Indestructible Pristine Awareness [Tantra], which reveals the instructions on the teaching methods of the seven ornaments [to explain the words] of the Guhyasamaja Tantra. It should be understood that this system [of five types of explanatory tantras] applies also to the mother tantras.
The concordant tantras are of two types: those concordant with both words and meaning; and those concordant with the meaning [of the root tantra].
All tantras are included within the two categories of root and subsidiary tantras; or within the two categories of root and explanatory tantras; or within the two categories of extensive and concise tantras.
As to the extent of those tantric scriptures, the Compendium on the Indestructible Pristine Awareness [Tantra] states:[7]
The great yoga tantra bears the name
“Twelve thousand,” but is beyond reckoning
When its full extent is considered.
The combined tantra is [called] “six thousand”;
Conduct tantra, “eight thousand”;
And action tantra, “four thousand.”
“Great yoga” means the highest yoga tantra not split into method and wisdom [tantras]. The names, from one called “twelve thousand” down to that called “four thousand,” do not refer to their sizes in terms of number of stanzas[8] since the [action tantra's] detailed ritual of Amoghapasha has eight thousand stanzas. Furthermore, the Indestructible Essence Ornament Tantra explicitly mentions the meaning of the title and the size of [Guhyasamaja and other] father tantras of great passion,[9] from which [the size of] other tantras can be inferred. [On the mother tantras], the Indestructible Tent states:[10]
Bliss of the Sky-Farers, Ocean of Bliss, Space,
Golden Rain, Great Delight, Ghasmari,
Playful Great Bliss, Secret Inner Bliss,
Plus tantras that support them, Vajra Sky-Farer,
Hevajra Mandala of All Buddhas, Secret Treasury,
Derived From Indestructible Nectar, Chakrasamvara,
[Indestructible] Tent, and an abundance of others
Are known as the sixth, the yogini tantra.[11]
As indicated in this and other sources, there exists an infinite number of types of tantras, and the extent of the highest yoga system in particular cannot be fathomed.

On the meaning of consecration [point six], Rongzom Pandita states that to confer initiation on a student and to perform consecration on a deity [image] are essentially identical. To explain [this statement], in initiation, the basis of purification is the innate body and mind; the object to be purified, the adventitious stains; the purificatory means, the four initiations with their branches which effect purification, whereupon the pristine awareness beings are made to merge with [and be stabilized within the pledge ones]; and the result of purification, the establishment of the seeds of the four dimensions of awakening [in the student's mind].
Likewise, in consecration, the basis of purification is an image formed of matter; the object to be purified, the stains of the artist [who made the statue] and of the donor [who commissioned it]; the purificatory means, the correct ritual procedure through which the pristine awareness deities merge with and are stabilized within the pledge ones; and the result of purification, the spontaneous activity, as the essence of the indestructible awakened body, speech, and mind of a buddha, that accomplishes others' welfare.
The rationale for this description [of four elements of basis, object, means, and result of purification] is one principally connected to the terminology of the last cycle of the Buddha's teaching. Some [scholars], the Sakyapas and others, take these to be three elements: the object to be purified, purificatory means, and result of purification. They assert that the basis of purification is posited with respect to the object to be purified, and the object, with respect to the basis, in a relationship of reciprocal dependence, and therefore the basis of purification is not discussed separately.

Without instructions on how tantric texts should be taught, one would be overwhelmed by, and unable to fathom, the profundity and vastness of their contents. Therefore, instructions for their exposition [are set forth] beginning with the three lower tantra sets.
Action tantras should be taught, as is explained in [Buddhaguhya's] Commentary Epitomizing the Dialogue with Subahu Tantra,[1] by presenting four practices: entrance, approach, effecting powers, and using powers. Whatever is incomplete or obscure in the particular root tantra is to be supplemented and elucidated by [referring to] general explanatory tantras of action tantra, such as the Secret General Tantra, which emphasizes entrance; Dhyanottara, which emphasizes approach; Susiddhi, which emphasizes both approach and effecting powers; and Dialogue with Subahu Tantra, which establishes the characteristics of all four practices.

The way conduct tantras should be taught, as explained in [Buddhaguhya's] Commentary Epitomizing the Vairochanabhisambodhi Tantra,[2] involves three approaches to exposition: a statement of the title of the tantra alone (in the case of a student of sharp faculties who gains understanding from the beginning statement); a statement that scrutinizes the meaning of the title alone (in the case of a student of average faculties who gains understanding through analyses); and thorough analysis of related aspects of the words, with extensive commentary based on a successive examination (in the case of a student of low faculties who is engrossed in words).
For each of those three approaches, there should be an explanation of the two excellences: the excellence of the [tantra's] promulgator's objective for himself or herself and the excellence of the promulgator's objective for others. The first is expounded in terms of the excellence of the cause, nature, and result; the second, in terms of [the excellence of ] the mandala, mantra, seals, and so forth. To provide that explanation entails expositions on both the conduct related to the mandala rituals and the conduct on the part of the practitioner in order to propitiate the awareness mantra [the female deity], the secret mantra [the male deity], and so forth, as well as the resultant [attainments]. For that, one must explain how to propitiate the secret [and awareness] mantras, which comprises the four practices of entrance, approach, effecting powers, and using powers (or three, if [the last two] are condensed), as taught in the section [in chapter four] on the stages of the path in conduct tantra. These points are incorporated in an abridged form in the exposition of the Vairochanabhisambodhi [Tantra], and should likewise be applied in expositions of other conduct tantras as appropriate.

Yoga tantra's styles of exposition are concerned with teaching the excellence of the result through the points of introduction [that set forth] the framework of the tantra, and, after that, the means for the attainment of the result, the content of which comprises the ten essential principles with their twenty (or thirty) subdivisions.[3] As to the methods of exposition, the Indestructible Peak[4] states:
...forms the compendium of all analyses
Of the great means to accomplish all objectives.
That which reveals in detail the secrets
And elucidates the intention of yoga
Forms the compendium of all analyses
That imparts knowledge of essential principles.
The procedure of the vajra yoga
And the ritual of the yoga of the circle
Form the compendium of all analyses
That is known as the supreme secret.
Actions that encompass all times
And the source of all secret yogas
Form the compendium of all analyses
That is the great means for all activities.
These four compendiums of analyses were taught as elucidations on the knowledge of all yoga tantras, or methods of exposition, [and are described as follows:]
[The first] comprises descriptions of the way the Buddha attained enlightenment; [the way] the Buddha, for others' welfare, emanated [the mandala of ] the deity and taught [the tantra]; and the definitive meaning of the words of the tantra; and expositions in condensed form of the subject matter to be taught, all the procedures that accomplish one's objectives.

The second comprises statements from the root tantra such as:[5]
Having thrust the linga into the bhaga...
with explanation:[6]
I shall explain the meaning of bhaga,
Which is called bhaga because it conquers.
It conquers the body of emotional afflictions.
Hence, it is called wisdom bhaga.
What, then, is called linga?
Linga is explained as “sign.”
Wise ones arise from the linga of wisdom,
Bodhichitta, the supreme method,
Which is known as the sign.
Having thrust the linga into the bhaga
The circle's power is attained.[7]
which constitute expositions that reveal in detail [the meaning of] secret words. [This second also includes] explanations of the rationale for the Buddha being called Vishnu, and so on, in the root tantra:
Having cognized essential reality itself,
The purity devoid of fixation and so forth,
Being without self[-grasping] or afflictions,
I am therefore called Vishnu (The All-Pervading).
which constitute expositions that elucidate covert intention; and expositions that impart knowledge of the sacred essential principles, the teachings concerning the essential principles of powers, self, deity, mandala, and so forth.
The third comprises teachings on the supreme secret, that of vajra yoga, the procedure of preliminary familiarization; and the yoga of the circle [of deities], the ritual of the mandala (both in abridged forms), thereby revealing knowledge of the practices.
The fourth comprises the pledges and vows that concern actions that encompass the three times; the secret yogas, contemplation involving visualization [of the deity, etc.] and recitation; and the fire-offering rituals, which accomplish all activities.[8]
These topics should be expounded in relation to the four compendiums in whatever way is appropriate. All these compendiums should be presented in a way similar to that of general treatises, which includes five teachings: purpose, concise meaning, literal meaning, context, and resolution of contradictions. The points of introduction [for setting the scene of the tantra] and the initial discussion [on the reason for the teaching] should be presented by distinguishing between early events [the awakening of the Buddha] and practical application intended for later followers.

The methods of teaching highest yoga tantras are the “seven ornaments,” principles of knowledge [that stem] from the Compendium on the Pristine Awareness Tantra.[9] Some scholars apply these teaching methods as techniques for expounding only the father tantra of Guhyasamaja since they find their source in this tantra. However, these seven ornaments are considered not only as methods to expound the Guhyasamaja but also as an important framework for discourses on the [highest] tantras in general. The seven ornaments [and their twenty-eight subdivisions] are stated in [Chandrakirti's] Illuminating Lamp:
The points of introduction number five;
The correct methods are of four types;
Parameters for extensive discourses, six types;
And modes of exposition number four;
The fifth ornament is divided into two; The sixth ornament, divided into five;
And the seventh, divided into two:
The ornaments are thereby encapsulated.
Within the [seven] ornaments, there are five points of introduction containing the purpose of the tantra; four correct methods which provide a synopsis of the tantra; six parameters for the words and meanings that form extensive expositions of the tantra; four modes of teaching related to words and meanings; two forms [group and individual teachings] distinguished in terms of the subject matter; five forms distinguished in terms of the persons who are recipients of the teaching; and two types of the seventh ornament which ascertains the two truths on the basis of scriptures and reasonings, distinguished in terms of the purpose. [In this way,] the ornaments form seven categories, within which are twenty-eight subdivisions. They are referred to as “ornaments” since they delight the wise by beautifying and illuminating the tantras.[10]

The first [ornament] comprises five points of introduction, which are to state the title of the tantra, [the persons] for whom the tantra is intended, the composer, the extent of the tantra, and the purpose.
The title of a tantra is given to reflect [one of] several elements, such as its subject matter, as is the case for the Guhyasamaja, Chakrasamvara, Hevajra, and Kalachakra tantras;[11] or the words that convey [the subject matter], as is the case for the Prophetic Declaration of Intention Tantra; or the extent of the tantra, as is the case for the [Hevajra] Tantra One Hundred Thousand; or its promulgator, the person who requested it, the examples used, and so forth.
If one asks for whose welfare tantra was promulgated, the answer is that tantra was taught primarily to guide persons of sharp faculties who are dominated by desire. This is so because the resultant state of great bliss must be reached principally by the path of desire. Nevertheless, tantra is not intended solely for the benefit of beings dominated by desire since it teaches the fierce [mode of] activation, and so forth, for the sake of persons dominated by aversion or other emotional afflictions.
If the composer of the tantra is not an ideal one, that tantra will not be trustworthy. Therefore, if one wishes to know who the composer of a particular tantra is, the answer must be found in the section of the particular tantra where the author is stated. For example, Guhyasamaja was spoken by the great Vajradhara in the form of a [universal] sovereign; the Chakrasamvara Root Tantra, by the [great Vajradhara] in the form of a fearsome heruka.
Concerning the extent of a particular tantra, the Guhyasamaja, for instance, contains twenty rituals, or eighteen chapters, or five major sections.[12]
The purpose of a tantra is to develop ordinary powers; the most essential purpose is to attain the supreme power [of awakening].

The second [ornament] comprises the four correct methods, which are [to expound] the lineage, starting basis, definitive word, and propensity.[13] These four [are interpreted] in terms of the way [to become a buddha following a path] free from desire; and in terms of the way [following a path] possessed of desire.
First, the four correct methods for [the path] free from desire are as follows:
To have taken birth as a virtuous human being represents what is called “lineage” since it is in a human form alone, by having become a renunciant, that one can becomes free from desire.
To become a renunciant in signs, apparel, and so forth, as when [the Buddha as] a prince renounced his entourage of consorts, represents the “starting basis” since to become a renunciant is the only correct [course of action] if one aspires to freedom from desire.
In addition to having become a renunciant, to safeguard the vows prescribed in the discipline collection of teachings represents the “definitive word” since to do so is correct as an area [of training] definitely required.
In addition to safeguarding the vows, to apply the teachings with the aspiration to attain resultant awakening represents the “propensity” since this alone is correct for the attainment of freedom from desire. As is said:
Moral, learned, and reflective,
One dedicates oneself to meditation.
Second, the four correct methods for the path of desire are as follows:
To generate oneself as [all] the buddhas of the five buddha families in accordance with one's own particular family represents the “lineage” since this is correct as the support for mantra practice.
Moreover, [the five buddhas], being transformations of Vajradhara [endowed with the seven features] of union, and so on, are of a single family, that of the great secret: this represents the “starting basis” since conviction in the mode of the path of desire is thereby imparted.
Upon accepting the vows of the five buddha families, to assume the outer, inner, and secret vajra levels [of teaching][14] and so forth, and, in particular, in highest yoga tantra, to assume the deliberate behavior of pure conduct in the union of vajra and lotus[15] represents the “definitive word” since this is an area of training that is, without any doubt, definitely required.
To engage in the secret teaching that uses in the path the desire aroused by flirtation, laughing, and so forth, represents the “propensity” since this brings about the attainment of the dimension of great bliss.

The third [ornament] comprises the six parameters [three pairs], which are the provisional meaning, definitive meaning, interpretable meaning, non-interpretable meaning, standard terminology, and coined terminology. They are known as “parameters” since the meaning of the words [of the tantras] do not go beyond these.
Expositions using the provisional meaning are intended for persons who do not actually possess the sublime fortune [to directly fathom the pristine awareness of the phase of completion] in order that the Victor, having concealed the real meaning of that teaching, might draw them towards it. These consist in alternative teachings such as those concerning the phase of generation and its subsidiary practices.
Expositions using the definitive meaning are of two types. The first, the definitive meaning in common with the phase of generation possessed of authentic characteristics, comprises such explanations as found in the Compendium on the Indestructible Pristine Awareness [Tantra],[16] which says: “Camphor refers to semen.” The second, the definitive meaning of the natural state which is perfect in itself, reveals the meaning of the causal continuum, the innate nature, and other aspects of the completion phase.
Expositions using the interpretable meaning are intended to reveal essential reality to someone [of sharpest faculties] who aspires to the supreme goal while preventing that person from pursuing it without [the guidance of] a master. An interpretable teaching is expressed in words that contradict the ways of the world in that they would be censured by upright persons, as in the case of the injunction “to slay living creatures.” “To slay living creatures” would be interpreted as to block karmic winds. Such words that contradict worldly conventions are also intended to attract [to the tantric path] persons [who engage in base acts], such as butchers.
Expositions using the non-interpretable meaning teach all the essential principles of the generation-phase practice, such as total emptiness, luminous clarity, and so forth, to persons of low faculties who are not qualified to receive the interpretable teachings.
Expositions using standard terminology are those in accordance with the [three] lower tantras that concern the performance of detailed rituals related to the outer mandala, fire offerings, and so on, and the sets of activations.
Expositions using coined terminology are terms such as “kotakhya” [for life wind][17] that were coined only by the Transcendent One on a particular occasion and are found neither in treatises nor in [common languages of] the world.[18]

The fourth [ornament] comprises the four modes, which are [to expound] the literal meaning, general meaning, concealed meaning, and final meaning.
The first, the literal meaning, is an explanation that is simply focused on the syllables [of the words] by means of splitting them [into parts], and so forth.[19]
Expositions using general meaning are of two types: one, the general meaning of the sutras and tantras; and two, the general meaning of the phase of generation. The first type comprises the general meaning that counteracts regret felt by persons who have entered the sutra way; and the general meaning that counteracts regret felt by those who have entered the mantra way. The first is used in the case of a person who is aware of such statements as the following:
Despite endless austerities and vows,
One's goal will still be not realized,
But attainment is swiftly gained
By enjoying all sensual pleasures.
and feels regret over not having embarked on, from the beginning, [practice of] the teachings for which the path is easily accessible and through which enlightenment is attained in the same lifetime, and thinks that it was not good to have entered the sutra way (or the way of action or conduct tantras, and so on). In response, an explanation such as this is given: It is not the case that a person who wishes to be free from cyclic existence, attain awakening, and so on, should enter the highest yoga tantra and not the path of sutra. As it is said:
For those endowed with purity and method,
Emotional afflictions contribute to awakening.
Even the sutras say enlightenment can be attained through an easily accessible path if one is a person of sharp faculties and possessed of special method and wisdom. Such an exposition is referred to as the general meaning [type].

<d e="2">
The general meaning exposition that counteracts regret felt by a person who has entered the mantra path is used in the case of someone [who has entered the highest yoga tantra] and feels regret at having done so, thinking that, in the sutras and the action and conduct tantras, and so forth, the Teacher spoke of ablutions, cleanliness, fasting, and so on, and that [the highest yoga tantra] rejects these and instead expounds behavior like that of dogs and pigs, for which excrement, urine, male and female regenerative fluids, and so on, are offered to the deities and also ingested by oneself.
A general meaning exposition for a person of low faculties [who feels such regret] comprises statements such as this: This system [of highest yoga tantra] rejects the performance of ablutions, cleanliness, and other [observances] when, as in the case of those performed by brahminical Hindus, they are devoid of special method and wisdom. However, it does teach forms of cleansing that purify [the karmic traces of ] negative actions and obscurations, and so on; and therefore to ingest excrement or urine and do other similar acts is to apply the practice of total sameness of flavor of the sense faculties and their objects.
A general meaning exposition for a person of sharp faculties [who feels such regret] comprises statements such as this: There is also [a way to] realization devoid of hardships and austerities which is taught in action tantras such as the Trisamayavyuha. To be attached to cleanliness, adverse to what is unclean, and so forth, are meaningless [conceptions] and do not favor the attainment of the pristine awareness of total sameness. Hence, to overcome such adherences, even the sutras, action tantra, and so forth, prescribe the conduct of sameness of flavor.
Second, a general meaning [exposition] of the phase of generation includes teachings on the outer aspects and general meaning of the generation phase, such as the following:[20]
Always contemplate at the tip of the nose
A precious [insignia] of five different colors.
which are instructions for persons unqualified to hear the concealed teachings on sexual desire to imagine the subtle insignia of the five buddha families on the relative “tip of the nose.”

Expositions using the concealed meaning consist of teachings that explicitly present practices involving sexual desire in the union of the yogin and yogini. They are referred to as the concealed teachings on sexual desire, concealed because to speak of them in a group would cause embarrassment. The stage of practice of the illusory body, the supreme essence veiled by subtle but manifest stains, is the concealed [teaching] on the realization of relative truth. The cause for that [attainment of the illusory body] is the pristine awareness of light, increase, and culmination, the middling essence veiled by middling stains; and the cause for that, the speech isolation termed “indestructible awakened speech” and body isolation termed “indestructible awakened body,” the minor essence, or natural state, [veiled] by great stains.[21] Because these are concealed, their explanations are also concealed.
Expositions using the final meaning consist of teachings on the stage of luminous clarity, the final path; and teachings on the stage of union, the final result.
Each of these four modes represent the same vajra class [of tantric teachings] but expound the teachings in accordance with the different faculties [of the recipient]. Here, [the four] modes have been presented generally in relation to the Guhyasamaja Tantra, but should be applied in a similar way to other tantras. Therefore, a general statement on each follows:
The literal meaning appraises the meaning of the syllables [of the words] according to grammar and spelling; the general meaning expounds what is in common with the sutra way and lower tantras; the concealed meaning, the uncommon profound points of highest yoga tantra; and the final meaning, the way to realization of the state of union with training and beyond training based on the first three.
This discussion on the four modes and six parameters is based on distinctions in the levels of [the students'] minds (to be explained below) but has been set forth here according to the tradition of the Guhyasamaja Tantra in order to be easily understood.

The fifth [ornament] comprises two forms of exposition, group teachings and teachings to individual students. The standard terminology, non-interpretable meaning, provisional meaning, literal meaning, and general meaning are taught to students in a group. (It is not permissible to teach tantra to someone who is not one's student.) Teachings on the phase of completion using coined terminology and the definitive meaning, and expositions using the interpretable meaning, concealed meaning, and final meaning are given only to the best students, who are like “jewels.”
That being the case, with the exception of the concealed sexual practices, teachings on the generation phase and related topics are expounded to a group; and those on the completion phase and related topics, to individual students. Thus, the form of teaching depends on which of the two phases is being taught.

The sixth [ornament] comprises expositions for recipients of five types: like a blue lotus, white lotus, [red] lotus, sandalwood tree, and jewel.
A blue lotus absorbs nutrients from various sources in the environment and retains its nectar as long as it is in water. However, it withers quickly, losing its luster, fragrance, and so on, when plucked. Similarly, a person deemed “blue lotus” listens to all of the master's teachings and is able to retain [this knowledge] for a time. However, when there are worldly distractions and other activities, he or she will instantly forget it.
A white lotus is similar to a blue one, but does not wither as easily and is more beautiful in color. However, although it keeps its nectar, it is not able to emit [its fragrance], and, like a water-sogged ball of cotton in a vase, it is difficult to pluck. Similarly, a person deemed “white lotus” acquires much knowledge and does not forget it, but owing to having little self-confidence is unable to transmit this knowledge to others.
A [red] lotus whose radiance is finer than others' emits a sweet fragrance when opened by the sun and is filled with nectar. However, the nectar is quickly released and therefore does not last long. Similarly, a person deemed “lotus,” endowed with faith, compassion, and wisdom, has a fully blossomed mind and is able to transmit knowledge to others. However, because he or she is of an unstable nature, these qualities do not last for long.
A sandalwood tree [of inferior kind][22] does not absorb nutrients from the various sources in the environment and lacks flexibility. Its roots do not spread deep into the ground, and around its many branches coil venomous snakes. Thus, it cannot afford protection for others. Similarly, a person deemed “sandalwood tree” has absorbed little knowledge yet takes pride in his social status, and so forth. Although lacking [knowledge] rooted in scriptures and reasonings, he or she talks a great deal and is therefore unable to nurture students.
A jewel devoid of faults and endowed with many fine qualities has an excellent and unchanging nature and provides the source for whatever is needed or desired. Similarly, a person deemed “jewel” maintains pure ethics, is learned in many sutras and tantras, perseveres in what is wholesome, exhibits great wisdom, and is of pure mind. Accompanied by these qualities, he or she acquires knowledge and then effectively teaches others.
The jewel is the best type of student; the other three, middling; and the sandalwood tree type, inferior. The sandalwood tree type has the good fortune to be connected to the [secret] mantra and is therefore mentioned here [among the five] for its excellent affinity [for tantra].
The first four types of individuals have the fortune to receive group teachings and the phase of completion [teachings]. The jewel-like ones are qualified to receive the individual teachings. This implies that the previous four possess the fortune [to be taught] the phase of generation.

The seventh [ornament] comprises expositions on the two truths. The ascertainment of the two truths or two phases by means of scriptures and reasonings, and the elimination of doubts, and so forth, is the purpose of expounding tantra using the [previous] six ornaments. Based on that, to make the phase of completion the essence is the supreme purpose. Hence, all of the highest yoga tantras are to be expounded by means of the seven ornaments.

Special styles for teaching the tantras are set forth in the yogini tantras of highest yoga tantra. The methods to expound Chakrasamvara are stated in the Equal to the Sky Tantra, which is part of the Chakrasamvara Rali tantras:[23]
The meaning of words, auxiliary meaning,
Condensed meaning, general meaning,
Concealed meaning, and the final meaning:
The tantras are definitely these alone.
Accordingly, the Chakrasamvara Tantra is expounded in terms of these six instructions. The general, concealed, and final meanings are the three instructions concerned with the subject matter, or the meaning to be conveyed; and the literal meaning, auxiliary meaning, and inclusive meaning are the three instructions for ways to explain the terms that convey the subject matter.[24] Those are to be applied individually to the meanings and the words of the scripture, as well as collectively to each word of the scripture, as appropriate for the particular exposition.

Some masters speak of four meanings:
Outer, secret, inner, and absolute:
These are four kinds of meanings
Which represent the mandala, action seal,
Body, and absence of intrinsic nature.
It should be understood that these correspond to the six instructions just mentioned.
In the esoteric instructions of the great sage Naropa, it is stated that the Chakrasamvara Root Tantra is to be expounded by means of the three unions while the Chakrasamvara Concise Tantra says that it is to be expounded by means of what are known as the secrecy of the path, the secrecy of the result, and the branches that bring these to completion.
The Hevajra Tantra should be expounded in terms of the three purities, as stated in the [Hevajra Tantra] Two Examinations:[25]
In a definitive way, the purity of all things
Is declared to be the true nature as it is.
Later, it should be described as the purity of the deities
In terms of their individual distinctions.
The essential nature of self-awareness is purity itself:
There is no liberation through another purity.[26]

The three purities may be expounded by applying them to the three continuums. In terms of the causal continuum, the true nature of all phenomena, or primordial peace [emptiness], is the purity of the true nature; manifestation in the form of a body with face and arms is the purity of the individual deities; and the experience of bliss, not experienced by any other means, the purity of self-awareness [i.e., awareness that cognizes its own nature].
In terms of the continuum of method, the view that has eliminated misconceptions on the basis of study and reflection is the purity of the true nature; the generation phase of the path, the purity of the individual deities; and the phase of completion, the purity of self-awareness.
In terms of the resultant continuum, the essential dimension of awakening is the purity of the true nature; the two form dimensions of awakening, the purity of the individual deities; and the innate dimension of awakening, the purity of self-awareness. In addition, the three continuums may be expounded by applying each to the three purities.

The Mahamaya Tantra should be expounded by means of [the three essential natures,] shape, mantra, and reality. The same tantra states:[27]
Unstained by the faults of existence,
The meaning of tantra should be understood
Through the three types of unions:
The natures of shape, mantra, and reality.
The essential nature of shape denotes the phase of generation, which, after the vase initiation has been conferred on the body, reveals the body itself as the manifest dimension of awakening. The essential nature of mantra denotes the inner heat, which, after the secret initiation has been conferred on the speech, reveals speech itself as the enjoyment dimension of awakening. The essential nature of reality denotes the third initiation, which, after the wisdom initiation has been conferred on the mind, reveals the mind itself as the reality dimension of awakening. The essential nature of the ultimate reality, after the fourth initiation has been conferred on the body, speech, and mind, together with the winds, reveals the winds themselves as the essential dimension of awakening. Both the reality of the initiation and the ultimate reality are included within “reality,” thus making the three essential natures.

The Chatuhpita Tantra should be expounded by means of the “four seats,” the seat of oneself, the seat of others, the seat of union, and the seat of the secret, as a framework for the tantra in general from beginning to end, as well as for each of its chapters.
The four seats may be applied to the three continuums. In terms of the causal continuum, the seat of oneself refers to the revelation that everything, the outer environment and inner inhabitants, is a manifestation of one's mind; the seat of others, the revelation [of appearances] as empty of outer objects and perceiver; the seat of the union, the nonduality of appearances and emptiness; and the seat of the secret, the essence of this union as the nature of great bliss.
The four empties—great empty, empty, very empty, and total empty (the reality dimension of awakening)—which are experienced at the moment of death of [every] being, are present as the four seats of oneself, others, union, and secret, respectively. [Likewise,] the transference of consciousness, the mental body, unobstructedness, and conception (the enjoyment dimension of awakening) [related to] the intermediate state are present as the four seats, respectively. The four components, the white [semen], the red [ovum], consciousness, and the formed body (the manifest dimension of awakening) [related to] birth are present as the four seats, respectively.
In terms of the path continuum, the seat of oneself refers to a qualified master who confers the ripening initiation; the seat of others, a qualified student; the seat of union, conferral of initiation; and the seat of the secret, the meaning of the initiation that has been experienced in the [student's] mind. The four seats must be applied as well to each of the four initiations.
In terms of liberative means, the seat of others refers to the outer practice of the phase of generation; the seat of oneself, the inner practice of one's body as method; the seat of the union, the secret practice with a real consort; and the seat of the secret, the essential reality of the inconceivable pristine awareness of the great seal. The four seats should be applied as well to each of these four [outer, inner, secret, and essential reality].
In terms of the resultant continuum, the seat of oneself refers to the reality dimension of awakening, the fulfillment of one's own objective; the seat of others, the manifest dimension of awakening, to guide one's students; the seat of union, the enjoyment dimension of awakening, endowed with five certainties;[28] and the seat of the secret, the indivisibility [of the previous dimensions] as the essence of great bliss. The Chatuhpita Tantra is thus expounded by applying the natures of the [four] seats [to the three continuums].

The Continuation of the Samputa Tantra is to be expounded by means of the seven secrets, such as the obscure. These are summarized as follows: one, the obscure, the causal continuum, the meaning to be understood; two, the concise formulation of essential reality, the eleven [vase] initiations; three, the five seed syllables,[29] the phase of generation; four, the concealed sacred element, the view that realizes the meaning of essential reality; five, the secret lotus, the path connected to the third initiation, the means of the mandala circle;[30] six, the joy at the navel, the phase of self-blessing;[31] and seven, that which serves all [purposes], the different branches of the path such as pledges and vows.
It is explained that some tantras are to be expounded by means of the “four dwellings”: dwelling in a sphere, in water, and so on. The Equal to the Sky Tantra[32] states:
In a sphere, in water, in form,
And in a state beyond form:
These are the four dwellings.
The tantras are definitely these alone.
These four dwellings should be understood in relation to the three continuums.
The four dwellings of the causal continuum are explained as follows: In the case of a sentient being who will be born from a womb, first, when the parents are enjoying the pleasure of sexual intercourse, the intermediate state is also attracted to that pleasure and as a consequence, enters the womb. This is the “dwelling in a sphere”: the enjoyment dimension of awakening which experiences bliss. The stages of fetal development, such as the mer mer stage,[33] which occur after the consciousness has become unconscious in the midst of the semen and ovum [of the parents], is the “dwelling in water.” The stage in which the being is embodied, with all the sense faculties complete, is the “dwelling in form.” The stage when the being has died is the “dwelling in a state beyond form.”

As to the four dwellings in terms of the continuum of method, the four of the initiation [are explained in this way]: The articles used in the vase initiation, the diadem, and so forth, primarily represent the “dwelling in a sphere”; the substance used in the secret initiation, bodhichitta, the “dwelling in water”; the referent used in the wisdom initiation, the male and female deities in union, the “dwelling in form”; and the referent for the fourth initiation, great bliss transcending thought, the “dwelling in the state beyond form.”
The four dwellings are also applied to each initiation individually. In the context of the water initiation, the transformation of the syllable hum into a vajra is the “dwelling in a sphere”; the melting of the vajra, the “dwelling in water”; from that, the generation of the deity with face and arms, the “dwelling in form”; and the blessing of one's continuum, which occurs as the deity is absorbed [into oneself ], the “dwelling in the state beyond form.” The four dwellings are likewise applied to all the other initiations.
As to the four dwellings in terms of the path, there are four dwellings in the context of the phase of generation and four in the context of the phase of completion. For the first, the deity's insignia which arises from the seed syllable is the “dwelling in a sphere”; the melting of the causal Vajradhara which arises from the deity's insignia, the “dwelling in water”; the manifestation of the resultant Vajradhara which arises from the causal one,[34] the “dwelling in form”; and, at the conclusion [of the session of practice], the dissolution [of the deity] into fundamental luminous clarity, the “dwelling in the state beyond form.” The second, the four dwellings in the context of the phase of completion, are to be known through an understanding of the three higher initiations.
As to the four dwellings in terms of the resultant continuum, the enjoyment dimension of awakening is the “dwelling in a sphere” since this is the experience of bliss; the reality dimension of awakening, the “dwelling in water” since it is of one flavor [with everything], like pouring water into water, or devoid of the “corners” of discursive thought, like a drop of water; the manifest dimension of awakening, the “dwelling in form” since it has a form with face and arms; and the essential dimension of awakening, the “dwelling in the state beyond form,” since all dimensions are therein integrated.

There are many other methods of exposition, such as that of the [Hevajra Tantra] Two Examinations, which teaches all tantras by including them within the two phases [generation and completion], or that of the Worldly Lord of
the Family Tantra, which expounds the tantras in terms of the four essential principles.[35] The exposition style of Kalachakra, the king of all tantras, is stated in Pundarika's Great Commentary [Stainless Light]:[36]
On the basis of the mundane and supramundane truths,[37] a complete elucidation is made of the total purity through the four aspects of perfect awakening or four vajras,[38] the four dimensions of awakening,[39] the six families,[40] the twelve truths,[41] the sixteen essential realities,[42] the sixteen emptinesses and the sixteen compassions whose essential natures constitute the subject matter and the means of conveying the subject matter,[43] the ten mundane initiations, and the eleventh, the supramundane one.[44] A complete elucidation is made of the action seal, pristine awareness seal, and the great seal, as well as the mundane and supramundane powers.[45] [These elucidations] are of the essential natures of the five chapters, or five analyses [of the Kalachakra Tantra]: the [outer] world system, the inner [vajra body], the actual conferral of initiation, the sadhana practice, and pristine awareness.[46]
Accordingly, the teachings of Kalachakra, such as the two phases [of generation and completion] which are based on the two truths, the four awakenings, and so forth, are expounded in relation to the outer, inner, and alternative levels. As is said:
As for the outer, likewise the inner; As for the inner, likewise the alternative.
To explain, with the exception of standard terminologies, every word is expounded extensively in terms of the three levels (outer, inner, and alternative), or concisely in terms of the two meanings (provisional and definitive), as is done in the Commentaries by Bodhisattvas.[47]
In short, to expound a particular tantra, one must be knowledgeable of the content of many tantras and possess the elements of the teaching methods of individual tantras and the instructions of masters. In a way appropriate to the intellect of the student, one must introduce the pith meaning and teach the tantra based on the four reliances.[48] The detailed explanation [of how to teach tantra] is to be learned from a master's instructions in the context of the expositions of individual tantras. Accordingly, Vajragarbha's Commentary [Epitomizing the Hevajra Tantra] states:[49]
Understanding of Chakrasamvara and Chatuhpita should be derived from the Hevajra Tantra; Understanding of Hevajra and the Concise Chakrasamvara, from Chatuhpita; And understanding of their definitive meanings, from the Supreme Primordial Buddha (Kalachakra) and the Great Chakrasamvara.
Those who aspire to the path should always understand All tantras such as those just mentioned Through brief and extensive presentations of other tantras As well as through their commentaries.[50]

At the present time, the system widely known for the expositions of the Chakrasamvara, Hevajra, and other tantras, and which represents, in particular, the meaning of the Continuation of the Guhyasamaja Tantra, is that of holders of the esoteric instructions of Naropa and his followers, whereby all tantras are expounded in terms of the three continuums.
Expositions in terms of the causal continuum include teachings on the way in which the intrinsically pure nature, or state of perfect peace, exists in all sentient beings; and descriptions of [the vajra body] (possessor of this nature) with a detailed breakdown into thirty-six constituents (aggregates, elements, and sense fields); or, concisely stated, teachings on the way in which body, speech, and mind exist.
Expositions in terms of the method continuum include teachings on the path that effects ripening [of the student], that of the initiation, and the path that effects liberation, the way of cultivating the two phases [of generation and completion] and their branches.
Expositions in terms of the resultant continuum include teachings on the actualization of the dimensions of awakening and pristine awarenesses, beginning with the conferral of initiation to ripen that which abides as the cause, followed by the cultivation of the two phases which develop contemplation [in the state] of realization and thereby the stage of attainment.

Persons who listen to [teachings on] tantras [expounded] in the ways set forth [above] must first have received initiation in the appropriate manner and have assumed the vows. When an exposition is being given, a protective circle[51] is first imagined, and an offering of food to the sky-farers and other [beings] is made. The environment and inhabitants are viewed as the mandala [of the deity], and an offering such as gold is made to the teacher. Modelled on early events of [Buddha's] teaching [of tantra], the master is imagined as the lord of the mandala, and the student, as the requester of the tantra, and so forth, by means of contemplation carried out by both student and teacher.
Students must eliminate the faults of body, speech, and mind, or eleven failings: physical unfitness (sleepiness, and so on), playing, joking, angry confrontation, babble, involvement in evaluations and deductions due to strong inclination towards sophism, lacking esoteric instructions, having false instructions, or having received them from an unripened [uninitiated] individual, harboring a competitive attitude, and a desire for material gain.
Those who expound and listen to the tantras in the ways described, with undistracted minds and endowed with the ornaments of speech, reap measureless benefits, both temporary and lasting. They gain the special attention of the sixth family[52] [Vajradhara] and the Lord of Secrets [Vajrapani], and others, and are cared for by them, as well as being protected and nurtured as cherished siblings or children by all the awareness-holders and their attendant oath-bound sky-farers.

[Vimalamitra's] Great Perfection Endowed with Conch Letters states:[2]
Of the different collections of precious teachings, [mantra belongs to] the phenomenology collection.
Thus, the master Vimalamitra and others assert that of the two aspects of the phenomenology collection, outer and inner, mantra [belongs to] inner phenomenology. [However,] the Mode of Transcendent Wisdom in One Hundred and Fifty Stanzas states:[3]
The eighteen sets of tantras constitute the eighteen major sets of discourses (sutras).
The master Shantigarbha[4] and others reflect similar viewpoints in statements such as this:
Since it reveals profound topics in a succinct form, [it belongs to] the collection of discourses.
Thus, there seem to be different assertions on the place of secret mantra [within the Buddha's teachings]. However, certain masters consider what is referred to as the “awareness-holders' collection of teachings” as a separate collection: the [Indian] master Aryadeva, the Tibetan scholar Rok DershekChenpo, the omniscient Drimé Özer (Longchenpa), and the Lord of Dharma Terdak Lingpa[5] all maintain that, in general, this constitutes a fourth [collection of teachings]. The Majestic Creative Energy of the Universe states:[6]
The 21,[000] teachings of the discipline collection Were delivered in order to overcome desire. The 21,[000] teachings of the discourses collection Were delivered in order to overcome aversion. The 21,[000] teachings of the phenomenology collection Were delivered in order to overcome delusion. The 21,[000] teachings of the fourth collection Were delivered in order to overcome all of these. In short, although 84,[000] teachings were delivered, All were intended to overcome afflictive emotions.
Moreover, the Array of Qualities Tantra states:[7]
The three outer collections of teachings Were taught as the particular remedies For desire, aversion, and delusion, respectively. The secret mantra, which equals the unsurpassable, Was taught as the remedy for all afflictions.
According to what is said in the general scriptures of the Buddha's words, the ways are not considered to be limited to one specific number. This is so because the Buddha's compassion reveals whatever is appropriate for those to be guided, in accordance with their levels of intelligence. The [Transcendent Wisdom] Extensive [Scripture] states:
The unsurpassable and inconceivable ways that have been taught Are none other than what manifests to the individual's mind.
The Descent to Lanka [Discourse] states:[8]
In order to guide all sentient beings I have explained many different ways. It is not a case of “this is the way.”

The different stages may also be considered collectively. For example, the White Lotus of the Sacred Doctrine states:
There is one way, not three ways.
This kind of statement [of the Buddha] is referring to the result [of the way]; from that perspective, ultimately, there is only one way. Nevertheless, two ways are differentiated, that of the lesser way and the greater way; or, alternatively, the causal way [sutra] and resultant way [tantra]. There are three ways [when differentiated into] the ways of the proclaimers, solitary sages, and bodhisattvas; or, alternatively, the way [of sutra] that leads away from the source of suffering; the way [of outer tantra] [that resembles] Vedic austerity; and the way [of inner tantra] of the dominating method.[9] There are four [when differentiated into] the three causal ways[10] and the resultant way. Moreover, Descent to Lanka states:[11]
As long as mind continues,
There is no end to spiritual ways.
When the mind has been transformed
There is neither a traveller nor a way.[12]
This passage points out that as long as there are various levels of conceptual mind, the ways [to realization] will be without end and are therefore inconceivable. It goes so far as to say that a so-called “way” with paths to travel, traveller of those paths, and so on, does not exist except as meanings attributed by the conceptual mind.

Nonetheless, the General Scripture [that Unifies the Knowledge of All Buddhas] states:[13]
Moreover, Lord of Lanka, The definitive and ultimate way Is taught in three precise divisions: The way that leads one from the source of suffering, [That resembles] Vedic austerity, and that of the dominating method.
Each of these three is subdivided into three sets: the three sets of the way of characteristics [of the proclaimer, solitary sage, and bodhisattva];[14] the three sets of outer tantras [action, ubhaya or conduct,[15] and yoga]; and the three sets of inner tantras [mahayoga, anuyoga, and atiyoga]. This ninefold set of successive grades of ways is very well known. Thus, [this system] is said to comprise four collections from the perspective of the overcoming of specific emotional afflictions, or nine ways to accommodate three [levels of] faculties, superior, average, and inferior, each of which has three levels.

The way of the ground denotes the causal continuum or the ground that is to be realized. The ground is referred to by various expressions: in the
causal way, it is called the “ground-of-all pristine awareness”; in kriya (action) tantra, “essential reality of self”;[19] in ubhaya and yoga tantras, “the signless, ultimate dimension, the potentiality of which is viewed relatively as the deities of the vajradhatu mandala”; in mahayoga, “the great dimension of reality of the superior indivisibility of the two truths”; in anuyoga, “the mandala of original pure and perfect mind, the offspring [of great bliss][20] which is the indivisibility of the ultimate dimension and pristine awareness”; and in atiyoga, “essence,” “nature,” and “compassionate energy.”[21]
In whatever terms it is defined, the ground is explained precisely as that which is present as the nature of the indestructible sphere, the reality dimension of awakening, or original pure and perfect mind itself, in the midst of the refined essences of the five [elements] (supports for the causal continuum) in the center of the channel-wheel of phenomena at the heart of all embodied beings. Even the pairs of the six refined essences (of the five elements, plus mind) are essentially identical [in the ground]. Thus, the ground primordially abides as the nature of the three indestructible vajras, which represent the extremely subtle three doors [of body, speech, and mind], utterly immutable.
The ground being designated as a “way” is [a case of] referring to a basis [i.e, the ground] with the name of that which relies on that basis [i.e., the way]. [Buddhaguhya's] Sequence of the Path states:
The way of the ground is presented first.
Although the way of gods and humans is said to be the ground or precondition for all ways, in this context, the ground is considered to be as just stated above.
The supreme way of the path (which presents the explanation) includes everything from the way of the proclaimers up to anuyoga. These ways are correlated with the days of the lunar calendar, from the third to the fourteenth [of the waxing moon], respectively.
The way of the result is the supreme pristine awareness of natural luminous clarity which transcends explanation and thought, cause and effect, commitment and effort. This is the final result to which all other ways lead: atiyoga itself.

The first [three] of the nine grades of ways are the three sets of teachings with specific characteristics [the way of characteristics]: the way of proclaimers, that of solitary sages, and that of bodhisattvas. These guide one toward liberation by means of relinquishing karmic actions and emotional afflictions which are the source or cause [of suffering], and are therefore known as the way of liberation from the source of suffering.
[The second three of the nine are] the three sets that constitute the outer tantras: kriya (action), ubhaya (conduct) or “tantra of both,” and yoga (union) tantra. In these yogas, the practitioner must engage in ritual practices such as ablution and strict cleanliness resembling the customs of Brahmin proponents of the Vedas. Hence, these three tantras are known as the way [resembling] Vedic austerity.
The presentation of those six is essentially identical to the way explained above in the context of the new schools of mantra. Thus, one should gain knowledge of them from the common explanation given above.

The three [inner] yogas are the tantra [system of] mahayoga, the elucidation [system] of anuyoga, and the esoteric instructions [system of] atiyoga.[22] These yogas conclusively establish the knowledge that everything animate and inanimate, the form manifestation of the dimensions of awakening and pristine awarenesses, mind nature, is the indivisibility of the two superior truths,[23] beyond any [specific] way of conduct. The yogas are therefore the skillful methods whereby all phenomena are “dominated” within the state of total sameness and so are spoken of by the general designation of the “way of the dominating method.” These three yogas are also known as the three sets, generation, completion, and the great perfection, respectively.

As to the special features of those three, Lhajé Zurchungpa[24] distinguishes them based on their views. Mahayoga is distinctive in its understanding that all phenomena are the magical display of the indivisibility of appearance and emptiness, mind's nature. Anuyoga is distinctive in its understanding that all phenomena are the creative energy of the nonduality of the ultimate dimension [of phenomena] and pristine awareness, mind's nature. Atiyoga is distinctive in its understanding that all phenomena are the very manifestation of primordial, naturally present, pristine awareness, which is without origin or cessation, mind's nature. Longchenpa's [Great Chariot ] states:
Mahayoga, the father tantra, the nature of method [related to] appearance, [is taught] to benefit those whose strongest emotional affliction is aversion and who are subject to excessive discursiveness.
Anuyoga, the mother tantra, the wisdom of the completion phase [related to] the essential reality of emptiness, [is taught] to benefit those whose strongest emotional affliction is desire and who delight in stillness of mind.
Atiyoga, the nature of nonduality, [is taught] to benefit those whose strongest emotional affliction is delusion and who are tarnished by [attachment to] effort.[25] The Great Array states:[26]
The generation phase is for minds elevated [with many concepts]; The completion phase, for minds with attachment [to the experience of bliss]; And the great perfection, for the most secret and supreme.
Thus, the yogas are described in those terms. Furthermore, Longchenpa's Finding Comfort and Ease in the Nature of Mind states:
Mahayoga emphasizes winds and the methods of the generation phase.
Anuyoga emphasizes the constituent [of bliss] and the wisdom of the completion phase;
Atiyoga emphasizes pristine awareness from which nothing is separate.

The entrance to mahayoga is the conferral of initiation for which the setting is the mandala. Generally, seven mandalas are explained, as stated in the Magical Manifestation:
In this context, mandala comprises the mandala of the nature,
The mandala of reflected images, the superior mandala of reflected images,
The contemplation mandala, the superior contemplation mandala,
The bodhichitta mandala, and the supreme assembly mandala.
The first of these, the mandala of the nature, is divided into the mandala of the nature and the spontaneously perfect mandala of the nature. Thus, there are the eight mandalas, explained as follows:
First, the fundamental nature of all cyclic existence and perfect peace, the ultimate dimension of reality which is not in the least subject to conceptual formulations, is called the mandala of the nature.
Second, the nature of pristine awareness endowed with two purities,[2] being spontaneously perfect as the essential cause of the sevenfold riches[3] and thereby effecting the welfare of sentient beings, is called the spontaneously perfect mandala of the nature.
Third, the four continents and Mount Meru existing as the reflection of the five pristine awarenesses is called the mandala of reflected images.
Fourth, [the four continents and Mount Meru] depicted in colored powders, on painted cloth, or in three-dimensional construction is called the superior mandala of reflected images. Being constructed by human effort, it is referred to as “superior.”
Fifth, the yogin's contemplation that is devoid of conceptual constructs is called the mandala of contemplation.
Sixth, the yogin's meditation on the mandala circle in the phase of generation is called the mandala of superior contemplation. Being imaginatively created, it is referred to as the “superior contemplation mandala.”
Seventh, the bodhichitta, or kunda [semen], is called the mandala of bodhichitta.
Eighth, a gathering of any number of yogins and yoginis engaged in practice is called the mandala of the assembly.

Specifically, the actual mandalas used to confer initiation are the four mandalas that correspond to the particular level [of recipient], and the [four] mandalas [of the four initiations] suited to effect the ripening of the majority of individuals in present times [the mandalas of colored powders, the bhaga, and relative and ultimate bodhichitta]. The former four are the mandala of the nature of pristine awareness; the superior reflected images of contemplation mandala, also called the emanated mandala; the mandala of the experience of total presence;[4] and the superior reflected images mandala.[5]
The first three of these are explained in the Vajra of Magical Manifestation[6] as mandalas used in cases of conferral of a particular initiation by a master who is a perfect buddha, one who dwells on the final path,[7] and one who dwells on the path of meditation or path of seeing, respectively. The students receiving the initiation would be, respectively, bodhisattvas on the final stage of awakening; those who have developed to perfection the qualities associated with the paths of seeing and meditation; and the paths of accumulation and preparation. Hence, these mandalas are the spheres of experience of exalted individuals.
The fourth is conferral of initiation into the superior reflected images mandala, performed by a qualified master who has gained at least a similitude of stability in contemplation, and conferred on students of good fortune. Depending on the type of student, there is an appropriate conferral for which a mandala of colored powders is used to initiate a student of lesser fortune; one painted on cloth, to initiate one of middling fortune; and a mandala that is no more than a tiny referent, such as a small heap [of precious stones or flowers or the deity's symbol], to initiate one of supreme fortune. Accordingly, the Gathering of the Joyful Ones of the Eight Transmitted Precepts Root Initiation Ritual says:
As to conferral of initiation in a particular mandala,
Those said to be the best, average, or least adept
Are given initiation in the three mandalas, respectively,
Of flowers, the painted, and the colored powders.

The mandalas used to confer the profound initiations are the same as those for the three high initiations as explained above [in the section on mandala in the new tradition].[8]
In accordance with the Net of Magical Manifestation, the actual initiations are as stated in the [Secret] Essence:[9]
Knowing that he is endowed with faith and energy, and [capable
of ] deliberate behavior,
Confer on him the initiations that bring benefit, and after that
Confer in sequence the initiations that impart ability.
Accordingly, the ten outer initiations that bring benefit (diadem, head ornament, [the chaplet, armor, victory banner, seals, parasol, vase, food and drink, and five essences]) are conferred to ripen persons who have faith.[10]
The five initiations that impart ability are conferred to ripen persons who have energy. The initiation [of Ratnasambhava] concerning listening and the initiation [of Akshobhya] concerning meditation impart the ability to accomplish one's own welfare. The initiation [of Amitabha] concerning teaching and the initiation [of Amoghasiddhi] concerning awakened activity impart the ability to accomplish others' welfare. The initiation [of the five buddha families] concerning the infinite teachings of the vajra king imparts the ability to accomplish both the welfare of oneself and that of others.[11]
The three initiations of profundity are conferred to ripen persons of three [types]: those [capable of] the deliberate behavior of tantric conduct, the deliberate behavior of awareness, and the deliberate behavior of sameness.[12]
According to the general transmitted teachings [such as] Gathering of the Joyful Ones, there are four initiations in the sadhana tradition. The Commentary on the Pure Scripture states:[13]
The outer, inner, and secret initiations, and the initiation
That generally encompasses all the ways and their views:
Confer these initiations in sequence and in their entirety.
Thus, the four are the outer, inner, and secret initiations, and the initiation of essential reality. The outer initiation is conferred so that students who are dominated by aversion may use [the practice of] releasing [beings][14] as the path. Conferral of this initiation is by means of one hundred and eight outer and inner ritual objects, such as the vase.
The inner initiation is conferred so that those students who are dominated by pride may use the deity as the path. Conferral of this initiation is by means of the physical body.
The secret initiation is conferred so that those students who are dominated by desire may use sexual union as the path. Conferral is by means of the aid of a consort.
The initiation of essential reality is conferred so that those students who are dominated by delusion may use discursive thought as the path. Conferral is by means of the mind.
In the special transmitted teachings of the sadhana practices such as that of Vajrakila, four initiations are conferred as in the general transmitted teachings common to the highest yoga tantra. Moreover, although within the especially profound tradition of accomplished masters there are many conferrals of initiation, in terms of general categories, all initiations of the highest [tantra] are contained within the four initiations just mentioned.

In a general enumeration of the views associated with the stages of the path (wherein the views are applied), the great pioneer Buddhaguhya speaks of nine: one, the view of the wisdom of ascertainment of the indivisibility of the two truths;[17] two, the view of reality, that of great emptiness;[18] three, the view of all-illuminating illusory compassion;[19] four, the view of the single seal, the union of appearance and emptiness;[20] five, the view of the elaborate seal, the realization of the myriad of thoughts as the mandala;[21] six, the view on the path of preparation of everything-in-one-group practice,[22] which uses objects of desire as the path; seven, the view on the path of seeing of the power of body and life span,[23] which is mastery of unconditioned total presence; eight, the view on the path of meditation of the great seal, in which the mind never strays from the sameness of the true nature of things: nine, the view on the final path of spontaneous perfection, the knowledge that is pristine awareness devoid of any object. Additionally, Buddhaguhya speaks of nine types of views on the meaning of tantra as the object of practice:[24] the view of the pledges not to be transgressed, the view of the conduct in which there is nothing to be practiced or avoided, and the other [seven]. [These views are set forth] because all of those topics of tantra are to be contemplated having been sealed with the view of the indivisibility of the two truths.

What follows now is a detailed explanation of the meaning of the view as the characteristic of knowledge which is the [primary] cause [of awakening],[25] also known as the view of the wisdom of ascertainment, or the view of essential reality (among the ten topics [of the tantras]):[26]
The superior ultimate truth is posited as the ineffable [state of ] total presence, spontaneously perfect as the essential cause of manifestation. The creative energy of that presence—the myriad of thoughts—which manifests in and of itself as the mandala of awakened dimensions and pristine awarenesses is posited to be the superior relative truth.[27] Neither one of these two truths represents solely the side of appearance or the side of emptiness because the truths manifest as a total sameness, in essence indivisible.[28]
Although the two truths are designated as “indivisible,” this indivisibilty is not within the sphere of experience because it transcends the objects of the thoughts and expressions that [try to] capture it. The description “superior” is applied because the manner of realizing the two truths far surpasses that of the way of characteristics.
The axioms used to conclusively establish the indivisibility of the two truths are not ones based on sophism and fallacious reasonings but are instead the extraordinary four great [sets of ] axioms:[29] the axioms of the four understandings, the three purities, the four samenesses, and the total state of being.

The axioms of the four understandings are the means by which all phenomena are conclusively established as the indivisibility of the [two] truths. What is taken as the basis for evaluation [in the first axiom] is adherence on the part of the dualistic mind which apprehends as separate the appearances of cyclic life and perfect peace. The means of evaluation is that of the axiom of the identical cause through which all phenomena are established as being of an unborn nature.
Likewise, adherence to the conclusion established from each of the previous axioms is then taken as the basis of evaluation[30] for the next axiom.
Evaluations by means of the axioms of the mode of letters, the empowering energy, and the direct cognizance establish conclusions in the following sequence: [on the basis of the conclusion that] all phenomena are of an unborn nature, the axiom of the mode of letters establishes [the radiance of the unborn nature] as unimpeded expressive energy;[31] the axiom of the empowering energy establishes that [the unborn nature and the unimpeded expressive energy] are in essence indivisible; and the axiom of direct cognizance establishes that such reality transcends the intellect.
As to the ways these are evaluated, the subject of the first axiom is all phenomena included within cyclic existence and perfect peace. All share an identical cause[32] in being mind nature, the unborn dimension of naturally present pristine awareness. [This is so] because the phenomena of cyclic existence and perfect peace seem to appear separately depending on whether or not they are realized to be of an identical nature, although they have no separate existence whatsoever. Thus is stated the axiom of the identical cause.

The subject of the second axiom is the radiance of the unborn nature of mind. The unimpeded expressive energy of such radiance manifests in and by itself as the mandalas of the dimensions of awakening and pristine awarenesses. [That this is so is] understood through the example of the [meaning represented by] the letter a, which itself cannot be pointed out, but which manifests as many letters that point to it. Thus is stated the axiom of the mode of letters.[33]
The subject of the third axiom is both the unborn nature [of mind] and the unimpeded expressive energy. Although referred to with different words, when the two are understood to be indivisible, there spontaneously arises the empowering energy of understanding their true nature as an indivisible essence. [This is so] because the superior ultimate truth is spontaneously perfect as the essential cause of the seven riches, and when its [illusory] appearances cease, the environment and its inhabitants naturally manifest as the mandalas of the dimensions of awakening and pristine awarenesses. Thus is stated the axiom of the empowering energy.[34]
The subject of the fourth axiom is the indivisibility of the [two] truths [unborn nature and unimpeded expressive energy]. Such indivisibility transcends mind's sphere of experience. This is so because, through direct cognizance of total presence, the indivisibility is understood to be intrinsic clarity devoid of any object, inexpressible and inconceivable. Thus is stated the axiom of direct cognizance.[35]

The environment, its inhabitants, and mental continuums are
understood to be pure.
The subject of this axiom is outer and inner phenomena which appear in this way [as environment, inhabitants, and their mental continuums]. All are, and have always been, in a state of enlightenment as the mandalas of the dimensions of awakening and pristine awarenesses. [This is so] because they are endowed with three purities. That is because the five elemental properties of the environmental world are pure in being the five female consorts [of the buddhas]; the five aggregates of the inhabitants are pure in being the five male buddhas; and the mental continuums, the eightfold group of consciousnesses, are pure in being the five pristine awarenesses.[37]

The axiom of sameness is taught [in the Secret Essence Tantra]:[38]
By virtue of two samenesses and two superior samenesses
[All things are] the mandala of the realm of Samantabhadra.
The subject is phenomena appearing in the way they do. All are, from the very beginning, in a state of enlightenment as the dimension of reality. [This is so] because they are endowed with the four samenesses.
Of the four, two are common, and two, superior. The first of the two common samenesses [is explained in this way]: A person appearing as a person is an appearance that is conventionally real. A pile of stones appearing to be a person is an appearance that is conventionally unreal. Both the conventionally real and the conventionally unreal are the same in being appearances that are illusions.
The second common sameness [is explained as follows:] To overcome only one aspect of conceptual constructs, such as to understand that a sprout does not arise from [a cause that is of the same nature as] itself, is a partial ultimate truth.[39] To overcome all conceptual constructed limits, such as to overcome the constructs of the four limits ([understanding] that a sprout does not arise from itself, from another, [from both, or from neither])[40] is the all-encompassing ultimate truth. Both the partial and the all-encompassing ultimate truths are the same in being unborn. Those are the two common samenesses.
The first of the two superior samenesses is as follows: A thing that appears and can perform a function is conventionally real. A thing that appears but cannot perform a function is conventionally unreal. Both the conventionally real and conventionally unreal are conditioned karmic appearances and therefore conventionally unreal. Thus, both are the same in being the mandalas of the dimensions of awakening and pristine awarenesses.
As to the second superior sameness, emptiness [posited] as absolute negation, that is, as the emptiness of self-nature of all phenomena, is the partial ultimate truth. Emptiness as an affirmative negation that is the union of the ultimate dimension of phenomena and pristine awareness, the nature of mind existing as nothing whatsoever, is the all-encompassing ultimate truth. Both the partial and the all-encompassing ultimate truths are the same in being spontaneously perfect as the essential cause of the ultimate seven riches. Thus is stated the axiom of the four samenesses.

The axiom of the total state of being[41] is taught [in the Secret Essence Tantra]:[42]
Naturally present pristine awareness manifests with no fixed abode.
The subject of the axiom is all phenomena of cyclic existence and perfect peace. Phenomena seem to appear as a multitude [of things], but in actuality, this is not the case. This is so because, from the very beginning, everything abides as the total state of being, that of great naturally present pristine awareness alone, the unborn nature of mind. Thus, the Array [of the Path of the Net of Magical Manifestation] states:[43]
All this appearance is consciousness alone
Devoid of inherent self-nature: naturally present
Pristine awareness, manifesting with no fixed abode.
Thus, the view of mahayoga, established conclusively by those axioms, is the understanding of uncontrived reality, the indivisibility of the [two] superior truths.
The riches referred to in the expression “seven riches” means riches like those found in a treasure of inexhaustible wealth. The seven consist of the three [ultimates], the ultimate of dimensions, the ultimate of pristine awarenesses, and the ultimate of results, the last comprising [five] subparts, the five inexhaustible ornaments of the body, speech, mind, qualities, and activity of the awakened state. The first, the ultimate of dimensions, exists as the emptiness aspect; the second, the ultimate of pristine awarenesses, as the clarity aspect; and the last, the ultimate of results, as the basis of emanations.

As for meditation in mahayoga, in the tradition that emphasizes sadhana practice, the eight [systems of] knowledge of the eight sets of sadhanas are taught.[44] As to their general meaning, at the time of the ground, the true nature of the eightfold group of consciousnesses is present as the essence of the nine vast spaces of pristine awareness.[45] At the time of the path, there is manifestation as the mudras, mantras, and contemplations of the eight major sadhanas. At the time of the result, there is full awakening to essential reality, known as “Glorious Heruka.” The particular meanings of the eight sadhanas [are explained next]:
[First,] [the practices of ] the knowledge of Manjushri [tantras of awakened body] are known as the “transformation of the life[-force] into pristine awareness” by means of the rotation of the four channel-wheels[46] at the four places [of the body]. It is stated:
All the infinite [practices] of Manjushri Yamantaka[47] Have been concentrated in a single one
By the great master Manjushrimitra
To be understood in the four channel-wheels:
The secret channel-wheel, contained in the mind,
The channel-wheel of existence, contained in the navel,
The cutting channel-wheel, contained in the hands,
And the channel-wheel of emanation, contained in the feet.
Thus, it should be understood that the total state of being
Is contained in the four channel-wheels.[48]

<d e="2">
The first of the four channel-wheels encompasses everything in cyclic existence and perfect peace. The second derives from the true nature of the three realms of existence.[49] The third accomplishes the ten awakened activities through the ten symbolic mandalas [of Manjushri Yamantaka]. The ten are these:
Appeasing, enriching, dominating, killing, summoning,
Expelling, dividing, stupefying, maddening, and suppressing...
The fourth is the understanding that all things are manifestations created by mind. These four channel-wheels are also connected to the ground, the path, and the result.
[Second,] all [practices] of the knowledge of Padma, awakened speech,[50] are contained in the “three neighs of the horse.”[51] It is stated:
All the sadhanas of Padma, awakened speech,
Are concentrated in the three neighs
Wherein is natural pristine awareness.
Primordial, naturally present pristine awareness [manifests] with divine pride [in the form] of the glorious Hayagriva and neighs three times. With the first neigh, all phenomena of cyclic existence and perfect peace are understood to be uncreated and yet spontaneously perfect. With the second neigh, the environment and its inhabitants are transformed into an ocean of meat, blood, and bones, to be enjoyed by mamos[52] and sky-farers. With the third neigh, all mamos and sky-farers are persuaded to obey commands and carry out duties entrusted to them.

[Third,] all [practices] of Vishuddha are contained in the knowledge of the “holding enlightenment in one's fist” [practice of] continuous contemplation. It is said:
The single realization of Vishuddha Unifies all the great bliss of the buddhas. Its deep yoga perfects the three dimensions: All is the mandala of secret pristine awareness.
In the essence of the single sphere of the naturally present essence of enlightenment, the pristine awareness of the Great Glorious One[53] is already perfected as the totality of everything. Hence, one's body is visualized as the palatial residence of the charnel ground display, within which one's mind manifests as the pristine awareness circle of Shri Heruka. All mantras and deities are complete in the emanating and reconverging of the eight syllables of the ru lu [mantra], as is stated:
Om represents the ten blood-drinking males and females;[54] The first ru lu represents the eight gauris;[55] The second ru lu, the eight simhas;[56] The hum, the four gate-guardians, [such as] Horse-Head;[57] Bhyo, the twenty-eight ishvaris;[58] The second hum, the splendor gathered in the five dimensions;[59] Everything included [in the mantra] from om to hum Ripens into the fifty-eight blood-drinking herukas,[60] But their natures, or essential beings, Abide in the essence of the syllable hum.

[Fourth,] all [practices of] Mahottara[61] are contained in the knowledge of Pure Nectar, as explained by the scholar Jemala [Vimalamitra]:
All of the environment and its inhabitants, the outer and inner, Is contained within the five types of nectars, To be realized as the buddhas of the five families.[62]
That is to say, everything is conclusively established as the ground, path, and result of the [five] nectars, and the finality of knowledge is achieved on the basis of the three [factors of] act, agent, and object acted upon.
[Fifth,] all Kila [practices] are contained in the knowledge of the Piercing Kila.[63] [Padmasambhava] states:
To free evil beings of the three existences, I, King Lotus-[Born,] Garland of Skulls,
Have taught Vajra Kila, Lord of Three Existences,[64]
As epitomized in the four [kinds of ] kila.
The four kinds of kila are the kila of pristine awareness which is total presence; the kila of supreme bodhichitta; the kila of boundless compassion; and the kila made of composite matter. These four strike and pierce the four “objects” [respectively, of ignorance, the unrealized condition, beings of the six realms, and enemies who encompass the ten areas], thereby actualizing the four results [the four dimensions of awakening].

[Sixth,] all mamo [practices] are contained in the channels, winds, and bodhichitta, which correspond to the site, action, and support, respectively. It is said:
All the mamo of existence are included
In the channels, winds, and vital essence.
[The syllable] ma [in mamo] represents the ultimate dimension of phenomena; [the syllable] mo, the pristine awareness of total presence. Hence, everything that exists in the phenomenal [world] is perfect as [original] pure and perfect mind (bodhichitta), the inseparability of total presence and the ultimate dimension of phenomena.
[Seventh,] all [practices] of worship [of worldly deities] are contained in the three [aspects] of life: the original life, the life of the refined essence [of the five elements], and the additional life.[65]
[Eighth,] all [practices] of fierce mantra are contained in the three ways of observing [worship] and three ways of propitiation, which are [to relate to the deity] as master, as friend, or as servant.
Of those eight sadhanas, the first five are the five sadhanas of pristine awareness deities; the latter three, the three common sadhanas.

There are two levels of meditation in the tantra tradition,[66] the path of method and the path of liberation. The first, the path of method, [leads to] the attainment of the result, liberation, through engaging in actions that [normally] bind one [to cyclic existence]. [This path] principally involves a method whose distinctive feature is the conduct of deliberate behavior which enables one to swiftly achieve the sublime result. Hence, if such deliberate behavior—for which the three poisons are not abandoned but are directly overpowered—is practiced by someone endowed with the certainty of the view, he or she not only is unfettered [by the poisons], but also swiftly attains the result of liberation. However, if one who is not so endowed were to practice this conduct, not only would liberation not be achieved but there would also be a great risk of falling into bad forms of life. Such a method is therefore very risky, likened to the use of the mercury makshika [used in alchemy to transform iron into gold].[67]
This path of method comprises two aspects, as stated [in the Oceanic Magical Manifestation]:[68]
There are esoteric instructions for the upper door and the lower
door.
The former instruction concerns meditation done in a sequential way. It relies on the six channel-wheels of the upper door of one's own body.[69] Through applying the practice of the blazing [of the inner heat] and the dripping [of vital essence], one experiences the pristine awareness of great bliss as described in the Explanatory Tantra of the Oceanic [Magical Manifestation].[70]
The latter instruction concerns a simultaneous approach. It relies on [the union of] the “space” [of the female] and “secret” [of the male] at the lower door of another's body [that of the consort]. Through application of the four-branched practice (familiarization, complete familiarization, attainment, and great attainment), in an instant one forcibly elicits the pristine awareness of bliss and emptiness, thereby perfecting the stages and the paths at the same time.[71] This path of method of simultaneity is explained in the All-Surpassing Explanatory Tantra.[72]

The path of liberation emphasizes wisdom of three kinds,[73] through which certainty and understanding are gained. As a consequence, the fetters of one's mind are released by themselves and one becomes liberated in the vast space of one's true nature. Although this path does not possess the distinctive feature of swiftness characteristic of the path of method, the two paths do not differ in terms of arriving at the result at some point. Moreover, this path is almost free of risk, like the kaustubha gemstone [that separates gold from ore gradually].[74]
This path is differentiated according to the levels of faculties [of practitioners] into two, the simultaneous and the sequential. In the first, liberation is attained [simultaneous] with the time of initiation, as in the case of [King] Indrabhuti.[75] Concerning the second, the Tantra of the Secret Essence states:[76]
The retention of the characteristics of knowledge and application Constitutes the cause and condition that bring to maturation the result. Whoever is possessed of their power and potency becomes renowned Throughout the realm of the victorious awareness-holders.
That [sequential path] has three aspects: the cause, which is the view, the characteristic of knowledge; the condition, contemplation, the characteristic of application; and the result, [the state of ] awareness-holder. The first has been described above. The second aspect, contemplation, comprises the two, devotion meditation and definitive perfection.[77] These methods, distinguished with respect to the stages of the meditative process,[78] will be presented [in subsequent sections of the Infinite Ocean of Knowledge].

The All-Unifying [Pure Presence] says:[1]
The outer initiation, inner initiation,
Initiation of attainment, and secret initiation
Are complete with ten, eleven, thirteen,
And two aspects, respectively.
To explain, there are two procedures of conferral, one according to the tantra tradition and one according to the esoteric instructions tradition. In the first procedure, thirty-six initiations, complete in the “four rivers” of the outer, inner, attainment, and secret initiations, are conferred in the mandalas of the Root Scripture,[2] in accordance with what is explicitly taught in that tantra, on exceptional students who are naturally qualified and have an earnest interest in the profound meaning [of wisdom].
In the second procedure, eight hundred and thirty-one short ancillary initiations (derived from the thirty-six root initiations of the [All-] Unifying [Pure Presence] Scripture which encompasses all ways [to realization]) are conferred on ordinary students who are qualified by virtue of training and have an earnest interest in the vastness [of methods]. These initiations are conferred in accordance with the List of Rituals That Illuminates Great Bliss[3] in which the tradition of the entire [All-Unifying Pure Presence] Scripture is subdivided into individual ancillary mandalas.
Nowadays, masters have adopted the practice of incorporating into a single system the key elements of those two traditions, the tantras and the esoteric instructions, and conferring those initiations accordingly. Such a practice has the immediate advantage of being easy to perform, as well as achieving in the long run the special purpose of ensuring that neither system declines in favor of the other and that both are propagated together.
Both those traditions are alike in that they contain all four yogas[4] and all the initiations of the nine ways. The Analysis of the Meaning of Initiation states:[5]
Ten initiations confer the awakened lineage;
And eleven initiations, the inner and secret meaning.
Thirteen initiations are known as the great master;
The two perfect the initiations of the nine ways.

<d e="2">
Thus, this tradition of the entire [All-Unifying Pure Presence] Scripture does not represent a general [initiation] ritual compiled from rituals specific to each of the eight ways. Instead, this is a system particular to the elucidation [i.e., anuyoga] system in which one travels through the stages [of awakening] beginning with the first undetermined stage[6] up to and including the tenth stage. For this, one receives the tenfold initiation sequence (action and conduct tantras counted separately) starting with the initiation of [the way of] gods and humans up to the finality of the completion phase of the anuyoga system, which is [called] atiyoga.[7] This tenfold initiation sequence corresponds to that of the system of the nine ways when action and conduct are considered one and is therefore called the “initiation of the nine ways.”
These ways [to realization], which are supportive paths [of anuyoga's own path], incorporate elements similar to those of their individual paths. More than that, however, being essentially possessed of mantra's skillful means, they provide a swift path that gives rise to the various qualities that are similar to the kinds of relinquishments and attainments associated with these different paths.

The entrance to this way [of anuyoga] is by way of the nonduality of the ultimate dimension [of phenomena] and pristine awareness. The Majestic Creative Energy says:[8]
Those who aspire to the level of indivisibility in anuyoga, Having entered the way of the ultimate dimension and pristine awareness...
How does one enter? Not through generation, but through the mode of perfection. The Lock of the Heart says:
The unborn ultimate dimension itself is pristine awareness; The pristine awareness of total presence is the ultimate dimension itself;
The great bliss of this nondual expressive energy
Is not entered gradually. Instead, what is encountered
In all the symbols of phenomenal existence
Is like the flash of a fish from water:[9] All that exists
In the entire universe is [instantly] experienced as total symbol.

According to the view of anuyoga, all phenomena, from the very beginning, have always been the nature of perfect enlightenment in the mandala of original pure and perfect mind, the indivisibility of the three kinds of mandalas, the characteristic nature of which is the union of the ultimate dimension [of phenomena] and pristine awareness. The General Scripture that Unifies the Knowledge of All Buddhas says:[10]
Since everything is one in the state of pure being,
All is the great bliss of primordial enlightenment,
The essence beyond arising and cessation.
All is the three mandalas that transcend action,
Primordially present and spontaneously perfect.
Of the three mandalas mentioned in that [passage], the first, “the mandala of primordial suchness,” is the vast space of total purity of the mother Samantabhadri, the unborn nature of mind, beyond all conceptual limitations, in which everything that exists, all phenomena of cyclic existence and perfect peace, is included as the natural creative energy of mind.
The second, “the mandala of the spontaneously perfect nature,” is naturally present pristine awareness, Samantabhadra, whose very manifestation freely pervades the totality of that [vast space] without any restriction whatsoever.
The third, “the mandala of original pure and perfect mind” is great bliss, the offspring, which is the nonduality of the ultimate dimension [of phenomena] and pristine awareness, the two first mandalas being in essence an inseparable union.[11]

The first is the method to realize the innate pristine awareness of bliss from the melting [of vital essence], immutable supreme bliss. It comprises two [sets of ] esoteric instructions.

Concerning the path of liberation, the same text says:
Proceeding by means of study, reflection, and meditation,
One enters that [path] by three approaches:
The minds of analysis, the meaning, and letters.
First, to enter by way of analysis is to establish conclusively the view, which is a prerequisite for the path. This involves discerning examination of knowable objects by means of logical reasoning that brings about understanding of them.[14] As a result, the authentic condition of all phenomena, the true nature, primordial suchness, is conclusively established as the inexpressible, inconceivable, and indescribable nature of the three mandalas. [This represents] the tenet, or view, of this system [of anuyoga], as it has just been explained.
Second, to enter by way of the meaning is to remain in contemplation without thoughts or symbolic attributes. The object of meditation is the state of the true nature of reality just as it is. Moreover, the meditating mind is placed in exactly the same state. This is known as “establishing [actually abiding in] the meaning [indicated by the view].”
Third, to enter by way of letters refers to contemplation of a deity with symbolic attributes. With the simple utterance of the seed-syllable or the mantra that generates the particular support [the deity's environment] and the supported [the deity], all of the universe and inhabitants, like the flash of a fish from water, is imagined clearly and distinctly as the palace and the circle of deities of the mandala. Practice that emphasizes this form of meditation is known as the “expression in signs.”
From the perspective of the utterly perfect path formed by those, anuyoga includes both the conditioned [or mundane paths] and unconditioned [or supramundane paths]. The first comprises the yoga of the aspiring mind [of the path of accumulation] and the yoga that reveals the great buddha family [of the path of preparation]. The second comprises the yoga that confers great encouragement [of the path of seeing], the yoga that receives the great prophetic declaration [of the path of meditation], and the yoga that perfects great creative energy [of the final path].[15]

The ground to be realized, or view, and those paths that lead to realization are connected to, or included within, three yogas: the yoga of the cause (the object of the action); the yoga of the condition (the action itself); and the yoga of result (transcendence of action).
The first refers to the authentic condition of all phenomena, that which abides perfectly and distinctly as the nature of the three mandalas.
The second refers to the three ways of the proclaimers, solitary sages, and bodhisattvas, which, through application of [those] paths with effort, enable one to transcend cyclic existence and thereby enter the provisional result of peace.
The third refers to the ways of the outer and inner mantra systems which, since mind's true nature is primordially and intrinsically pure, are free from the hope and fear involved in the effort of searching for the result [of awakening] outside of oneself.
Those two latter yogas are known as the “general common path.” In the anuyoga system, the above three yogas are classified according to the distinctions between the path of method and that of liberation. The first refers to the [real] meaning of tantra [“continuum”], that which is to be known; the second, to the sequential practice based on effort; and the third, to one's natural condition devoid of effort.

The conduct of anuyoga, as a general rule, is principally conduct in the state of total sameness.[16] The Miraculous Key to the Storehouse says:
Anuyoga of completion is the perfect enjoyment
Of the ultimate dimension and pristine awareness.
Specifically, anuyoga conduct is of three types: the conduct of empowering energy, the dominating conduct, and the conduct of method. The General Scripture [That Unifies the Knowledge of All Buddhas] says:[17]
The conduct of empowering energy,
Dominating conduct, and conduct of method
Are likened to the sky, and to a king,

Atiyoga initiations do not need to rely on the example pristine awareness [revealed] through the third initiation [of pristine awareness through wisdom]. Right from the start, fortunate students qualified to enter the mandala of the ultimate awakening mind are conferred the initiation of the creative energy of total presence[22] of the great perfection [system]. [The meaning of] this initiation is as stated by the master Manjushrimitra in his Essential Meaning of the Net of Magical Manifestation of Manjushri:[23]
The supreme initiation of profound reality is to attain
The initiation of the creative energy of total presence.
Being the realization of mind's nature, it is known as “initiation”:
The conferral of the diadem of the pristine awareness initiation.
In particular, in accordance with the [atiyoga] division of esoteric instructions, there are four initiations as stated in the Naturally Present Perfection:[24]
The elaborate, unelaborate,
The very unelaborate, and utterly unelaborate:
Four initiations in four aspects
Effect the ripening of the fortunate.
The four initiations, in sequence, purify the obscurations of body, speech, and mind, and the obscurations to omniscience; and establish the potencies for awakened body, speech, and mind, and naturally present luminous clarity. They empower [the student] in the four practices: the phase of generation, meditation on inner heat, and meditation on the union of bliss and emptiness (through which are realized the pristine awareness of primordial purity), and the practice to directly experience the state of spontaneous perfection, respectively.
These initiations represent four divisions within the higher initiation [the fourth]. Hence, although in number they are equal to the common initiations of highest yoga tantra, one should understand that their meaning is different. Furthermore, one must accept that a person who has received the mantric vows of the fourth initiation in common with the highest yoga tantra will be assuming a new set of vows not previously taken when he or she receives these particular initiations.

The view of atiyoga is divided according to distinctions in understanding based on the [practitioner's] level of faculties. This yields three divisions, as noted in the Great Array:[29]
The division on mind is for persons inclined to intellectualization;
The vast space division, for those inclined to the dimension of space;
And the esoteric instructions division, for those who do not strive
after stages.
Accordingly, the views of the three divisions of atiyoga are as follows: The division on mind [asserts] freedom from the limiting [concept] of things to be renounced since all phenomena are nothing other than mind's nature.[30] The vast space division which transcends action [asserts] freedom from the limiting [concept] of remedial measures since all phenomena are totally perfected in the primordial space of Samantabhadri, the true nature [of things]. The esoteric instructions division of profundity [asserts] freedom from the limiting [concepts] of both things to be renounced and remedial measures since the essential characteristic of everything is the real condition [already] established.[31]

The general view, or tenet, of the mind division [is presented first]. All that constitutes the compounded truth of the path—the stages of the ways, the two truths, generation and completion, and so forth, as well as conditioned fetters owing to rigid notions of adherence to those elements—is asserted to be the pristine awareness of total sameness, the nature of original pure and perfect mind, the ineffable, ultimate dimension of phenomena, the fundamental nature of ultimate truth, the great dimension of total freedom from cause and result, virtue and evil, and acceptance and rejection. In short, [the view] represents the transcendence of all phenomena which manifest as the dualism of apprehended and apprehender.
In accordance with this generally accepted view [of the mind division], seven distinctions are made. The first distinction in the mind division view asserts that the result is the source of mind. The result is the primordial ultimate dimension, within which no change occurs; and therefore, in mind, there is no movement or change. [Yet] from that changeless state, the spontaneously perfect appearance aspect of the very ground of freedom manifests as what seems to be cyclic life. However, because mind has never shifted from its [changeless] state, what manifests is empty of any characteristic of impurity. In terms of its appearance aspect, [that which manifests] arises from, abides in, and dissolves back into the [primordial] ultimate dimension, like a miraculous apparition in the sky: this is primordial freedom, without endeavor or effort, left on its own.

</d>
<d e="2">
The second distinction is the view of the transcendence of deviations and obscurations. [This asserts] that the eight ways (from the way [of gods and humans] up to anuyoga) are deviations from the [primordial] ground because they are creations of the conceptual mind. In contrast, in this system, [the ground], naturally present pristine awareness, is beyond conceptual mind, and therefore transcends causes and conditions. Thus, there are no obscurations in the true nature, that of total primordial emptiness, the real condition transcendent of thought, memory, limited positions, perceptions, and so on.
The third distinction is the view concerning the collapse of the foundation of logical reasoning. Understanding of unmodified reality in the totally ineffable nature of mind, the ground, effects freedom in the unborn essence. Since unimpeded creative energy surges pervasively throughout total openness, there is no base where karmic traces [can accumulate]; therefore the ripened results of good and bad actions do not exist. Thus, through the [indisputable] logic[32] of the true nature of reality, primordially empty and naturally purified, total freedom from all limits, there is freedom in the total sameness of cyclic existence and perfect peace.

<d e="2">
The fourth distinction is the view that [the true nature of reality] does not fall to one side and cannot be partitioned. This asserts that naturally present pristine awareness, mind's nature, pervades the totality of cyclic life and perfect peace. However, it is not limited to what is substantial (appearance), nor is it limited to the nonsubstantial (emptiness). It does not fall to the side of being neither of those or their union. Its essence is empty and therefore free from the limit of eternalism. Its creative energy is unimpeded and thus free from the limit of nihilism. As such, it is the true nature of reality, beyond action, transcending pleasure and pain.
The fifth distinction is the view that [the true nature] transcends partial and limited philosophical positions. [This asserts that] mind's essence does not abide anywhere, nor does it exist as anything; yet it appears in any way at all, manifesting with no restriction whatsoever. Thus, although it manifests, there is nothing to refute, grasp, or conceptualize.

</d>
<d e="2">
The sixth distinction is the view that [the true nature] is beyond the conceptual mind and transcends limited positions. [This asserts] that since naturally present pristine awareness is beyond the conceptual mind, whatever appears does not exist as [something] true or false, and is therefore the expressive energy of total freedom from the limits of existence and nonexistence.
The seventh distinction is the view that everything is part of mind. [This asserts] that all these appearances are the expressive energy of mind.[33] Therefore, even though such energy manifests in a variety of ways, since mind itself is without essence, the various appearances are also without essence. Moreover, the aspect of mind that apprehends what appears and the appearance that is apprehended, although seeming to be separate, are inseparable in being naturally present pristine awareness, the true nature which does not exist in any way. The spontaneously perfect manifestation of the natural creative energy [of pristine awareness] arises as the duality of cyclic life and perfect peace, yet that which gives rise to appearance is devoid of [any] essence. Thus, cyclic existence and perfect peace are released on their own, right where they arise.[34] These are the distinctive features [of views] within the division on mind.[35]

The general tenet of the vast space division [is presented first]. In the vast space of Samantabhadra, the true nature, naturally present pristine awareness, all phenomena, however they arise, are simply ornaments of manifestation that appear in and of themselves. Other than that, phenomena cannot be defined as bound or free, as what appear or what generate appearance. Therefore, phenomena are not considered to be manifestations of the creative energy or expressive energy [of mind] (as they are in the view of the division on mind). Instead, everything is understood to be boundless primordial freedom, which cannot be analyzed in terms of relational proof, existence or non-existence, being or not being, purity or impurity.

</d>
<d e="2">
There are four distinctions [within the vast space division's general view]. The first distinction is [the view of ] black vast space propounded as the absence of cause. This asserts that authentic, naturally present pristine awareness itself is unchanging, its nature transcending causes and conditions, and beyond limited aspects, and therefore unrelated to phenomena and their natures.
The second distinction is [the view of ] multicolored vast space propounded as diversity. This asserts that all that manifests as the expressive energy of naturally present pristine awareness is affirmed [in the sense of] being the ornament and expressive energy of the true nature manifesting on its own as a variety, yet is negated [in the sense] that the expressive energy manifesting pervasively and unrestrictedly can be neither refuted nor proven.
The third distinction is [the view of] white vast space propounded as mind. This asserts that everything manifesting from the state of self-originated total presence—outer appearances and inner cognizance—is the expressive energy of mind. Since appearances and their conditions are liberated in their own place, all things are pure from the beginning, with nothing to be done. Such is their authentic condition of being; thus, there is nothing to be realized.
The fourth distinction is [the view of ] infinite vast space in which cause and result are transcended. This asserts that all phenomena which appear from the state of naturally present pristine awareness are perceived as appearances by the mind, yet understood to be nonexistent by virtue of their authentic condition.[36]
Within these distinctions are twelve further divisions,[37] which form many categories such as the four vast spaces (expressive energy, ornament, true nature, and transcendence of action).[38]

In this system, the true nature of reality, primordially pure and liberated from the beginning, is viewed in a way contrary to [other systems. Other] bases and doctrines divide reality into objects of observation and observing consciousness and thereby validate the dichotomy of delusion and no delusion, or realization and no realization. [This view, however, asserts] that from the perspective of the very nature [of reality] which is beyond all conceptual constructs, both the object to be known and the subject, the knowing consciousness, are equal in not being real. Except for mere conventional usage, all thoughts and expressions that apprehend that duality are genuinely transcended. That being the case, this view directly flows to the essential point that is beyond intellect and analysis, thereby resembling moxabustion application.

There are three distinctions [within the general view of the esoteric instructions division]. The first is the view of the scattered teachings. [This asserts] that the true nature of reality is pristine awareness, which transcends the conceptual mind, arising instantaneously, without differentiation, exclusion, or reference.
The second is the view of the oral tradition. [This asserts] that the true nature of reality is, in essence, beyond the conceptual mind and free from delusion. Its nature [effects] the collapse of the foundation of conceptualization. Its character cannot be defined in any way.
The third is the view taught in the textual tradition of tantras of the esoteric instructions division itself. [This asserts] that the true nature of reality is the point of origin of all transmitted teachings. Its nature is beyond cyclic life and perfect peace, and therefore devoid of something to be renounced or something to strive for. As it does not abide in sounds or words, it is untouched by disputations concerning emptiness.[39]
There are many further distinctions based on different aspects of these views.[40] The principal ones, however, are distinctions within the third view, the four cycles that are renowned in the oral transmission and in the explanatory tantras: the outer cycle which resembles the body; the inner cycle which resembles the eyes; the secret cycle which resembles the heart; and the most secret cycle which resembles the body as a whole.

</d>
<d e="2">
First is the view of the outer cycle. In terms of essence, [the true nature of reality] is devoid of emotional afflictions; thus, the five poisons are used on the path. In nature, it involves neither effort nor attainment; thus, whatever manifests arises as reality itself. In character, it has no parts; thus, there is no division into emptiness and appearances.
The second is the view of the inner cycle. In terms of essence, [the true nature of reality] transcends form; thus, it is a reality without conceptual characteristics. In nature, it neither comes nor goes; thus, it is unceasingly present pristine awareness. In character, it penetrates both cyclic life and perfect peace, thereby resembling the root of a tree. Its own “face” looks in different [directions], thereby resembling the trunk. Its manifestations of creative energy extend everywhere, thereby resembling branches. Its clarity aspect is unobstructed, thereby resembling flowers. Its various aspects ripen into one, thereby resembling fruit.
The third is the view of the secret cycle. In terms of essence, since [the true nature of reality] is introduced and realized simultaneously, it is unrelated to the three kinds of wisdom. In nature, since the cessation of breathing [death] and liberation are simultaneous, reality is unrelated to the strength of experience. In character, since enlightenment and the emergence of compassionate energy are simultaneous, reality is unrelated to the two causal accumulations.
The fourth is the view of the most secret cycle. In terms of essence, [the true nature of reality] is not something to be known; thus, it is unrelated to an agent of knowing. In nature, it is directly seen; thus, reality is not the domain of analysis. In character, it is reached in the ultimate dimension of the primordial ground through the four visionary appearances,[41] within this very life, without generating hope for later results.

Meditation on the above views is of three forms: meditation in the division on mind is to remain in the state of total presence and emptiness, the dimension of reality. The vast space division meditation is to remain in the state of [one's own] true nature with no action or effort. The esoteric instructions division meditation is to remain in the state of primordial freedom, the true nature which is beyond renunciation and acceptance.
Generally, meditation in the great perfection tradition comprises two aspects: the approach of total relaxation and the direct leap approach.[42] These are explained in detail in subsequent parts [of the Infinite Ocean of Knowledge].

The three yogas (tantras, elucidations, and esoteric instructions) may be divided according to their structures of subparts. The division of each of the three yogas into three, the mahayoga of mahayoga, and so forth, yields nine yogas. These are explicitly mentioned in the Garland of Views esoteric instructions [of Guru Rinpoche]. As well, the Supplement to the Transmitted Teachings of the Elucidation of the Attainment of the Gathering of the Joyful Ones[46] provides an extremely detailed presentation, encapsulated as follows:
The mahayoga of mahayoga is the sequential generation of the mandala of the deities. The anuyoga of mahayoga is the natural mandala of spontaneous perfection. The atiyoga of mahayoga is the ultimate unborn essence.
The mahayoga of anuyoga is the generation in a simultaneous [mode] of the mandala of deities. The anuyoga of anuyoga is the perfect purity of the relative mandala of deities as the ultimate dimension of phenomena. The atiyoga of anuyoga is the nondual pristine awareness of total presence.[47]

The mahayoga of atiyoga is the primordial presence of the mandala of deities. The anuyoga of atiyoga is the identity of the mandala of deities and one's mind. The atiyoga of atiyoga is the essence of mind which cannot be defined in any way, its nature being spontaneously perfect.
The Key to the Transmitted Teachings of Secret Mantra states:[48]
The entirety of the secret mantra system is divided into three: tantras, elucidations, and esoteric instructions. Each of these has three divisions, the tantras of the tantras, the elucidations of the tantras, the esoteric instructions of the tantras, and so forth, for a total of nine.

The tantric scriptures that express [the meaning of] the three yogas are said to be limitless. The great perfection system[1] alone, for example, comprises six million, four hundred thousand [four-line stanzas] of tantra. Of these tantras which are as vast as the sky, those that were brought to the Land of Snow and became renowned are as follows:
The principal tantras of mahayoga are known as the eighteen principal tantras, comprising the five major root or fundamental tantras (of awakened body, speech, mind, qualities, and activities); the five tantras of expression, which expound the sadhana practice; the five tantras that concern the practice of conduct; the two that are like continuation tantras, which serve as supplements for what is incomplete; and the one major tantra, which is like a condensation of all the others.[2] This last refers to the tantra of the Net of Magical Manifestation of Vajrasattva, [also known as] the Glorious Secret Essence, Supreme King of Tantras that Ascertains Reality. The cycle of the Net of Magical Manifestation itself includes the eight major texts of the Magical Manifestation[3] and the four major explanatory tantras.[4] All these are subsumed under the three categories of father tantras (Guhyasamaja, etc.); mother tantras (Buddhasamayoga, etc.); and nondual tantras (Net of Magical Manifestation, Guhyagarbha, etc.).

In particular, there are what are known as the seventeen unsurpassable tantras[10] of the exceptionally profound and most secret [cycle], such as the Tantra of the Great Naturally Present Perfection, as well as many essential and quintessential tantras.

These belong to the rediscovered treasures.[13] There are also special tantras: To use the Manjushri tantra alone as an example, in India there were 16,[000] teachings on Manjushri. Of these, the sixty-five tantras of pristine awareness and activation are known to have been translated into Tibetan. In addition, the various [special tantras] that originated from treasures are extremely numerous even today.

By ascertaining simply [the meaning of ] the title “Net of Magical Manifestation of Vajrasattva, the Secret Essence That Ascertains Reality” [explained] in accordance with the tantras, elucidations, and esoteric instructions,[15] the secret of what is contained in the unsurpassable tantra is understood. There have developed a few methods of commentary on this “king of all tantras,” epitomized in two styles of exposition: commentary according to the esoteric instructions of atiyoga; and commentary according to the generation phase of mahayoga. The former represents the perspectives of the master NyiSengé and the omniscient Longchen Rabjampa; the latter, of Lilavajra, Buddhaguhya, and other masters,[16] and, for the most part, the holders of the Zur tradition of transmitted teachings.[17]

Widely known at the present time is the discourse style of the mahayoga system according to which the subject to be expounded is the King of Tantras, the Secret Essence, exalted by virtue of its eight great qualities. The means of exposition incorporates the four [explanatory tantras]—the Explanatory Tantra of the Oceanic Magical Manifestation; the All-Surpassing Tantra; the Essence of Pristine Awareness; and the Indestructible Mirror—and the three ideal cognitions.[18] As to how expositions are given, the earlier masters used three methods: [The first,] known as teaching “by grasping the top as one would an arrow,” explains the tantra's title wherein the ground, path, and result are contained. [The second,] known as teaching “by grasping the neck as one would a spear,” is as stated in the fifth chapter [of the Secret Essence]:[19]
The retention of the characteristics of knowledge and application Constitutes the cause and condition that bring to maturation the result.
Whoever is possessed of their power and potency becomes renowned Throughout the realm of the victorious awareness-holders.
This method of exposition incorporates three characteristics: one, the characteristic of knowledge, the view (the primary cause for enlightenment); two, the characteristic of application, contemplation (the condition); and three, the characteristic of the result brought about by the path, the four kinds of awareness-holder.
[The third,] known as teaching “by grasping the handle as one would a sword,” is an exposition that contains the four manifestations [presented] in the two verses of the last chapter [of the Secret Essence]: the ground, the natural manifestation; wrong notions, the manifestation of deception; students to be guided, the manifestation of the path; and the result, the manifestation of the joyful ones.
In the Zurpa tradition of transmitted teachings, the style of exposition comprises five topics: the way of being of phenomena, their nature; the way deceptive appearances arise from not realizing that nature; the way an omniscient one knows; the way compassion develops from love; and the way to accomplish the welfare of beings.

The style of exposition used at the present time is the one set forth in Vimalamitra's Fundamental Text:[20]
To the most adept, the title is taught; to the average, an analysis [of the text]; And to the least adept, the meaning of the words is taught.
Accordingly, there are three methods: to a person of superior faculties, an exposition on the basis of the title is given; to one of average faculties, an analysis of the general content of the tantra is presented; and to the least adept, a commentary providing the word-by-word meaning is given.
The first consists in an exposition of three [meanings of the] title in accordance with the tantras, elucidations, and esoteric instructions, combined with an exposition on the path of method of the upper door and the path of method of the secret lower door.
The second consists in both analysis of the sets of contents and analysis of the sets of words [of the tantra]. The former comprises five points: origin (the source of the tantra); secondary conditions (scene of the promulgation of the tantra); result (the meaning of the tantra to be fully understood); purpose served by the tantra and the way it is connected to its purpose; and the teachings to the audience and entrustment of the tantra.
The third consists in an exposition that sets forth the essence, semantic meanings of the words, and differentiations [between terms].
Those three methods lead to direct ascertainment of the tantra by relying principally on wisdom derived from study and reflection.

The ten topics of the tantras are these: the view (essential reality); conduct (transcendence); mandala (the manifestation); initiation (the sequential process of conferral); pledges (what are not to be transgressed); activations (expressive energy); sadhana (what is to be practiced); contemplation (stillness); offerings (to fulfill the goal); mantras to be recited and mudras to be executed. Those ten serve as instrumental conditions for the path of the practitioner. All of the most important contents of the tantric scriptures are evidently categorized and expounded as the “ten topics of the tantras” owing to their association with the practice of actualization [of the deity]. In short, the ten represent sequential instructions for training in the practice of actualization [of the deity] by relying principally on wisdom derived from meditation.

Tantras in the sadhana [tradition] are taught by means of twenty methods of exposition. The Gathering of the Joyful Ones Tantra General Guidelines states:
Ascertainment by means of five general summaries,
Five tantric guidelines, five combined elucidations,
And five systems of unification of the sadhana:
These are the twenty instructions in exposition methods.
Accordingly, the five general summaries penetrate the general meaning of the tantra. The five tantric guidelines provide an expanded commentary on that meaning. The five combined elucidations set forth general combinations of fundamental teachings. The five systems of unification integrate the contents with the student's mind. By means of these, understanding [of the tantras of the sadhana tradition] is gained.
The first five, the general summaries, serve as keys to the treasury of the secret mantra transmitted teachings. They combine the essential outlined teachings of the five elucidations of mantra and elucidations of sadhana and ascertain the teacher, the teaching, and the meanings of the words that convey the essential definitive meaning.
The second five, the tantric guidelines, provide explanatory statements on the table of contents [of the tantra]; set forth additional words and syllables through connections; present the abbreviated meaning through instructions; organize miscellaneous topics by connecting their contexts; and teach the practice through esoteric instructions.
The third five, the combined elucidations, present the merging of tantra with elucidation; the merging of elucidation with sadhana; the merging of sadhana with activities; the merging of activities with practical application; and the merging of practical application with experience.
The fourth five, the systems of unification, comprise the unification of the root [tantra] and the sadhana; unification of sadhana and activities; unification of activities and essential meditation instructions; unification of essential meditation instructions and contemplation; and unification of contemplation and esoteric instructions.

The Heruka Galpo Tantra sets forth the scriptural elucidations of anuyoga [tantras]:
Enlightenment in phenomenal existence is the elucidation of the view. Clarity in the seal of the deity's body is the elucidation of the generation phase. Perseverance in recitation and familiarization is the elucidation of mantra. The ultimate dimension of reality enjoyed as consort is the elucidation of union. Elimination of [beings complete in] ten areas[21] is the elucidation of release. The foods of the circle of the [tantric feast] gathering is the elucidation of offering. Receiving initiation and gaining powers is the elucidation of great attainment.
Anuyoga elucidations are to be understood in terms of those seven.

The great perfection atiyoga tantras are expounded using six general meanings: the five teachings on the path for which there are examples, plus one teaching on the result, which is beyond examples.
These are the five teachings that use examples: teaching on the pristine awareness of the ground, using the example of pure space; teaching on the view of the authentic condition, using the example of the [baby] garuda bird which has fully developed wings [when hatched]; teaching on meditative equipoise, using the example of the ocean to which all waters have flowed and merged; teaching on overcoming the analytical approach, using the example of the lion's roar; and teaching on the perfect result, using the example of the wish-granting tree.
This is the one teaching on the result, for which there is no example: the ultimate authentic condition, spontaneous perfection which need not be sought, is the original buddha, Samantabhadra, the supreme of the reality dimension of awakening, the great forefather of cyclic life and perfect peace. This nature cannot be realized through sophistic reasoning or conventional examples or words, but is directly pointed out as one's natural condition through the symbols of the introduction.[22]
