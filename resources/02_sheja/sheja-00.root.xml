The Encompassment of All Knowledge: A treasury of precious teachings compiled from all the approaches of the systems for spiritual development, a treatise that effectively transmits the three trainings

Namaḥ śrīmāṃ-sad-guru-pādāya
[Embodiment] of complete purity and ethics, you stand firm like the golden foundation.
Your beauty reflects your countless contemplations, like the distinct features of the mountains and continents.
Like the sun and moon, your brilliant wisdom illuminates all phenomena.
Supreme sage and achiever of all goals, I revere you.
With the heart of a great hero who protects beings for as long as they exist,
You suffused the universe with your excellent conduct.
Though father to the victorious ones, you manifest as the victorious ones' son.
Lion of Speech, grant me flawless intelligence.
You nurture the seed — the potential or nature of beings — by imparting instructions that mature and liberate them.
You cause others to purify incidental defilements through the twofold path,
And bestow the fruition, the four dimensions of awakening distinguished by great bliss.
To you, my mentor, and to the masters of the lineages, I bow.
Although I lack the intellectual capacity to compile knowledge correctly,
I shall compose a short, clear, comprehensive work
In order to ensure that those with insufficient knowledge or interest to understand the texts
Will not lose their opportunity on this isle of treasures.

This treatise [The Infinite Ocean of Knowledge] as a whole has [ten] divisions, equal in number to the ten perfections:
The realms that appear during the age of illumination;
Buddha, the Teacher; the doctrine, both scriptural and experiential;
Its continuation and spread in the Land of Jambu;
Maintaining ethical conduct; learning; reflection; meditation;
Through successively engaging in these, progression through the paths; and realization of the ultimate result.

There are general and specific causes and conditions that initiate [the creation of realms]:
For as long as infinite space and sentient beings exist,
The compassion of the victorious ones and the actions of sentient beings continue without end.
Those to be guided and enlightened guides Manifest through inconceivable interconnections.
When the characters and dispositions of those to be guided are activated,
[The compassion of] the guides [arises], and the configurations of the realms and the dimensions of awakening appear;
The miraculous methods of guiding others manifest beyond all bounds.
The sphere of reality never changes into something else;
Yet blessings, vows, actions, and natural laws Cause oceans of realms to appear.
The realm Unsurpassed is free from incidental defilement
And transcends the experience of the three realms: it is indivisible pristine wisdom.
In this self-manifesting, spontaneously appearing [realm,] Richly Adorned,
Dwells Illuminator, Great Glacial Lake of Wisdom;
A billion realms in his every pore.
Their locations, shapes, sizes, durations, and arrangements are inconceivable.

Within the central minute particle in the palm of his hand lies the Oceanic World-System
That itself contains many world-systems, in the center of which
Lies the realm called Flower-Filled World.
Furthermore, [between the wind] and Unsurpassed lie one billion four-continent world-systems,
A great third-order thousand [world-system].
Multiplying that by factors of one billion [Yields] Infinite Links, Continuums, Oceans,
And Flower-Filled World.
Each rests on an ocean and [is encircled by] an outer rim. This is the sphere of influence of one supreme manifest dimension of awakening.
Inside the great outer rim, in a sea of scented water,
Four jewelled lotuses support A tiered arrangement of twenty-five world-systems;
The thirteenth is known as Endurance. This third-order thousand world-system
Is completely encircled by realms — Covered, Surpassing, Stainless, Variously Emerged, etc. —
Equal in number to the particles of this thirteenth world-system.
[Endurance] is spherical, has a four-vajra demarcation,
And rests on a multicolored configuration of wind and a network of lotuses.
Illuminator, the teacher in this [world-system],
Appears throughout the Unsurpassed realms of the pure domains.
This four-continent [world-system] called Destructible
Is surrounded by ten other four-continent [world-systems].
It is taught that these [world-systems] are formed and destroyed together;
This is the experiential domain solely of the lords of the tenth stage of awakening.

In our own world-system, four [ages] occur: formation, abiding, destruction, and vacuity.
Of the two, environment and inhabitants, [a description of] the environmental world [is presented first]:
After the age of vacuity had elapsed at the end of the previous age,
Winds arose from the ten directions, creating a configuration in the shape of a cross;
Rain fell from a cloud, and amidst a mass of water,
A thousand lotuses were seen; thus the Fortunate Age was proclaimed.
The churning of water by wind produced a golden disc,
Upon which rain fell; [this became] the great ocean.
The churning by wind developed the [ocean's] elements — superior, medium, and base;
These elements formed Mount Meru, the seven mountain ranges, the four continents and the outer rim.
The mountains and continents all extend eighty thousand [leagues] down into the ocean.
Mount Meru rises eighty thousand [leagues] above the ocean.
The four sides of Mount Meru are composed of crystal, blue beryl, ruby, and gold.
The sky [on each side] reflects these colors.
From sea level to half its height are four terraces.
Beyond it are seven golden mountain ranges, Yoke and the others.
The spaces between are filled with seas of enjoyment, which have eight qualities.
The four continents and the eight islands
Are semi-circular, trapezoidal, round, and square.
There are numerous unspecified little islands.
The outer rim consists of a mountain range composed of iron;
A salt-water ocean fills the area as far as this range.

North from the center of the Exalted Land, beyond nine black mountains,
Stand the Snowy Mountains, and north of these the Fragrant [Mountains].
Between these two mountain ranges lies Cool Lake; from its four sides
Four cascades flow in four directions toward the ocean.
A jambu tree adorns the lake's shore,
And so this continent is known as the land beautified by the jambu tree.
The names of Majestic Body and the others indicate their distinguishing features.
Tail-Fan Island is inhabited by cannibal demons, and the others, by humans.
The hells and the world of the starving spirits are located below the earth.
Animals, the inhabitants of the depths, dwell in the great ocean.
Demi-gods [live] in the crevices of Mount Meru from the water's edge down.
The Four Groups of the Great Kings reside mainly on the terraces of Mount Meru.
Beings may also dwell in various unspecified secondary abodes.
Above Mount Meru is the heaven of the Thirty-three
In which is found the Victorious Residence, the city called Lovely,
Parks, playing fields, the All-gathering tree, the fine stone slab,
The Assembly Hall of the Excellent Law, as well as the dwelling of the yakṣas.
Above, Conflict Free, Joyful, Enjoying Creations, and [Mastery Over] Others' [Creations]
Rest on riches like cloud formations in the sky.
There are sixteen heavens in the form realm, beginning with Group of the Pure;
Above them all is Lesser Unsurpassed.
The lord bodhisattvas reside above that, according to the Five Treatises on the Stages.
[The heavens] double in size and grow increasingly magnificent.
One third-order thousand world-system is fathomed by the vision of the proclaimers and solitary sages,
Who assert that it is composed of indivisible particles of matter.
The nature of each being is unobscured and undetermined.
The four absorptions of the formless realm and the other realms arise sequentially; [the beings within them]
Diffuse from higher to lower, down to the hells.

Moreover, the four levels of absorption of the formless realm
Are only distinctions in contemplation; they have no form or location.
The form realm: In the fourth level of meditative concentration, [there are] five pure domains and three heavens of ordinary beings.
Three [heavens] are located within each of the lower three levels of meditative concentration.
The desire realm comprises thirty-six types of beings:
Six groups of gods, [humans of the] four continents,
[Inhabitants of the] eight islands, animals and starving spirits,
[Beings in the] eight hot hells, and the eight cold hells.
The twenty existences, ten happy and ten miserable,
May also be classified as twenty-eight.
Within the happy existences — the form realm and the rest —
Lifespans and possessions decrease the lower the level.
In the miserable existences, suffering increases the lower the level.
The four [levels] of absorption, the four levels of meditative concentration, and the desire realm
Comprise nine levels. In terms of type, there are six [classes of] beings.
A classification of five — human, divine, and three miserable existences —
May be made in terms of paths and courses.
All these beings may be categorized according to the four modes of birth,
Or into pure, corrupt, and indeterminate groups.
During the time of abiding, most beings, except for animals,
Experience consequences that are predetermined.
In our world, humans have a wide variety of lifespans, wealth, and physical size.
Lifespan decreases from incalculable to ten,
And then increases to eighty thousand, and so on.
During a decline, a rise, and eighteen intermediate cycles,
There are fluctuations. The three continents are places where [consequences] are experienced;
Jambu Land, the most distinguished, is the place of action.
Beings in this world came down from the heaven of Clear Light.
The nourishment derived from meditative concentration and other [pristine] qualities gradually deteriorated due to craving.
The sun and moon provided light, and King Honored by Multitudes appeared.
Then, such distinctions as the four eras and four classes arose.

Wheel-monarchs, who [possess wheels of] gold, silver, copper, and iron,
Appear in this world only when the lifespan is no less than eighty thousand years.
Some say that they reign totally over the third-order thousand world-system.
There are many variations in food, hunger and thirst, color of clothing, night and day, etc.
Beings in lower [realm] do not see those in the higher.
At the time of destruction, the miserable realms, beginning with the hell realms, empty.
Gods and humans attain meditative concentration and are born in the form realm.
As the realms empty of inhabitants, the [beings of] the lower realms move higher.
The heavens of the first meditative concentration and below are destroyed by fire.
Space alone remains, a vacuity containing nothing at all.
Again formation occurs, and again abiding, and finally destruction by fire.
After seven such [sequences], a deluge at the end of the eighth
Destroys the second meditative concentration and below.
Seven destructions by fire alternating with one by water occur seven times,
Ending with another seven by fire.
Finally, intense wind destroys the third meditative concentration and below.
Because those three contemplations have imperfections [they are destroyed];
The fourth, being free of imperfection, is not destroyed by the elements.
Altogether, sixty-four great cycles of destruction occur.
Each of the ages of formation, abiding, destruction, and vacuity
Lasts for twenty intermediate ages; together, these [four] constitute one cosmic age.
Such statements as that in a single age seven fires,
One flood, and one wind arise, destroying the third level of meditative concentration and below,
Reflect different points of view of different systems.
The pure realms and the Seat of Enlightenment, etc., are not destroyed,
Since they are not the result of the origin [of suffering].

The King of Tantras of the Primordial Buddha
Refutes erroneous systems and integrates the outer, inner,
And alternative [levels]. In the center of space rest spherical foundations
Of wind, fire, water, and earth, [proportional in size to the measure between] the soles of the feet and the waist.
Mount Meru, its neck, face, and crowning protuberance
[Are proportional to the measure between] the waist and the crown of the head.
The center is green; the east, blue; the north, white; the south, red;
And the west, yellow. Each part is composed of a precious substance.
From the [edge of the] vast upper surface hang five indestructible enclosures
In a concentric arrangement; the outer ones are progressively longer.
At the base is a ledge which forms an indestructible perimeter.
Between the six continents — Moon, White, Most Excellent,
Kuśa Grass, Centaur, and Crane —
Are [six] oceans: Honey, Butter, Yogurt, Milk, Water, and Beer,
Encircled by the mountains Blue Radiance, Mandara Blossom,
Night, Jewel Radiance, Vessel, and Cool.
These are lands of experience. The seventh continent,
The Greater Land of Jambu, said to be the land of evolutionary action,
Is located between Cool Mountain Range and the edge of the salt water ocean.
The seventh mountain range forms the Impenetrable Perimeter,
Surrounded by the fire and wind arising from the respective spheres.
Beyond this is vacuity, devoid of any attributes.
The twelve lands of evolutionary action—the great continents of wind, fire, water, and earth —
Are situated in the center [of each] of the four directions.
They are semi-circular, triangular, round, and square in shape
And are flanked by smaller continents. All are positioned like lotus petals.
The Exalted Land is situated in the south of the Small Land of Jambu.
Situated to the north are, successively, Tibet, Khotan,
China, Śambhala, and the Great Snow Range.
Thirty-one existences — eleven desire, sixteen form, four [formless] —
Live within these [environments].
The celestial sphere pervades space between Mount Meru and the mountain of fire.
It is a belt of wind, within which the twelve houses
And the twenty-eight constellations formed first.
[The houses] are situated in a clockwise arrangement. Planets such as the sun and moon rise above them.
[Eight] move counter-clockwise; Eclipser [moves] clockwise.

A solar day is measured in terms of six breaths and sixty minor clepsydra measures constituting one major clepsydra measure of time.
Lunar, solar, and house days are determined
In relation to the movement of the moon, sun, and constellations.
The [three types of] days are equivalent to one fifteenth of a phase of the moon, one revolution of the sun around the continents,
And a thirtieth of the time [required for the sun] to move through a house.
Each is longer than the preceding one. Based on lunar months and house years,
The four seasons occur in natural sequence on earth.
Time-conjunctions affect the quality of life.
Explanations of the four eras of the doctrine
Of the wheel-holders, of the world-system, and of entering vacuity supplement the above.
The Victorious One did not base his teachings on the belief that a single system is the only valid one,
[But taught] in response to the interests and abilities of those he guided.
There are a variety of units for measuring space and time:
Eight minute particles equals one fine particle;
A hair-tip, ketsé seed, louse, barley seed, and fingerwidth [are determined] in a similar manner.
Twenty-four [finger-widths equals one] cubit; four cubits equals one bow-length;
Two thousand [bow-lengths equals one] ear-shot; four of those equals a league.
The phenomenology system presents units of form and time, and components of words.
Seven minute particles [equals] one fine particle;
Iron, water, rabbit, sheep, ox, and sun-ray particles
Louse egg, louse, barley seed, and finger-width are similarly determined.
Twenty-four finger-widths [equals] a cubit; four cubits, a bow-length;
Five hundred [bow-lengths], one ear-shot,
Or the measure to solitude; eight of those, a league.
The third-order thousand [world-system] is described and measured with these units.
One sixty-fourth of a finger-snap
Is the smallest unit of time. One hundred and twenty [of these units]
Equals an instant. Sixty instants [equals] one moment.
Thirty [moments equals] a period; thirty periods, a solar day;
Thirty solar days, a month; and twelve months, a year.
Based on these units, the measurable and the immeasurable are calculated.
Individual letters are the components of words.
[Groups of words] form sentences.
If examined, [words] do not capture [the essence, but are] deceptive.

What causes create the world?
The erroneous theories of the non-Buddhists claim that [the world]
Was created by Īśvara or the sage, or that it arose from the self or naturally.
It is taught in the scriptures that worlds and beings
Are created by various actions influenced by subtle and proliferating [emotions].
The factor ensuring actions' results is said to be acquired or inevitable,
The stream of mental consciousness, the fundamental consciousness,
The mere individual, clear light, and so forth.
The Analysts and Traditionists state that the environment is created from the wind at the peak
[of existence] which remains from the time of destruction,
Or from five types of seeds carried from other worlds.
The stream [of phenomena] is undispersed and coheres through [the effect] of concordant actions.
Lasting form and time are deceptive impressions within naive minds;
It is taught that the exalted ones comprehend the cessation of particles and moments.
Most agree that in the formation [of the world] the mind is the agent, subtle particles and the moving and stationary winds are the objects acted upon,
And the [winds' motions] are the means of creation.
Six causes and four conditions produce conditioned phenomena;
Five results are produced by these [causes].
The Individualists' system of phenomenology follows these excellent explanations.

The productive cause of [a particular phenomenon] is that which is other than the conditioned phenomenon.
Coemergent causes are [conditioned phenomena] that are causes and results of one another.
Causes of the same outcome are preceding phenomena creating later similar phenomena.
Concomitant causes are mind and mental events that share five aspects.
Omnipresent causes are defiled phenomena.
Developing causes are non-virtue and contaminated virtue.
Developed results arise after their causes, pertain to a continuum,
And are unobscured and neutral.
Results concordant with the causes are of a type similar to same outcome and omnipresent [causes].
Freedom results are cessations attained through appreciative discernment.
Caused results are attainments through the power of the causes.
Owned results [which are exclusively] conditioned phenomena arise from non-hindering phenomena.
It is asserted that [results] are all conditioned phenomena, as well as the attainment of freedom,
And that the two unconditioned phenomena lack causes and results.
Developed [results] arise [from] the last [cause]; owned results from the first.
Results concordant with the cause [from] the third and fifth; caused [results] from the second and fourth.

Except for the productive cause, the five [other] causes are causal conditions.
Mind and mental factors producing results that arise immediately are immediate [conditions].
Phenomena suitable to be objects of the six consciousnesses are objective conditions.
Phenomena that do not obstruct arising are dominant conditions.
The arising, functioning, etc., [of conditions] can be learned from [Vasubandhu's] treatise.
Productive causes which produce [a result]; assisting, co-emergent [causes];
Augmenting or same outcome [causes]; concomitant causes, sharing four factors;
Defiled omnipresent causes; developing causes of the body:
All may be categorized as productive causes,
Which the Synthesis of Phenomenology sets forth as twenty classes.
Causal conditions are the five causes and the fundamental consciousness.
The objective condition is the perceived object. The dominant condition is the support.
The immediate condition is asserted in the third way.
When four conditions are present, consciousness generates consciousness;
When there are two or three, consciousness produces coarse objects.
Freedom results are cessations without causes.
Owned results pertain to external phenomena.
Developed results pertain to the continuums of beings.
Caused results [arise from] creating causes; results concordant with causes [arise] from same outcome [causes].

Although cyclic life and actions do not exist ultimately,
Interdependent origination occurs superficially due to causes and conditions.
Thus, the wheel of twelve links continually turns.
Adherence to a self is the root of cyclic life.
Emotions produce actions and suffering.
These lead to [the cycle of suffering] which manifests like [dreams during] sleep.
The beginningless nature of mind is empty, clear, [and] unobstructed,
But its nature is not recognized.
[The fundamental consciousness], stirred by mental creations, produces dualistic appearances
[and] the consciousnesses.
Feeling develops from acceptance and rejection; discernment, from objectification-habit.
[Discernment leads to] mental formations which are mental factors; habitual adherence creates form.
With attachment and grasping as a link, the wheel of existence turns.
In summation, three instincts imprinted on the fundamental consciousness
Cause three deceptive appearances: object, subject, and body.
The environmental world, the five objects such as form,
The eight consciousnesses, and virtuous and negative actions [develop from objective instincts].
[Adherence to] the forms of the six [types of] beings, and the object, agent, and action
Generate object and subject, which in turn produce emotions.
[Emotions] create cyclic life without beginning or end.
When the course of interdependent origination is reversed or its causes and conditions collapse from the inner core,
Deceptive [appearances] are exhausted and supreme liberation is attained.

The superior system of the Supreme Yoga is the culmination of all spiritual ways.
Six [claims] concerning the fundamental nature of the original ground are mistaken.
The correct [view is that the ground is] primordial purity, the common basis of both deception and freedom.
Two or three pristine wisdoms are inherent to the character [of the ground of being].
The spontaneity of the ground manifests as eight gates.
Three causes and four conditions [produce deception]: when the six cognitions arise,
The nature of the ground's manifestations is not realized; factors in groups of five [arise]
Based on subject and object. Through the course of the twelve links of interdependent origination, [the wheel] turns.
Object, body, and mind arise from the three bases of deception.
Mental, radiant, and material bodies develop in the three realms.
Womb-birth: from the penetrating, scattering, and equalizing [properties of the] elements,
The channels, syllables, energy-winds, and vital essences [form], and both the superficial and ultimate elements develop.
Through dependence on the former, the aggregates and so forth develop.
The latter serve as the cause of the four lamps which reveal the four visions.
Twenty-five elements generate the effulgence and creativity of pristine wisdom.
Buddha-nature pervades all sentient beings.
Its mode of appearance and mode of manifestation are taught in six sets of five.
Intrinsic awareness is present in the center of the heart, based on the three palaces.
The excellent vital essences abide in the four entrances of clear light.
The two eyes are the doors for the manifestation of external clarity;
[Depending on] objects and fulfilling crucial means, deception is ceased,
And one effortlessly attains the original place of freedom.

Among infinite numbers of victors, guides of this world,
In the midst of this Fortunate Age’s thousand buddhas,
One was praised as like a white lotus: the incomparable King of the Shakyas.
Initially, he developed the aspiration to awaken; subsequently, he performed bodhisattvas’ conduct.
Finally, [he demonstrated] manifest enlightenment and aided beings.
According to the lesser way, King Luminous first developed the supreme aspiration to awaken for three reasons.
Later, [our teacher] developed the mind of awakening upon seeing the great buddhas Shakyamuni and
God of the Pure.
[This marked] the beginning of the first incalculable age of his spiritual path.
The great way’s tradition includes many accounts,
Such as that of Brahmin Ocean Particles:
His son, the Victor Jewel Heart
Caused three trillion living beings to grasp the mind of awakening.
Finally, [the brahmin] made five hundred prayers of aspiration to care for the age of conflict, and he received a prophecy [of his enlightenment].
Other accounts include that [the future Buddha] engendered the mind of awakening
As a strong man in Fire Chariot Hell or in the presence of Buddha
Sight of the Meaningful.
The materialist school asserts that he reached perfection over three incalculable [ages].
Concerning these ages, the collection on discipline and The
Treasury of Observed Phenomena present two different delineations.
The elders’ order asserts that for seven incalculable ages, the future
Buddha fostered the mind of aspiration,
Then engaged in [a bodhisattva’s] conduct for nine incalculable ages.
For four ages he was diligent in physical, verbal, and mental conduct.
For one hundred thousand ages, he completed minor acts, then attained enlightenment.
The majority order asserts that it is necessary
To gather accumulations for a period of ten to thirty incalculable [ages].

The great way presents many systems of calculation of time —
Three, thirty-three, or many [ages of traveling the spiritual path];
And intents — [the ages are said to begin with] the development of the aspiration to attain awakening,
The great [stage of the] path of accumulation, or awakening’s first stage, etc.
These teachings’ purposes are to show difficulty, to avert indolence,
And to show time as inconceivable.
The most prevalent [view is that the period] from the path of accumulation to awakening’s first stage required one incalculable age.
During the second incalculable age, he traversed six stages;
During the third incalculable age, he traversed from Unwavering to the eleventh.
Collectively, these represent the stages of ordinary individuals and [exalted beings’] path of training; he thereby completed the twofold accumulation.
Some explain that an individual of lesser acumen imbued with faith treads the path for sixteen [incalculable ages];
One of average [acumen endowed with] diligence, for eight incalculable ages plus a hundred thousand [ages];
One of a high degree of acumen having sublime insight, for four incalculable ages.
Our teacher himself belongs to this last group;
Moreover, due to his intense diligence, he was swifter.
[The Bodhisattva] traversed the path by maturing beings, purifying realms, and [completing] the six transcendent perfections.
Alternatively, he engaged in four forms of conduct—to foster interest in those devoted to the supreme way,
To the lesser way, or to both; and the conduct of guiding [beings].
He reached the end of the path through the eighty inexhaustible qualities and other attributes.
The three points at which bodhisattvas no longer regress —
[From] the first instance of the supreme mind of awakening, at awakening’s first stage, or at the eighth stage —
Indicate distinctions of capability; the sublime Sage belongs to the first.

On the subject of how the Joyful Buddha attained enlightenment, three traditions exist:
Pious attendants believe that at the end of three incalculable ages,
[The Buddha] completed the karmic causes of the marks and signs of physical perfection during one hundred ages,
Was born in Joyful, and demonstrated the twelve deeds.
Until he sat at Vajra Seat, his physical support was at the highest [stage of the] path of accumulation
With the limitations of an ordinary being.
At that very time and place, he reached the end of the four paths;
With knowledge of extinguishing and non-arising, he attained enlightenment.
Some great way [perspectives] are in general agreement [with the pious attendant tradition].
Alternatively, it is said that countless ages ago,
He became a victor, such as Crown of the Powerful One.
[The great way’s traditions] concur that during the first [incalculable age], he traversed the paths of accumulation and preparation;
During the second, [awakening’s] first seven [stages]; during the third, the three pure stages.
In his final lifetime, he received the empowerment of great radiance in Unsurpassed Realm; a vajra-like meditative state arose within him.
He attained enlightenment as the body of perfect rapture; his emanations performed beneficial deeds.
The vajra way’s action tantras
State that he studied tantra with Buddha Showing Flowers to All.
He engaged in its conduct, then emanated from Joyful Heaven, and so on.
This accords with the general great way; conduct tantras concur with the specific details.

According to A Synthesis of the Absolute, when Siddharta sat at
Heart of Awakening,
The buddhas inspired him, and he rose from his meditative state.
He received empowerment and achieved manifest awakening.
Shakyamitra teaches that when the Bodhisattva practiced hardships,
His wisdom body went to Unsurpassed;
The victors gave him empowerment and he attained manifest enlightenment.
Anandagarbha believes that incalculable ages ago, in [the
Bodhisattva’s] final existence,
The victors gave him empowerment and he attained enlightenment.
Then he once again demonstrated taking birth in the Shakya clan.
According to the highest yoga tantras’ definitive meaning,
A bodhisattva in his final lifetime in Great Unsurpassed Realm
Practiced the exceptional profound path’s immediate cause and became Buddha Vajra Bearer.
Even when his emanation [demonstrated] enlightenment, he traveled the path by means of the immediate cause.
Buddhaguhya defined the Unsurpassed Realm in six ways:
Ultimate, symbolic, of awareness, secret, conceptual, and worldly.
Longchen Rabjam considers that the three bodies of enlightenment’s realms
Are true ultimate [Unsurpassed Realm], self-manifest Richly
Adorned [Unsurpassed Realm],
And the manifest body’s natural abode and the pure domains’
Unsurpassed Realm.
In addition, many explanations exist, based on distinctions of
Unsurpassed Realm being actual or nominal, etc.

[Various accounts relate] one hundred or other numbers of deeds enacted by the sublime manifest body.
There are countless perspectives, including that of the extraordinary [way] and conclusions [based on inference].
However, an account of twelve deeds is prevalent.
Sacred White Crown taught the hundred approaches to the teachings in Joyful Heaven.
Seeing the five visions, he departed.
In a central country, when the life span [of humans] in the Land of
Jambu was one hundred years,
He entered Mahamayadévi’s womb. His father was of the royal caste.
Accompanied by ten million marvelous signs,
Siddharta was born in Lumbini Grove.
He excelled in many aspects of culture and athletics:
Composition, mathematics, art, archery, tests of strength, analysis, and rhetoric.
His enjoyment with Gopa, Yasodhara, and other women endowed with all qualities
Brought his circle of sixty thousand queens to spiritual maturity.
Seeing such things as aging, sickness, death, and a pure mendicant,
He felt renunciation, renounced home life, and accepted saffron [robes].

He actualized the meditative absorption of the pinnacle of existence.
On a river bank, he sat in the same cross-legged posture for six years and engaged in austerities.
When he drank milk soup, the marks and signs of physical perfection appeared and he blazed with light.
Carrying a seat of grass, he proceeded to Heart of Awakening.
With the power of loving-kindness, he subdued the utterly enraged one
And hordes of deceptive demons, along with the gods’ afflictive emotions.
He successively saw [levels of] concentration, the four truths, and the links of interdependent causation.
With a vajra-like meditative state, he gained manifest, complete awakening.
At the request of Brahma and others, he taught in known and unknown places
Expedient and definitive meanings in three successive turnings of the wheel of Dharma.
He demonstrated unlimited transcendence of sorrow.
His relics spread throughout the world.
According to the pious attendant system, the miracles occurred on the same day;
According to the great way system, in fifteen days.
This illustrates dissimilarities in explanations of cycles of teaching, length of life, etc.
There is also a major difference in scope.
However, the pious attendant system presents the account as witnessed in common by disciples, and it has become prevalent.
Therefore, when recounting the Buddha’s deeds, [the two systems] must be differentiated and unmixed.
Here, I have recounted the deeds according to a scripture by the sovereign bodhisattva of awakening’s tenth stage.

According to the highest way, clear light vajra pinnacle,
Prior to any division between the wheel of life and transcendent states,
There existed self-arisen wisdom, buddha-nature, the basis of being.
At the moment the basis of being dawned as manifest appearances,
[Ever Excellent] recognized them as his own and gained natural liberation on the basis of being.
Endowed with threefold greatness, master of all,
Buddha Ever Excellent abides in the youthful vase body’s pure realm —
Inwardly luminous subtle wisdom, indwelling but not obscured.
His blessing [created] self-manifest wisdom’s pure realm, Richly Adorned,
Where the self-manifest body of perfect rapture in the five families’ assemblies appears
Endowed with the five certainties.
Loving compassion for deluded sentient beings arose:
They arrayed in the buddhas’ hand implements’ locations and within each of their pores
Immeasurable pure realms, as numerous as the four elements’ atoms,
Filling the basic space of phenomena with enlightenment’s pure realms and bodies.

In the context of the body of ultimate enlightenment, the realm is called Luminous Vajra Essence;
In the context of the self-manifest body of perfect rapture, Sound of Brahma’s Drum;
In the context of the manifest body, Great Brahma Eon.
On the space of a hair’s breadth are oceans of past, present, and future buddhas
In numbers equal to [the realms’ atoms], etc.
The extent of Ever Excellent’s deeds is gathered in this.
Among Ever Excellent’s deeds, he sent a skillful emanation to guide this realm:
Innumerable [eons] ago, he offered a golden vajra to Buddha Exquisite Flower
And developed the intention to attain supreme awakening.
In a series of incarnations he received the victors’ teachings. At the end of settling in evenness,
He attained enlightenment at the summit of Mount Perfectly Configured Profusion of Jewels
And dwelt in the realization of the body of ultimate enlightenment.
[Buddha] Vajra Bearer arose as the appearing aspect of the body of perfect rapture’s array of clouds.
Having mastery of the three mysteries’ wheel
Of endless ornaments’ thirty-six deeds,
He appears in the form of lord of the wheel of the hundred wisdom families.
The unfolding of outwardly appearing luminosity produces the semi-apparent supreme body of perfect rapture.
In the residences of Buddha Illuminator Great Glacial Lake
Are found realms and the five wisdom families’ victors, endowed with the five certainties:
The music of their vajra miraculous manifestations unfolds to infinity.
The teacher, endowed with seven special attributes and decorations of outer, inner, and secret marks and signs,
Emanates a pure sacred circle.
That very [teacher], like an image transferred into crystal,
Appears to tenth-stage [bodhisattvas] as the realms of enlightenment’s natural manifestation
In fivefold bodies, wisdoms, teachings, etc.

Within the continual [natural manifestation], manifestations to guide beings —
Sublime emanations and the six sages who embody awareness —
Demonstrate the four miraculous displays of training in the six kinds of beings’ abodes.
Diverse manifestations appear as varied artistic creations, incarnate beings,
Or inanimate substances—gems, trees, treasures, boats, bridges, food, or medicine.
In particular, as appearing aspects of the body of perfect rapture during this eon,
Twelve teachers have appeared in twelve places,
From Sacred Illuminator in Joyful Pinnacle
Until Shakyamuni in Jetavana Grove.
Endowed with the five magnificent qualities, these teachers epitomize the teachings’ sixty gateways.
Their deeds are enumerated in terms of ninety-six collections.
At the same time, representations of the three bodies’ doctrines appear:
A naturally produced vajra, book, and statue.
They have the enlightened activity of liberating in their own ground
Any being, along with that being’s material body, who sees, hears, or touches them.
They move to disciples’ abodes; at present they reside in this realm.
The ways in which The Discourse That Gathers Wisdom’s
Realization, Vajrasattva’s Net of Illusion Tantra, and other tantras explain these subjects are boundless;
Therefore, learn them from their individual source texts.

The foremost miracle performed by the spiritual master of gods and humans to guide his disciples
Is that of turning the wheel of Dharma:
The essence [of Dharma] is a wholly positive quality, the antidote to obscurations.
The etymology of dharma: in Sanskrit, dharma has ten meanings.
Among those meanings is the holy Dharma, comprising [the truths] of cessation and of the path.
In the classification of Dharma, there is realization, the subject; and the scriptural transmissions that express it.
The holy Dharma of realization comprises the truths of cessation and of the spiritual path:
These are the four kinds of exalted beings’ wisdom mind streams, which are free from any [attachment];
And the agent of that separation, which itself has the nature of antidotes.
The essence of scriptural transmissions is twofold:
[The Buddha’s] words well spoken in ten ways and the treatises that elucidate [the Buddha’s] intent.
The canon presents the three trainings, is expressed in flawless language,
Has three kinds of logic [as proof], and is virtuous in the beginning, middle, and end.
In terms of its dominant cause, [the canon] was spoken by the Buddha;
Blessed by his wisdom body, speech, or mind; or authorized by him.
From the perspective of the canon’s subjects, its content comprises three collections.
The collection on discipline mainly teaches training in ethical conduct; the collection of discourses, training in meditative states;
And the collection on observed phenomena, training in sublime insight.
Nine categories are found within [the three collections], such as discourses on discipline;
Thus in fact, the training is ninefold.

Otherwise, there are nine collections in the individual liberation, bodhisattva, and secret mantra [systems].
[The three collections bear their] simple names, or can be adorned with the terms “higher,” or “profound.”
They are called “discourses,” “discipline,” and “observed phenomena” for four reasons each.
The collections eliminate doubt, detrimental behavior, and erroneous views.
The collections’ framework is threefold
Because one collection presents the Dharma and its meaning, one collection presents its practice, and one [defines] terminology.
In relation to disciples’ [degree of scope], they are gathered into two: the lesser and great way’s collections.
In terms of content alone, the Victor’s canon
Is divided into twelve branches of the Buddha’s excellent speech:
Discourses, aphorisms in verse, prophetic declarations, verses,
Purposeful declarations, accounts to provide a framework, narrative stories, legends,
Accounts of former lives, extensive teachings, marvelous events, and definitions.
Classification based on degrees of acumen yields the three wheels of Dharma.
Authors must possess a degree of [qualification]—highest, medium, or minimum.
[Treatises] refer to the Victor’s doctrine
And have the qualities of refining and protecting.
Three kinds of treatise are believed to be free from six faults.
In terms of function, there are three kinds of treatise:
Treatises that encompass the vast, reveal the profound, or rectify order.
Among commentaries on the intent [of the canon’s] general or specific topics,
The three wheels’ commentaries on the view and conduct are distinct.
In terms of subject, treatises mainly present
“All that there is,” “things as they are,” or freedom and omniscience.
The works by the sovereign bodhisattvas of awakening’s tenth stage, the six ornaments, and others
Should be venerated like the Victor’s canon.
Older Tibetan treatises as well are especially exalted.

Pious attendants state that our teacher [began to] turn the wheel of Dharma
Seven weeks after he attained enlightenment.
Until he transcended sorrow, he taught only the lesser way.
Followers of the great way believe that there were three cycles [of scriptural transmission].
In essence, “the wheel of Dharma” refers to sacred teachings that cut through what is incompatible [with enlightenment].
The particularist school asserts that the path of seeing [is the wheel of Dharma];
The discourse school, the paths of seeing, meditation, and no further training, along with enumerations of the Dharma that explain [these paths].
The great way places the five paths and the scriptures within [the wheel of Dharma].
The essence of scriptural transmission is knowledge manifest in speech.
Based upon the Victor’s wisdom and beings’ pure minds,
Disciples’ understanding manifests as terms, words, and letters.
The particularist and discourse schools assert that words and terms belong to two [different] aggregates.
Concerning the etymology of the term “wheel of Dharma,” chakra, the latter part of the term Dharmachakra,
Denotes the movement of realization and the aggregate of scriptural transmission.
When scriptural transmission is classified, the first doctrine comprises the four truths;
The intermediate doctrine, absence of characteristics; the final doctrine, accurate discernment.
[The Buddha] spoke of renunciation, freedom, and irreversibility
To have beings enter peace, reach spiritual maturity, and fulfill prophecies;
And to have them turn away from what is not meritorious, from the self, and from [the basis of] all views.
The four truths were repeated three times, making twelve [parts].
To teach the absence of characteristics, the explicit teaching presented the three gateways to freedom;
The hidden meaning explained the eight manifest realizations and related topics.
The final cycle principally teaches the three characteristics [of knowable things].
All scriptural transmissions are referred to as “aggregates of Dharma,”
Of which there are eighty-four thousand.
Pious attendants determine an aggregate in three ways.
Others consider that the measure is equal to [a load] on the back of the elephant Steadfast.

Among the four classes of tantra, action tantras were spoken to Gentle Splendor and others
In the Unsurpassed Pure Land and at the summit of Supreme Mountain.
Conduct tantra was taught to buddhas accompanied by their spiritual heirs
In such locations as Buddha Illuminator’s realm, intermediate realms, and the Heaven of the Thirty-three.
The speaker appeared as a sublime body of emanation.
[According to] yoga tantra, after the teacher’s enlightenment in the Unsurpassed Pure Land,
His emanation, a lesser body of rapture,
Emanated a sacred circle at the summit of Supreme Mountain.
Moreover, he spoke [yoga tantras] in unspecified locations, including the Heaven of Mastery Over Others’ Creations.
[According to] the Matrix of Mystery tantra of highest yoga, after the teacher subdued demons,
He went to Joyful Heaven or to Heaven of Mastery Over Others’ Creations.
He emanated a sacred circle and taught the tantra to a circle of disciples that filled space.
Alangkara-kalasha and Anandagarbha affirm this.
Tibetan scholars and others state that while the teacher lived in Shravasti,
Indrabhuti supplicated him, and he went to Oddiyana.
He granted the empowerment and tantra in an emanated sacred circle.

[According to] the cycle of Slayer of the Lord of Death, when the
Buddha subdued the demons’ armies,
[Slayer of the Lord of Death] arose from [the Buddha’s] three secret vajras; he emanated a sacred circle.
Many other accounts [of this tantra’s origins] exist.
[According to] the Vajra of Delight cycle, when the Buddha defeated demons, he taught the root tantra
While inside a source of phenomena. He spoke the explanatory tantra at another time.
[According to] the Supreme Bliss tantra, victors have spoken this tantra since time immemorial.
During the era of decline by one half,
The fruition Héruka taught it again to his circle in the Land of Jambu.
During the era of conflict, when Fierce Terrifying Demon, his consort, and retinue
Controlled the sacred places, regions, and charnel grounds,
The Héruka’s emanation subdued them, arrayed a sacred circle, and spoke [the tantra].
[According to] the Wheel of Time, before transcending sorrow,
On Chaitra month’s full moon, at glorious Treasure Mound Stupa,
Our teacher emanated Lord of Speech of the Basic Space of Phenomena below;
And above, the glorious constellations’ sacred circle.
He then spoke the tantra to a fortunate circle, which included King Suchandra.
Some believe that all tantras were taught only at Treasure Mound Stupa.
Further, in different places, both relative and ultimate,
[The teacher] rose as the wisdom body of the lord of the wheel.
Within great bliss, the teacher and circle of disciples indivisible,
The nada’s melody proclaims the tantras at all times.

To dispel the gods’ scorn and to ensure the doctrine’s duration,
The year after the teacher transcended sorrow,
Five hundred arhats gathered in Nyagrodha Cave;
Three — Ananda, Upali, and the eminent Kashyapa —
Compiled the [collections] of discourses, on discipline, and on observed phenomena.
Aggregates, Interdependence, and Factors of Awakening
Were placed into the Long, Medium-Length, and Increasing-by-One Scriptures, etc.
[Collections on] discipline and observed phenomena, too, [were compiled] in the same way.
The measure of the doctrine’s duration is said to be one thousand years.
For the extraordinary great way teachings,
One million bodhisattvas gathered on Vimalasambhava Mountain in south Magadha.
Vajra Holder, Loving-Kindness, and Gentle Splendor
Compiled the [collections] of discourses, on discipline, and on observed phenomena.
Although this system proposes many measures of the doctrine’s duration,
The most prevalent states that, among ten five-hundred-year periods,
The present is the era of scriptural transmission.
Of the three parts of the spiritual practice era, Longchenpa and others consider this to be the period of training in sublime insight.
At Willow Grove in the North, where the three lords enjoy themselves,
Vajra Holder compiled action, conduct, and yoga tantras.

Highest yoga tantras were compiled by those who requested them and by those to whom they were entrusted.
Those who taught them also compiled them, etc.
Specifically, mother tantras were established
In dialogues of questions and answers among vajra dakinis.
Vajra Essence compiled The Vajra of Delight Tantra’s Two Chapters.
King Suchandra compiled The Wheel of Time Root Tantra;
Manjushrikirti encapsulated its essence in The Concise Tantra of the Wheel of Time.
All were manifestations of Lord of Secrets; thus, the compilers were the same.
The doctrine of supreme mystery long endures;
In particular, the mother tantras will not disappear.
One hundred and ten years after the teacher had departed to peace,
Seven hundred arhats, including Kirti,
Assembled in the Kusmapuri Temple
To refute ten points of inappropriate conduct.
They carried out a partial compilation
Known as “the correct declaration of the seven hundred.”
Following that, The monk Mahadéva, together with his followers,
Proclaimed five points, through which the four basic orders
And the branches of these, the eighteen orders, developed.
King Kanishka summoned five hundred arhats, including Parshva,
And four hundred venerable monks.
The [different] orders were established as the canon and the three collections were committed to writing.
Thus, the third compilation of the canon was carried out.

In the tradition of the ancient school of the early translations,
The doctrine of great mysteries has three major styles of descent.
In the self-manifest pure Unsurpassed Realm, the basic space of phenomena,
To [his retinue,] oceans of wisdom, throughout inconceivable time,
Buddha Ever Excellent naturally illuminates
The wisdom mind of uncompounded clear light.
In Richly Adorned, [wisdom’s] manifest aspect, a wisdom body with the complete marks and signs of physical perfection,
Expresses great perfection
In ceaseless wisdom speech beyond self-characterized words and terms
To self-manifest disciples within evenness, the fourth time.
As compassionate manifestations perceived by others,
Five teachers grant three profound empowerments in the five wisdom families’ palaces.
With wisdom mind, symbols, and six modes of exposition,
They teach the way of techniques to their regents.
At that time, they produce in impure realms’ perceptions
Six teachers who disseminate approaches to the teachings that support the path.
In the pure domains, before the Buddha appears [in this world],
A body with qualities similar to the body of rapture
Teaches the transcendent perfections and the three outer tantras to accomplished masters and awareness holders.
As a manifestation perceived by others, the tantras arisen from symbols and words
Were compiled by sublime Vajra Dharma, Holder of a Human Skull,
Dakini Calm Purna, and others.
The doctrine was entrusted to the lords of the three kinds of beings,
To the dakinis, and to those possessing the eyes of the Dharma.
In short, the teacher’s three-body framework is the victors’ wisdom mind transmission.
When six [conditions prevailed], the effortless way
Was given through empowerment by Vajrasattva to a god named Altruistic;
It spread in the gods’ realm.
[The god Altruistic] then rose in the human world as enlightenment’s manifestation Garab Dorjé,
Who received empowerment and the tantras’ treasury, and became the doctrine’s chief.

When [Garab Dorjé] dissolved into light, Manjushrimitra received his testament.
Likewise, all the other regents successively received [a testament].
[The lords of] the three kinds of beings, masters of knowledge, compassion, and power,
Chiefly taught the view and conduct of meditation practice:
Gods, nagas, and noxious spirits in groups of hundred thousands attained liberation.
Twenty-eight years after the Victor transcended [sorrow],
Five lineage-holding nobles at Mount Malaya’s summit
Uttered twenty-three verses of lamentation:
Lord of Secrets manifestly appeared; he recited and taught the secret tantras.
The ogre Skillful Intelligence
Recorded [the teachings] and concealed them in the sky with the energy [of perfect intent].
The transmission among awareness holders passed through symbols [occurred in this way].
At that time, seven signs appeared in King Ja’s dreams
As the manifestation of the blessings [of Lord of Secrets’ teaching].
[He found] a statue of Vajra Holder and the eighteen sections of tantra
Descended upon the roof of his palace. He gradually realized their meaning,
Then transmitted them to Kukuraja. [The transmission] continued and the teachings flourished.
At the same time, the three classes of exoteric tantra
Descended to Varanasi, Bird-Foot Mountain, and Blazing Mountain.
Anuyoga’s volumes
Descended to Singha Island’s forest.
Vajrasattva taught atiyoga at Lake Dhanakosha
To Garab Dorjé, who wrote it down.
Tantras appeared from a great variety of other sources.
These teachings are called the transmission among individual masters through hearing.
To subdue thoughts, as many approaches to ways of spiritual development as there are
Issue from natural great perfection.
The peaceful and wrathful deities taught the means of attainment;
Lord of Secrets compiled them.
He entrusted them to the dakini, who concealed them in a stupa’s vase.
When eight masters meditated for seven nights,
Dakini Sovereign of Activity entrusted each with a treasure chest.
The designated inheritor of the convergence of them all is the magnificent master.

[I will describe] how the doctrine spread in this Land of Jambu.
In the land of exalted beings, two periods of Buddhist practice occurred:
One focused on the pious attendants’ way, the other on the great way.
The Victor’s regents
Were Kashyapa, Ananda, Shanavasa, Upagupta,
Dhitika, Krishnapada, and Sudarshana;
These, plus Madhyantika, are the eight patriarchs.
It is also said that their line continued until Bhikshu Singha.
The earliest treatise, The Great Treasury of Detailed Exposition, spread.
Those who attained the four results were as numerous as dust motes.
[During] the pious attendant period, many hundred thousand monks—the four great noble masters and others —
Preserved the masters’ individual schools.
Following that, noble Avitarka and others
Received teaching from lord bodhisattvas of awakening’s tenth stage;
Many masters appeared who attained the meditative state of the stream of the teachings.
Most great way [discourses] arrived in the land of humans.
At Nalanda, Udbhatasiddhisvamin built a temple.
Nanda and others composed many treatises.
They were known as proponents of the aspects of consciousness.
The ancestor of accomplished masters, Venerable Rahulabhadra,
First elucidated the supreme vehicle’s middle way tradition.
The second buddha, exalted Nagarjuna,
Then brought the Perfection of Sublime Insight in One Hundred
Thousand Verses [to this world].
Nagarjuna’s three collections explain the intent of the teachings’ three wheels.
He defeated in debate believers in external reality, and proved the great way to be the Buddha’s word.
A succession of masters including Aryadeva preserved and transmitted the doctrine.
Exalted Asanga, who dwelled upon awakening’s third stage,
Received five doctrines directly from Maitreya
And composed five treatises on the stages of awakening and two compendiums.
Vasubandhu and others transmitted the doctrine widely.
Dignaga and Dharmakirti, masters of logic,
Illuminated the path of logic and used debate to defeat pernicious attacks.
In brief, as the Victor foretold,
The world’s six adornments, the four supreme masters,
The two marvels, and others
Preserved the doctrine in the course of unfathomable lifetimes of liberation.

After the great way spread, action and conduct tantras were practiced:
One hundred thousand awareness holders appeared who accomplished secret mantra.
Saraha brought an ocean of tantras,
Including Buddha Skull, from the region of Oddiyana.
Due to the accomplishment of King Indrabhuti and his retinue,
His land became the source of the vajra way.
The father, the exalted master, and his spiritual heirs clearly elucidated Matrix of Mystery.
Luyipa, Vajraghantapa, and Krishnacharya
Founded the tradition of Supreme Bliss.
Virupaksha, Saroruha, and Lalitavajra
Obtained Red Slayer of the Lord of Death, Vajra of Delight, The
Seven Segments, and other tantras.
Union with the Buddhas Tantra and other tantras appeared in the region of Zahor.
Further, countless lords of accomplishment —
Hayagriva, Dombi Héruka, Kambala,
Kukuripa, Gambhiravajra, Télopa,
Venerable Shantigupta and others who appear until the end [of the age] of conflict —
Illuminate the vajra way’s doctrine like the sun.
Prakashchandra of a royal family taught yoga tantra.
His three followers learned [in yoga tantra] and others
Widely disseminated the yoga tantra’s historical tradition.
Chilupa and Kalachakrapada, the elder and the younger,
Drew forth The Wheel of Time Tantra, and spread the bodhisattvas’ commentaries.
Later, King Dharmapala
Built the secret mantra temple known as Vikramashila.
Tantric masters, including Venerable Buddhajnana,
The six learned gate guardians, Lord Atisha, Abhayakaragupta,
And Shakyashri defended the doctrine.
Secret mantra remained in Koki in the east and in the midst of the southern Vindhya Hills.
In some small lands in the southeast and southwest,
The Victor’s doctrine lasted until later times.
In the future, it is thought that the sixteen elders, exalted
[Nagarjuna], and others will appear,
And the Victor’s doctrine will long flourish.

Tibet’s Buddhist kings were of the Licchavi clan.
The sacred teachings reached Tibet during Lha Totori Nyentsen’s reign.
Lord All-Seeing One Songtsen Gampo
Built temples and introduced the sacred teachings’ major customs.
Tonmi Sambhota invented an orthography and grammar,
Opening the great door of Himalayan discourse for the first time.
Gentle Melody’s magical manifestation Lord Trisong Déutsen
Invited the abbot and master, [and they] constructed glorious Samyé Monastery,
[Aided in the] translation of all the sacred teachings, and founded major schools of study and practice.
The brother princes, especially Tri Ralpachen,
Increasingly propagated the teachings, fashioned new terms, and [supervised] major editing of the translations.
The sacred teachings of monastic discipline, basis of the Victor’s doctrine, [came to Tibet] as follows:
Shantarakshita, lord of the doctrine,
First ordained the seven men under examination.
Countless sublime persons, translators, and monks appeared.
After Lang Darma’s suppression of Buddhism, the lineage passed through Mar Shakyamuni, Yo Géjung, and Tsang Rabsal.
Lachen Gongpa Rabsal and his disciples—the ten men from central and western Tibet —
Revived the doctrine and established monastic communities far and wide.
The ordination lineage of the great scholar’s two disciples named Pal
Has continued until the present.
Pala’s lineage, known as monastic discipline from upper Tibet, also appeared.
Scripture and realization are preserved through scholarship and meditation practice.

Concerning the teaching lineage of monastic discipline,
In southern India, two masters — Gunaprabha and Shakyaprabha —
Six masters named Mitra, and others
Widely transmitted commentaries on the substantialist order’s system.
In this land, lineages from Danashila, Jinamitra, and Chokro Lu’i Gyaltsen
Were united by Zu Dorjé Gyaltsen into a single teaching line,
Which gradually spread from his four disciples.
Tsonapa, Gya Duldzin, Ja Duldzin, and many other especially exalted individuals appeared.
Omniscient Butön Rinchen Drup received the legacy; his activity was that of a second powerful Sage.
The two collections on observed phenomena, higher and lower, written by Asanga [and his] brother,
Were propagated by Stiramati, Purnavardhana, Vasumitra, and others.
Jinamitra, Kawa Paltsek, and Chokro Lu’i Gyaltsen translated and taught the collection on observed phenomena.
Wé Yeshé Gyalwa and Drum Gyalwé Yeshé caused the teachings to spread upward [from eastern to central Tibet].
Great scholar Smriti Jnana passed The Treasury of Observed
Phenomena’s teaching lineage to Yé Chenpo Sherab Drak;
Rok Chökyi Tsöndru, Ben Könchok Dorjé, and Togar Namdé preserved it.
Sakya Pandit received Shakyashri’s teaching, along with a proximate lineage,
And eloquently expressed this especially exalted teaching tradition.

The [Buddha’s] outstanding regent perfectly elucidated
The Ornament of Manifest Realization, the hidden meaning of the perfection of sublime insight;
Asanga and his brother illuminated it.
Both the eminent Vimuktisena and Haribhadra elucidated the intrinsic emptiness method.
Because their teaching system was excellent, their activity was superior.
Here in Tibet, the perfection of sublime insight was taught and practiced widely
Due to the kindness of Lang Khampa Gocha and Bérotsana.
Rinchen Zangpo founded a teaching system of The Ornament of Manifest Realization.
As well, Lord Atisha taught it to Ku Chenpo Lhadingpa,
Dromtön Gyalwé Jungné, and Chadar Tönpa.
In particular, great Translator Ngok Loden Sherab spread widely [the perfection of sublime insight].
From Dré Sherab Bar, designated heir of earlier and later transmissions, and Ar Jangchub Sengé,
The lineage passed in stages to Yak Mipam Chökyi Lama and Rongtön Shéja Kunzik.
These spiritual fathers’ and sons’ intelligence continues to flow in an excellent, undiminished stream of teaching.
Illustrious Geshé Chapa transmitted the Trolung teaching system.
Those who explicitly teach emptiness follow the middle way.
From the two commentaries to exalted master [Nagarjuna’s] thought
Grew the consequentialist and independently verifiable reason schools.
These two had many followers, including Chandrakirti,
Shantideva, and the three easterners.
Chokro Lu’i Gyaltsen and Translator Ngok Loden Sherab transmitted the Indian scriptures.
Chapa Chökyi Sengé, the eight great lions, Rongtön Shéja Kunzik, and others
Held the independently verifiable reason school. Patsab with his four spiritual sons
Founded the tradition of the glorious Chandrakirti’s scriptural path.
The upholders of the Himalayan consequentialist school derive from that [source].

Maitreya and Nagarjuna elucidated the final wheel
In the four teachings and A Collection of Praises.
Asanga, his brother Vasubandhu, Chandragomi, and others taught and propagated it.
Translator Ngok Loden Sherab and Tsen Kawoché received from Sajjana
The teaching and practice transmissions thought to be two—the middle way and mind-only.
Tsang Nakpa Tsöndru Sengé, Rangjung Dorjé, the omniscient master
[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen] and his spiritual children, and others
Sounded a lion’s great roar of the incontrovertible meaning.
Shri Dharmapala’s collections of reasoning
Are said to elucidate the final wheel’s intent.

Uttamabodhibhagavan and Buddhaguhya taught action and conduct tantras;
Wé Manjushri spread the latter’s teaching system.
In yoga tantra, there are three learned masters’ traditions
Initially transmitted by the great translator, his four spiritual sons, and Atisha.
In the interim, one hundred streams from Tsakyawa Tönshak, Nur
Nyima Özer, Dzimpa Lochen, and others
Finally fl owed into Butön Rinchen Drup’s ocean of learning.
He restored yoga tantra doctrines from their very foundations.
It is said that there were twenty-four traditions of Matrix of Mystery.
Among just the six traditions to appear in Tibet,
The principal two are those of the exalted master [Nagarjuna] and Venerable Buddhajnana.
The former is the tradition of Marpa Chökyi Lodrö, Gö Kukpa
Lhétsé, Atisha, Chak Chöjé Pal, and supreme Scholar Shakyashri;
The latter is the tradition of Rinchen Zangpo, Translator Nyen, Ra Chörab, and Nyö Jungpo.

The supreme traditions are Marpa Chökyi Lodrö’s and Gö Kukpa Lhétsé’s transmissions of practice and teaching.
Marpa’s teaching line fl owed through Tsurtön Wang-gi Dorjé.
Gö’s tradition continued through the pillars, beams, rafters, etc.;
It reached the second omniscient one, Butön Rinchen Drup.
Slayer of the Lord of Death spans five time periods:
Desired Accomplishment, Various Forms of Conduct,
Harmful, Definite Engagement, and Partial Engagement.
Lalitavajra, Venerable Buddhajnana, and Shri Dhara
Were the early, middle, and last designated heirs,
And were vajra masters of the supreme sacred circle.
In particular, the compilation of Slayer of the Lord of Death’s cycles passed successively
Through Shri Dhara and others. In this land, it was the first secret mantra tantra.
During the doctrine’s later spread, [traditions originated with] Chokdru Sherab Lama,
Naktso Tsultrim Gyalwa, Rongzom Chökyi Zangpo, Chal
Chöpal Zangpo, Ra Dorjé Drak, Lama Kyo, Zhang, and Nyö Jungpo;
Among them, the tradition of Ra Dorjé Drak, Manjushri incarnate, is most exalted in teaching and practice.
Great Translator [Rinchen Zangpo] translated the tantra of the stupidity family, The Full Litany of the Names of Manjushri.
Its teaching and practice instructions appear in the early and later traditions.
Twenty-seven traditions of Supreme Bliss appeared in India;
Most reached Tibet.
Among traditions including those of Lokya Sherab Tsek,
Translator Mal Lodrö Drakpa, Marpa Dopa Chökyi Wangchuk,
Puhrang Lochung,
Rongpo Gargé and Yakdé Zémarwa, and Balpa Nawa,
The most exalted was Marpa Dopa’s, which Gyanam Dozepa Loden and others preserved.

Twelve commentaries and seven complete traditions of Vajra of Delight are known:
Those by Saroruha, Krishnavajra, Durjayachandra,
Ratnakara, Naropa, Métripa, and Yashobhadra.
Drokmi Shakya Yeshé preserved Virupa’s lineage; there are traditions from Gö Kukpa Lhétsé and Gyijo Dawé Özer.
Naropa’s lineage system passed through the teacher Marpa Chökyi Lodrö, Chal Sönam Gyaltsen, and Ram Tsenchen.
In particular, the teacher Marpa, Drokmi Shakya Yeshé, the teacher Métön Sönam Gyaltsen, Ngoktön Chöku Dorjé, and the Sakya [lineage holders]
Have hoisted this doctrine’s victory banner that stands until the end of existence.
Due to the kindness of Translator Marpa Chökyi Lodrö and Gyijo Dawé Özer,
Mahamaya, Four Seats, and Buddha Skull spread for a long time.
Many Wheel of Time traditions appeared,
From Gyijo Dawé Özer, Tsami Sangyé Drak, Ra Chörab and Dro Sherab Drak, Sapen the great, Chak
Drachom, Chal Chökyi Zangpo, and Rongling Dorjé Wangchuk.
Among them, the practice and teachings were transmitted through the Jonang and Zhalu lineages.
The tantra’s teaching was continued by the life-giving channel, the great master Butön Rinchen Drup.
The early translations’ teaching tradition continues to the present day.
The Vajrasattva Net of Illusion Tantra is the root tantra.
It stands above the crown of the head of all tantras like a victory banner.
Lalitavajra, Shri Singhaprabha, and Buddhaguhya explained this tantra.
Vimalamitra, Ma Rinchen Chok, and Nyak Jnana Kumara translated and taught it.
Rongzom Chökyi Zangpo, Longchenpa, Chomden Rikpé Raldri, and others spread it.
Zurpa’s especially exalted doctrinal tradition dwindled to become a slender hair.
The brothers of Mindrol Ling Monastery revived the doctrine’s dying embers.

In later, early, and minor traditions,
The teaching systems for great seal’s eight teaching systems,
The Sovereign All-Creating Mind,
And other tantras, scriptures, and profound instructions are indescribably numerous.
Jnanashri and others were famous for preserving many reading transmissions.
In Tibet, there were also Chomden Rikpé Raldri, Bak-tön Zhönnu Tsultrim, and others.
The ten foremost pillars who sustained the teaching traditions
Are the Buddhist government minister Tonmi Sambhota, Bérotsana,
Kawa Paltsek, Chokro Lu’i Gyaltsen, Zhang Yeshé-dé, Nupchen Sangyé Yeshé,
Rinchen Zangpo, Ngok Loden Sherab, Sakya Pandit, and Butön Rinchen Drup.
Their kindness cannot be measured, even by the bounds of space.
Later, it seems that the teaching doctrines were mainly transmitted in the Sakya and Géden orders;
The doctrines of the practice lineages, mainly through the Kagyu and Nyingma.
My tradition, from omniscient Rangjung Gyalwa,
Mainly emphasizes the teaching doctrines of The Profound Inner Meaning, The Vajra of Delight
Tantra’s Two Chapters, and The Highest Continuity.
The major scriptures’ four doctrines fl owed to Mikyö Gyalwa
He with his spiritual heirs shone everywhere the sunlight of eloquent teachings.
Nowadays, the true transmission continues.
Upon the ocean of the doctrine of monastic discipline, with waves of teaching and composition,
Gentle Spendid Melody incarnate, with the name Nyingpo, gathered the teachings.
Light of Shakyamuni’s doctrine, he was a second Nagarjuna.

The Shangpa Doctrinal Lineage, Pacification, Six Applications, and Approach and Accomplishment of the Three Vajras.
The early translations’ principal pillars are The Discourse That
Gathers Wisdom’s Realization, The Net of Magical Illusion
Tantra, and the mind category.
The class of practices forms their ornament; the secret cycle is the essence of their life force.
Due to the immeasurable kindness and altruistic intention of Lord Trisong Déutsen, instigator of the doctrine in the Himalayas,
Padmakara, the second Buddha, [came to Tibet].
In common perception, he merely taught The Pith Instructions, a Garland of Views;
To fortunate disciples, he imparted inconceivable cycles of ripening and liberating instructions,
Including the eight groups of meditation practices.
Considering beings of the future, he concealed many treasures
And established three meditation communities: countless accomplished masters appeared.
Experiencing hardships, Bérostana received Shri Singha’s heart essence.
It spread through the five links and the teacher Pang-gen Sangyé Gönpo.
The mind and spatial categories of instruction produced the kingdom of Buddha Ever Excellent.

Vimalamitra and Nyang-ben Tingzin Zangpo’s pith instructions give birth to [liberation in] a body of light.
Longchenpa, the second Garab Dorjé, spread this doctrine.
From four masters of India, Nepal, and Drusha,
Nupchen Sangyé Yeshé received The Discourse That Gathers
Wisdom’s Realization, the cycle of Slayer of the Lord of Death, and other [teachings].
The canonical transmission, mainly The Net of Magical Illusion Tantra, Yangdak Héruka, and Vajra Dagger,
Was preserved by an uninterrupted series of excellent accomplished masters,
Including Ma Tok Rinchen, Nyak Jnana Kumara, Nupchen Sangyé Yeshé, Nup Namké Nyingpo, So Yeshé Jungné, Nyang Sherab Chok,
The teacher Khön Lu’i Wangpo Sungwa, Lhazig Lang, Odren Palgyi Wangchuk, Gyu Palgyi Zhönnu,
Rongzom Chökyi Zangpo, [and members of the] Zur, Nyo, Chal,
Chim, Kyo, and Yung [clans].
Two sublime [treasure revealers], eight masters named Lingpa, capable masters, and others
Appeared successively, attuned to their historical periods. During the final times,
They will, with their disciples, prevent the secret mantra doctrine’s decline and cause it to flourish.

Lord [Atisha] emphasized the view and conduct
And presented A Lamp on the Path to Awakening, which integrates scriptures and profound instructions for meditation.

Naktso Tsultrim Gyalwa’s doctrinal lineage and others are infinite, yet
The principal lineage is that of Lord All-Seeing One, Dromtön Gyalwé Jungné.
The precious Buddha’s Word as Instruction has seven deities and teachings,
The three brothers’ system of scriptures, profound instructions for meditation, and pith instructions.
Many great exalted beings spread this excellent path to awakening.
This tradition pervaded every school,
Yet later, Manjushri’s magical manifestation, Tsongkapa,
Principally emphasized the path of scriptures, known as the new tradition of the Buddha’s Word as Instruction.

Nine cycles of the path from Virupa, Saroruha, and others
Were transmitted as essential profound instructions for meditation to the great Master Drokmi Shakya Yeshé.
The teachings that resulted from his spiritual connections with the six gates’ [scholars], the pith instructions without root [verses],
Concealed teachings of the path in a direct lineage, and Clarification of the Meaning through Symbols
Are the most important wisdom speech in the Path with the Result.

The spiritual sons of body and mind, and Sé Karchungwa, propagated three lineages.
Later, among those who received the full, medium, or minimal [transmission],
Three lineages—the male and female Zhama traditions and a blended lineage — are derived from the medium transmission.
The male lineage had disciple and son lineages; the female, three lineages;
And the blended lineages resulted in four traditions —
From Dumbu Kodrakpa, Chagen Wangchuk Gyaltsen, Jonang Kunpang, and Latö Wangyal.
The full transmission,
The Zhangtön lineage, [was received by] the particularly exalted
Sachen Kunga Nyingpo.
His former heirs were Pakmo Drupa and Chégom; the later heirs, the proximate and historical lineages;
And Mang-lam and Zhing Pukpa’s tradition. Among the total of eighteen traditions,
The Sakya and Zhama traditions spread for a long time.
In particular,
The Sakya tradition has the exoteric teachings of Ngor, Dzong, and Gang-kar [lineages],
And the esoteric teachings that the Tsarchen father and sons upheld, practiced, and transmitted.
Vajra of Delight’s creation and completion phases swelled like a lake in the summer.
The tradition of Gyijo Dawé Özer merged with that of the great Jonang Kunpang.

Lord Translator Marpa — regent of [Tilopa] who unites four doctrinal lineages, Naropa, and Métripa —
Received doctrines of teaching and meditation practice.
[Marpa’s] transmission reached the four pillars; in particular, Lord Milarepa’s oral lineage
Was held by his two disciples like the sun and moon.
The profound instructions of Réchungpa, heart-son of Machik Drupé Gyalmo and Tépupa Vimalamitra,
Nurtured all Himalayan schools.

[Gampopa] the monk physician whose life the Victor foretold
Had spiritual heirs who founded four major orders: Barom,
Pakdru, Kamtsang, and Tsalpa;
With the lineage holders of his main monastery, there were five.
Pakmo Drupa’s disciples [founded] the Drigung, Taklung, Tropu, Ling-ré,
Martsang, Yelpa, Yazang, and Shukseb: these are the four root and eight branch [Kagyu orders].
Ling Répa Péma Dorjé’s spiritual heirs founded the upper, lower, and middle Drukpa Kagyu orders.
The main lineage is that of the sixth buddha, Lion’s Roar.
With the Zurmang and Nédo traditions, there are three [Karma Kamtsang streams].
The last has filled most of eastern Tibet with holders of the Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lineages.
In particular, when the doctrine of meditation practice was setting over the western mountains,
The intentional manifestation of the translator [identical] with Vajra of Delight
Shone the light of the doctrine’s sun.
The Dakpo Kagyu’s accomplished masters are [as numerous] as particles of earth:
They will continue to appear unceasingly for as long as the Victor’s doctrine exists, exalted above all others.

From one hundred and fifty masters, including wisdom dakinis, scholars, and accomplished masters,
Kyungpo Naljor, endowed with the five culminant practices, received their wisdom minds’ treasure trove.
Of his three paths of teaching, debate, and meditation practice, the essence of the last
Is the five cycles of teachings, of which the golden doctrines form the root.
Kyungpo Naljor brought to spiritual maturity and liberation one hundred and eighty thousand persons who became spiritual mentors,
[Including] his six earlier and later spiritual heirs.

The vajra seal of the single lineage was lifted by Drogön Chöjé Tönpa, the seventh precious master of that line.
Lineages of disciples arose from three learned, accomplished masters and Latö Né-nying’s monastic seat.
On three occasions, early and later, Tangtong Gyalpo received
Niguma’s doctrinal transmission.
Drupé Pawo [Kunga Drolchok] received twenty-five historical and recent lineages.
The dakini accepted him as her disciple; within this marvelous recent lineage,
Lord of Secrets Drolwé Gönpo’s doctrinal system is exceptional.
This lineage is a series exclusively of bodhisattvas in their final life.
The dakinis’ vajra words are unmistaken and unadulterated.
Even in these final times, the fruit of accomplishment ripens.
The enlightened activities of Swift Acting Protector and other wisdom deities are infinite.

Padampa Sangyé received the essence of fifty-four accomplished masters and thirty-six celestial beings.
He traveled to Tibet five times;
In forms attuned to others’ needs, he liberated many beings.
[Pacification of Suffering] was taught three times: an initial, middle, and final transmission.
The Kashmiri master and Translator Angpo received the first transmission.
[The middle transmissions] are those given to Ma Chökyi Sherab,
So-chung Gendun Bar, and Kam Yeshé Gyaltsen,
Along with the three lesser lineage traditions, and various diverse teachings.
The final [transmission] was given to four authorized adepts and others.
[Padampa Sangyé’s] systems of profound instructions for spiritual ripening and liberation were as numerous as stars in the sky.
The middle transmissions conform to [discourses of] the definitive meaning; the final one concurs with the tantras.
The most exalted tradition is that of Jangchub Sempa Kunga, equal in realization to Padampa Sangyé himself.

Due to Translator Chöpal [Dharmashri]’s kindness, a bridge rope [of this lineage] remains.

A branch is the sacred teaching of severing demons.
Padampa Sangyé gave Kyo Shakya Yeshé and Yarlung Mara Serpo
Six portions of profound instruction, the male system of Severance.
The female system of Severance, the intended meaning of the perfection of sublime insight, the teachings that Machik Lapdrön realized,
Encompasses doctrinal transmissions of father, mother, nondual, and the dakinis’ meditative experience,
Or [lineages of] her sixteen spiritual children.
Machik Lapdrön’s daughter’s historical lineage, the direct lineage in Gyaltang’s tradition,
Kunpang Tsöndru Sengé and Ladu Dorjé Drönma’s treasure
Severance tradition, and others
Have continuing marvelous and widespread enlightened activity.

All extensive root tantras teach the essence —
Vajra Yoga, the pinnacle of all phases of completion.
[Vajra Yoga] has an excellent source: it originated from the mouths of [Shambhala’s] Buddhist kings and lineage bearers,
Greater and lesser Kalachakrapada, Shavaripa,
Anupamarakshita, Ravishrijnana,
Naropa, the Kashmiri scholar, Shantigupta, and others.
In Tibet, the best known [systems of Vajra Yoga] were four earlier traditions,
Five middle ones, and two later ones.
These seventeen traditions, of Gyijo Dawé Özer, Ma Géwé Lodrö,
Translator Trom Péma Özer, Atisha, Dro, Ra Chörab, Tsami Sangyé Drak,
Réchung Dorjé Drak, Translator Ga Namgyal Dorjé’s three, the Kashmiri scholar’s two,
Vibhutichandra’s two, Translator Chak Chöjé Pal, and Men-lungpa,
Were united in great Kunpang Zhang Tukjé Tsöndru.
In addition, many major and minor traditions emerged:
Kodrak, Rong, Bodong, and Latö Wangchuk Gyaltsen and Sönpa Kun-gyalwa.
In particular, the omniscient lord endowed with the four reliances
And Drolwé Gönpo, a true Buddha Vajra Bearer in the age of conflict,
Originated the superior oral transmission of the two lineage bearers.

Vajra Yogini bestowed her wisdom mind’s fundamental essence —

Rinpoché Kar-chuwa, Dawa Sengé, Butrapa Kétsun Sönam Özer,
Zur-pukpa Rinchen Pal, and the Nyédo brothers began many traditions.
Lord of the teachings, the second Victor Rangjung Dorjé,
Untied the vajra verses and illuminated this excellent path of profound instructions.

Infinite authentic, minor [lineages] appeared,
Including those from Mitrayogi and Latö Marpo, and Karak Gom- chung Lodrö Wangchuk’s three cycles of teaching.

In the first of the fields of culture, Sanskrit grammar,
Indra composed a treatise on the study of grammar; Brihaspati learned it.
As that scholar’s pride was shattered, he observed “days of restriction.”
Brahmin Panini, the grammarian whose life the Buddha foretold,
Was blessed by Lord of the World and composed the ancestor of grammar texts,
Commented upon by Shesha and Vararuchi.
Panini’s tradition includes The Mahabhasha’s root text and commentaries, Moonlight of Analysis,
An Introduction to Form, Shakatayana, and Katyayana’s [Grammar].

Chandragomi’s discourse, commentaries, and ancillary texts
Provide a perfect summary [of Panini’s Grammar], being concise, clear, and complete;
From among many texts written by him and others,
Translator Shong Dorjé Gyaltsen first translated and taught the root text.
To understand the grammar Indra taught Indradhruva,
Saptavarman followed Udayana’s command
And practiced meditation on Six-Faced Youth.
The Kalapa treatise was introduced [to Tibet] through the kindness of translators Shong Dorjé
Gyaltsen and Pang Loten.
Noble Sarasvati taught a grammar to Anubhuti.
The lord of Jonang and Chökyi Nangwa translated and taught the root text and commentary.
Translator Zhalu Chökyong Zangpo translated Manjushrikirti’s grammar text.
In India and Tibet, countless good and poor-quality commentaries on grammar have been written.

Non-Buddhist logical analysis, though earlier, is defective.

The first Buddhist text on logic was Establishing Debate.
Dignaga composed A Compendium of All Discourses on Logic, a discourse in six chapters
That present both direct and inferential [logic], exclusion of other,
Examples, and refutation.
As commentaries to that text,
Dharmakirti composed long, medium, and concise texts, which constitute the root,
And four branch [treatises], initiating the tradition of the seven treatises.
Devendrabuddhi, Shakyamati, Vinitadéva, Alamkara Prajnakara,
Shankarananda, and others explained these works.
Alamkara Prajnakara’s followers were Jina, Yamari, and Suryagupta.
Trijayadhaka explained Ascertainment of Dignaga’s Logic and A Drop of Reasoning.
Kamalashila explained Shantarakshita’s Compilation on Thatness.
Chandragomi and others composed many minor texts.

Some of the later texts among [Dharmakirti’s] seven were translated during the early translations.
Ma Géwé Lodrö, Ngok Loden Sherab, and Sakya Pandit translated texts on logic during the later propagation.
The latter [Sakya Pandit] composed the root text Logic: A Treasure of Reason and its commentary.
The holders of the teaching lineage—Sharpa Sherab Jungné, Nupa Uyuk-pa Rikpé Sengé, and Gungpa Kyotön Drimé —
Disseminated it into the transmissions of Khang-tön Özer Gyaltsen, Nyen Darma Sengé, Zhang Dodé-pal, and Zur- kangpa Kar Shakya Drakpa:
Many exalted masters appeared.
In particular, Lord of the World,
The seventh supreme Victor, compiled An Ocean of Texts on Logic,
Which contain all streams of Dharmakirti’s thought.
There are three Tibetan modes of commentary: Translator Ngok Loden Sherab’s [middle way] essencelessness,
The Sakya tradition’s [middle way] yogacharin, and others’ [middle way that accepts] conventional consensus.

Sacred supports for the three jewels constitute the most sublime art form.
The first among all was the Lotus Mound Stupa.
Faithful persons gradually built other stupas.

When the human life span was one hundred thousand years,
Subduer of Fear learned painting from Brahma and Vishvakarma.
Since then, until Lord of Sages’ transcendence of sorrow, [paintings] could be mistaken as real.
The earliest sacred supports of the wisdom body during this
Buddha’s doctrine
Are said to be paintings of the Buddha’s wisdom body — “Drawn from Water” and “Light Rays” —
Sent to Udrayana and Muktikakhatti.
Many precious sculptures were made for the seat of honor at the noontime meal
After the Buddha gave permission to Anatapindata.
When the Buddha visited the heavens, the king of Kashi (Benares)
Fashioned a sandalwood statue that now dwells in China.
Later, Rahula made with naga jewels
Great Glacial Lake, which was placed in the outer ocean.
Shakra, with various miraculous acts, made from many jewels
Physical representations of the Buddha at eight, twelve, and twenty-five years of age.
The last dwells with the gods; the other two reside in Tibet.
Directly blessed by the Buddha, they have the same blessing as our teacher.
After the Buddha’s transcendence of sorrow, divine artists emanated as humans:
Three brahmin brothers made statues,
And many sacred supports were built, such as the eight wonders of Magadha.
During Ashoka’s reign, noxious spirit artists
Built the eight stupas at the eight major sacred places and at Vajra
Seat’s inner enclosure.
During Nagarjuna’s lifetime, nagas produced many works of art.
The traditions of Bimbasara, Srigdhari, and Dhiman developed,
Modeled upon art of gods, noxious spirits, and nagas.
Their traditions became known as central, old western, and eastern art.
Nepal [followed] the old western style in the early period, and one similar to eastern [in the middle period].
In Kashmir, there were three traditions: central, old western, and indigenous.
In Tibet, the statues at the three spiritual centers were the earliest.
Painting [developed in] the Nepalese style, then both the Menri and the Kyenri appeared.
Chiuri was the third. Three artists named Tashi founded the
Gardri tradition.
In sculpture as well, a succession of masters appeared.
Particularly, [painting by] the master of art, supreme Lord of the World,
And the genius of Tsuklak Chökyi Nangwa
Are nectar for the eyes that transcends ordinary beings’ rational mind.

There are many Indian and Tibetan textual traditions that teach proportions,
Such as The Wheel of Time, The Origins of Binder of the Wheel
Tantra, and The Discourse Requested by Shariputra.
Many kinds of script developed in different countries.
In Tibet, Tonmi Sambhota studied grammar and written language with scholars in India.
He took [Indian scripts] as a model
And devised a script with the omissions and additions necessary for Tibetan.
He composed eight texts on grammar,
Including Thirty Verses and Tibetan Grammar.
Kyungpo Yutri, Sumpa Nöjin, and others disseminated [Tibetan calligraphy] widely.
I have not related here the minor histories of art.

Brahma first conceived of The Life Veda;
He sought nectar and composed One Hundred Thousand Verses on Healing Treatments,
Subsequently transmitted to Indra.
His disciple, Atreya, composed the treatise A Summary of Brahma’s Teaching.
From Agnivesha and other gods, the lineage passed to human beings.
Harichandra composed Charaka;
Other erudite seers composed many medical texts.
Our teacher gave instruction on medicine in disparate scriptures, including those on monastic discipline, discourses, and tantras.
At that time, such doctors as Atreya and Jivakumara appeared.
Some believe the Buddha taught the tantras in the Forest of Medicine.
Due to erroneous statements concerning A Cluster of Jewels,
A great deal of nonsense has been written on this subject.
However, the teachings of the later Zurkar Lekshé Tsol are unmistaken works.
Afterwards, Suryapala composed Establishing the Essentials of Medicine.

The exalted master [Nagarjuna] composed The Hundred
Prescriptions and other medical texts.
Amidst eighteen virtuous signs on the three planes of existence,
Vagbhata composed The Eight Branches,
A superior treatise that contains the correct essentials.
Chandranandana wrote a commentary, Moonbeams.
In China, following the end of the age of perfection,
Emanated kings and officials composed a series of texts.

During Songtsen Gampo’s reign, a text of the three great traditions was composed.
During Mé Atsom’s reign, many translations and compositions were done,
Including the traditions brought by his Chinese bride, those by a
Chinese monk, by Viji, and others.
The combined efforts of many skilled physicians resulted in the text Somaraja.
During Trisong Déutsen’s period, the text of the three emanated sons,
The Yellow Manuscript; A Compendium of the King, Officials, and Subjects;
And a text by skilled doctors from China, Zhang Zhung,
Mongolia, Tibet, and Azha were established.
Treasure texts relate that Bérotsana translated [texts] on astrology and medicine, etc.
Dzoro, Viji, and the four frontier doctors comprise the lineages of royal physicians.
During Buddhism’s later spread, many earlier and later Indian texts were translated.
Rinchen Zangpo’s transmission of The Eight Branches
Started lineages from the four Pu-hrong physicians,
Cherjé Zhangtön Zhikpo, Darma Gönpo, Yutok Yönten Gönpo, and others;
This represents the initial proliferation of Tibetan doctors, those able to help others.
Those known as the nine skilled doctors also followed these [teachings].
Medical writings composed by Tibetans are beyond enumeration.

Zhang-tön Ziji Barwa and Tötön Könchok Kyab traveled to India,
Became masters of The Eight Branches, composed texts, and engaged in widespread activity.
In later times, authentic texts appeared plentifully among the canonical and treasure teachings,
Including Secret Treatments, Mercury Prescriptions, and Treatments of Epidemics.
All lineage systems converged in Yutok Yönten Gönpo, Medicine Buddha incarnate.
Shrimala directly bestowed upon him her secret treasury.
He received the essence of all lands’ instructions, [composed] long and short tantras,
And turned the common and special wheels of the teachings.
A nest of physicians overflowed and innumerable lineage holders emerged,
Such as the traditions of the Jang father and sons, and the Zurkar uncle and nephew.
Most famous in later times were Dési Sangyé Gyatso and Chökyi Jungné.
[Such masters] elucidated these teachings and cared for the land of Tibet.

Seers created many systems of stellar calculation.

The Buddha taught astrological calculation in discourses and tantras
And in The Wheel of Time Tantra’s worldly realms chapter, upon which Butön Rinchen Drup and Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen wrote.
In particular, the Victor Rangjung Dorjé composed A Compilation of All Astrology.
Pukpa Lhundrup Gyatso, the Lord of Jang, and others elucidated their own systems.
In later times, the two astrological traditions of Pukpa and Tsurpu developed.
In response to Uma’s questions, Ishvara taught The Tantra of Victory in War.
This was translated by Lowo Sherab Rinchen and commented upon by Pukpa Lhundrup Gyatso and others.

Emperor Hung Dhi created element calculation when he examined a turtle.
Many subsequent texts were based on this.
Khampa Tramo, Krishnachandra, Kyung-nak Shakya Dargyé, and others founded systems,
But the early translations were very adulterated.
Later, the omniscient Lord made many new reliable translations of Chinese astrology.

The most famous work of poetry is Hindu, the Bharata.
Kalidasa composed works such as The Eight Messengers.
There were many Indian commentaries to The Mirror, composed by Dandi.
Valmika taught metrical composition.
Jinadeva established Marserchen’s tradition.
Ratnakarashanti composed a work with six wonderful applications [of meter].
The many works on lexicography include Medinikara and
Elucidating a Variety of Points,
Haravali, and The Composition of Rudra Kapyari.
Most excellent, however, is Amarasingha’s Treasury of Immortality.
Its Indian commentaries include The Nectar of Explanation, Moon of Words,
And Fulfillment of Desire. The latter has been newly translated.
Treatises on theater were not translated into Tibetan.
The latter fields of culture did not exist in Tibet before Sakya Pandit,
Who composed three treatises that encapsulated their meaning.
Texts on these subjects appeared due to the kindness of Shong
Dorjé Gyaltsen, Pang Loten, and Drogön Chögyal Pakpa;
Tenpé Nyinjé elucidated them all.

As the Victor did not emphasize worldly treatises,
He did not teach the basic texts of culture.
Since they are branch fields, the learned have elaborated them.

In Shambhala, the lineage-bearing Buddhist kings
Continuously turn the unsurpassable doctrine’s wheel.
Its ninety-six provinces practice the great way’s secret mantra.

In the future, the lineage-bearing kings
Will bring the age of perfection to the twelve parts of the lands of action in succession.
The doctrine was introduced in China one hundred and ten years after the teacher’s transcendence,
During the reign of Han emperor Ming-ti.
Many arhats and translators visited.
Primarily, the discourses and monastic discipline are practiced; the
Sakya, Karma, and Géden traditions are venerated.
Many arhats and bodhisattvas converted Khotan.
Both the lesser and great way doctrines spread there.
Master Padmakara converted Dravida.
Many vajra holders visited and the genuine secret mantra doctrine flourished.
On the islands of Sri Lanka, Dhanashri, Payigu,
Tamra, Java, and others, the great way [spread] a little;
The lesser way spread widely and continues to exist without decline until the present.

To take advantage of life’s leisure and endowments
Upon approaching the Buddha’s teaching, the source of all happiness and well-being,
First find and then follow a spiritual guide.
Since by relying on an inferior, one regresses,
On an equal, one stagnates,
And on a superior, one excels,
Keep in touch with a spiritual guide superior to yourself.
The need for a guide can be determined from scripture, logic, and similes.
A spiritual guide may be an ordinary human being, a bodhisattva, a buddha in manifest or enjoyment dimension
Suited to the four phases of the disciple’s growth.
Eight, four, or two qualities characterize the teacher who is an ordinary person.
The teacher may be a monastic preceptor, a bodhisattva’s instructor, or a tantric master.

The ordaining preceptor, ceremonial master, interviewer, tutor or instructor, and instructor of novices act as the five monastic teachers.
A monk who is ethical, well-versed in monastic ceremonies,
Compassionate toward the sick, associated with upright monks,
Diligent in helping others spiritually and materially, and able to give timely counsel
Is qualified to be a monastic preceptor.
An aspirant bodhisattva should work with a spiritual guide who is self-controlled, tranquil, and has pacified deception,
Is eminent, diligent, and displays a wealth of transmissions,
Has realized the nature of all phenomena, is articulate,
Embodies loving-kindness, and shows no weariness or discouragement.
The bodhisattva’s instructor who exhibits twelve qualities such as erudition is an exceptional teacher.
The tantric master must be steadfast, self-controlled, intelligent,
Patient, honest, and well-versed in the activities related to mantra and tantra.
He or she is compassionate, learned, expert in ten fields,
Proficient in the drawing of mandalas, and skilled in the ways of explaining the Secret Mantra.
From a different perspective, the vajra master owns three treasures, has received the entire course of initiations,
Is committed, learned in the tantras, skilled in performing rituals, and has produced signs of experience.
In summary, the vajra master belongs to an authentic lineage, preserves the pledges, has heard secret instructions,
And has realized the meaning of tantra. A monk is the best of the three types of vajra master.
Magnificent is the master with the power to evoke in the student
The adamantine pristine awareness of the state of union.
Avoid a master whose traits are discordant with those of a true teacher;
But since a fully qualified master is rare, follow the one who is replete with good qualities.

The suitable candidate for the life of a renunciate must be free from obstacles to assuming the vows.
In particular, he must respect the instructor, follow an ethical code strictly,
Persevere in meditation and study,
Be conscientious, restrained, and patient,
Since a good monk who lives by the monastic discipline is known by these very qualities.
A suitable candidate for the bodhisattva’s training is gifted with faith, kindness, intelligence,
And the stamina to engage in the bodhisattva’s conduct, does not seek personal peace,
Is energetic, and delights in hearing about emptiness.
A suitable candidate for the Secret Mantra is devoted to the master and is discrete,
Shows great aptitude, lives by the pledges, and perseveres in the practice.
The teacher should ignore a disciple ridden with shortcomings, but accept one who, despite imperfections, is gifted with qualities such as faith.
To determine whether they can brave a spiritual relationship, the jewel-like teacher and disciple must first examine each other.
Those intent on liberation should devote themselves to a spiritual guide with offerings and respect, service, and spiritual practice.
The Victorious One said: “By devoting yourself to a spiritual friend,
You will attain the full, accomplished, unique, and perfectly immaculate path to liberation.
By trusting me now as your spiritual guide, you will gain freedom from suffering. Consider these reasons!”
Many other benefits that accrue from studying with a spiritual guide are taught in the scriptures.
Shun unvirtuous friends who have bad characters, cynical outlooks, and prejudice,
Believe their own view to be the best, are boastful, and disparage others.
When working with a spiritual teacher, recognize demonic forces and defeat them with their antidotes;

Moreover, cultivate lucid, trusting, and longing faith.
The teacher prepares for a spiritual discourse by creating a congenial setting,
Dispelling malevolent influences, and maintaining dignified composure.
The disciple makes offerings, behaves respectfully, and values the opportunity.
When teaching, the master demonstrates three kinds of expertise, two types of kindness,
And three kinds of patience; and includes six elements in the discourse.
Alternatively, the teacher first states the general and specific purposes,
Provides two summaries which have six qualities,
And then analyzes the words in terms of object, agent, and action, and their literal meaning.
To facilitate understanding, the speaker clarifies the sequence of words and meaning by illustrating the two types of relationships,
And in response to objections, ascertains the meaning through scriptures and logic.
For the brightest student, the teacher may explain deep and far- reaching subjects; for the less intelligent, first give easily retained and accessible teachings,
Then delve into subtle details, connections, and contradictions.
Another task of the teacher is to encourage dispirited persons and counteract their distraction and apathy.
The disciple should eliminate the three defects of a jug, the six improper ways of listening, etc.,
And regard himself or herself as an ill person, the doctrine as medicine, and the master as a physician.
The speaker and the student should practice the six perfections when teaching and listening.
The teacher concludes the discourse with an apology, dedication, and sealing by contemplation.
The student makes offerings, recites dedication prayers, and maintains mindfulness.
Study, reflection, expounding, listening, and upholding the doctrine
Integrated with living experience is said to yield limitless merits.

To follow in the footsteps of saints, bodhisattvas, and buddhas
Is to preserve a threefold morality, the foundation for all good qualities,
Known as the ethics of personal liberation, of the bodhisattva, and of the awareness holder.
Concern for personal peace motivated by renunciation
Forms the basis for defining the personal liberation vows of the proclaimers.
The vows themselves are defined as the intention (as well as concomitant mental factors)
To forsake both injury to others and its basis. In the Analysts’ view, these vows have form.
Personal liberation is known as morality, virtue, endeavor, and vow.
The vows of personal liberation, meditative absorption, and the uncontaminated are found within different levels of existence.
The eight vows, those of the monk and nun, male and female novices and lay practitioners,
Postulant nun, and the purificatory fast,
Diversified in nature, are condensed into four types. Only seven meet the necessary requirements.
The present-day ceremony of ordination was introduced after the demise of the original one.
Men or women of the three continents are suitable candidates.
In assuming the vows, the candidate must not be bound by five stipulations, and must be free of the four obstacles.
An aspirant who has not gone for refuge cannot assume the personal liberation vows.
The precepts of the purificatory fast are observed for a day and may be conferred by any person holding the precepts.
The layperson’s precepts, the novice’s, and the monk’s ordination are conferred in their respective ceremonies.
The ceremony for the monk’s ordination requires ten essential elements.
Ethical conduct is maintained by reliance on others, purity of mind, recognition of incompatible factors,
Engagement in the training, and relying on the conditions for living comfortably.

The eight branches of the purificatory fast consist of the four basic precepts, abstinence from alcohol, dance, necklaces, etc.,
Luxurious or high beds, and eating after noon;
Ethical conduct, conscientiousness, and disciplined conduct encompass these eight.
An individual who observes these precepts for life is known as a venerable lay practitioner.
Lay practitioners are of five types. The first is committed to the Three Jewels
And abides by the three special and five general precepts.
The second abstains from one; the third, from some; the fourth, from most;
And the fifth, from all four root downfalls and alcohol.
Traditionalists maintain that there is also a celibate lay practitioner.
Novices may incur ten transgressions of the rules: violations of the eight branches,
Plus the rule to not accept gold and silver. With the exception of thirteen permissible ones,
The related minor infractions are the same as those of the monk.
The postulant nun observes six basic and six ancillary rules.
The rules of the monk concern five classes of downfalls.
Sexual intercourse, theft, murder, and lying about one’s level of spiritual attainment
Constitute the class of defeating offenses.
If the basis, attitude, act, and consummation are all present, the ordination is lost.
If one or more aspects are missing, a serious infraction or another offense is incurred.
Ejaculation, touching, and speaking of sexual intercourse to a woman, extolling reverence,
Matchmaking, constructing a hut, or a large dwelling, groundless, or trivial accusation,
Causing a schism, taking sides, causing a layperson to lose faith, and defiance
Constitute the class of partially defeating offenses.
Any of these offenses is said to leave only a residue of the vows.

Accepting a nun’s alms, accepting food served without regard to seniority,
Transgressing the rule not to beg at a household, and eating with- out checking the forest
Constitute the class of offenses to be individually confessed.
The one hundred and twelve minor infractions
Concern the wearing of robes, decorum,
Sitting, receiving food, manner of eating,
Begging bowl, teaching the doctrine, behavior,
And climbing. Thus, a monk must observe
A total of two hundred and fifty-three rules.
The nun must observe three hundred and sixty-four rules.
Prohibitions concern that which is incompatible with ethical conduct.
The first basis for monastic discipline consists of three methods for refinement of the training.
The purification-renewal to develop mental quiescence perfects meditation and wisdom.
Confession to foster harmony should be performed
Every half month, to increase prosperity, to eliminate misfortune, and to settle disputes.
Each of the two rainy season retreats, the earlier and later, lasts three months.
Timely, untimely, or unexpected lifting of the restrictions conclude the retreat.
The making and distribution of robes constitutes a basis of training concerned with conditions for living comfortably.
Robes include prescribed, accessory, and extra garnments.
The thirteen prescribed robes should be colored by the appropriate dyes.
Leather seat and shoes are permitted in special cases. The four types of food and medicine
Are those permissible before noon, within a day, seven days, or kept until one is cured of an illness.
One hundred and one formal procedures are subsumed under three categories.
The ordination is lost by returning it, death, wayward views, etc.
Scholars disagree on what constitutes loss of vows: some maintain that vows and downfalls exist together like a rich person with debts.
Others maintain that committing a root downfall destroys the whole ordination.
In particular circumstances, a defeat may not be an infraction due to incapacity to maintain the rules or other reasons.
Any type of ordination is destroyed by the violation of the four roots.

In this case, a layperson must reassume the precepts; novices and monks
Can amend unconcealed downfalls but not concealed ones.
Partial defeats are amended by demotion and services; downfalls are amended
By forfeiture, confession, and restraint; if a monk is unwilling to amend, he must be subjugated.
Four types of dispute are settled in seven ways.
The monastic sites and monks’ quarters at least should accord with the teachings on discipline.
A monk must relinquish the two extreme lifestyles: indulgence and austerity.
If an action accords with those permitted by the Buddha, it is performed; if it does not, it is renounced.
Analysts believe that the three disciplines have form and are substantially different;
Centrists assert them to be consciousness, the former transformed into the latter ones.
Individualists’ vows of personal liberation become Universalists’
If assumed with an altruistic motive to attain enlightenment,
Or even when the mind of awakening arises afterwards.
Universalists’ vows are received in the course of proclaimers’ ceremonies,
In special ceremonies such as the one for taking the vows of purification-renewal,
And in higher rites, the one for the formation of the awakening mind, the preparatory part of a tantric initiation, etc.
The preceptor may be a renunciate or a lay practitioner.
The candidate must fulfill the same qualifications specified for the proclaimers’ system;
But anyone ready to make the resolve to awaken is eligible to receive these precepts during special ceremonies.
In a case of special necessity, even the seven unvirtuous acts are permissible.
Concealed downfalls may be confessed and ordination retaken.
Secondary downfalls are amended by confession, sustained by the four forces.
Downfalls are purified by attitude, not by penances.
The vows are lost through wayward views, defeating offenses, or by returning them,
No other condition can destroy them.
In brief, the purport of all the scriptures on discipline is contained in these words:
Abandon negative actions, cultivate virtue, and discipline the mind.
Violation of ethical conduct bears serious consequences,
While pure ethics serve as the foundation and condition for all virtue.

The ethics of awakening mind in the Universal Way
Arise from awakened affinity, faith, love, and courage.
Awakening mind is formed through the strengths of a friend, cause, effect, path, and familiarization;
It arises from compassion, which springs from love.
The essence of the commitments consists in the ethical conduct that forsakes unwholesome deeds of body, speech, and mind,
Motivated by the intention to attain complete awakening for the sake of others.
The aspiring mind is characterized by wish; the venturing mind, by endeavor.
Awakening mind is approximate or subtle, depending on the way it is formed.
The stages are differentiated by appreciation, intention, full maturation, and freedom from all impediments.
Twenty-two similes, earth, gold, moon, etc., are used to distinguish awakening mind with respect to individuals.
Relative and ultimate awakening minds differ in their focuses.
Awakening mind may be formed in three ceremonies. The exclusive ceremonies are known as the two traditions of the pioneers;
These have been preserved by their followers.
In the profound view’s tradition, anyone able to articulate ideas
May assume the commitments of the aspiring and venturing minds at the same time
In the presence of a master or a sacred representation, following preparatory cultivation of merit and purification of mind.
Acute practitioners must avoid fourteen root downfalls.
Five of these apply mainly to kings: to steal the Three Jewels’ property, to reject teachings,
To blame the immoral, to commit deeds of direct retribution, and to profess wayward views.
Five downfalls apply mainly to ministers: the first four are the same as those prohibited for kings,
And the fifth is to plunder a town. The eight root downfalls that apply to beginners are to teach emptiness to the untrained,
To cause another to give up the intention to awaken, to make someone abandon the Individual Way,
To assert that the Individual Way does not conquer emotions, to praise oneself and belittle others,
To falsely claim realization of emptiness, to cause a king to inflict a fine and then accept stolen property as a bribe,
To disrupt meditation or to give the possessions of a contemplative monk to one who merely recites scriptures.
Downfalls for average practitioners are to give up awakening mind,
Be ungenerous, angry, or hypocritical.
An obtuse practitioner must at least maintain the aspiration to awaken.

The secondary infractions number eighty: twenty-four stem from disinterest in others’ happiness or suffering;
Sixteen stem from neglecting to accomplish greater goals.
Each may be incidental or continuous.
The commitments may be lost in six ways, such as giving up refuge.
While a root downfall may damage some aspects of the venturing mind,
As long as aspiration is present, the commitments cannot be lost.
To restore the commitments, one invokes Akashagarbha and acknowledges the downfall in his presence.
If the time limit for confession has passed, one restores the commit- ments using the four forces.
One should promise to train in the prescribed practice only to the extent and for as long as one estimates one can.
In the magnificent deeds tradition, commitments of aspiring mind are assumed by a holder of one of the seven personal liberation vows
Before an erudite and competent master who abides by the same commitments.
The commitments of venturing mind are bestowed only after the scriptures are studied.
The extensive rite for the venturing mind includes an inquiry concerning obstacles, etc.
A practitioner must guard against four root downfalls and forty-six secondary infractions.
The root downfalls are to praise oneself and belittle others out of attachment to wealth and honor;
Not to give material aid or not to give teachings to the needy out of miserliness;
Not to forgive someone though he has apologized and to strike him in anger;
To abandon the Universal Way and to present false teachings as true Buddhism.
Depending on the strength of involvement, the downfall may be serious, moderate, or light.
The seven contradictions to generosity are not to make offerings, to indulge in desires, not to have respect,
Not to answer questions, not accept invitations, to refuse gifts, and not to explain the teachings.
The nine contradictions to ethics are to reject the immoral, not to observe the rules, to make little effort for others’ sake,
Not to commit an unvirtuous deed although permitted, to engage in wrong livelihood, to play out of excitement and agitation,
To wish for a solitary escape from cyclic existence, not to avoid a bad reputation, and not to resort to disquieting methods.
Four contradictions to patience are to neglect the four obligations, to reject an angry person,
To refuse apologies, and to give in to anger.

The three contradictions to effort are to gather followers, not to overcome laziness, and to delight in meaningless conversation.
The three contradictions to meditation are not to seek instructions, not to overcome impediments, and to be attached to the pleasur- able experience of meditation.
The eight contradictions to wisdom are to reject the proclaimers’ way, to embrace that way or a non-Buddhist one,
To prefer its literature, to take no interest in the distinctive features of the Universal Way, not to seek the true teachings,
To praise oneself and belittle others, and to rely on the words rather than the meaning:
These thirty-four contradictions prevent the development of wholesome qualities.
Not to help persons in need, not to care for the sick, not to relieve others’ suffering,
Not to correct the heedless; not to repay kindness, not to relieve pain, not to be generous,
Not to care, not to comply, not to praise, not to correct,
Not to uplift others: these twelve contradict working for others’ benefit. Infractions are of three types: emotional, non-emotional, and without consequence.
If a root downfall is committed with great emotional involvement or if the aspiration for awakening has deteriorated,
The commitments are lost and must be reassumed.
Downfalls committed with medium or slight involvement are confessed before three vow holders or one;
Emotional minor infractions, before one; and non-emotional minor infractions, with one’s mind as witness.
In this tradition, one must observe all points of training to their full extent and until awakening.
Common to both traditions are five precepts for the aspiring awakening mind:
Not to reject any being; to ponder benefits; to acquire merits; to refine the awakening mind;
And to shun the four black deeds of deceiving one’s master or a venerable person, feeling regret for what is not to be regretted,
Being angry at a bodhisattva, and being cunning and deceitful,
And to undertake the four white deeds in their place.
One should have the three noble aspirations of goal, skillful means, and marvelous activity;
And eliminate despair, apprehension, and other emotions that cause aspiration to deteriorate.
The points of training in venturing mind prescribe both what to avoid and what to practice.
All these points are included in the threefold ethics of restraint, acquiring good qualities, and working for the benefit of others.

The prescription for what to avoid corresponds to the commitments set out in the two traditions mentioned above.
One should renounce what is naturally unwholesome or unwholesome by prescription except in cases of special necessity,
Impediments to the spiritual maturity of oneself and others,
Pleasures of this life that create suffering in the next, or what causes misery in both,
Deeds that qualify as downfalls, and downfalls-in-disguise;
And undertake what brings happiness in the next life though is painful in the present, what brings happiness in both,
Deeds that do not constitute downfalls, and those that might seem to be downfalls but are not.
All actions done with compassionate concern are without fault.
The prescribed practice corresponds to the ethics aimed at acquiring good qualities, which is the practice of the six perfections.
The perfections are described in terms of their number, order, characteristics,
Semantic meaning, divisions, and groups.
Each perfection is threefold: Generosity of material aid, the teachings, protection,
Ethics of restraint, aimed at acquiring good qualities, and working for the benefit of others,
Patience to withstand harm, accept hardships, and fathom emptiness,
Effort that is armor-like, applied to the task, and insatiable,
Meditation of resting at ease, aimed at acquiring good qualities, and focused on the welfare of others,
Wisdom that is worldly and supramundane, higher and lower,
Or wisdom that arises through listening, pondering, and meditating.
When wisdom is present, all five become supramundane perfections.
Four means of attraction and other ways are used to benefit others.
Awakening mind and its training are safeguarded with mindfulness and discriminating alertness.
A great wave of altruistic deeds is the cause of an ultimate awakening mind.
Its essence is the pristine awareness of an exalted bodhisattva’s equipoise.
It may be divided into the awakening mind of the first stage, and so forth.
Some scholars assert that ultimate awakening mind can be formed in a ritual; others deny this.
Ultimate awakening mind possessed of three ultimate aspects
Is the pristine awareness that directly realizes the sphere of reality.
To damage awakening mind brings four adverse consequences.
To safeguard aspiration reaps eight merits; and venturing mind, two special ones.
The awakening mind is indeed the source of all temporary and lasting benefits and happiness.

The two systems of awareness-holder vows are the new and the ancient.
In the system of the later translations, some enter the Secret Mantra gradually; others, straightaway.
Mantric vows are essentially the resolve, accompanied by its concomitant factors,
To train in methods to experience blissful pristine awareness in order to bind grasping to subject and object and the propensity for movement.
In short, the ethics consist in the discipline of binding body, speech, and mind with skill in means and wisdom.
Three types of vows are distinguished according to subject matter:
The causal tantra’s vow to bind all phenomena, form, sound, etc., within innate pristine awareness;
The vow of the tantra of skillful means to bind subtle and gross objectifying thoughts within the creation and completion phases;
And the resultant tantra’s vow to bind subjective experience within the nature of the dimensions of awakening and pristine awareness.
Four classes of tantra teach the actual tantra: Action, Conduct,
Yoga, and Highest Yoga tantras.
Three kinds of mantric vows are distinguished according to initiatory rituals in which they are assumed:
The mantra’s own personal liberation and awakening mind vows assumed during regular confession;
Vows of divine fortune taken upon entry into the mandala;
And the creation and completion vows assumed in the main part of an initiation.
The vows are assumed with a promise upon entry into the mandala,
Or in their entirety at the end of the initiation.
The vows’ seeds are planted when the body, speech, and mind are consecrated;
They are formed with the promise to maintain them and blessed by the descent of pristine awareness;
The main conferral of initiation brings them to the apex.
Mantric vows of the lower tantras are called incomplete or partially complete;
And those of the higher tantras, fully complete.
Bliss and emptiness, as two or as one, embrace all vows.
Although no discrimination is made with regard to aspirants,
A person unable to safeguard as much as the common vows
Is not to be initiated but may enter the mandala.
Vows and pledges assumed during the initiation must be safeguarded like one’s life.
Four pledges constitute the foundation common to all tantras:
To maintain correct view, refuge, and awakening mind, and to receive the mandala’s initiation.

The fourteen general pledges of Action Tantra
Are to have faith in the Three Jewels and in mantra, to have earnest interest in the Universal Way,
To be devoted to the supreme field of merits, not to be angry with deities, to make offerings on special occasions,
Not to venerate other traditions, to honor guests, to be always benevolent,
To acquire merit, to exert oneself in reciting the mantra and in safeguarding other commitments,
Not to teach mantras or mudras to those without pledges, and to accomplish the aim of the tantras.
Practitioners must observe the pledges of each family as taught in the respective tantras.
The means of purifying transgressions include reciting one hundred thousand of the mantra of one’s family
Or the recollection mantra [called “Unconquerable Vajra] That Blazes Like Fire,” the performance of appeasing fire offerings, etc.
Conduct Tantra’s pledges are fourteen: to refrain from the ten unvirtuous deeds, not forsake the sacred doctrine,
Not give up one’s awakening mind, not be miserly, and not harm others.
The means of restoration of the Action Tantra’s pledges also apply to the Conduct and Yoga Tantra.
Yoga Tantra pledges consist of fourteen injunctions and fourteen prohibitions.
Injunctions related to the five families are to take refuge in the
Three Jewels, commit oneself to the vajra, bell, and master,
Practice the four generosities, uphold the three ways, and make offerings.
The prohibitions are not to forsake the Jewels and the awakening mind,
Not disrespect the deity, mantra and seals, and master, not step over sacred objects,
Not eat wrong foods, not divulge the secrets, not forsake mantra and seals, not harm others, not delight in the Individual Way,
Not despair, not forsake the training, and not engage in what is unwholesome.
These five families’ pledges are the main pledges taught in the explanatory tantras.
The sets of pledges given in the Glorious Paramadya and other fundamental tantras should be learned from other sources.

Explanatory tantras teach the pledges of the five families, general pledges, and pledges given in the concise proclamation.
The general root pledges are to shun the fourteen defeats for a bodhisattva.
The branches are the ethics of restraint from the four root offenses and from drinking alcohol;
The ethics aimed at acquiring good qualities by devoting oneself to authentic masters, etc.;
And the ethics of working for others by giving up four incompatible attitudes.
Not to disrespect gods, etc., and other common vows are assumed as part of those given in the concise proclamation.
The vows to be safeguarded by all are taken with a promise,
While the vows not to commit the ten infractions, etc., are assumed through initiation.
Highest Yoga Tantra prescribes three disciplines: conduct, vows, and pledges.
Each tantra presents its special forms of conduct.
The Guhyasamaja Tantra teaches the conduct of the five families and four pledges to be interpreted.
The Chakrasamvara tantras speak of twenty-two modes of pure conduct and eight concerning the awareness woman.
Fourteen conducts are enumerated in the Tent Tantra; nine, in the Unsurpassable Tantra.
The Wheel of Time Tantra prescribes twenty-five modes of conduct.
Five consist in refraining from the four root offenses and from drinking alcohol.
Twenty consist in abstaining from the five related ill-deeds of gambling, eating impure food, reading perverse subjects,
Making sacrifices for ancestors, and extremist religious practices;
Five murders of killing an animal, child, man, woman, or destroying reliquaries;
Five kinds of enmity toward friends, leaders, the Buddha, the Buddhist community, or a trustworthy person;
Five desires related to form, sound, smell, taste, and sensation.
These modes of conduct form the foundation of all vows and pledges.
The common vows are those of the five families, or the six:
For the Akshobhya family, to keep the seals and master;
For the jewel, to practice the ten kinds of generosity; for the wheel, to rely on ten foods;
For the sword, to make offerings; for the lotus, to maintain vows of retention;
For Vajrasattva, to cultivate a mind of awakening. These have both provisional and definitive meanings.

The exceptional vows are these: for the vajra family, to take life; for the sword family, to lie;
For the jewel, to steal wealth; for the lotus, to abduct the women of others;
For the wheel, to eat meat and drink alcohol; and for the curved knife, to be generous and not to disrespect women.
Practitioners should engage in the evident or hidden meanings of the pledges according to their levels of spiritual accomplishment.
Highest Yoga pledges prescribe avoidance of fourteen root downfalls:
To disrespect one’s spiritual master; transgress the Buddha’s teachings; be angry at one’s spiritual companions;
Abandon love; lose the awakening mind; disparage the teachings;
Disclose secrets; abuse one’s own aggregates; disbelieve what is pure in nature;
Love the wicked; apply discursive thought to transcendent reality; cause believers to lose faith;
Not accept pledge substances; and disrespect women.
Eight secondary downfalls are to rely on a consort without pledges,
Quarrel at ritual feast, accept nectar from an unsuitable consort,
Not teach when appropriate, answer questions perversely,
Stay in the home of a proclaimer, boast of being a tantric practitioner although ignorant,
And proclaim secrets to the unsuited. There are many other ways to enumerate secondary downfalls.
The subtle infractions include fifteen concerning charismatic activity and seven branches.
The tantras give numerous classifications of the pledges, the pledges of the four initiations, etc.
Mikyö Gawa asserts that all pledges are included in the four pledges related to the four initiations:
The pledges to be safeguarded, of sustenance, of conduct, and not to be apart from.
Pema Karpo presents the pledges of restraint from root downfalls, the pledges of practice of the six families,
And the pledges related to practice, which form the three groups of pledges prescribing ritual articles,
Pledges prescribing enjoyments, and pledges of equipoise and post- equipoise.
The victorious Rangjung Dorjé states that all pledges are included in four pledges.
All of these pledges are encompassed by two categories: prohibitions and injunctions.
Six modes of conduct are taught in Tent Tantra for practitioners who have reached the stage of warmth.
Practitioners who have perfected pristine awareness are beyond codes of behavior.

A defeat occurs when there is motivation, recognition, pursuing, separation,
Lack of regret, non-deranged state of mind, and overdue acknowledgment.
If some completing factors are missing, the infraction may be a serious transgression, downfall, or a minor infraction.
The Essence Ornament teaches twenty-five means of restoration.
Fire ritual, recitation of mantra, meditation, ritual feast, etc.
Are the means to purify downfalls, transgressions, violations and ruptures.
Any downfall, regardless of its seriousness, can be purified if acknowledged before three hours have elapsed.
Meditation and recitation of the mantra of Vajrasattva and Samayavajra,
Initiation, and self-initiation are the best means for purification.
Higher pledges are restored through self-blessing and the view.
In the tradition of the ancient translations, the pledges common to the spiritual ways of skill in means
Are the general pledges, the particular, and the exceptional ones.
The general pledges are the limits to be observed in the personal liberation precepts, awakening mind commitments, and the pledges of the three outer tantras.
The particular pledges are the root pledges of body, speech, mind, and awakening mind, and
The secondary pledges of the five to practice, five not to renounce,
Five to accept, five to recognize, and five to integrate.
Practitioners should safeguard and engage in the provisional or definitive meanings of these pledges
In accordance with circumstances. The exceptional pledges concern familiarization and attainment practice.
The Magical Net, the source tantra of Mahayoga,
Presents five root pledges: not to forsake the unsurpassable, to honor the master,
Not to interrupt mantra and seal practice, to be kind to siblings,
And not to divulge the ten secrets; and ten secondary pledges,
Five not to renounce and five not to reject.
Those are divided into three hundred and sixty that can be subdivided indefinitely.
By virtue of their sevenfold greatness, states Rongzom, Mahayoga’s pledges are superior
To the pledges of lower tantras and to the commitments of the Universal Way.
Anuyoga presents nine general pledges which are encompassed by two:
The pledge of reality with no limits to be observed;
And the pledge of compassion with limits.

The general Atiyoga pledges are outer, inner, and secret pledges relating to a buddha’s body, speech, and mind;
Each divided thrice yields a total of twenty-seven.
The exceptional pledges relate to non-existence,
Naturalness, spontaneous accomplishment, and oneness.
Transgressions are of five types: major deteriorations, root and secondary, violations by association, and indirect ones.
Not to confess these brings misfortune and a life in the Hell of Unceasing Torture.
The proclaimers’ vows, like a clay pot, once broken cannot be repaired;
The awakening mind commitments, like gold or silver, can be restored;
The tantric pledges, like a dented vessel, are restored by the practitioner’s strength.
Pledges are restored through action, precious substances, earnest desire, contemplation, and reality.
The Great Cleansing can purify all transgressions.
A person may hold one, two, or all three sets of vows, etc.;
These vows are distinguishable. Indian scholars differ from Tibetan scholars in their assertions
On how all three sets of vows coexist in one person.
Abhayakara says that the vows are similar in that they share an attitude of restraint
But are distinguished by their forms. The great scholar Vibhutichandra asserts
That the higher vows outshine the lower, while remaining distinct.
The incomparable Gampopa and his followers state that the three ethical systems
Are each of a different essence and should be preserved as prescribed.
Faced with dilemma, the higher system takes precedence;
Transgressions of the lower vows are thereby overcome; their qualities are contained in the higher.
The systems differ in the way vows are assumed and lost.
The venerable Drakpa, the omniscient Longchenpa, and others
Assert that the individual identities of the ethical systems are unmixed; each is complete in prescribing both restraint and requirements.
The essence of one vow changes into the next; thus, the qualities of the higher contain the lower.
Special conduct makes them compatible with each other. One should observe the most important in any given circumstance.
The Gedenpas assert that the three sets of ethical systems are distinct and that each one is the foundation of the next.
Each of these assertions is substantiated by scriptural references and reasonings.
A supreme vajra holder endowed with the three sets of vows who perseveres in practice
Will attain the rank of Vajradhara in one lifetime and in the same body.

At the outset, studies should be pursued impartially
Because they are the basis of all erudition and enlightened attributes.
Whatever one investigates—scriptural compilations, treatises, or fine arts —
One should be aided by humility and perseverance.
Why so? In order to accumulate genuine [analytic] knowledge and so forth!

Articulation of syllables is the basis of all knowledge.
Although the number of languages and scripts may be limitless,
Their [common] foundation comprises the vowels and consonants.
Actual sounds are held to be not fruitional [in nature],
But they are either produced in conformity with their causes, or cumulatively.
The essential nature of syllabic articulation is vocal pulsation,
Which may be short, long, or diphthong in its duration,
Enduring [respectively] for one, two, or three blinks of an eye.
Each fraction [of a vocal pulsation] lasts but a single instant,
And, along with others, forms a continuum.
[Syllables] are categorized in the Treasury [of Phenomenology]
Among the disassociated [formative predispositions].
The etymological definitions [of “syllable”] include “unchanging nature,”
“Elucidator of nouns and words,” and “signifier of meanings.”
The syllabic scripts include Rañjanā, and so forth.

As for the analysis that is commonly made,
In Sanskrit, the foremost of the four classical languages of India,
The vowels include simple vowels and diphthongs,
And the consonants include basic phonetic sets, semi-vowels, and spirants.
The vowels [according to the Grammar of Candragomin]
Number one hundred and thirty-two,
And the basic consonants thirty-seven, which, when multiplied by the vowels,
Become four thousand three hundred and fifty-six.
These all arise dependent on eight places of articulation,
Their articulators, and the modes of inner and outer articulation.
The Tibetan language has four represented vowels, I and so forth,
And thirty consonants, analyzed as prefixes, suffixes, and radicals.
These may occur as isolates, or [in conjunction with] prefixes, superscripts,
Stacks, subscripts, and suffixes.
Meaning is disclosed by adding inflections, particles, and so forth;
And [action] is conveyed by verbal agentives and objectives, and the three tenses.
At first [Tibetan] phonics should be practiced,
And this should be followed by the spelling aloud of constructed syllables.
These [syllables] are produced and expressed in conformity with
Their distinct places of articulation, articulators, and modes of articulation.
Having mastered [spelling], the technique of affixation—
The process determining which [affixes] are attached to which [radicals] —
As well as the need for [affixation]
Should all be studied with reference to the excellent texts of Tonmi,
The oldest of [all the Tibetan treatises on] language,
Which were [composed] through the enlightened activity of the buddhas.
All [constructions depend on] the following eight elements of linguistic application:
Apprehended sounds and languages,
Names and attributes,
Communicative symbols and conventional terms,
And words and meanings.
Through the convergence of sounds and meanings,
An apprehending intelligence arises
In association with five successive factors:
Objective reference, sound generation, shared ideation,
Commonality, and adhesion.

There exist no branches of knowledge
That should remain unstudied by the sons of the Conquerors.
Therefore the classical sciences should be studied
Because they eradicate [wrong understanding],
Bring [seekers] into the fold,
And achieve the all-knowing [path of omniscience].
Grammar — [the science] that eliminates wrong understandings with regard to words —
Comprises three aspects: primary bases, affixation, and derivation.
Among primary bases, the verbal roots can be subsumed in six categories:
Those that have been listed or formally conjugated,
Those that have not been listed or formally conjugated,
And those that have both been and not been formally conjugated;
As well as denominative verbal roots, affixed verbal roots,
And those that are both denominative and affixed.
When subsumed, they comprise active and reflexive verbs.
Nominal stems are of six types:
Those of exclusive gender, those of mixed gender,
And those of obscure, congruent, universally applicable, and indeterminate [gender].
Affixation includes desiderative suffixes,
Enabling verbal roots to be formed as [other] verbal roots,
Verbally conjugated suffixes, enabling verbal roots to be formed as phrases,
Primary nominal suffixes associated with verbal action,
Enabling verbal roots to be formed as nouns,
Denominative suffixes, enabling nouns to be formed as verbal roots,
Feminine-forming suffixes, enabling gender to be formed as [another] gender,
Secondary nominal suffixes, enabling nouns to be formed as [other] nouns,
And nominal case suffixes, enabling nouns to be formed as phrases.

Nouns, adjectives, verbs, and pronouns—
These are the four [categories of words].
Alternatively, [words] can be classified as agents, verbal actions, and objects.
Derivation comprises both actual [derivation] and nominal compounding.
The essential elements of derivation concern the substitution [of retroflex syllables for dentals],
And the classification of technical markers attached to verbal roots, affixes,
Gender terminations, augments, indeclinable and [permitted final] words.
Elision should be carried out in respect of [final vowels] that facilitate pronunciation
And [final letters] denoting peculiarities [of inflection],
As well as those that are [merely] technical markers.[*2*]
The verbal prepositions that modify meaning and form, and the augments
Constitute the ancillary aspects of derivation.
As for [derivations due to] affixation,
All three elements — syllables, affixes, and inflections —
Undergo infinite transformations,
Including those due to euphonic conjunction.
There are six kinds of nominal compound:
Descriptive, pre-numerical, uncountable,
Initially dependent, exocentric, and coordinative.
The essence [of grammar] is subsumed in nouns, words, and derivations.
To learn the language, one should be undeluded with respect to meaning.

Valid cognition, which eradicates wrong understanding with respect to meaning,
Refers to the object, subject, and processes of [logical] understanding.
The object is the knowable or appraisable which is to be understood.
Objects may be substantial or insubstantial,
Compounded or uncompounded, permanent or impermanent.
Substantial [objects] include material and cognitive phenomena,
Causes and results, along with their subdivisions.
In terms of their functionality [objects] fall into three categories,
Namely, apparent, conceived, and applied objects.
In terms of the processes of understanding objects that are to be appraised:
[Objects] include specifically and generally characterized phenomena,
Or else they are established as directly evident, indirectly evident,
And indirectly evident to an extreme degree,
Or else [they comprise] signified [phenomena] and their supplementary [definitions].
The subject is both the signifier which engenders comprehension, and the cognizer.
Signifiers essentially include nouns, phrases, and speech.
In terms of the signified they include type signifiers,
Set signifiers, and modes of signification,
As well as the predicate, the subject, and preclusion without or with [predicate].
Theoretically, [signifiers] may be conceived or directly evident.
[Also incidentally defined here] are the term “syllable” and the term “individual person. ”
Consciousness or awareness [has ten aspects]:
Valid and non-valid cognition,
Conceptual and non-conceptual cognition,
Mistaken and unmistaken cognition,
Intrinsic and extraneous awareness,
Mind and mental states.
With regard to direct perception,
There are four modes of direct perception:
Sense organs, mind, intrinsic awareness, and yoga.
Inference is made through the power of facts,
Popular acclaim, and conviction.
There are many such categories and approaches,
And the conclusions of valid cognition Should also be incidentally understood.
With regard to [the logical processes of genuine] understanding,
There are contradictions [that may be determined],
Along with relations, negations, proofs, universal and particulars,
Identity and difference, eliminative and affirmative engagement,
As well as extraneous [elimination], definition, definiendum,
Substance and counterpart [phenomena], and the two modes of inference.

[The first of these] is inference for one's own sake —
This requires genuine evidence endowed with the three criteria.
One should reject ostensible and contradictory evidence
In which [these criteria] are incomplete.
The [given] examples should also be determined accordingly.
[The second of these] is inference for the sake of others—
This requires a statement of proof endowed with the three criteria,
Acceptable to both the antagonist and the respondent,
And endowed with the two aspects.
In the case of evidence, elimination, refutation,
Consequential reasoning, and so forth,
The ostensible [types] should be rejected,
And the correct [types] should be established.
While these [processes of logical understanding] are prestigious in modern circles,
There are also different [logical presentations],
Exemplified by the Treasure of Logical Reasoning,
The Oceanic Textbook of Uncommon Logical Reasoning,
And the traditions of the ancient [Kadampas].
All points signified in the texts on valid cognition may be personally understood
Through direct perception, inference, and their ostensible forms,
Whereas proof, refutation, and their ostensible forms engender understanding in others:
These are the eight aspects of dialectics.
In brief, there are three kinds of objects to be appraised:
The directly evident, the indirectly evident,
And the indirectly evident to an extreme degree.
As for their means of appraisal, they comprise [respectively]
Direct perception, logical inference, and scriptural authority,
Of which the purity is established by the three types of scrutiny.
There are four kinds of direct perception,
Three logical axioms of inference,
And various technical terms that derive from these.
The analytical basis or topics [for discussion],
The analysis of phenomena,
The systematic framework to be determined,
Consequential reasoning which is the process of determination, and [correct] view —
These are the five modalities offering an introduction to the Middle Way,
Subsumed in [the teachings] of the mighty lords of knowledge.
Through conventional terms, ultimate objects of appraisal
Are established as valid cognition.

Although the arts that can be earnestly pursued are limitless,
All knowledge may in fact be subsumed within the fine arts of the three media.
The supreme arts of the body are the representations
Of buddha body, speech, and mind.
Artists are skilled and maintain the one-day observances (upavāsa).
They have received empowerments and maintain the commitments
Associated with the inner [classes of] the way of secret mantra,
And they are endowed with blessings, as are their materials and tools.
Painted icons representing [visualized deities] of meditative commitment
That accord with the texts arc the best.
With regard to iconometric proportion, the number of relative finger-widths
Allocated [for buddha images] is one hundred and twenty-five
According to the Tantra of the Wheel of Time,
While, according to the Tantra of the Emergence of Cakrasaṃvara,
It should be one hundred and twenty.
The [Tantra of the] Four [Indestructible] Seats is similar [to the latter],
While the [Tantras of Red and Black [Yamāri] calculate eight face-length measures.
The Sutra [Requested by Śāriputra] and [other ancient] Indic texts
Are [generally] in conformity with those [works],
And there are [contemporary] traditions that follow them as well.
Among the five anthropometric scales applied in certain circumstances,
[Including the scale of] twelve and a half finger-widths,
[The scale of] twelve finger-widths, and the palm-length measures,
The first and second accord with the Wheel of Time
And the Emergence of Cakrasaṃvara,
While the third and fourth comprise the nine and eight palm-length measures.
These all correspond to the actual teachings of the sutras and tantras,
And painstaking efforts should be made [in applying them].
The [first three of these anthropometric scales] are applied, as appropriate,
To the [drawing of] tathāgatas, bodhisattvas,
Wrathful deities, and icons without consort.
The fourth is applied to the most wrathful deities [alone].
The [fifth] is the Tibetan tradition of six mid-finger span measures which emerged later.
As for the typology of the deities, they may be classified as follows:
[Icons depicting] renunciant forms without a consort, universal monarchs,
Peaceful icons without ornaments [including] hermit sages and beings of inferior class,
[Wrathful] buddhas, emanational wrathful forms, and kings among wrathful deities,
Supreme and common bodhisattvas, servants, and intermediaries.

However, among well-known contemporary [traditions],
[Including] those that identify eleven distinct iconometric scales,
All of them concur that the axial lines of Brahma are drawn first.
Then, [as for the elevenfold classification,] this comprises [Renunciant buddhas] without a consort,
And the buddha body of perfect resource,
Which are scaled at one hundred and twenty-five finger-widths;
Bodhisattvas scaled at one hundred and twenty finger-widths;
Wrathful hermit sages scaled at twelve palm-lengths;
Female consorts scaled at nine palm-lengths;
Acolytes of Yama and yakṣas scaled at eight [palm-lengths];
Ogre-like wrathful deities scaled at six, five, or three [palm-lengths];
Pious attendants and hermit buddhas who are similar in scale to human figures;
[Mundane protectors] such as Brahma, scaled at nine large units;
And human beings of the four continents,
Scaled at seven mid-finger spans in length, and eight in width.
All such measurements are said to depend
On the degree to which the vital energy of past actions is impeded.
[Icons should be depicted] with the major and minor marks,
Or they should be peaceful, amorous, wrathful, graceful,
Or expressive of the dramatic airs.
[Icons may also be adorned with] religious robes,
The eight ornaments made of precious gems,
And two kinds of silken clothes,
With [hand] gestures and
The eight or ten categories of glorious charnel ground accoutrements,
As well as the vajra, khaṭvāṅga, and so forth,
Which are foremost among the symbolic hand-held emblems.
There are seven aspects to the construction of a throne or palanquin,
[Which symbolize respectively the seven] categories of the branches of enlightenment,
While the six ornaments of the backrest symbolize
The six transcendental perfections, and so forth.
[Draftsmanship] should be without defects
In respect of long, short, thick, thin, and curving [lines], and so forth.
The basic and secondary color pigments and their shadings should then be applied
And the stylistic features should correspond to the traditions maintained in different lands.
The three-dimensional and two-dimensional celestial palaces,
The abodes in which [these icons] reside,
Are widely [constructed] in accordance with the Indestructible Garland.
But there are also other symbolic conventions and meanings,
Including [those represented by] the tradition of the Magical Net.

As for the representations of buddha speech, according to the sutras
There are sixty-four types of [ancient] script,
But Rañjanā, Vartula, and so forth are supreme
Among all the writing systems of different lands.
[In Rañjanā] it is approximately the case
That there are two calligraphic grid squares
For the head stroke and neck stroke [of each letter],
And three for the body strokes [of each letter].
Among these, the head stroke is [drawn] last.
In Tibetan calligraphy, all [writing systems] can be subsumed
Within the following six scripts:
The headed block-letter script, the headless [block-letter] script,
The headless thick and thin italic scripts,
The formal handwriting script, and the cursive shorthand script.
The block-letter scripts [evolved through] nine successive [modifications],
Including the “ancient and new styles.”
Thereafter, among the followers of Yutri, two traditions arose —
The “frog” tradition and the “popular” tradition.
There are eight [strokes] to which one should pay attention,
Ten [points of calligraphy] to be accentuated,
Twenty-one primary characteristics, sixteen secondary characteristics,
And three general characteristics that should all be applied.
As for the headless thick-stroked italic script,
There were two [original] traditions—those of Li and Den —
From which many [others] gradually evolved.
One should proficiently study the calligraphic proportions,
Writing surfaces, ink and pens;
One should cherish all major and minor [characteristics of composition],
Maintaining neatness, elegance, and accuracy.
One should write, without contravening the hierarchy [of the various scripts],
Whereby the sacred scriptures [of the Buddhas]
Are copied in the block-letter script, and so forth.
I cannot digress [to consider here] other kinds of calligraphy because they are limitless.
As for the representations of buddha mind,
There are explained to be five particular types [of stupa]:
Those that are spontaneously present by nature, those that are unsurpassed,
Those that are consecrated by blessings,
Those that arise through spiritual accomplishments,
And those that correspond to the different vehicles.

The practical techniques [of stūpa construction] that are applicable
Include those suitable for ordinary persons, pious attendants,
Hermit buddhas, and conquerors,
As described in the transmissions [of monastic discipline].
With regard to the eight stupas of the conquerors,
Although their measurements are indefinite,
The scholars of Tibet generally attest to [the method outlined in]
The [Commentary] on the Taintless [Crown Protuberance].
Accordingly, they refer to the height [of a stupa]
As sixteen large units, and the width as slightly more than half of that.
As far as the uncommon stupa of pristine cognition
Mentioned in the [Tantra of] the Wheel of Time is concerned,
When the Buddha is seated in a cross legged-posture,
The area from his navel downwards corresponds to the terraces [of the stupa];
The abdomen, to the dome plinth;
The [chest] from there as far as the shoulders, to the bulging dome;
The throat, to the high pavilion; [the face] as far as the hair ringlet,
To the face [painted] on the high pavilion;
And the [hair knot] from there upwards, to the [stacked] wheels
Of the sacred teachings and the crest [of the stupa].
These collectively and accurately correlate [in their proportions]
To the external [world], the inner [subtle body], and even to other [divine forms].
In particular, there were many [stupas of extraordinary] measurement and shape
Which existed from antiquity and are unheard of by arrogant scholars,
Such as the Stupa of Intangible Glory,
And the Naturally Arisen [Svayambhū] Stupa of Nepal.
The Nyingma tradition also speaks of the stupas of the eight virtuous abodes,
Of the dimensions and designs [of the stupas]
Corresponding to the nine sequences of the vehicle, and so forth.

The proportions and systematic presentation
Of the vajra, bell, ritual spike, tantric staff, and so forth
Are clearly set forth in the Collection of Rites, and so forth.
[The playing of] drums and cymbals, sacred masked dances, and so forth
Are all ritual activities associated with the body.
The ordinary [physical arts] comprise [the making of] residences,
Ships, clothing, ornaments, food,
Armaments — both aggressive and defensive — weapons, and so forth.
The supreme arts of speech are debate, explanation, and composition.
Innate musical sound comprises [four melodic contours]:
The sustaining note, the descending note,
The changing note, and the ascending note,
Which [are exemplified] respectively by [four metaphors]:
A wish-granting tree, a creeping flower plant,
The [changing reflections of the] moon [in water],
And the [traverse of a slow] river.[*3*]
By undertaking preliminaries that focus on three essentials,
The. six defects and five causes should be abandoned.
[Chanting] should then be undertaken in a timely manner, in six great [ceremonial contexts].
In congregations twelve distinctive [ancillary modes of chanting]
Including the lion’s roar should also be employed, as appropriate.
The common [vocal arts] include songs, flutes, and formal speeches.
The supreme arts of mind are those of study, reflection, and meditation
With regard to the eloquently expressed [teachings of the Buddha].
The common [mental arts] comprise the eighteen topics of knowledge,
As well as Sanskrit grammar, logic, and so forth.
There are also eight subjects of scrutiny
Comprising land, gems, trees, chariots, horses, elephants, treasures,
And men and women; and commonly too
There are the treatises on [human] conduct, and the sixty-four crafts,
Along with all sorts of [other] enumerations, including the four categories.

Among all the works of medical science
Which concern the physical body and its vitality,
The structure of the Glorious Great Tantra
Entitled “Essence of Nectar” is of crucial importance.
The roots [of medical science, as expounded in the Root Tantra],
Namely, physiology, diagnosis, and treatment,
Are explained in terms of the patient, the remedy,
The application of the remedy, and the practicing physician.
There are eight branches in the Instructional Tantra:
[Treatment of] the physical body [in general], pediatrics, gynecological diseases,
Demonic possession, wounds and injuries, poisoning,
Old age, and the restoration of virility and fertility.
Diseases and remedial techniques are integrated in the Subsequent [Tantra].
The patient includes [the topics of] physiology for which [treatment is prescribed]
And the diseases which are treated.
The remedy includes [the topics of] regimen, diet, medication, and external therapy.
The method of treatment includes [the topics of] the prevention of disease,
And the treatment of pathological transformations,
While the practitioner of medical science [includes the physician].
[Medical science] is subsumed in these primary and ancillary [topics].
Within physiology [the following] are determined:
The understanding of human embryology,
Based on primary and secondary causes,
And the indications [of parturition],
As well as the understanding [of human anatomy] in metaphorical terms,
And the natural condition of the bodily constituents,
The channels, the vulnerable points,
And the passageways and orifices,
Along with the defining characteristics [of the elements]
Which may be subject to harm,
And [the humors] which may be harmful,
As well as the physical activities, distinctions,
And signs of physical decay.

With regard to diseases, the remote and immediate primary causes
Are [respectively] the three poisons and the three humors.
While the secondary causes that aggravate [the basis of disease]
Include the activity fields of the senses
As well as their gathering, arising, and [fully manifest] arising.
The characteristics [of humoral imbalance],
Which has its inception in the six pathways,
Are excess, deficiency, and [mutual] aggravation.
[Diseases] are then classified on the basis of their primary causes,
The [sex or age of] the patient, and their [four] aspects.
Regimen comprises continuous [daily] regimen, seasonal regimen, and occasional regimen.
Dietetics includes [knowledge of] the [diverse] types [of food and beverages],
As well as dietary restrictions and moderation in the quantity of food.
Medication includes taste, potency, post-digestive taste, and compounding methods.
External therapy includes [the application of] mild, rough, and rigorous [treatments],
Along with the [appropriate] surgical instruments.
[Prophylactics] maintain [the body] in good health, free from disease,
And prolong [the life] of the aged, free from disease.
[Understanding] the primary causes and characteristic [symptoms] of disease,
And relying on [familiarity with] the advantages and disadvantage [of certain remedies],
[The physician] should [also] undertake diagnosis through subterfuge
And through the four alternative parameters,
On the basis of which [treatment] is to be abandoned or prescribed.
Treatment should then be administered
According to general, specific, and special [therapeutic] principles.
Both the common and special methods of treatment should be mastered.
Physicians should be endowed with the six primary attributes.
They should be supreme [in all their other qualities],
And masters of [medical and spiritual] practices.
[Thus,] they themselves and others will enjoy
The results of immediate happiness and long-term well-being.

Among the [subjects] known as the five minor sciences,
Astrology discloses things to be adopted or rejected
From the perspective of relative appearances.
The gross apparitional forms of reality or emptiness
Underlie the astrological calculations to be made,
While the techniques of astrological calculation
Are mathematical computations of interdependence or correlation.
The stepping of the planets derives from the breath within the central channel,
But at the end of the four ages, they will enter a state of vacuity.
The precision of time arises through repeated scrutiny.
The inner [world] qualitatively manifested as the [phenomena of] the external world,
Among which the solar mansions and constellations Which [the planets] traverse took form;
And die planetary bodies that traverse them [also] arose.
The Sun marks out its [anti-clockwise] longitude through the solar mansions,
While the four [terrestrial] seasons rotate in a clockwise manner.
The solar mansions of the constellations and the zodiac,
Dependent on the motion of the wind element,
Also rotate clockwise in the course of each solar day,
While the planets demarcate celestial [longitude], through their respective motions.
Rāhu encounters the Sun and the Moon
In the interval which follows the passing of three “seasons.”
The zodiacal, calendar, and solar days then emerged,
Dependent on the epicycles of the Sun, Moon, and the wind element.
[The Sun and the planets in a single solar day] rotate along the zodiac,
[Divided] according to three “periods” of time, four “junctures, ”
Eight “watches, ” twelve “[ascendant] conjunctions,”
Thirty “hours, ” twenty-one thousand six hundred “breaths, ”
Three thousand six hundred “intervals” of time,
Or sixty “clepsydra measures” of time.
Through the five aspects [of astrological calculation] —
Weekdays, lunar days, constellations, combined calculations, and impacts —
The longitude of the five planets and of Rāhu
As well as the conjunctions and [other] aspects should be examined.
Elective prediction and other minor calculations should also be studied.

There are common understandings concerning merely the happiness of this life
And there are philosophically inclined persons, endowed with a spiritual path.
There are many views, authentic and inauthentic.
For every hundred lower [views] there is but a single higher view,
But when they are [all] subsumed, they comprise
The outer [non-Buddhist] and inner [Buddhist perspectives].
The non-Buddhists are designated as “extremists. ”
[Extremists] are of three sorts:
Nominal, emanational, and independently established.
The last of these include meditators
Who possess the fivefold supernormal cognitive powers.
The basic [divisions] of the dialecticians
Are the eternalist and nihilist schools.
Among them, [the latter] are the materialists
Who hold that life forms are of three types —
Discernable, indiscernible, and animistic.
They espouse nihilism, denying the existence of unseen causes,
And they refute the existence of past and future lives,
Along with [the impact of] past actions, and so forth,
For which reasons they cannot attain even the higher realms [of gods and humans].
The oldest of all the eternalist schools is the Sāṃkhya,
Who through three modes of valid cognition
Appraise the twenty-five aspects of reality.
In particular, they hold that the “self,”
Endowed with five [characteristics],
Relates to the fundamental state of “nature, ”
[Identified with] primal matter in which the three attributes
Are in a state of equilibrium,
And from which evolves the “[great] intelligence”
From that in turn the ego principle evolves,
Along with the five aspects of subtle matter,
The motor organs, the sense organs, and the mind.
As they unfold in series, they give rise to cyclic existence,
But if these modifications are reversed,
The “self” will attain release.

The Vaiśeṣika are followers of Īśvara
Who hold that within substance and its attributes
All subtypes are subsumed,
And they propound the six categories [of reality]
While being similar to the Naiyāyika In maintaining four kinds of valid cognition,
Eight aspects of radiant form, and so forth.
There are also the Vaiṣṇava, originating from the ten incarnations [of Viṣṇu],
The Brāhmaṇa, who uphold valid cognition that accords with the Vedas,
The Aupaniṣadika, who [regard] the underworld and “soul” in a single savor,
And the Vaiyākaraṇa, who [regard] all things as embodiments of sound.
There are the followers of Jaiminī,
Who maintain twelve defining characteristics and so forth,
The followers of Caraka, who maintain there are eight kinds of valid cognition,
And the Nirgrantha Jains, who propound the ten objects of knowledge and so forth.
All of these are merely on the path to the exalted realms,
But they are to be rejected
Because [the attainment of] release [from the cycle of existence]
Is obscured by their views of the “self. ”
There are also barbarians,
Who claim harmful or violent acts as their sacred teaching,
Including those in Tibet and China,

The god [realms] and the [worlds of] Brahma
Are within [reach of] the exalted vehicle.
Among the three kinds of faith,
Which are the prerequisites[*4*] of all [spiritual paths],
It is through the conviction that [the impact of] past actions Is of primary importance, and so forth,
And through the four correct ways of progressing [on the path],
That the ten non-virtuous actions are abandoned,
While the ten virtuous actions and their peripheral acts are adopted.
In this way, laws are maintained concerning [conduct] to be rejected and accepted,
While confused [virtuous and non-virtuous actions]
And disharmonious [goals] are abandoned.
Those who perfect the path of [virtuous] actions
And are disciplined [in respect of their vows]
Will, in the higher reams, attain excellent results,
Mastering the ripening fruits that conform to their causes.
The vehicle of Brahma is that which traverses the higher world systems.
The four meditative concentrations associated with the world-system of form
Have both causal and fruitional phases.
In the causal phase [of the first meditative concentration],
Preparation entails the meditative stability of calm abiding,
In which physical and mental refinement occurs,
By means of the nine techniques [for settling the mind],
Namely, placement, perpetual placement, integrated placement, intensified placement,
Control, calmness, quiescence, one-pointedness, and meditative equipoise.
Having accomplished [calm abiding],
Then, through the six kinds of attention —
Namely, defining characteristics, resolve, isolation,
Encompassing joy, scrutiny, and perfected application,
One will accomplish the higher insight,
Of attention to the fruit of perfected application.
These coarse and quiescent aspects [of higher insight] constitute the common mundane path.
The actual foundation of the first meditative concentration has five aspects:
Ideation, scrutiny, joy, bliss, and one-pointed mind.

Those for whom the first [meditative concentration]
Is defective and the second without defect
Then [focus on the causal phase of the second meditative concentration].
Here, the extraordinary preparation entails [cultivation of]
The attention that is aware of individual characteristics [and so forth].
The actual foundation [of this second meditative concentration]
Has four aspects, starting with intense inner clarity.
Similarly, the third [meditative concentration] will ensue
When preparation entails progressive scrutiny,
By means of the higher insight endowed with attention.
[Its actual foundation] has five aspects, starting with recollection.
Then, [the actual foundation of] the fourth [meditative concentration]
Has four aspects, purified of the eight defects.
In this way, the results will be greater, mediocre, or lesser,
Corresponding to the actual foundation of each [meditative concentration].
The ripening fruit appropriate for each of these states and so forth will be experienced.
The four meditative absorptions
Associated with the world-system of formlessness
Also have both causal and fruitional phases.
One whose mind has obtained the fourth meditative concentration
And has not relapsed
After inhibiting [the world system of] form,
And its [interactions] of contact, vision, and perception,
Should conclusively perfect the summit of existence
Through the meditative absorptions
Which experience infinite space and consciousness,
Where there is nothing-at-all to be grasped,
And where there is neither perception, coarse or subtle,
Nor is there non-perception.
The results are particularly sublime,
On account of their meditative stability, life span, and so forth.
This basis of enlightened attributes,
Including the [four] immeasurable aspirations,
The [five] supernormal cognitive powers, and so forth
Is the supreme objective to be striven after by both non-Buddhists
And [by followers of] the Lesser Vehicle.
This is a prerequisite for those who would progressively embark
Upon the vehicle of the Conquerors.

The substratum consciousness, unobscured and unspecified,

Propensities [are analyzed] according to the ground in which they are distributed,
Their distributors, the distribution process, and their actual content.
The stable continuum [of the substratum], though not clearly [cognized],
Is that in which [propensities] have the capacity to be distributed,
Because it is concurrent with the [other modes of consciousness]
Which are their [actual] distributors.
Seven modes [of consciousness] and their peripheral supports
Are the actual distributors [of these propensities].
Even though [propensities] may have ceased,
They still have the capacity to generate their results.
The distributed [propensities] include those of the causal type,
Which are similar in class [to the original mental phenomena],
And those that are maturational,
And therefore capable of generating other [mental phenomena].
The six kinds of seed comprise those that are external and internal,
[The two] that are invisible, and those that are relative and absolute.
They abide through their [association with] five natural properties.
Though they are localized by whatever localizes them,
They remain unspecified and cannot be described
As identical in substance, or different.
They become localized by regenerating their own habitat,
And by generating [impulses] that did not previously exist.

The eighteen sensory bases which support the seeds [of everything]

Those that are not subsumed in the psycho-physical aggregates,

Which are all subsumed within [the category of] form.
Feelings, perceptions, and formative predispositions
Are subsumed within [the category of mental] phenomena,

They are all objects of the mental faculty.
As for the aggregate of consciousness, it is designated as
The “seven sensory bases of consciousness,”

Along with the dissonant mental [consciousness],
And these are all subsumed within [the category of] mind.
The unconditioned sensory bases
Without causes and conditions, and without agglomeration,
Are included within one part of the sensory base of mental phenomena
That is not subsumed in the psycho-physical aggregates.
These comprise the three aspects of reality, space, the two aspects of cessation,
The immovable state, and the cessation of feeling and perception.

Moreover, the five foundational factors

Appearances are universal indicating states or objects,

And those that are projected, such as the imputed self.
Names are verbally designated universals,

Things imputed by verbal expression and false imagination are imaginary.
These comprise three categories: the imaginary nature of delimited characteristics,
Exemplified by the concept of individual selfhood;
The nominal imaginary,
Exemplified by the dualistic appearances of the subject-object dichotomy;
And the referentially imputed imaginary.
Or, alternatively, there are ten aspects.
The dependent nature is assigned to apperception alone,
Which arises through causes and conditions.
It has two categories: one comprising the seeds of all dissonant mental states
And the other in which neither dissonant nor purified mental states inherently exist.
Or, alternatively, there are six aspects.
The consummate nature is the ultimate actual reality — the absolute reality.
The [consummate] nature has four aspects:
For it is naturally pure, it is free from adventitious stains,
It is the pristine cognition of the spiritual path,
And it is the objective of the scriptures.
In particular, [the three natures] may also be explained
In terms of the ten aspects of distracting false imagination,
The eleven aspects of apperception,
The nine aspects of the consummate nature, and so forth;
But because the apparitional aspect of dependent nature
Partakes of bewildered imagination,
The [three] natures that have been differentiated
May also be subsumed in two.
Respectively, [these three natures are identified] as the emptiness of non-existence,
The emptiness of existence,
And the emptiness of the natural [reality].
When demonstrations [of these three natures] are introduced,
The imaginary is the apparitional aspect,
The dependent is the union of radiance and awareness,
And the consummate is free from conceptual elaboration.

The first two [of these three natures] are dependently originated.
[In the case of the dependent nature,]
This [process] is endowed with generative or causal
And generated or fruitional aspects,
And [in the case of the imaginary nature]
It is endowed with interrelated determinative and determined aspects.
However, it is the genuine dependent origination
[That determines] the substratum consciousness.
The essential nature [of dependent origination]
Is that it occurs only with regard to appearances,
And it arises contingent on them.
The etymology implies “origination
Dependent on a complex of causes and conditions.”
The literal meanings include “without an agent, ”
“Endowed with causal basis, ” and so forth.
Fundamental ignorance, the opposite of awareness,
Is endowed with three attributes.
Although it has many classifications,
It comprises both [ignorance] endowed with dissonant mental states
And [ignorance] devoid of dissonant mental states.
Fundamental [ignorance] is within the periphery
Of the dissonant mental consciousness,
Deluded with respect to [its imputation of] a self.
Formative predispositions include those associated with meritorious past actions,
Those associated with non-meritorious past actions,
And those associated with past actions that do not transcend [cyclic existence].
The substratum consciousness, along with its propensities,
Includes both causal and fruitional aspects.
[Name and form] comprise the four [aggregates endowed with] names,
Along with physical form in its five stages of embryonic and fetal development;
While the sensory activity fields essentially demarcate the six sense organs.

Sensory contact, which [fully manifests] after birth,
Is an interaction of sense objects, sense organs, and consciousness.
The sensations dependent on that are attachment, aversion, and neutrality.
[Consequently] there is craving desirous [of rebirth]
And craving that grasps after perishable things.
Through grasping after desires, rebirth, erroneous views,
And belief in [an inherently existing] self,
[The rebirth process] is endowed with the potent function
Of implementing reincarnation.
Reaching the moment of conception, birth is obtained,
And commencing from then,
There is a continuous series of indivisible time moments,
Leading to the obstruction of the life essence, aging, and death.
The functions [of the twelve links]
Are respectively to obscure the truth,
To plant seeds, to direct towards [birth],
To offer complete support [to the body],
To perfect it, to delimit [its sense objects],
To partake of [happiness], to acquire [rebirth],
To conjoin [with birth], to propel towards [birth],
[To engender] suffering, and to transform [age].
The detailed analysis [of dependent origination] comprises
A threefold [analysis], an eightfold [analysis],
And a detailed exegesis according to the [twelve] links.
Among the aspects of the threefold analysis,
[The dependent origination] that distinguishes the essential nature
Refers to the emanation of all phenomena from the substratum,
And this is said to be [understood] only by those of highest acumen.
[The dependent origination] that distinguishes attractive and unattractive [goals]
Is said to be [understood] by pious attendants and hermit buddhas.
It has two aspects, referring to dissonant mental states and purification.
[Here] the verb “distinguishes” is understood To mean augments and “magnifies.”
[The dependent origination] associated with sensory engagement
Refers to the process that generates and obstructs the six modes [of consciousness],
Which pious attendants then control by means of selflessness.

The eightfold [analysis of dependent origination]
Comprises six aspects that are all within the range of dissonant mental states,
Namely, [the arising of] consciousness;
The arising of birth and death;
The external [dependent origination] of seeds, shoots, stems, and so forth;
The extensive analysis of the physical environment,
Which [appears to undergo] creation, duration and destruction;
Sustenance by means of the four types of nourishment;
And [the distinguishing of] living beings
According to desirable and undesirable [realms of rebirth].
Release [from cyclic existence] contingent on the five [spiritual] paths,
Which is well distinguished by means of purity,
And the attainment of the six supernormal cognitive powers,
Which is well-distinguished by means of [spiritual] power:
These are the [two] aspects within the range of purification.
[All eight aspects] are [established] with reference to
The generated and generative [modes of dependent origination].
As for the detailed [exegesis of] the twelve links,
This includes the circumstantial [dependent origination].
[Accordingly,] when [one cycle] is completed
Over two lifetimes within the world-system of desire,
There are five links that are projected
By means of the two [preceding] projective [links],
And there are three links that are formed By means of the two formative [links].
A single sequence of the causal and fruitional processes [of dependent origination]
[Is completed] in these four projective and formative phases,
And it is said that these can therefore be known
[To resemble] the planting and nurturing of seeds.
Then, when two links are each associated
With the limits of the [immediately] past and future [lives],
And eight are associated with limits of the [present] intervening [life],
Two causal and fruitional cycles [of dependent origination]
[Are completed] over three lifetimes
Within the [world system] of desire, and so forth.
This is extensively revealed in order to reverse the three aspects of delusion.
There is also [a process whereby] the [cycle of dependent origination]
Will be completed in a single lifetime,
Experiencing [the fruits] of presently perceptible phenomena.
With regard to the instantaneous completion [of the cycle],
Consequent on the completion of a [specific] deed,
As in the case of murder,
This implies a dependent origination of that [instantaneous type].

With regard to the interconnected [dependent origination]
According to the Analysis of the Middle and Extremes,
Birth is conjoined with aging and death.
Consequently, there are [only] eleven links.
Then, in terms of the three categories of dissonant mental states,
Fundamental ignorance, craving, and grasping are subsumed
As [dissonant mental states] arising from dissonant mental states;
Formative predispositions and the rebirth process[*2*] are subsumed
As [dissonant mental states] arising from past actions;
While the remaining [seven] are subsumed
As dissonant mental states arising from the birth of suffering.
These [twelve links] may also be subsumed Into two categories, in which case
The first five are [designated as]
Causal dissonant mental states arising from past actions,
While the last seven are [designated as] fruitional.
[Dependent origination] may also be presented
According to seven causes of the projective and formative phases,
And these [are said to be] completed over two lifetimes.
Vasubandhupāda has explained,
With reference to the fourfold process of projection and formation,
That this is analyzed according to the following seven aspects:
The projector, the projection process, and the projected,
The former, the formation process, and the formed,
Along with their disadvantages.
The arising and cessation of substantial things
Through uncreated and impermanent seeds
Which are endowed with potency
Accords with the understanding of dependent origination.
Phenomena, just as they appear, are relative.
Their actual reality is merely designated
As the dependent origination of ultimate [truth].
This [point] is extremely subtle.
[Dependent origination] is hard to understand
On account of the profundity of its causal basis,
Defining characteristic, arising, duration, and functioning,
And on account of its five ostensible contradictions.
All phenomena are merely dependently originated and without self.
The real nature of internal [phenomena] is apperception, devoid of self.
Regarding this [mere apperception],
Although it does not primordially exist, it does appear,
Without contradiction,
In the manner of consciousness that is tainted by sleep.
This is the real nature devoid of inherent existence,
The pristine cognition of inner radiance
That transcends the objects of dependent origination,
Because it is liberated from the mutual interdependence
Of determined and determinative aspects.

The three yānas of Buddhism were expounded by the Victor.
The four philosophical tenet systems are the outcome of the fnal view [reached] by individuals through their own intellectual processes.
The Hīnayāna consists of the Shrāvaka[yāna] and the Pratyekabuddha[yāna].
Shrāvakas attend others and proclaim what they have heard.
The entryway [for shrāvakas] is the four truths of sufering, its origins, its cessation, and the path, with their sixteen aspects of the acceptance of phenomena, knowledge of phenomena, subsequent acceptance, and subsequent knowledge.
In terms of their essence, [the four truths are] the continuity of the aggregates produced by previous karma and mental afictions; the karma and mental afictions forming the causes for what will be appropriated in the future; the relinquishment that has destroyed what is to be eliminated by means of the remedies; and primordial wisdom, which has the power to relinquish and attain.
[The four truths] are characterized by being in agreement with [the Buddha’s] teachings.
Their numbers — in two sets of causes and results—and their sequence are defnite.
They are what is to be understood, abandoned, attained, and relied upon.
In terms of their essence, each is undeceiving; thus they are said to be truths.
The nine levels within the three realms (which are the places where beings take birth) and the beings who take birth there are of the nature of the truth of sufering.
In terms of their nature, [suferings] can be condensed into eight, six, three, or two [categories].
The truth of the origins of sufering consists of the mental afictions and defled karma.
Subtle proliferators, observed objects, and incorrect mental engagement are the causes.
[The afictive causes of sufering] are mental events characterized by a pronounced lack of tranquility.
The motivating forces are the root mental afictions, the secondary ones, and the views.
[They create] actions that are intentions and the physical and verbal actions produced by those.
[Karma is] unmeritorious, meritorious, or stable.
It is in terms of its impetus and completion; speed; performance and storage; strength; mode of appearance; and being similar or not that [karma] causes [beings] to take rebirth in the three realms.

The attainment of separation brought about by the path is cessation, thusness.
Vaibhāhikas and Sautrāntikas [respectively] assert it to be a nonimplicative negation that is substantially established or that is not so established.
The nature [of cessation] is [described by its] twelve aspects: its characteristics, profundity, and so forth.
The path is that which, once embarked upon, takes you to your goal.
It comprises the fve paths: accumulation, junction, seeing, meditation, and beyond training.
[Sufering is] impermanent, sufering, empty, and without a self-entity.
[The origins of sufering are] causes, origins, strong producers, and conditions.
[Cessation is] cessation, peace, goodness, and defnitive release.
[The path is] a path, suitable, efective, and what brings defnite release.
The vows, that which are to be guarded, are the discipline of individual liberation, [motivated by the wish for] defnitive release.
The view is primarily the realization of the absence of a self of persons.
Nirvāa is a nonarising, unconditioned phenomenon.
Vaibhāhikas assert that it is an implicative negation and Sautrāntikas that it is a nonimplicative negation.
[Nirvāa] with remainder [is divided into] eighty-nine conditioned and unconditioned [results], or into four results; [nirvāa] without remainder is the severing of continuity.
[The Shrāvakayana’s] philosophical tenet systems are either Vaibhāhika or Sautrāntika.
They agree in not accepting the teachings of the Mahāyāna scriptures.
They reject a permanent, single self and state that karma is the creator.
Observed objects either increase deflements or do not.
Thus conditioned phenomena are defled phenomena; and the phenomena of the truth of the path and unconditioned phenomena are undefled phenomena.
[Conventional reality] is whatever halts its perceiver when it is destroyed or eliminated.
[Gross] entities and continuities are conventionally existent and ultimately do not perform functions.
Partless particles and instants of mind, which do not so halt, are ultimately existent and perform functions.

They agree for the most part about the way conditioned phenomena arise and about the paths and results.
Points of dissimilarity are that the Vaibhāhikas assert that the seven [abhidharma] texts are [the Buddha’s] words; that there are partless, discrete particles with interstices between them; that when of similar types, [such particles] perform the same activity, and that they are like [grasses in] a meadow; that sense faculties see referents, and consciousnesses apprehend those [referents]; and that in most cases, percepts and perceivers, as causes and results, arise simultaneously.
[Vaibhāhikas] maintain that the fve bases, [the phenomena of] the three times, and nirvāa exist substantially; that unconditioned phenomena are permanent, and the truth of cessation is an entity; that consciousnesses are aware of what is other; and other points.
The basis [of their system] was delineated by the four great ones and others in reliance upon scriptures.
Dārhāntikas mostly state the opposite of that.
Particles touch but do not join, like [the pages of] a book.
The sense faculties are matter; external referents are hidden phenomena.
The consciousnesses do not see these: they experience images as their referents.
Forms, mind, feelings, discriminations, and intentions exist substantially.
Everything else is imputedly existent; space and the others are nonimplicative negations.
They assert that [consciousness is both] a refexive-awareness and an other-awareness; that [the phenomena of] the three times are imputed entities; and other points.
This is [the system] asserted by Sagharakhita, Shrīlāta, and others.
The main orders are the four: Sarvāstivādins, Mahāsāghikas, Sthaviras, and Samitīyas.
The divisions into fve, seven, three, and three [result in] the eighteen [orders].
They are grouped into propounders of a self and propounders of an absence of a self.
[Shrāvakas] are fawed in their refutation of the Mahāyāna and in their assertion that [ultimate] reality is established.
On other [topics] they are not wrong; it is their own system.
Having meditated on the sixteen aspects, one progresses through the fve paths by applying the factors for awakening, and attains the four types of results.

Approachers to [the result of] a stream enterer may not have abandoned any of the desire realm afictions, or they may have abandoned the fourth or ffth, but to have abandoned the sixth is not possible.
They abide in one of the fifteen moments, and are of two types: followers of faith and followers of the dharma.
Abiders in the result have attained the realization of the sixteenth moment.

Those who abandon the ninth [afiction] abide in the result. They may go to the form realm, where they pass beyond [misery] in the bardo, after birth, or [after] rising to a higher state; they may go to the formless realm; they may [attain] peace in this lifetime; or they may physically actualize
[nirvāa].
They approach the level of an arhat in order to abandon the ninth afiction of the [Pinnacle of]
Existence.
With the abandonment of that [ninth afiction], they are liberated from the bonds of the three realms and abide in the result.
[This result] is classifed as those with twofold liberation and those liberated by wisdom; those with the ornaments of the supercognitive abilities of magical powers and those without ornaments;
and those with a remainder of the appropriating aggregates and those without remainder.
Of the four pairs of beings, or the eight types of individuals, the frst and last have the instantaneous type and the middle two have skippers.

Swift pratyekabuddhas are released in three existences, and the rhinoceros[-like take] one hundred aeons; they all give rise to [some qualities that] are strong, some that are weak, and others profound.
The meaning of the term is that they awaken on their own without relying on others.
Their entryway is to take external causes and results as analogies for the forward and reverse sequences of internal dependent origination.
Sasāra and nirvāa both have two modes: forward and reverse.
Their vows are those of individual liberation.
They realize the absence of a self of persons and that perceived referents have no nature.
Those of higher acumen in their fnal phase of cyclic existence take rebirth on the basis of three aspirations.
They become fully ordained monastics and rely upon the special and fnal fourth [meditative concentration].
By meditating on the sixteen aspects [of the four truths], on one seat, they proceed from the heat of the path of junction to the attainment of an arhat.
The lesser congregating practitioners are of lower acumen, the greater congregating practitioners are of intermediate acumen.
They take two lifetimes, and bring [the doors of] liberation to mind.
They teach the dharma by means of silent physical communications.

[Mahāyāna practitioners] realize both absences of self-entity; their intention and practice accord with the pāramitās.
They abandon the two obscurations, and do not abide in the extremes of existence or peace.
[The Mahāyāna] possesses seven greatnesses.
This is the Mahāyāna, [which leads practitioners to] buddhahood through its cause-based philosophical [path].
People who make this journey are highly intelligent; their acumen is at one of three levels.
Following the generation of bodhichitta, their undertaking is to train in the six pāramitās.
We should understand these in terms of their essential qualities; characteristics; etymologies;
divisions and summaries; pure forms; most important types; distinctiveness; ways of training;
results; numerical defnitiveness; and order.
The actual practice is frst to cultivate shamatha, which is one-pointed concentration, and then vipashyanā, which is the discernment of phenomena.
[The Pāramitāyāna’s] systems of philosophical tenets are either Chittamātra or Madhyamaka.
Chittamātras state that consciousness is truly existent.
They condense the entire Mahāyāna path into seven bases.
The source of knowable objects is the ālaya consciousness.
As for the three characteristics: the dependent characteristic arises from that [ālaya consciousness].
It is the imagination of what is unreal, appearing through the force of habitual tendencies.
It does not remain for an instant and is governed by what precedes it.
On top of that substantially existent basis for designations, a self, “mine,” and so forth are mistakenly imagined.
[The consummate is] the unconditioned, empty of the object of negation: imputed existence.
It is nonconceptual cognition, empty of duality, ultimately existent.
The practical engagement of those [three characteristics involves] three [determinations] free from discouragement; four abandonments; devoted interest; knowing the absence of any reference;
abandoning imagination; and seeing correctly.
In this way, [bodhisattvas] enter the bhūmis of engagement through belief, seeing, meditation,
and completion.
The cause and result of that [engagement] are contained within the conduct of the six pāramitās.
The gradual progression is the unfolding of the modes of the ten bhūmis.
The trainings are the three types of higher trainings.
The results are the excellences of relinquishment and primordial wisdom.

The root of their assertions is that other than being mere cognition, external referents do not have even the slightest existence, like dreams.
They hold [one of] two positions: [frst,] Proponents of Real Images assert that appearances are real in being the mind, which is the perceived object.
[Some state that both] cognition and [its] images are real in being refexive parts.
[Others say that] the number of perceiving cognizers corresponds to the number of perceived images.
[Some] say that even though there are various appearances, the entity [of cognition] is not a plurality.
Proponents of False Images assert that, like [the foaters seen] by the visually impaired,
appearances are nonexistents vividly appearing, unreal and false; only cognition empty of duality is real.
Since [some] assert that appearances taint cognition and [some] do not, and [some] say that there are dualistic appearances on the bhūmi of buddhahood and [others] say there are not, there are the two divisions of Staining and Non-Staining.
This is the system of fve hundred past masters and others.
All the fawed [assertions] of Realists are refuted by the texts of the noble [Nāgārjuna].
Being free from extremes, Madhyamaka is the best philosophical tenet system.
Its entryway is the two truths.
[Mādhyamikas engage] conventional reality knowing that from the perspective of no analysis,
[things]
appear and yet do not truly exist; and they conduct themselves properly with regard to what is to be adopted and rejected.
They encounter ultimate [reality] by knowing that there is nothing to adopt or reject, block or encourage, in anything — the very [moment] things simply appear, they are empty.
This [approach] integrates the two stores. what are to be guarded are the bodhisattva vows.
What is realized is that, on the conventional [level], phenomena appear while not existing, like the moon’s refection in water; but, ultimately, all elaborations and characteristics subside.
They realize the two truths unerringly.
The result is peace, the manifestation of the two kāyas.
Although Madhyamaka is classifed in many ways, its two main divisions are Sūtra-Madhyamaka and
Mantra-Madhyamaka.
The Sūtra system comprises [the teachings of] the Proponents of the
Absence of a Nature and the Yogāchāras, which correspond [respectively] to such terms as
“ordinary”
and “preeminent,” or “broad” and “subtle.”
In Tibet, they are known as Rangtong and Shentong.

The first has two [subschools:] the Svātantrika and Prāsagika.
Their common [approach] is to use reasonings to refute the two self-entities: of persons (the source of views) and of phenomena (the root of obscurations).
The object to be negated is something imputed to a subject.
Probanda are either facts or conventions.
Reasons analyze four points: cause, result, both of those, and nature.
These four forms of analysis eliminate the Realists’ extreme of existence.
The reason of dependent origination, [used in] the analysis of mere appearances, eliminates both extremes.
Thus [Svātantrikas and Prāsagikas] do not disagree about the ultimate.
They difer over many issues: conventional [reality], statements in debate, and other points.
Among those who commented on the thought of Nāgārjuna,
Bhāvaviveka and his followers accept positions of their own, such as emptiness, and formulate reasons in which the three modes are established through the power of [their relationship to real]
things.
They concur with Sautrāntikas about outer objects.
Shāntarakhita and others only assert mere consciousness, not outer referents; in this presentation they are like Chittamātras.
Conventional [reality] is that, from the perspective of a deluded state of mind, phenomena exist.
Ultimate [reality] is that, from the perspective of an undeluded mind, there is no such existence.
The two truths are defned as either what can be negated by reasonings or what cannot be so negated.
They are one in essence but diferent isolates.
Conventional [reality] is presented as correct or mistaken according to whether something is able to perform a function or not.
They prove a nonimplicative negation that is an exclusion: it [simply] refutes real entities.
The refutation of arising and so forth is the nominal ultimate.
The pacifcation of elaborations is the fnal ultimate.
They do not assert an ālaya, thus consciousness has six modes.
They say that fruition is the illusionlike appearances of primordial wisdom.
For eradicating conceptually elaborated characteristics,
Chandrakīrti’s system is exceptional and preeminent; it does not use independently [verifable]
reasons.
His own system is free from assertions except [for what is done] simply for others.

[This system uses] negations and affirmations that employ four valid means of cognition — direct perception, inference, scriptural authority, and analogical proof, which are commonly acknowledged in the world; and four types of reasons—inferences based on what is commonly acknowledged by others,
consequences that expose contradictions, comparable applications of [the opponent’s] reasons,
and
[the demonstration of] the irrelevance [of proofs that are equivalent to the probandum].
A mind that discerns conventions is necessarily a mistaken cognition.
Correct and mistaken conventional [realities] are equal in their performance and nonperformance of functions.
The presentation of the two truths is determined by the presence of delusion and its absence.
In sum, this is the fnal exegesis of the Collection of Reasonings.
Scholars say, “In the system of the noble father and son, which serves as the model for all
[Madhyamaka] texts, the fundamental topic of profound emptiness is explained in terms of the three phases.”
The ground, the sphere of conduct, and the result are presented in accord with conventional expressions from a perspective of no analysis.
The absence of self-entity and the ultimate are presented from the perspective of slight analysis.
Superb analysis is the pacifcation of all conceptual elaborations.
It is taught that worldly conventional [reality] is the method and ultimate reality is what develops from that method.
For conventionality, [Prāsagikas] cite what is commonly acknowledged by others in the world.
In terms of the ultimate, [Prāsagikas] use fve types of reasons to prove the absence of a self-entity of phenomena and a sevenfold reasoning to prove the absence of a self of persons.
The actual ultimate is beyond the intellect; elaborations do not apply to it.
Cutting through elaborations, such as eliminating the eight extremes, is [itself] simply a convention.
A thesis is [the creation of] the intellect; the intellect is conventional.
Therefore, there are no independently [verifable] theses or assertions.
Even nonarising and so forth are not a thesis, because they [simply] banish fxation to never-existent entities.
It is taught that once [reifcation] is overturned, clinging to nonentities must be renounced.
The [Prāsagika] philosophical system emphasizes abiding in unborn peace, free from elaborations;
this involves no mode of apprehension.

The unification of method and wisdom is gradually developed during the ten bhūmis [when]
primordial wisdom directly realizes [dharmatā].
[Primordial wisdom] is divided during subsequent attainment in that it is the support.
[The result] is asserted to be the unity of the two kāyas.
What is logically imputed is rejected: entities are simply names.
Conditioned phenomena are deceptive; nirvāa is not.
Taking things to be real and what that produces is the afictive obscuration, the root of cyclic existence.
Because the three yānas’ ways of seeing are similar, their paths of seeing are the same.
Since [from the perspective of buddhas] knowable objects have subsided, buddhas are simply appearances for others.
These are the main features of this philosophical tenet system.
Maitreya’s thought was explained by Asaga and his brother.
The two systems of Yogāchāra and Certainty about the Ultimate do not difer in terms of the essence of their views.
However, in the system of the frst Dharma Treatises there are three yānas [ultimately]; whereas the view of the Highest Continuum is that there is one yāna ultimately, a bhūmi with the habitual tendencies of ignorance, and birth through undefled karma.
These are ways for the common [disciples] to cut through conceptual elaborations and the uncommon
[to become certain] about the ultimate.
First, imagination of what is unreal exists conventionally.
Percept and perceiver are simply imputed by mind and do not exist.
Primordial wisdom, free from conceptual elaborations, [exists] in the sense that it is the dharmatā
of that [consciousness]; and within that [dharmatā], adventitious, removable stains exist.
Conventional [phenomena] are simply delusive appearances, empty of any nature.
Dharmatā is unchanging, not empty of a nature.
The imagined is nonexistent; the dependent exists conventionally.
The consummate does not exist conventionally but does exist ultimately.
These three [characteristics] are imputedly existent, substantially existent, and existent without conceptual elaborations.
They are the emptiness of the nonexistent, the emptiness of the existent, and the ultimate emptiness.
They are the inherent absence of characteristics, the inherent absence of arising, and the ultimate inherent absence.

Consequently, [Shentong Proponents] assert that all knowable objects are pervaded by emptiness.
They state that the consummate, in terms of its own nature, is not connected to conventional phenomena; it precludes the triad of defnition, defniendum, and illustration; it is free from conceptual elaborations, permanent, partless, and omnipresent.
Their presentations of all other [topics] accord with the Chittamātra.
The Proponents of False Images state that the entity of consciousness truly exists and that it is an object of mind. This [Shentong system] asserts that primordial wisdom truly exists; and yet,
because it is not a conditioned phenomenon, [their assertions about] the ultimate are free from the mistakes of the Realists.
The Rangtong and Shentong [systems] do not difer over the way that conventional [phenomena] are empty, nor do they disagree that the extremes of conceptual elaborations cease during meditative equipoise.
They difer over whether, as a convention, dharmatā exists during subsequent attainment or not,
and over whether primordial wisdom is truly established at the end of analysis or not.
[The Shentong system] asserts that [if] ultimate reality were simply a nonimplicative negation,
whereby its nature is not established, it would be an inanimate emptiness.
[Shentong Proponents] present [ultimate reality] as being primordial wisdom empty of dualism, as being refexive awareness.
This is asserted to be the profound view linking the Sūtra and Mantra [systems].

Most Tibetan teachers say, “This system is Chittamātra,” and regard Maitreya’s texts and Asaga and his brother as inferior.
The sun and moon that ornament the sky of the Sage’s teachings are the scriptural traditions of the two chariot[-systems].
The judicious thing is to give up fxed positions in which one repeatedly echoes the constellation[-like] minor texts, and engage [these two systems] in an equal way.
The Madhyamaka of the profound Mantra [approach] is the basic state of all phenomena.
It is natural luminosity distinguished by great bliss; it is primordial wisdom, the union of clarity and emptiness, bliss and emptiness.
This is taught clearly in the Five Stages, Commentaries by Bodhisattvas, and other texts.
As its ground, [Madhyamaka] does not denigrate conventionalities just as they appear, and it is free from conceptually elaborated extremes regarding the abiding nature.
Its path is to relinquish the apprehension of characteristics through profound wisdom, and to amass merit for the sake of others out of compassion.
Its result is the perfection of the dharmakāya, a state of peace, and that the form kāyas nonconceptually beneft others.
These [three points] contain all that is taught in Madhyamaka.

[Here is presented] the resultant indestructible way of secret mantra:
The awareness-holder collection can be included in the three collections since it reveals their content equally.
Alternatively, some accept the proclaimers’ position on the three collections
While for others, that is not necessarily the case; since there are seven or other numbers of collections,
The mantra collection of teachings is asserted to be a separate collection.
The meaning of this way is epitomized in these three:
The nature of tantra, forms of meditation, and the methods of exposition of tantric scriptures.
Tantra denotes mantra and its procedures, as well as the means for teaching it.
It has various names such as the mantra collection of teachings and the way of mantra.
Tantras of worldly beings are not included here.
Its nature is to teach principally the path of awareness mantras and its result.
The two categories of mantra are the mundane and supramundane.
They differ in that the first is nominal; the latter, authentic.
The mundane mantra comprises what was created by ordinary beings;
That which leads to definite assurance, the highest states in the three realms;
And the support for the mind, the paths of accumulation and preparation, along with their collection of teachings.
Tantra is distinct from sutra, not in its ultimate aim which is identical,
But in its clarity, abundance of methods, and lack of hardships.
It is intended for one of sharp faculties.
According to the master Jnanashri,
Tantra is distinguished by its eleven forms of skillful methods.
Indrabhuti notes its seven special features; and Jnanapada, its practitioner, path, and result.
Shantipa states that mantra and perfections do not differ in ultimate truth,
But mantra has greater depth and vastness in relative truth.
Most believe that the distinction lies with the subject, not object.
Its distinctiveness is encapsulated in three features: the practitioner with three qualifications,
A path with three distinctions in method, and the resultant state of union.
Of four categories, sutra, tantra, both, and neither,
The mantra collection, which uses the result in the path, is distinguished.
Mantra is superior by virtue of its swiftness, which is due to five reasons; four sources of bliss;
And its skillful methods in the three trainings and all spheres of experience.
Its essence is the union of emptiness and compassion.

The meaning of mantra is to protect the mind from conceptual objectification.
The three forms of practice are the best, the lesser, and the secondary;
In essence, great bliss, pride of being the deity, and mantra with its applications.
Alternatively, the seven forms are the complete, partial, special,
Initial bliss, almost complete, some measure, and slight great bliss.
Mantra refers to secret mantra and blissful pristine awareness.
Its applications as activations and powers are considered tantra.
Both the way itself and the means to express it are known as tantra.
Tantra is divided in many ways: into two sets, outer and inner;
Into three, action, conduct, and yoga; into four, five, six, and more.
The division into four sets is widely accepted because tantras were taught
In consideration of four kinds of recipients of the teachings,
As well as the persons to be converted, different castes, faculties,
Objects of purification, purificatory means, states, times, and other factors.
Action tantra emphasizes outer conduct.
It has six families. Its entrances, the water and diadem, establish the potentials
For the two dimensions, after which the pledges are observed.
For specific purposes, initiation is conferred in four parts; the mandala is a colored powders one.
The process of approaching incorporates ten auxiliary elements. The main elements
Are the essential principles: that of oneself comprises six qualities;
That of the deity, deity as form, as letter, and as nature;
That of recitation, immersion in sound, mind, and base;
And that of meditative absorption, dwelling in fire, in sound, and at the limit of sound.
Familiarization with the deity is perfected in a lord-subject manner.
The powers effected are articles, body, and wealth, equal in fortune to that of desire realm gods.
Powers are used for provisional or ultimate goals.
Three types of powers are effected in the appropriate manner.
Attainment requires up to eight aeons for one of sharp faculties; or other times.
The state attained is that of whichever of the three families one has perfected.
Conduct tantra comprises equal proportions of deeds and contemplation.
It has three families. The outer entering is to receive five initiations, the water and the others.
One assumes vows such as the vow unobscured throughout the three times.

The inner entering with signs involves the six deities.
For recitation and meditation on the two aspects of letter and base, the deity is like a sibling or friend.
Practice without signs is cultivated in conjunction with the minds of entering, abiding, and emerging.
The practice of approaching is to become skilled in practice with and without signs.
The practice to effect powers uses outer and inner mandalas for ordinary and special powers
Through which one becomes an awareness-holder of the desire or form realm. Progress on the mundane path
And the supramundane depend on one’s faculties.
Even hindered, full awakening is attained in three great aeons.
Yoga tantra emphasizes contemplation on the profound and the vast.
It has five families. The five initiations of the student
And the six of the master are taken gradually. An individual
Who is free of shortcomings and possessed of four qualifications and the vows,
Through the result and its fundamental cause, trains in the means of actualization:
The deity yogas incorporating the four seals which serve to purify
The ground-of-all, afflicted, mental, and sense consciousnesses.
One of sharp faculties trains in the initial union and the two supremely triumphant contemplations;
One of low faculties, by means of contemplation of the four yogas,
Trains in attention on the coarse deity and the subtle insignia
While applying the ten essential principles.
Perfect penetrating wisdom is the view of the unborn.
Powers and the pristine awareness of the seals are effected
Through meditative absorption, recitation, and fire-offering rituals.
One of sharp faculties swiftly crosses the stages and paths in one lifetime;
And one of low faculties, in sixteen or less. The culmination of the five awakenings
Is perfect enlightenment, in essence the five pristine awarenesses.
The highest tantra is the supreme yoga of method and wisdom.
The meaning of the tantra is contained in the three continuums.
The causal continuum is to be understood by eliminating misconceptions through study and reflection.
The continuum of method is to be relied upon through experience in meditation.
The resultant continuum is to be realized through three accumulations.

The causal continuum is to be understood by its essence;
Principal nature of luminous clarity; four characteristics;
Synonyms (continuum, ground, ground-of-all, and original buddha);
Attributes of interrelated flaws and qualities, or causes and results;
Five temporal states; and immutability. The exceptional system
Speaks of two authentic conditions, that of body and that of mind.
The luminous clarity nature of mind is the naturally present affinity
With three features. The evolving affinity is perfectly acquired.
As illustrated by nine examples, the essence is concealed by adventitious stains.
Its essence is unchanged throughout the three states
Of the impure, both pure and impure, and utterly pure.
It exists from time without beginning as the source of all phenomena,
But is difficult to fathom, entwined by four paradoxes.
It is the ultimate dimension of phenomena, indivisible profundity and clarity,
Abiding in the body as the pristine awareness dimension of the nature of great bliss.
Sutras and tantras expound the ground continuum using many synonyms:
Essence of enlightenment, transcendent wisdom, emptiness,
Original lord, innate pristine awareness, and other terms.
Coemergent ignorance creates the deception of the eightfold group, from which arises
The dualism of apprehended and apprehender and the various manifestations of cyclic existence and perfect peace.
The four empties and four elemental properties together form the root of cyclic life.
An alternative explanation is that cyclic life arises from mundane innate bliss; the indestructible vital essence
Is the root of the thirty-six psychophysical constituents.
The process of taking of birth in the three realms is gradually initiated. Of possible births,
The best recipient for mantra is the manifest dimension attended by stains,
In one of the three continents, having a vajra body endowed with six elements.
There are the three channels, twenty-four major channels, six channel-wheels,
And seventy-two thousand subtle channels, within which [winds flow].
The life, root, and branch winds, and winds of the time conjunctions,
In the orders of generation and dissolution, always shift and move [throughout the channels].
“Spring” and “vital essence,” the twelve refined and twenty-four residual vital essences,
In the types of the dissolved, engaged, and dominant, flow [throughout the channels].

The four states—deep sleep, dream, ordinary,
And sexual union—constitute the fundamental cause.
The refined elements, which transcend the nature of particles,
Manifest from relative bodhichitta, in essence pristine awareness,
The support for immutable bliss, the innate body.
The symbol for the causal continuum is evam, whose shape comprises
The union of the five letters of the great emptinesses and six letters of the empty essences.
What is symbolized: “semen” and “ovum,” moon and sun, the aspects of method and wisdom,
Vajra and sattva, the source of all tantras.
The causal continuum manifests as the powerful ten-letter mantra and Kalachakra.
The method continuum comprises four elements: conferral of initiation,
Pledges and vows, contemplation, and application of tantra.
A person who enters the path possessed of faith, diligence, and good fortune,
With confidence in tantra and a genuine teacher,
First learns the meaning of tantra and then engages in the two phases.
Initiation serves as the basis. The mandala precedes the initiation.
Mandalas are said to be of eight types or as few as two.
Emanated and pristine awareness mandalas are the spheres of experience of realized persons.
Some of sharp faculties may enter the body mandala and heaps of flowers mandala.

The mandalas appropriate for initial entry are mandalas of colored powders, painted on cloth,
And tridimensional, each of which comprises three mandalas: that of the pledge deity,
The invoked pristine awareness deity, and the myriad manifestations of the buddha,
Which are the bases of the initiation. The tantras are divided
According to emphasis on method or wisdom: father tantras comprise three families;
Mother tantras, six, of which the ultimate is the Kalachakra.
Each of the individual tantras has its rituals for the site and the preparation,
The actualization, veneration, and master’s self-entry, followed by outer and inner entry.
The functions of the vase consist in the awareness initiations, the deliberate behavior, and so forth,
The student’s initiations, and the irreversible wheel initiations.
Kalachakra sets forth seven initiations in the pattern of childhood.
In the body mandala, relative mandala, and ultimate mandala,
The secret, wisdom, and fourth initiations are received.
The high and supremely high ones are given at appropriate times.
All are included in the entrance, main part, and permission;
Lesser and supreme; mundane and supramundane, and so forth.
Initiations purify the obscurations of body, speech, and mind, and the three equally,
Establish potencies for the four indestructible states, ripen one as a fit trainee
Of the generation phase, self-blessing, and example and actual pristine awareness,
And bring about the attainment of the rank of a vajra master.
The initiations on the pattern of childhood correspond to the thirty-seven means of purification and spheres of purification.
The prohibitions concern root downfalls and secondary infractions;
Injunctions concern contemplation, conduct, sustenance, and articles not to be apart from;
Pledges include those for beginners, adepts of stable realization and highly stable realization,
Or the pledges of indestructible awakened body, speech, and mind, and so forth.

Contemplation comprises the two phases.
The phase of generation comprises essence, branches, divisions,
Stages, and actual and nominal aspects; its six topics of analysis,
Grounds of purification, final result, ripening effect,
Purpose, essence, and perfection apply to all its branches.
The phase of completion comprises three parts: essence, types, and natures;
And is understood through eleven topics of analysis:
What it is, where to strike crucial points, how to strike them,
Experience and signs, qualities, reasons, relinquishment, measure, delineation of stages,
Overcoming obstructions and enhancing realization, and the distinction between the principal and auxiliary.
The completion phase comprises the causal and resultant phases.
The causal phase comprises self-blessing, mandala circle,
And the great seal. As methods of eliciting bliss and emptiness,
Generally, four seals are taught. There are three sides to the resultant phase.
The emptiness side comprises the ultimate three lights of reality
And the relative three of interdependence, with conceptions and without.
The three lights are delineated in fifteen sets and referred to by many synonyms.
The thirty-three conceptions, the nature of which is light,
Forty, the increase of light, and seven, the culmination of light, serve as the source
Of deception and freedom. Pristine awareness is brought forth by method.
The essence of the appearance side is the form of a completion phase deity
Of three types. From the four lights and the four elemental properties
The subtle and gross constituents are created. The innate body serves as the ground for attainment.
The agent of attainment is the final example luminous clarity.
Actual awakening is the cause; the state of union, the result.
Application of tantra comprises the twelve great activations
And the common and supreme powers, achieved by means of meditation,
Fire offering, diagrams, and compounds. The practice to achieve the four ordinary powers
Includes direction, time, deity, necessary articles, disposition,
Place, meditation object, food, ritual, and mantra;
Uncommon substances and pledge articles are superior means to attain powers.
The complementary conduct is to engage in the elaborate, unelaborate,
And extremely unelaborate conduct; or the conduct of forsaking duality,
Ever-perfect, and victorious in all quarters, and so forth.

It is differentiated according to faculties, stages, and so on; of the many types,
All are considered part of the three categories of time, procedure, and essence.
The branch of tantric application of wrathful practices is of two types.
The perfection of those contemplations leads to the resultant continuum.
In summation, one gains certainty through the view based on wisdom
And traverses the path through the stages of cultivating the supreme methods.
Realization is enhanced by using experiences in the path and engaging in three conducts.
Within this lifetime, the state of union is thereby attained.
Tantric scriptures are classified on the basis of their content;
Both action and conduct tantras are categorized according to presentation
As sutras, tantras, skills, detailed rituals, and retention mantras;
Yoga tantras are categorized as root, explanatory, subsidiary, and concordant tantras;
Highest yoga, as root tantras, extensive and concise,
Two subsidiary, five explanatory, and two concordant tantras.
The five tantric topics concern procedures, powers,
Pledges, contemplations, and tantric applications.
An alternative system sets forth eleven points: ritual of the site, method of actualization,
worship, fire-offering rituals,
Initiation, consecration, prescribed ritual implements, and mandalas,
Ritual feast gatherings, familiarization, and sets of activations.
One must know details such as ritual implements of insignia (vajra and bell) and ornaments;
Drawing and construction of mandalas; place and time for ritual feast gatherings;
As well as the roles of the participants; familiarization for the welfare of oneself and others;
And activations related to body and contemplation.
The teaching method in action tantra comprises four practices, the entrance, and so on;
In conduct tantra, three exposition approaches and two excellences;
In yoga tantra, four compendiums of analyses, all of which include purpose,
Concise meaning, literal meaning, context, and resolution of contradictions.
Points of introduction are given based on the distinction between Buddha and his followers.

Highest tantras are to be expounded by means of seven ornaments:
Five points of introduction, four correct methods,
Six parameters, four modes, group and individual teachings,
Five persons, and two truths. The special exposition methods for Chakrasamvara
Are six key instructions and three unions;
For Hevajra, those of the three purities;
For Mahamaya, the shape, mantra, and reality;
For Chatuhpita, the four seats; Samputa, seven secrets;
For others, the four dwellings and four essential principles;
For Kalachakra, the outer, inner, and alternative levels,
All of those based on the four reliances.
In the esoteric instructions system, tantras are taught in terms of the three continuums.
A protective circle, food offering, offering to the teacher, and meditation modelled on early events are performed.
The eleven faults of the three doors are eliminated by students.
Those who expound and listen to the tantras undistractedly and endowed with the ornament of speech
Will be especially watched over by all awareness-holders, it is taught.
[Next is presented] the extraordinary ancient translation tradition of the indestructible way:
This system is said to comprise four collections from the perspective of overcoming emotional afflictions
And nine ways to realization according to different faculties.
All are epitomized in the three ways: the ground (the meaning to be explained);
The path (which presents the explanation); and the result (that which transcends explanation).
The ground comprises essence, nature, and energy;
The supreme path, the proclaimer’s way up to anu;
The result, supreme pristine awareness, ati.
The ways of proclaimers, solitary sages, and bodhisattvas constitute the way of liberation from the source of suffering;
And kriya, ubhaya, and yoga, the way resembling Vedic austerity.
These are essentially identical
To the ways described in the common explanation, from which knowledge of these should be gained.
The tantra, elucidation, and esoteric instructions systems constitute the way of the dominating method.
These are known as the three sets of generation, completion, and great perfection.
The essence of mahayoga is the conjoining of understanding and experience
Of the indivisibility of the superior truths by relying principally on method.
Mahayoga means the great training.
The entrance initiations of benefit, ability, and profundity effect ripening.

One enters by way of three contemplations: great emptiness,
Illusory compassion, and coarse and subtle symbols.
The view of the indivisibility of the two truths beyond the sphere of experience
Is conclusively established through the axioms of the four understandings,
Three purities, four samenesses, and the total state of being.
For meditation in the sadhana tradition, eight systems of knowledge
Are taught: the four channel-wheels; three neighs of the horse;
Eight syllables of ru lu; Pure Nectar; four piercings;
Channels and winds; and observance of worship and propitiation.
The path of method in the tantra tradition involves the upper and lower doors
Applied with the four branches of familiarization and attainment.
The path of liberation is endowed with three kinds of wisdom. Some achieve the result in a simultaneous way.
Those who proceed sequentially rely on the cause, the view of wisdom,
And the condition, contemplation with application, which comprises devotion meditation and definitive perfection.
Conduct in the path of method is deliberate behavior; and in the path of liberation,
conscientiousness.
These bring one to the result: the four kinds of awareness-holders.
The essence of anuyoga is the conjoining of understanding and experience of the nonduality
Of the ultimate dimension and pristine awareness, principally based on wisdom.
As desire is of primary importance, it is called anuyoga.
Its thirty-six initiations are condensed into four: outer, inner, attainment, and secret.
Entrance is through the union of the ultimate dimension and pristine awareness, in which there is perfection without generation.
The view is that of primordial enlightenment in original pure and perfect mind
Which is the indivisibility of the three kinds of mandala.
Meditation comprises the upper and lower techniques in the path of method, and establishing the meaning and expression in signs
In the path of liberation, thus forming the utterly perfect path.
Those are connected to the three yogas: the cause (the object of the action);
The condition (the action); and the result (transcendence of action).
The conduct is that of the empowering energy, the dominating conduct, and conduct of method.
The result is great bliss, spontaneously perfect, the twenty-five aspects.
The essence of atiyoga is direct liberation in the state of primordial enlightenment
Without renunciation or acceptance, hope or fear.

It is the supreme training, the summit of all ways.
The initiations are elaborate, unelaborate, very unelaborate, and utterly unelaborate.
One enters by way of no action or effort whatsoever.
The view asserts that everything is the total sphere of the dimension of reality,
Naturally present pristine awareness, effortless primordial enlightenment.
The respective views of the divisions of mind, vast space, and esoteric instructions assert
Freedom from the limit of something to renounce, as no phenomenon is other than mind;
Freedom from the limit of remedies, as phenomena are totally perfected in the vast space of the true nature;
Transcendence of renunciations and remedies, as all are of the real condition already established.
The division on mind has seven distinctions. The vast space division has four aspects.
The esoteric instructions comprise the scattered teachings, oral tradition, and textual tradition of tantras.
The last has cycles of outer, inner, secret, and most secret
As distinctions in the oral transmission and explanatory tantras.
Meditation in the mind division is to remain in total presence and emptiness, the dimension of reality;
In the vast space division, to remain in the state of the true nature without action or effort;
In the esoteric instructions division, to remain in primordial freedom without renunciation and acceptance.
Conduct is spontaneous; the place of primordial freedom is thereby reached.

The pledges should be learned in the context of the mantric vows.
Each of the three yogas may be subdivided
Into three subparts each, for a total of nine.
The scriptures include the eighteen tantras, the five scriptural elucidations,
The eighteen mother and son tantras of the Majestic Creative Energy, and the seventeen tantras of secret pristine awareness;
In the sadhana division, there are the five supramundane
And the three mundane, which include general and special tantras.
As exposition methods, mahayoga’s seven ornaments are the same as in the new tradition.
As special methods, two styles of exposition, that of atiyoga and that of mahayoga,
Are used to teach the Net of Magical Manifestation of Vajrasattva,
The Secret Essence, King of Tantras That Ascertains Reality.
The mahayoga style comprises the three exposition methods of the elders;
The Zurpa tradition of the transmitted teachings presents five topics.
At the present time, the title is taught to the most adept; an analysis, to the average;
And the meaning of the words, to the least adept; this is Vimalamitra’s way.
The ten topics of the tantra—view, conduct, mandala, initiation,
Pledges, activations, sadhanas, contemplation, offerings, mantras and mudras —
Serve as instrumental conditions for the path.
Sadhanas are understood through twenty methods: the five summaries,
Five tantric guidelines, five combined elucidations, and five unification systems.
Anuyoga is understood through seven elucidations: view, generation phase,
Mantra to be recited, union, release, offering, and propitiation.
Atiyoga is taught using the six general meanings: five teachings
On the path, with examples; and the result, which is beyond examples.

Sublime Intelligence Deriving from Contemplation [I]
You come to complete certainty by contemplating the significance of what has been heard.
This consists of an internal dialogue that involves conceptual thinking and investigation.
Mundane conceptual thought is associated with ordinary mental functioning, while transcendent thought is associated with sublime intelligence; a discerning mind engages in precise investigation.

This involves two factors: the keys that are crucial in order to evaluate the teachings and the treasure chamber of the sacred teachings that are to be evaluated. The standard processes of evaluation are primarily those of provisional vis-à-vis definitive meaning, direct vis-a-vis indirect intention, the four reliances, and the four logical principles.

Individuality, the state of an ordinary being, origination and cessation, the mind-body aggregates and sense fields, and so forth — these are means to gain access to the fundamentally unconditioned nature of reality.
These topics, together with the discussions of them, constitute the relative level of provisional meaning.
Those texts that present the totally pure avenue to the true nature of phenomena, free of elaboration — that is, the way in which things actually abide—are definitive in meaning.
Those that simply discuss the purposes for such teachings are held to be provisional in meaning,
but this is not necessarily the case.

Words can have different implications, but the method for interpreting them reveals that there is no contradiction.
Because those to be guided are guided by relying on these methods, [one considers] the underlying motive, the function, and the seeming incompatibility.
The four cases of direct intention are those concerned with equalness, implied issues,
eventualities, and the attitudes of individuals.

The means to educate others that are not definitive yet capable of leading them are with respect to
śrāvakas, the three aspects of the very essence of things, the overcoming of flaws, and the profundity of what is expressed. There are four cases of indirect intention, because they are concerned, respectively, with edification, characteristics, remedies, and transformation.

Direct intention simply plants the idea in the mind; it does not depend on the other person; it is explained that indirect intention does depend.

Rely on the meaning, which makes evident the omniscient state of timeless awareness; do not rely on the words and letters that are conventional terms and designations.

Rely on the teachings concerning unmistaken view and conduct; do not rely on an individual's family,
ancestry, fame, or wealth.

Rely on timeless awareness, which is free of elaboration, without identity, and the very essence of being; do not rely on ordinary consciousness, which is a mind fixated on characteristics and concepts.

Rely on the definitive meaning, with its profound and vast implications; do not rely on the provisional meaning that is temporarily expedient.

In mundane contexts, things are established through dependent relationships; the sense faculties,
objects, avenues of consciousness, and so forth, perform functions with respect to specific objects but do not perform these with respect to other aspects of experience; there is valid cognition based on inference, on direct experience, or on scriptural authority; and all phenomena can be found always to have their common and individual characteristics:
These are known, respectively, as the logical principle of dependent relationships, that of the performance of functions, that of establishing what is reasonable, and that of the nature of things.

The extraordinary approach of secret mantra is evaluated through six parameters and four modes.

Given the presence or absence of a fortunate capacity regarding reality, a single vajra word conveys distinct meanings.
Therefore, the provisional meaning is found in the stage of development and its ancillaries; the definitive meaning lies in both the causal aspect of tantra and the stage of completion.
A single meaning treated by different and seemingly contradictory statements is a case of explanation requiring interpretation, in which the meaning being expressed depends on the underlying intent.
Where it does not depend on this, one understands the presentation directly; this is explanation that does not require interpretation. These are two more parameters.
Descriptions of maṇḍalas and other topics in well-known language are to be taken literally;
those that use uncommon language and are bound up in symbolism are not to be taken literally.
Since the words and meanings do not fall outside the foregoing, they are the six parameters.

The mere reading word by word is the literal meaning.

The shared meaning concerns the alleviating of misgivings concerning the sūtra tradition and others,
and the stage of development.
The teachings on desire are hidden, relative truth is hidden, and the higher, middling, and lesser degrees with respect to what lies at the core are hidden meaning.
The path of utter lucidity and the fruition state of primordial unity constitute the consummate meaning. These four modes can be differentiated from a single vajra word, in accord with progressive levels of acumen.
The foregoing constitutes the first part, concerning a definitive treatment of the keys for evaluating the teachings.

The principal topics for evaluation are the three cycles of the sacred dharma.

All agree that the first cycle is provisional in meaning.

Proponents of things having no finite essence opine,
“The intermediate cycle is primarily definitive in meaning, the final one largely provisional”
They have no actual scriptural authority for this, only proving their rationale through reasoning.

“The intermediate cycle, putting an end to elaborations, is definitively meaningful in the shorter term; the final cycle, bringing a definitive conclusion concerning what is ultimate, is definitively meaningful in the far-reaching sense. ” So says the tradition of Yogic Practitioners.
Their scriptural authority is found in the distinctions made by the Victorious One himself, and the further distinctions made by the tradition of the prophesied exalted one, who attained the third level of realization.
The reasoning is found by applying the example of refining a gem and so forth.
Rangjung, Dolpo, Drimé Özer, and others primarily accept this latter interpretation, others the former.

In particular, it is explained that the three successive cycles of the dharma — initial,
intermediate, and final—undermine, respectively, nonvirtue, the belief in identity, and all bases for dogmatic opinions.

Some think of what is provisionally meaningful as untrue, as false, but this is an incorrect opinion, for the Buddhas word entails no falsehoods.
Because it eliminates elaborations concerning the manner in which things appear while actually demonstrating the way things actually abide, the great spiritual guide and others accept that the entire Buddhadharma has a single intent.

The sacred Buddhadharma was taught on the basis of two levels of truth.

Generally speaking, these are in essence contrived and uncontrived, respectively— that which is imputed by the minds of ordinary beings and the state of spiritually advanced beings in meditative equipoise.

As for the derivation of the terms, what is conditioned is true on the relative level itself,
while one fact is true on the ultimate level.

The characteristics are those of the object s being either that of a confused consciousness that does not investigate it or that of the unconfused mind of a spiritually advanced being—that is,
deceptive or not deceptive.
The way in which the subjective perceiver apprehends is either one of confusion or its absence.
These levels are presented with many synonymous terms.

Without investigating any foundation for analysis, on the basis of what simply can be known, one can distinguish the way in which things appear from the way they abide—that is, the relative from the ultimate.

The way in which things appear is a state of confusion — the perceptions in the minds of ordinary beings; the unconfused state is accepted by most to consist of the path and its fruition.
The relative is that of ordinary mortals and the spiritually advanced, or that of mundane people and advanced spiritual practitioners.
The ultimate is in essence indivisible but can be analyzed as having three characteristics, or,
from the perspective of topics under discussion, sixteen aspects, and so forth.

Due to the difference in the way that the minds of the spiritually advanced and the spiritually immature perceive, and the classification based on mutual dependence,...

... truth is certainly twofold.

Conventionally, this is one nature with separate facets; ultimately, there can be no discussion of being identical or separate.

If something is destroyed or broken down, the concept of it can be either discarded or not. More obvious things and streams of consciousness are relative, while what is indivisible is ultimately true. This is the tradition of the Particularist school.
Things that are ultimately able to perform functions or not, which are characterized as specifics or generalities—this is the tradition of the Followers of the Sutras.
Dualistic experiences of perceived and perceiver, of objects and their perceiving subject, are considered as actually being nondual consciousness. This is the tradition of the Mind Only school.
Sensory appearances, which are proven to be relative, are similar to illusions, while what is ultimate, like space, cannot be found to exist. This is the tradition of the Autonomist school.

What is imputed by ordinary consciousness is relative (accepted in accord with what is commonly understood in the world), while freedom from conceptual elaboration is beyond imagination or expression. This is the tradition of the Consequentialist school.
The imputed and the dependent are relative; the ultimate is the absolute—self-knowing timeless awareness. This is the tradition of qualified emptiness.
In the mantra approach, there is further embellishment due to its special features.
In particular, the relative consists of the appearances that manifest to dualistic consciousness,
which are described as being apparent yet without true existence, like the reflection of the moon on water.
The ultimate is the essence of things, emptiness in its eighteen aspects; the truth of this is nondual timeless awareness.

Knowing the foregoing, one is undeluded concerning the words of the Sage, puts the skillful means of moral choices—what to accept or reject — into practice, and beholds the significance of what derives from those means, reaching the far shore of samsara.

The totally pure nature of the foregoing is the way in which things are fundamentally unconditioned—
interdependent connection free of limiting extremes.

What occurs dependently, externally and internally, constitutes the interdependent connection of samsara.

Whoever beholds the interdependent connection of nirvana— the reversal of the usual progression—
has access to the key points of the Buddhas speech; therefore realize the significance of these through dedicated contemplation.
The foregoing constitutes the second part, concerning a definitive treatment of provisional and definitive meaning according to the three approaches, the two levels of truth, and interdependent connection.

Given that nirvana — the deathless state — is what to strive for, sublime intelligence is the remedy to eliminate ignorance, the source of obscuration.
Without it this will not take place, for it ensures that ones view is pure. Conduct through skillful means brings purification, and one swiftly gains freedom in the integration of totally pure view and conduct.
In particular, because all the teachings spoken by the Victorious One are directed toward, and come down to, the basic space of phenomena, initially one should come to a definitive understanding of the view. Having properly understood the flawed attitudes of erroneous opinions, one eliminates these while seeking out and accepting what is definitively meaningful as one's authentic view.

With ignorance serving as the cause, the belief in the reality of the perishable aggregates is the false perception of identity, which is the root of four mistaken ideas. The remedy to this is to develop sublime intelligence that realizes the lack of identity.

Conditioned phenomena are momentary and impermanent; all that is corruptible is of the nature of the three kinds of suffering; both the deeply ingrained afflictive state and the totally refined state are empty and lack identity; nirvana alone is liberation, the state of peace.
These are the four axioms that denote the general teachings of the Buddhas words.
Contemplating them thoroughly, one arouses a sense of certainty at the outset.

Next, one follows the path that avoids dualistic extremes.
One uses the sublime intelligence that understands ultimate reality as the perceiving agent to pare away conceptual elaborations concerning the object that is to be known. This is the tradition of each individuals own school.
Be that as it may, materialists may eliminate naive affirmation and nihilistic denial according to their own interpretations, but they still fall into extremes of overstatement and understatement.
Therefore, these interpretations are partly truth but with much untruth.
Because the way of abiding is realized to be free of conceptual elaborations and the way in which things manifest to be a process of interdependent connection, the Middle Way tradition is entirely true.

The scope of its view is emptiness — the actuality of negating the two kinds of identity, and an aspect of unqualified negation.

The basis for emptiness is objects in the phenomenal world, which are also what is to be negated and the basis for such negation.
The way in which these are empty, according to the unqualified interpretation of emptiness, is that they cannot be proven to exist in essence.
If this is analyzed, there are sixteen aspects—of outer, inner, both, emptiness, and so forth —
but these can be subsumed within the four aspects of what is substantial, insubstantial, true nature,
and alternate reality.

The basis for negation is what is absolute, while the factors to be negated are what is imputed and what is dependent.
The Yogic Practitioners profess that it is “empty of these.”
They explain that this can be analyzed into fourteen aspects, which can be subsumed within two.

The hindrances to perception are the ten distracting concepts; the remedies that dispel these are the two aspects of lack of identity.

The more obvious aspect of the lack of identity in phenomena is an issue common to Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike, and so one should come to a definitive conclusion about it at the outset.

This is, in essence, similar to a rope being taken for a snake; there is just the fixation in the ordinary mind that this is something self-justifying that is truly existent.

This is negated because it is the cause for misconstruing things to have identity, which lies at the root of the two obscuring factors.

Although the Particularists and Followers of the Sutras do not have a completely perfect understanding of suchness, they come to their definitive conclusion on the basis of temporary objects in the phenomenal world.
The rationale is that nothing whatsoever is found through investigation; for to consider this to mean a lack of true existence is their general tradition.
The Mind Only schools own tradition holds that they realize both aspects of the lack of identity;
but if a follower of the Middle Way evaluates this, because nondual consciousness is held to be ultimate, there still remains a rudimentary sense of identity in phenomena.

Although there are many lines of reasoning in the Middle Way, the tradition of the Exalted One uses five to usher in certainty concerning the integration of emptiness and interdependent connection.
Candra speaks of two models: once perceived objects are negated, the proof that they do not exist negates the perceiving subject; and the logic that a single relative thing is empty means that all phenomena are empty.

The issue that distinguishes non-Buddhists from Buddhists is that of identity in the individual.

In essence, this is the instinctual fixation on “I” and “mine”

It is negated because from it comes the sense of “other,” from which all opinionated views derive.

While there are differences in the way in which realization takes place, all four philosophical systems bring realization.

The five aggregates are not the self, the self does not possess them, nor do they act as supports one for the other. Some twenty alternatives are negated by lines of proof such as the reasoning based on the chariot.
In Distinguishing Center and Limit, there are ten ways of being wise, as remedies to ten ways of believing in identity in the individual. There are many other such ways of reasoning.

Because all phenomena lack identity, in essence these aspects are inseparable. The factors to be negated being true existence and the “I, ” or self, the aspects are assigned as this vis-à-vis that from distinct points of view.

The purpose of this is in order to care for two types of people.

Although the actual factors to be negated cannot possibly be known, due to confusion on the part of the subjective perceiver, they are imputed as being perceived as the one and the other.

The special attitude that derives from inferential knowledge based on reasoning is the primary kind of valid cognition that ascertains what is ultimately the case.
If one summarizes the categories of reasoning that rely on logical arguments, these are proofs of negation, due to a failure to observe something supportive or an observation of something contradictory.

The key point of all reasoning that investigates what is ultimately so is investigation that identifies a basis for attributes and then seeks out that which does not contradict its essential quality and that which contradicts its particular attributes.
Therefore, the freedom from being unitary or manifold negates any finite essence, while the negation of production in any of four ways negates particular attributes.
These two models are foremost; the rest are simply secondary.
The root of all of these is found in the homage to the Middle Way.

In the Autonomist tradition, all substantial things are proven not to truly exist; emptiness is proven so as to eliminate concepts of fixating on them.
The Consequentialists negate conceptual elaborations but do not try to prove a freedom from elaboration.

In particular, in the extraordinary tradition of Yogic Practitioners, it is realized that there is nothing other than mind and that mind does not exist.
The nondual basic space of phenomena is endowed with seven vajra properties.
The heart essence of all ordinary beings and buddhas is free of elaboration, in no way resembling any identity of an individual.
This is the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, free of the mere lack of identity in the individual, transcending being manifest or nonmanifest, and even interdependent connection.
Empty of adventitious flaws, it is not empty of unsurpassable qualities.
There is nothing to be removed or added, for it is realized through naturally occurring pure awareness.
It is said that ordinary mortals, śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and beginning bodhisattvas do not have mastery of the view concerning the buddha nature.
This is not an object of inference, because it is beyond language and concepts.
Since this mode is difficult for any mind other than that of a spiritually advanced being to comprehend, it has become a topic of controversy, but I will not elaborate here.

Having realized the individual methods of the two mainstream traditions, one integrates them as a
single underlying intent, free of the flaws of exaggeration or denigration.
One is endowed with flawless vision concerning the sūtras and tantras.

In the mantra approach, the interpretation of unqualified emptiness is that the subjective aspect is distinguished as the skillful factor of bliss, but that there is no difference in the objective aspect as freedom from elaboration.
For the interpretation of qualified emptiness, even the objective aspect is not merely freedom from elaboration; rather, it is posited to be endowed with the most sublime of manifestations,
comparable to divination with a mirror.
Some say that other than the mere freedom from elaboration, because of the skillful methods involved, the difference is like that between an ordinary fire and one of sandalwood.

In the Middle Way of the mantra approach, the profound unity of bliss and emptiness, the position of the vajra of enlightened speech, who bears the mark of light, is that there are four special attributes—the function of the central channel, the skillful means to experience emptiness, the influence exerted with respect to the ground of being, and the attainment of the kāya of primordial unity.

If this were not present as the fundamentally unconditioned nature, viewing it as such would not make it so, and when emptiness is realized, cause and effect are spontaneously ensured.
Whatever is the ceaseless process of interdependent connection is itself the supreme seal of unborn primordial unity.

The impact of study and contemplation is that of arousing an uncontrived faith in the teachings and the upholders of the teachings without sectarian bias.
Without falling into any extreme, one conducts oneself with precision25 concerning the effects of karma.
The excellent speech of the buddhas serves as one's advisor, so that one feels a growing sense of freedom in one's ongoing experience.
Nonetheless, there are the four contemplations that reorient the mind, which are methods from the tradition of pith instructions that dramatically reorient an ordinary person s mind.

The precious support, endowed with eight opportunities and ten endowments, has great purpose and is difficult to obtain (as determined by cause, result, and analogy).

There are three primary topics: death is certain; when one will die is unknown; and when death occurs, anything that is not spiritual will be of no avail.
There are secondary considerations: death cannot be prevented, life cannot be extended, and there is never enough time; the time of death is unpredictable, it happens under many circumstances, and life is fragile; and death does not allow us to take our companions, body, or wealth.
One recalls death by applying these nine rationales.

Once one has died, one will be reborn in either of two destinies; having contemplated the foregoing,
one reorients one's mind away from this lifetime.

Such is the process of karma: it is ineluctable; its results are greatly magnified; actions not committed have no effect; and the effects of actions committed never expire on their own.

The degree of gravity is greatly influenced by the focus, intention, underlying support, and actual content of an action— these bring about results due to complete maturation, results consistent with causes, and governing results.

Birth, aging, illness, death, being separated from what is appealing, encountering what is unappealing, striving for what one desires and not finding it, and the suffering of the aggregates that perpetuate samsara:...

... For everyone, moreover, there is nothing reliable, nothing satisfying, and this has been going on forever.
Contemplating the three kinds of suffering, the mind reorients itself away from samsara.

Through seven practical instructions concerning cause and effect, the basis for arousing an attitude of concern for the welfare of others is established by an even-minded attitude and a sense of empathy.
Seeking enlightenment as one's goal, with loving-kindness, great compassion, and altruistic motivation, one reorients one's mind away from quiescence and naive happiness.

Investigating the significance of the unborn nature of all phenomena with discernment, one reorients one's mind away from dualistic consciousness.

The actual significance of what one has studied and contemplated is put into practice through meditation;[*624*] by analogy, although a farmer may reap a fine harvest, it is meant to be eaten.

Seek for certainty about the themes for the vast range of meditative absorption — in the
Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna approaches — in the two aspects of calm abiding and profound insight.

In essence, these are a one-pointed state of attention and the discernment that thoroughly analyzes phenomena.

As for the derivation of these terms, with the calming [zhi] of distraction, there is abiding
[gnas]
to the highest degree, and the profoundly [lhag] special quality of things is seen with the insight
[mthong] of the vision of sublime intelligence.

Similar to a lamp's being unstirred by wind and burning brightly, when both aspects come together,
the true way of abiding itself is realized.

The developmental process involves a relationship of support and supported.

One dispenses with all that is counterproductive by relying on the circumstances for calm abiding —
dwelling in a conducive place, having few wants, knowing contentment, observing pure discipline,
and avoiding distractions and concepts.

An analysis includes the mind of the realm of desire, the states of meditative stability, the formless realm, and the state of cessation.

The process of meditation involves sitting comfortably in a physical posture that has eight points.

In general, the focus can be any of four — pervasive, purifying one of former behavior,
involving knowledge, or purifying one of afflictive states — and accords with the individual.

As for specific ways of settling the mind, these may involve an impure or pure physical support.

Without a physical support, one settles one's mind on a partial impression up to a complete one,
or uses some external or internal focus on the body or something related to it.

Once the waves of thought dissolve into the ocean that is the basis of all ordinary experience,
one strives at meditative equipoise that is the very essence of meditation.

There are two ways to identify experiences that develop from these methods.

According to mainstream sources, the five flaws are: three kinds of faintheartedness, the forgetting of instructions, two kinds each of laxity and agitation, nonapplication, and overapplication.
These are remedied by eight techniques: intention, effort, confidence, and thorough pliancy (which prevent the first flaw); meditative absorption without forgetfulness (endowed with three special features);
alert effort, and equanimity (once evenness has ensued).

Through six powers — listening, contemplation, mindfulness, alertness, diligence, and familiarization — involving situations of tension, interruption, no interruption, and spontaneity,
nine steps of settling the mind (settling on a focus and so forth) develop.

In the tradition of personal advice, understanding is gained through illustrative analogies of five experiences— movement, attainment, familiarization, stability, and consummation.

With the consummation of thorough pliancy, calm abiding is ensured— the space within which well-being, clarity, and the absence of any concepts about subtle traits blend.

This is the basis of all meditative stability in the traditions of sūtra and tantra.
It suppresses all afflictive states and suffering.

The causal circumstances for profound insight are to rely on holy masters, to hear many teachings,
to think correctly, and so to seek the view.

Its specific expressions are said to be the more obvious state of quiescence also found in non-Buddhist traditions, the topics that pertain to the Truths (in the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha approaches), the view of emptiness (in the pāramitā approach), and the influence of bliss (in the tantric approach).
The ordinary preparatory phases parallel those of the mundane path; however, these are not pursued by those in the tantric approach and others.

An analysis may involve three categories: analytical insight, thoroughly analytical insight, and insight as the avenue for four essential experiences of examination and investigation.
Insight can derive from the ordinary distinctions one makes, from a thoroughgoing search, and from discernment.
It can involve six explorations—of meaning, things, characteristics, influences, time, and logical principles.
(There are four logical principles that concern dependent relationships, performance of function,
establishment of what is reasonable, and the nature of things.) These six are used to analyze things in detail, from visual forms to omniscience.

These can be understood in three ways: meaning, reality just as it is, and things in all their multiplicity.
The preparation and the main practice are subsumed, respectively, within discernment and an unwavering state.

As for the way insight is cultivated in meditation, having used sublime intelligence to investigate the fact that things lack identity, one rests in equipoise in a state free of conceptual elaborations.
The bases for the investigation — the nonconceptual images — are focused on as bases of attributes,
while any false assumptions concerning their specific attributes are eliminated.
The nature of what is perceived is known to be empty, like space; what is to be examined—the origin,
location, shape, and so forth, of the perceiving consciousness— and the discerning function itself are like fire sticks consumed by fire. Nothing is found, for things dissolve into basic space,
and one rests without any fixated perception.

The gaining of thorough pliancy is explained as being the point at which there is attainment.

Although followers of the Middle Way interpret the process of development in distinct ways, they agree on what is to be developed—the integration of calm abiding and profound insight.
Unwavering and developmental meditation is paramount in all three cases.

When one is meditating with a construct, integration involves a precise analysis of the image on which one is focusing.
Once one gains profound nonconceptual insight, there is integration when these have become identical in essence.

That is the consummation of authentic meditative absorption— the attainment of nirvana that is not confined, but free of the bonds of conditioned existence and the state of peace.

In brief, unattractiveness, loving-kindness, the counting of exhalations and inhalations, the elimination of specific perceptions, the use of subtle channels and energies, visualization,
mantra repetition, and being at rest in the natural state of relaxation—all these amount to situations in which the attention is focused.

One may thoroughly investigate what is characterized and what serves to characterize it, or general and specific characteristics; one may investigate interdependent connection, use the five logical proofs, be directly introduced to one's true nature through scriptural citations, logical reasoning,
the transmission of blessing through symbols, and so forth. These are means to arouse the superb discerning function of one's sublime intelligence, accommodating the acumen of individuals.

Investigative and settling meditation are both alike in accomplishing calm abiding and profound insight.

Initially, with the meditative stability of an inexperienced practitioner, one experiences indications such as smoke. With the thorough analysis of what is ultimately meaningful, the phenomena of dualism merge as equal in taste, and the most sublime state of meditative stability is ensured.
With focus on suchness itself, one realizes all phenomena to be emptiness, and that is further realized to be the state of peace by nature.
The foregoing constitutes the first part, concerning a presentation of the stages in meditation to cultivate calm abiding and profound insight, the common foundation of meditative absorption.

As preliminaries to meditation, one observes discipline and develops sublime intelligence, is capable of both mental and physical isolation, rejects the eight concerns, maintains the twelve disciplines of spiritual training, and abandons the five kinds of wrong lifestyle

... then, the process of meditation consists of seven stages for those who follow the Sravaka schools.
These are subsumed within five points — focus, content, essence, result, and context.

Those who are beginners meditate on the general and specific remedies to desire
(that is, skeletons and the eight mental images); they examine their bodies; they see sensations to be productive of suffering and without any true substance, like hollow reeds; they focus their attention on the breath, and they meditate on the ultimate fact that no identity exists; and they see mental states and aspects of consciousness to be like illusions.
They employ the applications of mindfulness, using sublime intelligence to examine the fourfold characteristics that are specific and general.
They engage the Four Truths, cultivating the initial phase of the path of accumulation.
This model serves for the remaining stages.
Nonvirtue is prevented from arising or guarded against, while the opposite applies to virtue.
One employs meditative absorption that involves intention, exertion, attention, and investigation.

During the four phases that anticipate the decisive breakthrough, one applies two groups of five factors — confidence, diligence, mindfulness, meditative absorption, and sublime intelligence—
to the sixteen topics pertaining to the Four Truths.

On the path of seeing, there are seven aids to enlightenment: mindfulness, thorough analysis of phenomena, diligence, joy, thorough pliancy, meditative absorption, and impartiality.

The path of meditation is explained as eightfold: correct view, thought, speech, action,
livelihood,
effort, mindfulness, and meditative absorption.

Pratyekabuddhas employ the foregoing and, in addition, the process of interdependent connection,
and focus their attention on the three avenues to complete liberation.

Those who have awakened their affinity for the Mahayana uphold the two aspects of bodhicitta.

The initial step is that of the four immeasurable attitudes (loving-kindness and so forth).
Beginning practitioners focus on beings; those who are advanced in practice focus on phenomena;
those who have gained patient acceptance have no fixed frame of reference.

As preliminaries, one maintains discipline, controls the senses, exercises moderation in eating,
exerts oneself in spiritual practice in the late evening and early morning, takes joy in maintaining alertness, is enthusiastic without regret, enjoys the seven riches of spiritually advanced beings,
engages in the ten kinds of spiritual activity, and relies on inspiration and other positive causes of liberation;...

One trains one's mind with the four axioms, the five factors conducive to liberation,
recollection of the Victorious One and so forth, the nine perceptions of impurity, the eight thoughts of a superior spiritual practitioner, and the thorough purification of one's sphere of activity.

In the specific phase of formal practice, the significance of the Middle Way is paramount, and that involves investigation as a preliminary.
Autonomists rest in the significance of an unqualified negation, comparable to space.
For Consequentialists, the basic space of phenomena (as what to become familiar with) and the mind that becomes familiar are inseparable, like water poured into water.
For those who profess qualified emptiness, the state is nonconceptual and utterly lucid.
They all agree on the key point of there simply being a freedom from elaboration.

In the postmeditation phase one meditates successively on the thirty-seven factors that contribute to enlightenment; their significance has extraordinary dimensions of vastness and profundity.

In summary, through four applications — perfecting all aspects, culminating, sequential, and instantaneous — one gains accomplishment of the “mother,” the unsurpassable and transcendent perfection.
The foregoing constitutes the second part, concerning a presentation of the specific stages in meditation in the cause-based dialectical approach.
This concludes [the first two parts of] the eighth book, a developmental analysis of the higher training in meditative absorption, from The Encompassing of All Knowledge, also entitled The
Precious Treasury of Sublime Teachings:
The Compendium of the Methods of All Spiritual Approaches and A Treatise That Thoroughly
Presents the Three Higher Trainings.

The highest yoga tantra is currently the practice that is most emphasized
Of the four sets of tantra. All aspects of its path are contained in two phases.
The essence of the two phases is expeditious protection of the mind from concepts of characteristics.
The essence of the creation phase is the deity’s form possessed of four distinctions;
That of the completion phase is pristine awareness, with its causes and results, which manifests
When winds and mind have entered, abided, and dissolved in the central channel.
The terms mean imagined or fabricated; and the ultimately true or natural state.
Their number is two because they are paths that accord with birth and death;
They involve two aspects to be abandoned: resultant suffering and the seeds;
They eliminate both thoughts of the ordinary and fixation on the sublime deity;
In the context of the path, they are the yoga of body and the yoga of mind;
As for the results, they lead to both the ordinary and supreme results.
The order in the majority of cases is creation followed by completion,
The support and the supported—like a flower and its fragrance.
Just as one prepares a field with false millet before sowing rice, one purifies thoughts before embarking on what is without thought. once the natural state is realized, deliberate fabrication is dispensed with.
The two are cultivated as a union, not solely the appearance or emptiness aspect.
The presence of affinities, the special skillful methods, and the very nature of the three purities are the valid reasons why the two phases lead to freedom.
In the creation phase, one must abandon ordinary appearances, fixation,
And apprehension of reality; the remedies whose features are antidotal
Are clear image, pride, and the conviction that what appears is illusory.
The eight varieties of creation, transformation of bases of purification, and so on,
May be condensed into two: transformation of bases; and removal of bases.
The individual may be of weak, mediocre, or sharp faculties.
The practitioner advances through the stages of the four yogas:
The beginner’s stage, the descent of pristine awareness,
Minimal mastery, and the ultimate level of great mastery.

It is asserted that since this phase purifies both realms and sentient beings,
All four modes of birth are purified by a single method. Great Commentary’s
System is to purify miraculous birth by creation of the full form all at once;
Birth from egg, by creation of the world twice; birth from womb, by another.
The visualization-sequence branches in the framework of three contemplations—
The initial union, supremely victorious action, and supremely victorious mandala—
Belong to the Indestructible Garland system and apply to all yoga tantras in general.
The Mahamaya teaches the three yogas of shape, mantra, and reality.
Other tantras teach consecration, imagination, and completion of the form;
The four sets of actual awakenings — in an instant, in five parts, in twenty parts,
By means of the net of magical manifestations—encompass all three continuums;
In particular, the set of awakenings in five parts is referred to in many systems,
But here is meant that of the Net of Magical Manifestation.
Four branches form the framework of the two Guhyasamaja systems:
Familiarization, near attainment, attainment, and great attainment.
Four yogas are taught in the cycle of Yamari: the first, the subsequent,
The superior, and the great yoga. There are many methods such as
The four dwellings: as a sphere, as water, as form, and beyond form.
The Indestructible Tent has six branches based on family or nature.
The eight consecutive awakenings were introduced by Jalandhara.
The Kalachakra tantra is presented in a twelve-branch framework.
There is also an elaborate framework related to the purity of the major marks.
A practitioner of the visualization sequences consisting of those branches
Has received initiation and observes pledges. The place is consonant with one’s disposition.
In the beginning, one practices at night; once stability is gained, at all times.
One relies on fortitude, qualified assistants, and ritual implements.
The meditation entails both contemplative equipoise and informal contemplation.
The preliminary steps to equipoise are to appease obstructive forces, dispel adverse conditions,
And create favorable ones. For the main practice, one creates a celestial residence.

Next, one meditates on the circle of resident deities in its entirety
Using the creation methods—creation by means of the five actual awakenings, creation in four vajra steps, and creation by means of the three rites.
The first comprises moon, sun, seed-syllable, merging, and deity manifestation;
The second, emptiness, seed-syllable, deity manifestation, and syllable placement;
And the third, seed-syllable, insignia, and full manifestation of the deity’s body. completing branches include drawing in the pristine-awareness mandala,
Conferring initiation, sealing of five types, and offering with praise.
Four key elements are used as the path: form, imagination, result, and transformative power.
Having fulfilled all four, one ensures that practice leads to freedom by bringing forth
Clear images of coarse and subtle aspects in all visualizations and by making one’s pride firm.
The manifestation is that of the deity, while its essence is beyond conceptual elaborations.
One incapable of that seals the deity with emptiness by means of ascertainment
And seals it with bliss elicited by subtle and vital-essence yogas or by the wind yogas
Of the upper and lower nose-tips. When visualization becomes wearisome,
One should recollect the purity of the deity, of ultimate reality, and of self-knowing awareness.
One trains for four sessions; at the end of each, one dissolves and re-emerges.
Informal contemplation comprises the yogas of recitation, sacrificial offerings,
Eating, passion, conduct, sleep, waking up, and cleansing.
The bases to be purified are three processes: birth, death, and the intermediate state.
The death process, with its signs of dissolution of the twenty-five coarse constituents
And the three subtle constituents, is purified by fostering pristine awareness.
After luminous clarity arise the three stages of light, the eighty conceptions,
And the intermediate state, which is consciousness riding on the mount of wind.
This process is purified by different means: the three syllables on the three faculties;
The ho syllables and the nada for craving and grasping; an impression only; and so forth.

That being’s birth is influenced by various factors to which the creation methods correspond:
Urging the molten form with songs and emanation from the space accord with womb birth;
Creation by moon and sun, insignia, and merging accords with birth from an egg;
Creation by moon and seed-syllable alone, with birth from heat and moisture;
And creation of the full form instantaneously, with miraculous birth.
Creation by the five actual awakenings accords with the stages in the human womb, and so forth;
The pledge-being, with the coarse body; the pristine-awareness being, with the refined essences of channels, and so on;
The contemplation-being accords with the subtle innate body; and consecration
Of the sense fields and the three places, with the experience of sensory objects
When the potencies of the sense powers and the three faculties have strengthened.
The drawing in of the pristine-awareness deities symbolizes discernment of details;
Conferral of initiation and sealing symbolize being in one’s own family;
Offering and praise, the enjoyment of the five types of sensory objects;
Recitation symbolizes conversation; other steps, the corresponding activities;
And dissolution and re-emergence symbolize death and taking rebirth.
As to the results of purification, the celestial palace, and so forth, correspond
To the place of awakening; creation by methods, to the manner of awakening; offering, praise,
recitation, and so forth, to awakened activities and deeds.
Moreover, of the three dimensions, the creation phase possesses the entire range
Of the vast and special attributes of the manifest dimension. Thus, looking up,
The creation phase accords with the likeness of awakening; and looking down,
It accords with the likeness of cyclic life: so declared the seers of the sublime.
The creation-phase contemplations, once a special connection has developed,
Act as ripening agents for the arising of the realization of the completion phase.
The completion phase itself comprises the three, ground, path, and result,
Each having the characteristics of innateness, nonconceptuality, and totality.
The ground has two innateness aspects, the nature and the bliss from melting.
By contemplating the ground, it is made manifest at the time of the result.
The root of the path is the union of emptiness and compassion.
Emptiness means the emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects. compassion means the uncommon bliss, which does not change.

There are various formulations of the completion-phase branches.
The Guhyasamaja Root Tantra teaches six stages: body isolation,
Voice isolation, mind isolation, illusory body, luminous clarity, and union.
The first can be included in either the creation phase or vajra recitation,
So that all stages are included in the widely known five stages, namely, Vajra recitation, focus on mind, self-consecration, actual awakening, and union.
This five-stage formulation is that of the tradition of Arya Nagarjuna. In the Jnanapada system,
vital essences and winds are made workable By means of the meditations on the four vital essences,
whereupon Mind that has entered profundity, the essential nature of reality, unites inseparably with the clarity of the deity’s body, the great seal. The four yogas are shape, mantra, consecration,
and pristine awareness. Another system, the Red Yamari unelaborate completion phase, consists
Of a preliminary practice whereby elaborations are cut and powers gained;
A main practice to manifest ineffable pristine awareness; a conclusion Of six yogas (master,
compassion, root, pranayama, substance,
And Bhairava), plus a teaching on the way to dispel obstacles.
The Black Enemy tantra teaches the initial yoga of six branches;
The subsequent yoga, practiced by means of focus and examination; The complete yoga of deliberate behavior with an awareness female; And the great yoga of entering conduct through luminous clarity
And the awareness-seal. Those father tantras form the main systems.
The king of tantras presents the six branches of vajra yoga: withdrawal, Meditative absorption,
wind yoga, retention, recollection, and contemplation.
Hevajra’s esoteric-instruction system includes the path-and-fruition instructions.
Dombipa’s expertise was that of the yoga of inner fire.
Saroruha taught the three: self-consecration, entering, and re-emerging.
Samayavajra expounded the subtle yoga and yoga of the sphere. Naropa’s teachings formed Marpa’s twofold system of mixing and transference.
Mixing comprises the creation-phase trainings in forms, vital essences, and union;
And completion-phase meditations of inner fire, illusory body, and luminous clarity.
Transference consists of a main practice and an auxiliary of entering the deceased.
Maitripa’s oral teachings are known as the nine sets of the profound path.
These are all contained in the practices of inner fire, seals, and great seal.

Vyadalipa taught the way to make the life force enter the central channel
And, once it has entered, the way to develop the bliss that is unchanging.
The great adept Shantigupta’s system comprises four seals: the pledge seal,
Practiced by applying subtle and vital-essence yogas; the real action seal;
The phenomena seal on all appearances; and the great seal of six branches.
As a supplement to those, there is an introduction to the authentic view.
There are many minor teachings such as the Single Lamp.
There are three great chariot traditions of Chakrasamvara.
Luipa’s tradition has a completion phase to strike crucial points of the cause
And a second one to acquire mastery of the awakened qualities of the result.
The first is twofold, based on the emissary path and based on the yoga path.
For the yoga path, the followers of Pamtingpa use the three designations:
Gathering of vajra-beings, gathering of syllables, and gathering of vital essences,
Corresponding to the instructions on the great yoga (relaxation), instructions
On wind recitation (the coarse), and instructions on vajra recitation (the subtle).
The body of the deity, luminous clarity, and their union constitute the result.
Ghantapa’s tradition comprises five stages:
Self-consecration, vajra-cross, filling the jewel,
Jalandhara, and that of the inconceivable.
Charyadharapada taught common aspects (training in the creation phase
And in the view’s crucial points) and uncommon aspects (the yoga path
And the female-emissary path). The yoga path consists of four stages: The tantra stage of the root;
inner-fire mantra stage with equal emphasis;
Pristine-awareness stage of vital essence; and secret stage of the result. Those aspects are used as the path; twelve branch practices were taught.
The Chatuhpitha completion phase includes an uncommon creation phase
In which bliss and emptiness are mutually sealed, and a completion phase
Whose preliminary includes blocking the gateways and vajra recitation.
In its main practice, the pervading aspect consists of two yogas:
The inconceivable and the action seal; the pervaded aspect comprises
Four root instructions
(like a bull’s hoof, like a cow’s udder, a bunch Of plantain bananas, and a stupa-vase); and branch instructions.

The Mahamaya comprises the lesser yoga of shape, the profound mantra yoga,
The ultimate yoga of reality, and the auxiliary practice of the triad of illusions —
Those of daytime experiences, dreams, and the intermediate state.
The Buddhakapala system comprises practice with a focus that entails Subtle wind yoga,
vital-essence yoga with body as method, and enhancement ways;
And practice without a focus, which involves the branches of withdrawal
And absorption, plus the other four branches, which arise as their results.
The Tara Tantra: Origin of All Rites teaches four yogas:
The first yoga is the creation phase and its related aspects;
The subsequent yoga has both preliminary and main practices;
And the great yoga contains the three indestructibles.
These are primarily mother-tantra systems. There are many minor ones.
The tradition that emphasizes the tantras is that of Indian scholars and adepts.
All those systems share the key elements of requiring cultivation of the union
With training as direct cause for attaining the goal of union beyond training;
And requiring that the illusory body be dissolved and made to reappear;
And for that, the key elements of requiring cultivation of both the relative, self-consecration,
and the ultimate, luminous clarity; and for those,
Requiring that the channels, winds, and vital essences be made workable.
All completion-phase systems can therefore be contained in three key elements:
The body of oneself, to strike the crucial point related to the central channel;
The body of another, to elicit and stabilize the pristine awareness of the four joys;
And the great seal of empty form. However, in consideration of people today,
Three key elements — the relative, the ultimate, and their inseparability — are taught.
The relative aspect, the self-consecration completion phase, is twofold.
The common system is to make the channels, winds, and vital essences workable
By means of the three isolations; or the empty enclosures, vase holding, and so on.
The uncommon system is to ignite the inner fires of bliss, warmth, and no thought
So that the four joys and four empties manifest in union. From that arises
The pristine awareness of luminous clarity, and the example innate and the true.

Chandali literally means an agent of fiercely wrathful burning and vanquishing.
The general sense in sutra is the innate; in mantra, bliss, emptiness, and pristine awareness;
The hidden sense means the action, yoga, and innate forms of inner fire;
The ultimate inner fire is luminous clarity, the flame of pristine awareness.
As illustrated by the examples of illusion, everything is the illusory body.
Illusory body in its general sense means the meditation of illusion-like contemplation.
The understanding that appearances lack true existence is gained through examples.
There is a pure illusory body. From that special type dawns realization.
Wind and mind arising as the deity’s body after the luminous clarity of the four empties
Is its hidden sense, the very core, illustrated by the rainbow, reflection, and moon on water.
A link is formed through the illusory body of the union with training;
And the ultimate, utterly pure, illusory body of the deity is attained.
The remaining four of the six instructions are branches of those two.
The ultimate, the great-seal completion phase of luminous clarity, is as follows:

The true nature and what manifests during sleep and at death are the ground.
At the time of the path, the view of emptiness, the true nature, is the general sense.
The unceasing clarity of that emptiness’s own luminosity is the literal sense.
The innate joy from the winds dissolving in the central channel is the hidden sense;
Accompanied by duality, it is the example luminous clarity; without duality, the true.
Nonconceptual pristine awareness brings about realization and the ultimate result.
In the many meditation methods such as total apprehension and successive destruction,
To elicit correctly the luminous clarity in its hidden sense requires giving rise
To the experience of winds having entered, abided, and dissolved in the central channel.
The eight freedoms are based on steps in the way to enter luminous clarity.
Although the name used is the same, the meanings are unique to this way.
The inseparability of emptiness and compassion is union in its general sense.
Being without the conceptual differentiation as two is union in its literal sense.
The special stage, the one taste of emptiness and great bliss, and the inseparability of illusory body and luminous-clarity mind itself, is union in its hidden sense.
The three empties arising and passing in the forward and reverse orders
Is the union with training; the union beyond training is the opposite of that.
The meditation method is to arise from the luminous-clarity state as the illusory body,
Like the flash of a fish as it springs from water. What arises is the real or a similitude.

[Nyingma]
Here, amidst the snowy mountain ranges, there are eight practice lineages
That emphasize the esoteric instructions. From those, the early translation Nyingma
Has many meditation sequences in the three yogas,
But they are subsumed in two main kinds: with and without characteristics.
The Magical Manifestation tradition has two systems with characteristics: method and liberation.
The common technique of the upper door in the path of method uses six chakras.
The special technique involves Samantabhadra and Samantabhadrī,
And the pure union of melting and controlling of great pervasion.
The lower door with four branches refines all at once.
The path of liberation has gradual and instantaneous realizers.
In the former, the view goes before.
Meditative absorption is devotional meditation and
Definitive completion, training until the ultimate five experiences.
There are five objects of meditation that correspond to
The three stages of birth, intermediate state, and death:
Great emptiness, compassion-illusion, single mudra, elaborate mudra, and assembly practice.
That further has both coarse and subtle modes of refinement.
Creation phase involves three absorptions and the coarse form.
Having attained proficiency in eight measures of clarity and stability,
Mandalas, clusters, numbers, and faces and arms emanate.
Five excellences lay the foundation of practice,
And four branches of approach and attainment straighten the approach.
Awareness-holder of the desire or form realms is accomplished in six months or so.
The dissipating five paths purify the habitual patterns of samsara.
Completing the fruition, they cause the ripening of the higher paths,
Which is the cause of attaining the four types of nondissipating awareness-holder.
In completion phase, drawing energy-mind into the central channel is great emptiness.
Meditate on luminous clarity day and night by two ways of placement.
Compassion arises from liberation in illusory forms of emptiness.
The divine form of melting bliss seals,
The single form proliferates, and clusters emanate throughout space.
The assembly practice and three mudras are the perpetuating cause
Of attaining the nondual kaya of the path of training.
Meditation without characteristics is settling into the suchness of reality.
In anuyoga, the path of upper and lower skillful methods produces great bliss.

In the path of liberation one rests the mind just like that, in reality just as it is.
This is entrance consistent with the meaning, without characteristics.
Environment and inhabitants are mandala circles created just by mantra,
Like fish jumping out of water, clear and distinct.
This is explained as entrance through syllables, with characteristics.
The path of definitive completion in general is both dissipating and nondissipating.
It consists of the five yogas, such as “aspiring attitude,” and so on.
In the mind class, all relative phenomena, however they appear,
Are the expression of reality fully complete in the awakening mind.
This conveys to basic space free of identification as appearance or awareness.
Therefore, appearance is mind, and mind is pristine awareness.
By resting in the natural state, delusion is directly liberated in itself.
Since there is no experience of meditation nor of its absence,
One rests in dharmakāya, the awareness-emptiness of natural appearance without bias.
The conclusive points of the space class are subsumed and fully contained in
“Unmistaken, uncontrived, unimaginable, and free of intellect. ”
Natural openness, unwavering, drawing up, and not touching;
These four vital points are the modes for pristine awareness, basic space, bliss, and reality.
They make the clarity, emptiness, and so on of the four empowerments into the path.
To summarize, rest in reality without deliberate activity.
Experiences of abiding, unwavering, evenness, and spontaneous presence
Are posited by Garab as the four experiences of the mind and space paths.
Primordially pure trekchö and spontaneously present tögal are
Esoteric instructions that make the reality of emptiness and appearance fall away.
Abiding in four modes of liberation, naturally occurring awareness itself
Is recognized, and decided with confidence.
As enhancement one does yoga such as the threefold sky.
The sound of four elements, delineating samsara and nirvana,
And preliminaries of three doors is the training with three leaders.
Three vital points of physical support, basic space guidance, and
Objective visionary appearances; specifically from the path of four lamps,
Four visionary appearances will convey to the level of falling away.
Three restings grasp the extent, strike with the nail of three attainments.
Demonstrating the measure of liberation with fourfold confidence is breakthrough.

[Kadampa]
The general Kadam practice is four deities, Three Baskets,
And three trainings; the special esoteric instruction system is
Five recollections: guru, deity, mantra, compassion, and emptiness.
As extensions of that, the relative and
Ultimate sixteen vital essences are integrated on the path.
Three traditions combined into one: the stages of the path to awakening
Has four greatnesses and reliance on a root spiritual mentor.
Contemplating human life, impermanence, and suffering of bad existences,
Desiring one’s own emancipation, one goes for refuge in the Three Jewels.
The eight concerns are naturally liberated and faith is totally pure.
This is the meditation on the stages of the path for a person of small scope.
Believing in cause and effect, seeing the problems of samsara,
With an attitude of genuine desire to eliminate its cause, karma and affliction,
One pursues emancipation, certainty of release, and pure discipline.
This is the meditation on the stages of the path for a person of medium scope.
Great love and compassion for all mother sentient beings
Engenders the awakening mind. Six perfections and four modes of attraction
Enact one’s own and others’ welfare with totally pure noble intention.
This is the meditation on the stages of the path for a person of great scope.
The Buddha’s words that are intended for higher states, definite goodness, and mahayana
Are considered to be included in this path of three stages.
The special branch is the enhancement of compassion
By the kinds of mind training to exchange oneself for others.

[Lamdré]
Supreme Precious Words with four oral transmissions and four authentic qualities.
First, the path of samsara and nirvana in common has five.
Impure, yogic experience, and pure—
These three appearances provide the path’s foundation.
One maintains the view of samsara and nirvana inseparable in the causal continuum.
As the method continuum, one meditates on the profound path connected with the four empowerments.
The qualities of five kāyas and awarenesses arise in the result continuum.
All practice without exception is known through the three continua.
Scripture, narrative, esoteric instruction, and experiential practice:
These four authentic qualities and four transmissions cut through doubts.
Outer, inner, secret, suchness, and ultimate—
Five interdependent connections demarcate the path.
The worldly path of the stiff wheel has two:
The seven esoteric instructions and dispelling obstructions of the path.
Three gatherings of the constituents apply to the seven impartials.
Three modes of mental abiding are realized as the immediate cause of meditative absorption.
Whatever arises of three experiences is meditative absorption.
What has arisen is maintained as it occurs, whether or not the three warmths [arise in order].
Three modes of guidance distinguish the particular experiences.
The demarcations are known by applying three examples to three gatherings.
Three interdependent connections contain all causes and conditions, freeing one from hope and fear.
Two yogins that fall into partiality have four obstacles,
Eight protections, and fourteen in common.
Seventy great vital points, six instructions,
And the mandala circle dispel obstructions on the path.
In summary, the path of four empowerments has eight views and culminations of attainment.
Faults are qualities, and obstacles are taken up as spiritual powers.
When whatever appears is understood as experience, one is naturally liberated
And reaches the culmination of accomplishment on the transcendent path of the spinning wheel.

[Marpa Kagyu]
Master Marpa’s precious Kagyus
Teach the stages of the abiding nature of things, the path, and the result
In vajra lines that summarize the meaning of the highest yoga tantra.
The two abiding natures are coarse, subtle, and very subtle.
Three lights all are empty, luminous mind.
Aggregates, constituents, channels, vital essences, and native body are the ground.
The four states are what is to be refined, and the path that refines them
Is the four root dharmas with their two branches.
The literal meanings of the Six Dharmas have a textual tradition of both sutra and mantra.
Their general meaning is common and special; their hidden meaning is experience and realization.
Ultimately, they are concordant with training and the actual experience beyond training.
The particular meditation topics are the coemergent pristine awareness of
Bliss-, appearance-, awareness-, and clarity-emptiness, of three times, and of inseparability.
They refine the six aggregates and constituents, and actualize the six families.
The pillar of the path is inner heat: emptiness is the outer,
Short a is the inner, and union is the secret inner heat.
They sever elaborations, are the practice, and unite one with the state of supreme bliss.
What is targeted are the three channels and four chakras.
The energy currents are held by four applications and five vital points.
The vital essences of melting bliss are joined and bound without emission.
At the time of the ground, inner heat resides at the navel or secret place as substance, mantra,
and pristine awareness.
It ignites through visualizations, energy currents, and skillful methods. For that, meditate on the path of total liberation using the upper door of one’s own body
With the vital points of body, time, and object.
There is bliss, heat, nonthought, and pristine awareness, with enhancement.
Find another’s body and experience the bliss of sexual union.
Ten signs, qualities, appearance-emptiness, and bliss-emptiness Are all produced by inner heat,
and to enhance the path is illusory body.
The seven are examples, dream, intermediate state,
Luminous clarity, emanations, pristine awareness, and illusion,
With divisions of two, three, four, or more.
The practice is to see that impure phenomena are like the eight examples.
The pure is to train with the display of the deities, mantras, and pristine awareness.

The totally pure has time, method, cause, manifestation, and essence: Five distinctions and three isolations that have preceded.
Without characteristics, through the force of blessings,
Illusory body is born from the pristine awareness of mahāmudrā
And manifests to intrinsic awareness.[*1*]
After accomplishing the root yoga with characteristics,
Through action- and pristine awareness-mudra, the cause of the inexhaustible body
[Arises after] the progressive and reverse order of the three lights As the kāya of the quintessential mind-energy adorned by major and minor marks.
Postmeditation is appearances and such, integrated on the path.
The third of five stages, forms of emptiness of individual withdrawal and meditative stability
Are the meaning of mahāmudrā, so are hidden elsewhere.
The measure, dream, is divided into example, meaning, and the end of time.
The esoteric instructions of recognizing, training, and combining Ascertain appearance,
including death, to be like that.
Luminous clarity, the heart, is twofold: example and actual, experience and realization,
Or classified as four or five, such as natural, and so on.
In practice, luminous clarity at the time of the ground is introduced. At the time of the path,
vital points of the support and supported are bound;
Outer, inner, and common manifest awakenings are manifest.
Of the five occasions, sleep time is taken as the example.
The arising of illusory body with instant or subsequent dissipation Stabilizes recognition and the actual result is perfected.
Of all intermediate states, existence is assurance.
The best ones recognize luminous clarity, the middling refine the energy of illusory body,
The lowest block the entrance to wombs and choose.
The escort on the path for highest, middling, and lowest faculties Is transference in luminous clarity, illusory body, and creation phase.
It is explained that an auxiliary is entering from residence to residence. The ultimate result is actualizing the six dharmas.

Sutra tradition is freedom from elaborations,
Mantra tradition of bliss-emptiness mahāmudrā is special due to coemergence and empowerment.
In general, of the three traditions of Sutra, Mantra, and Essence,
The first is perfection of wisdom in essence and mahāmudrā in name. Its aspects are consistent with mantra.
The abiding nature of the ground is without bias, free of extremes of elaboration.
Not experiencing delusion or liberation, it pervades everywhere like the sky.
The mode of delusion appears but is not real; mere appearance itself Is the great play of three kāyas—arising, abiding, and ceasing.
At the time of the path, coemergent mind itself is dharmakāya, Coemergent appearance is dharmakāya’s light.
No distraction, no meditation, without fabrication in the native state. Liberation from four strayings and three deviations.
Beyond the four joys and three conditions, three ways of arising Make the connection and one traverses the four stages of yoga. Understanding the view and gaining experience through meditation,
Realization is perfected and fruition is attained right now.
The mantra tradition arises from the path of skillful methods.
The essence is the descent of vajra pristine awareness Simultaneously ripening and liberating those of highest faculties. Pakdru turned the dharma wheel in five practices:
Refuge, bodhicitta, devotion, creation-completion, and dedication.
The Karmapas introduce the three kāyas and
The Drukpas emphasize the eight great instructions and so forth.
In the tradition of Rechungpa and other holders of the hearing lineage teaching system,
The root of all is mahāmudrā and the six dharmas.

[Shangpa Kagyu]
The Shangpa tradition has three stages: exegesis, debate, and practice. The latter is the five cycles of Ni, Dhi, Maitrī, Abhaya, and Rāhula, Along with miscellaneous fragments.
The main practices are Niguma’s Five Golden Dharmas.
Having refined one’s being with the hollow interior, the exceptional purifier,
With fierce and gentle breathing exercises of inner heat, the root, Consume it as food, wear it as clothing, spread it as a seat, and ride it as a horse.
Devotion, the deity’s form, and the six classes arise as illusion. Through lucid dreaming, four empowerments, and nine unerring vital points,
Dreams are recognized, refined, and ascertained; liberating actions are mastered.
By root, branches, leaves, and flowers,
Light and deep luminous clarity integrates the three kāyas.
There is transference of suchness, union, blessing force, and Higher through the path of the unerring celestial realm.
By dharmakāya, saṃbhogakāya, nirmāṇakāya and the unerring general point,
One is liberated in the three intermediate states according to level of faculties.
Preliminaries are to develop calm abiding and higher insight by three naturally settled states.
The main practice is introduction and four faults liberated in their own place.
Concluding practices are the natural arising of awareness, clarity, and emptiness as the three kāyas.
This is the trunk of the dharma, mahāmudrā.
Whatever appears is the guru, appearance and sound are deity and mantra,
Appearance is mind, illusion, and dream.
Devotion, pure perception, and unreal; this is the dharma of integration, the branches.
The flowers are Red and White Khecarī, a stream of compassion Evoked by exalted supplication. In the four chakras Desire is liberated and the lamp of bliss-emptiness blazes intensely. One’s mind is unborn and so does not die.
The body itself is inert, not a basis for attributing “death.”
Bound in unerring basic space, this is said to be the fruit.
Sukha’s six dharmas, the practice of four deities together,
Guru and protector inseparable, and so on—many profound teachings.

[Zhijé and Chöd]
Pacification of the three sufferings is the ground.
Removing three, limitless beings obtaining three freedoms is the path. Total freedom from obscurations, dwelling in equalness is the fruition. Since it pacifies suffering, the general term is used specifically.
The first transmission was five instructions by example.
Defining characteristic lineages are sky-like:
Relative, absolute, unity, and non-abiding.
Father tantra is vajra-like: yogic exercise,
Vajra repetition, and mental control of energy lead to luminous clarity. Mother tantra is lotus-like: blazing, melting,
Retaining, reversing, and spreading make one unsullied by fault. Mahamudra symbol lineage is elixir-like empowerment,
Introduction, integration as path, and one comment on the unborn. The ḍākinī symbol lineage is wheel-like:
Shooting, falling, spinning, and settling.
Integrating the intermediate state as the path, and timely action.
The middle Ma system is based on meaning and word lineages,
Sixteen guidances and vital points introduce and cut off misconceptions.
The So system is nakedly seeing awareness, with three vital points.
The Kam system is the guidance in the meaning of the Heart Sutra, and so on.
Principally, in the last, the system of the bodhisattva Kunga,
There are white, red, and black guidances in the cycle engendering experience.
In the red guidance, the general preliminary severs attachment.
The special accomplishes the path’s foundation, accumulates, and purifies.
In the main part, the foundation act is possession of three vows,
Keeping the six restraints of yoga undamaged.

The agent is the path. Mind training on the path of accumulation
Lays the foundation. When refined by austerities on the path of application,
The secret activity of deliberate behavior is the connecting branch.
Subsequent activity is the path of seeing, equal flavor is the path of meditation,
Freedom from action is the path of consummation; these are produced by way of exertion.
The fruition is finding one’s own mind to be the totally pure four kāyas.
Clearing obstructions, enhancement practice, and the crucial approach to accomplishment.
One to one, one three, and one to one.
Severance of evil object is the activity of the profound perfection of wisdom.
Famous as the combination of sutric and tantric realization,
Abiding in emptiness, not forsaking beings, acting according to one’s word,
And the sugatas’ blessing: these four are the meaning of the doctrine.
Exceptional accumulations, incurring the crucial blessings,
Searching the mind, methods of settling, and opening the door to the sky
Introduce the Mother’s meaning. Objects, mind, attachment, and self
Severed in space. Alternating peaceful and wrathful equalizes. There is enhancement, uprising,
indications of success, and consummation.

[Jordruk]
Six branches are plainly presented in the extensive root tantras,
The vajrayoga that is the final destination of completion phase. Practicing with threefold confidence,
The complete deity’s form with fourfold disregard is the approach,
The main practices of withdrawal, meditative stability, vital energy control, and retention are near attainment,
Through recollection of desire, great passion is the attainment,
And in meditative absorption, the sublime pristine awareness body is great attainment.[*2*]
The vital points of gazing and binding the functions Sever all connections individually, drawing consciousnesses inward. The faculties of pristine awareness interact with five alternate objects.
The cessation of the mandalas of method and wisdom completes the ten signs.
With form and mind resting in equipoise, the five branches of meditative stability are complete;
Apparent images are endowed with three certainties and five properties.
Refining the channel pathways, vital energy enters into the dhūti.
If unable to bind it with the vase breath, forceful methods are to block it
At the lower door, release it upwards, and taste the inner elixir.
Blazing blends the vital and downward-clearing energies and immortality is attained.
Through retention that is unwavering and without coming and going, The blended energy currents dissolve into the indestructible vital essence.
Vital energy enters the forehead and is stabilized without emission. According to differences in vital essence of three levels of faculties,
Real recollection is action-mudra, awareness-mudra, or mahāmudrā of forms of bliss-emptiness.
Analogous recollection is refining the energy currents in the preliminaries,
And then awareness-mudra, the blazing of inner heat, and so forth.
Transformation into meditative absorption of melting bliss without emission is accomplished.
In the real one, through the arising and reversal of the ten signs of mahāmudrā,
The forms of emptiness of melting bliss are bound at the tip of the jewel,
Causing the seminal fluids and energy currents to cease.
Beginning with the first immutable instant until the twelfth spiritual level,
Breathing ceases and unchanging joy increases proportionally.
This is union, the embodiment of wisdom and method.
The path, the demarcations, and increasing the yoga without diminishing
Are added as supplementary branches.

The manner of cause and result of those yogas is that
Those virtuous at the beginning accomplish meditative absorption of calm abiding and higher insight,
Those in the middle blend energy and mind and open the chakras,
Those virtuous at the end accomplish the unchanging pristine awareness kāya.
The descent of vajra pristine awareness causes various experiences —
Jumping, shaking, and pain—releasing the knots of the three doors.
The six chakras are purified and the victors of six families accomplished.
[Dorjé sumgyi nyendrup]
Approach and Attainment is the oral transmission of the Vajra Queen. Approach of vajra Body purifies the body’s channels.
With three postures, hold the upper, lower, and middle energy currents.
Once ten currents enter the dhūti, forms of emptiness are seen. Attainment of vajra Speech purifies speech energy currents.
Using vital energy control, downward-clearing, joining, and vajra repetition,
Entering the vital essence accomplishes all great activities.
Great attainment of vajra Mind purifies mind and vital essence.
The blazing of three fires in the heightened passion of method and wisdom
Refines the refuse and achieves unchanging bliss.
The view is the way it is, meditation is the three vajras, and The fruition is purifying the three obscurations and introducing the three kāyas.
[Supplement: Śāntigupta]
The great adept Śāntigupta’s guidances of Six Transmissions Are creation phase, mahāmudrā, inner heat, luminous clarity,
Action-mudra, and miscellaneous esoteric instructions, and more.
Clearing away obstructions and enhancing is crucial in all completion phase [practices].

A spiritual path is, in essence, a passage that allows one to traverse to more sublime states.

Paths can be analyzed as the three approaches, as corruptible or incorruptible, and so forth;
although there are many such analyses, the most common format accepted by everyone is that of five paths.

As for the derivation of the term, it is a “path” because it is the basis of what is to be traversed.

For śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, the path (involving progress) is actual, while the fruition is nominally imputed.
For the Mahāyāna, the path is imputed, while the fruition
(the consummation of that progress) is actual; direct realization is actual, while its preparatory paths are imputed.

The path of accumulation is composed of positive factors that anticipate liberation.

The basis being characterized is one of striving at hearing teachings, meditating, and so forth.

Cultivation of the applications of mindfulness, aspects of correct renunciation, and bases of supernormal powers—this path has three degrees (that is, initial, intermediate, and final).
Alternatively, this path is analyzed into four stages, that of the beginner and so forth.

There are three distinctive features: onset, dependence, and what one focuses on.

More overt factors are eliminated, and the lack of identity is realized in a theoretical way.

On the basis of spiritual potential, attitude, and conduct, one is endowed with five qualities.
One gains the ongoing qualities of deeper levels of insight, levels of deeper discernment, and meditative absorption.

In these degrees (initial, intermediate, and final), the Four
Truths and two levels of truth are mentally embraced, which causes one to turn away from the four kinds of erroneous opinions and the conception of things as real; counterproductive factors are eliminated, while positive qualities are aroused and increased; the eight thought patterns are eliminated, and meditative absorption is brought to a one-pointed focus.

As for the derivation of the term, this path involves the accumulation of positive factors to make one a suitable recipient; it is also the path that anticipates liberation, that of faith, and that of direct confrontation.

The path of linkage provides the context for the direct realization of what is ultimate.

It is the sublime intelligence that derives from meditation in a mundane framework.

While there are many ways to analyze this path (such as the natural progression of dedicated intent), once timeless awareness is experienced as the onset of meditative warmth, with the stirring of fundamentally positive factors, one gains patient acceptance of the profound nature of phenomena and the highest mundane experience.
These four phases involve the cultivation of five governing powers and five strengths, one group for each pair of phases.

The distinctive features are: those in whom it awakens, what level it entails, and what one focuses on.

There is elimination since the obscuring layer of conceptual labeling is done away with; and there is involvement through a process of realizing the two ways in which any independent nature is lacking.

One is endowed with qualities such as experiencing no interruption and no falling.

The misperception of things having identity is eliminated, and there is the onset of the first level.

As for the derivation of the terms, these are “phases that anticipate the decisive breakthrough,”
“engagement through firm conviction,” and “linkage” to the direct realization of ultimate reality.

The path of seeing is the fresh new perception of suchness,…

…a transcendent harmony of calm abiding and deeper insight…

…that is indivisible in its very essence.
One trains primarily in the seven aids to enlightenment.

The factors to be eliminated on the path of seeing are 88, 94, 112, and so forth. It is held that they are eliminated through processes that cause the cessation of prior influences and cause new influences to come into being, and through the awakening of nondual timeless awareness.

There are four distinctive features: onset, dependence, the way realization occurs, and sequential steps.

How things are is perceived directly; how many there are is realized in some appropriate manner.

There is freedom from five states of fear, and there are twelve hundredfold qualities.

This frees one from conditioned existence and ensures one’s gaining the level of nirvāṇa.

This is incorruptible virtue, the antidote involving elimination, the initial arousal.
The derivation of the term lies in the direct experience of what is free of elaboration.

The path of meditation involves situations in which one becomes familiar with distinctive states.

That direct realization is integrated into one’s ongoing experience.

The corruptible path of meditation can be understood from the foregoing discussions.
For the incorruptible transcendent path, the working bases are those of the śrāvaka,
pratyekabuddha,
and bodhisattva.
It includes four pathways: that of linkage, that without obstacles, that of complete freedom,
and that of distinctive features. In essence, it is of greater, middling, or lesser degrees.
Analyzed as to what is becoming familiar (that is, meditative equipoise or postmeditation awareness), it is twofold.
One trains in the eightfold path of noble ones.

The 414 factors to be eliminated on the path of meditation are removed through antidotes.
The distinctive features are those in whom it awakens, what level it entails, and what one focuses on.

It is the cognitive obscurations that are primarily eliminated, and the actual nature of phenomena is truly realized.

The distinctive qualities continue to increase.

One traverses the ten successive levels, becoming free of latent obscurations.

The term derives from the process of bringing familiarity with realization.

In the path of consummation, there is direct realization of the consummate degree of what is cultivated in meditation.

The basis underlying these characteristics is the vajralike samādhi at the very threshold of enlightenment, the level of
Total Illumination, and so forth.

This path is analyzed according to three approaches, two paths, three levels, and so forth.
The ten factors that require no more training are included within the five incorruptible components.

The nature includes those in whom it awakens, what level it entails, and what one focuses on.

All hindrances having been eliminated, there is realization of reality just as it is and of things in all their multiplicity.

The qualities, both common and especial, are inconceivable.

This makes evident the kāyas and aspects of timeless awareness without exception.

As for the derivation of the terms, these are “the foundation of incorruptible virtue,”
“the antidote to conditioned existence,” and the completion of both the journey and the training.

As for the levels, in the broadest sense these are of two kinds: those of freedom from attachment and those of buddhahood.

The levels are called those of “spiritual potential,” “the eighth,” “seeing,” “subtlety,”
“freedom,” “realization,” “the śrāvaka,” and “the pratyekabuddha.”

There are said to be ten bodhisattva levels in the Mahāyāna approach.

There are distinctions concerning supernormal powers, levels of deeper discernment, realization,
meditation, insight, language, spiritual teaching, benefit ensured, and nirvāṇa.
Extensive Explanation of the Levels Associated with

In essence, these levels are the foundation for superior qualities.

The basis for what is so characterized is the unity of means and awareness in the ongoing experience of one undergoing training.

As for the derivation of the term, it implies “support,”
“attainment,” “dispensing with,” and “proceeding further and further.”

The analysis concerns ordinary individuals and spiritually advanced beings; the four ways in which attainment comes through intent, application, realization, and accomplishment; nonaccomplishment versus accomplishment; and pride, whether a good deal, little, or none.

The Utterly Joyful One, The Immaculate One, The
Illuminating One, The Radiant One,
The One Who Meets the Challenge, The One Who Makes
Evident, The One Who Has Gone Far, The Immutable One,
The One of Brilliant Intelligence, The Cloud of Dharma—…

…with thorough training, one progresses in stages.

One engages primarily in the specific transcendent perfections of the ten levels, generosity and so forth.
These entail pure view and discipline, meditative equipoise, an absence of preconceptions,
attainment of intelligence, refinement, maturation, complete perfection, and empowerment.

On six levels there are the three higher trainings, while on four the results of these are ensured.
With the realization of the actual nature of phenomena, five components of practice are successively refined.

Endowed with three causes, what is fundamentally positive becomes ever purer.
Cognitive obscurations are gradually eliminated, and ten aspects of timeless awareness are ensured.

One gains qualities from the first level, with its twelve hundredfold qualities, to the tenth,
where these qualities are as incalculable as the atoms in the universe.
From the eighth level onward there are the ten kinds of control over longevity and so forth, and on the tenth one receives the “empowerment of supreme radiance.”
One takes rebirth through the power of karma, aspirations, meditative absorption, and mastery.
Those abiding on these levels take rebirth, as a natural consequence, as world rulers.

Although they are alike with respect to meditative equipoise, due to distinctions in the certain knowledge gained in postmeditation and the thorough training, there are definitely ten levels.
The foregoing constitutes the first part concerning the paths and levels in the cause-based dialectical approach.

In the tantric approach, the ordinary methods of spiritual practice accord with those of the sūtra approach, while the more unique ones are those embellished by supreme bliss.

In particular, one invokes timeless awareness by meditating on the stages of development and completion.
In the initial degree of the path of accumulation, meditative equipoise consists of these two stages, while in postmeditation benefit is ensured by applying the methods of the tantras.
In the intermediate degree, meditation does not falter, even in dreams, while one gains the final degree through the realization that brings one mastery of timeless awareness.

Striving at practicing the stage of completion, through the realization associated with the three successive steps of subtle experience, one gains the meditative warmth of the path of linkage;…

…through the practice of karmamudrā comes the greatest degree of complete attainment.
The consummate experience that foreshadows the actual state of utter lucidity is a constant presence.
On the basis of that, one’s subtle energy and mind are realized in the embodiment of the deity:
this is the peak experience.
Until the eighty overt patterns of thought have been eliminated,…
…one trains in the twenty-four sacred sites and joins the gathering of vajra heralds, and so the subtle elements of pujā o a are arrested within the central channel: this is the first level on the path of linkage.
In a similar manner, there are secondary sites—Go, Ra, De,
Ma,
Kā, O, Tri, Ko, Ka, Lam, Kā, Hi,
Pre, Gṛ, Sau, Su, Na, Si, Ma, and Ku— known as Domain, Inner Domain, Intent, Inner Intent,
Gathering, Inner Gathering, Charnel Ground, and Inner
Charnel Ground; these points in the body are purified in pairs. One traverses ten levels.
Quenching of Thirst and Inner Quenching of Thirst are assigned to the enlightened embodiment of timeless awareness on the path of seeing….

…At that point, in both meditative equipoise and postmeditation, due to the conduct of the ongoing cycle of bliss and emptiness, that of the consort, one gains patient acceptance. With the awakening of manifest timeless awareness, there is the highest mundane experience….

…The third step is that of innate awareness; one uninterruptedly perceives the ultimate state of utter lucidity.
One has received the empowerment into nirmāṇakāya and eliminated the potential for ordinary thought.
The enlightened embodiment of nondual timeless awareness is achieved.

The factors eliminated on the path of meditation are analyzed into nine degrees of the three successive steps of subtle experience, lesser and greater.
With progressive elimination, the most subtle aspects of mind, mental events, and of the mind-body aggregates, sense fields, and components of perception are transformed….

…At the final limit of the continuum of this path, one receives empowerment from the sambhogakāya.
There is no more training.

In the Kālacakra tradition, through the stage of development and the process of consolidation,
one traverses the final degree of the path of accumulation….

…Meditative stability brings one to meditative warmth.
Harnessing and channeling subtle energy brings one to the intermediate degree; attention, to the greater degree.
Recollection brings one to the peak experience, and meditative absorption to patient acceptance and the highest mundane experience.

On this path there are twelve lower, or conceptually designated, levels.
At that point, beginning with aging and death back to ignorance, the twelve links and their attendant subtle energies are arrested. With each group of three, one of the situations of ordinary body, speech, mind, and thought patterns based on attachment is eliminated.
The four vajras of the path are accomplished. The eleventh level brings patient acceptance, the twelfth the highest mundane experience,…

…while the final moment constitutes the path of seeing, the enlightened embodiment of timeless awareness.

At that point, this serves as the foundation for superior qualities, these special levels being those of “Total Illumination,”
“Nectar,” “Space,” the lights of “Vajra,” “Jewel,” and “Lotus,” “Activity,”
“Incomparable,” “Endowed with Metaphor,” “Light of Sublime
Intelligence,” “Omniscience,” and “Pure Discerning Awareness.”
These twelve are attained simultaneously.
These are distinct aspects that remain present until buddhahood.

Next is the path of meditation: the level of Abode, or The
Utterly Joyful One, and the rest.
Since the transcendent branches are in equal measure, one traverses, just as one wishes, the levels that are the supreme higher context.

The consummation is the swift attainment of the actual state of Vajrasattva.
This especially exalted tradition is the presentation of the
Great Venerable One.

In the widely known tradition of the past, from Rangjung
Gyalwa and others,…

…receiving empowerment, practicing development and completion, practicing with conviction,
having meditative experiences that are still corruptible yet nonetheless excellent, and integrating sense pleasures into the path, one traverses the beginner’s level and the path of accumulation….

…With a foreshadowing and the experience of the hidden meaning of the illusory body, through the four descending gradations of joy, one traverses the level of practicing out of a sense of dedication and the four phases of the path of linkage….

…One beholds the actual state of utter lucidity.

With the stabilizing of subtle vital essence in an ascending manner, there is the experience of primordial unity that still involves training: the path of meditation….

…No more training is consummation—the actual enlightened embodiment of timeless awareness.
The stages are due to the actions of beginners practicing by bringing this into their experience.
The progress is either developmental or nonlinear.

One attains these levels through the successive moments of supreme and unchanging bliss, which derives from the passion of sublime intelligence.
The first step stabilizes the masculine and feminine essences in the glans and the crown of the head.
A single breath is arrested and nonduality is beheld.
Whatever is perceived is experienced as bliss, and one gains powerful mastery of the world.

In succession, 1,800 moments are completed.
An equal number of expressions of the subtle energy of karma are arrested, as is ignorance.
In the lower half of the secret cakra and the upper half of the very crown of the head, the masculine and feminine essences are stabilized, and the lesser gradation of joy and emptiness is perfected.
One attains the first level, named Abode and The Utterly
Joyful One.
A single blockage is freed and ascent to the first level achieved.
One becomes a foremost and supreme master of generosity.
Next, in ten series of 1,800 moments there is successive completion and successive arrest.
The six cakras are stabilized by halves, with three blockages freed in each.
With the freeing of a final one, through ascent in stages, there is total completion of the twelve aspects of the meaning of truth and 21,600 moments of unchanging bliss.
In like number, the twelve junctures, the expressions of subtle energy, and the twelve links of interdependent origination (the cycle of conditioned existence) are arrested.
The full moon at the very crown of the head and the sun in the glans are stabilized.
The furthest limit of the transcendent perfections is reached, and the processes of elimination and realization are thoroughly completed.
There is the completion of the sixteen degrees of joy and emptiness, and so sixteen levels of realization; these are subsumed within the former ones.

In conjunction with spiritual instructions, there are other methods of classifying the paths and levels, whose distinct features should be learned from their individual sources.
The foregoing constitutes the second part concerning the paths and levels in the fruition-based
Vajrayāna.

In general terms, conduct (as an auxiliary aspect of the spiritual path) is said to be conduct free of the passions on the lower level, that of the transcendent perfections in the greater context,
and that of desire and passion for those inspired by a profound approach.

If the latter (all that is explained in the tantras) is summarized,…

…it is of three kinds: elaborate, unelaborate, and extremely unelaborate.
To analyze it by environment, it pertains to households, charnel grounds, and sacred realms.
As for the mode, there is the conduct of eliminating duality, of complete nobility, and of total victory.

In emphasizing tantras of skillful means, there are two distinct modes: that of intent and involvement, and that of reliance and training.

For a beginning practitioner, activities such as those between practice sessions constitute the guidelines for training in intent and involvement….

…Single, twofold, or threefold modes: by relying on and training in these, one engages in conduct through alternation or combination.
Sense pleasures are meditated to be the vajra goddesses, arousing delight in the mind.
Between practice sessions, incorporate the sense faculties and their objects into one’s path;
this is the cause for the spiritual deportment of pure awareness.

Attributes, fellow practitioners, and song, dance, and other creative activities may be extensive or play a minor role, or one may rely solely on meditative absorption.
In essence, this is a developmental process from an elaborate mode to others.

The distinctions concerning one’s involvement in conduct include what one’s mind delights in,
and one’s age, intelligence, material possessions, and degree of desire.

Moreover, these three modes of conduct become nine in light of three contexts: activities,
meditation and contemplation, and occasion.
The mother tantras emphasize the spiritual deportment of pure awareness.

In general, the essence of this lies in the distinctive activities of the three avenues,
bringing enhancement through stable meditative absorption.

The occasion is when, through the stage of development, one’s chosen deity grants permission,
one is not overwhelmed by harmful events, one’s meditative stability is not shaken by circumstances,
one is equally indifferent to the eight mundane values, and sense pleasures are experienced as supports.
This constitutes meditative warmth of the lower degree of the stage of completion.
It brings the intermediate degree, with its accomplishment of the gazes of annihilation, and the highest degree, with that of the gazes of nurturing and the rest, and so is endowed with unlimited potential.
There are five specific occasions: to gain states of ordinary attainment due to one’s mastery of timeless awareness; to gain the ultimate state of a master of awareness, which is the fourth yoga of the stage of completion; to gain the enlightened embodiment that comes with the attainment of meditative warmth; and to experience the state of primordial unity with more training or no more training. There are two cases involving necessity.

The purpose is that of ensuring complete accomplishment of the two kinds of spiritual attainment and of causing those attainments to flourish and swiftly be brought to consummation.
Due to the specific variables concerning consorts (such as essence and number), one’s realization of the unity of supreme bliss and emptiness occurs in specific ways.

As for the way in which one engages in conduct, that of avadhūti is predominantly unelaborate,
that of complete nobility is balanced, and that of total victory is primarily elaborate.
The first two apply to the path of linkage and the latter to the path of the spiritually advanced,
but all three can be found in both ordinary individuals and spiritually advanced beings.

The environments for engaging in conduct are distinct locations, major sacred sites, and similar places.
In the conduct of the father tantras, one does not roam through such environments.

As for companions, practitioners of the stage of completion are unbiased, while practitioners of the stage of development ascertain that these are of like type, while for both stages there are those whose attainment comes from training and others.

The attitude has five points: the two kinds of benefit, absence of fixation, loving-kindness,
and generosity.

The frame of reference for practitioners of the stage of development is deity yoga, while for practitioners of the stage of completion, it is integrated with one’s awareness of utter lucidity,
the unity of bliss and emptiness.

One wears the attributes of the deity,…

…seeks permission, and performs prostrations and so forth.

One appreciates the equal taste of good and bad in a nonconceptual frame of mind.

The guidelines of training are: not to show disrespect, not to express anger, not to transgress,
and other such admonitions; to engage in conduct for beginning practitioners and in any situation whatsoever without fear; to give up rituals, certainty, and the like; and to acquire the means of gaining stability.
Not performing prostrations and so forth, one gains great stability.

The qualities are limitless….

…Initially, one engages in conduct in secret.
With stability comes that of avadhūti, which is carried out secretly in disguise; with the intermediate degree of meditative warmth, that of complete nobility (that is, the conduct of engaging fully in the world); and with the greater degree of warmth, that of total victory in all ways.

In particular, elaborate conduct in gaṇacakras involves the practice of accomplishment concerning the maṇḍala
.
Through symbolic song and dance, one partakes of the inner fire ritual and engages in the union of equipoise, embracing the pleasures of the senses.
In the Cakrasaṃvara tradition, one invokes the three kinds of heralds.

The unelaborate mode is to rely on any appropriate part of the foregoing.
There is even a practice to bind yakṣa and yakṣī spirits to one’s service.

The extremely unelaborate mode is that of the bhusuku, who does away with distraction and relies on the jñānamudrā consort and the utterly lucid state of sleep.
There are two actual kinds and three parallel kinds….

…For the elaborate mode and the rest, there are degrees of acumen (duller, middling, and keener)
that are progressively swifter.

In connection with empowerment, the expedient cause is a factor contributing to manifest enlightenment.

In the Kālacakra cycle, there is discussion of conduct of the four vajras, the six family types,
and the six transcendent perfections.

All modes are subsumed within the two kinds of conduct, that of the stages of development and completion.

As for the trenchant activity of wrath, an auxiliary function of conduct, this is not needed by someone immersed in the stages of development and completion; but for those engaged in mantra or the stage of completion, there are situations when it is useful, just as there are times that a horse is useful when an elephant is not.

According to the majority of past masters, the situation of a beginner is one of observing samaya and vows and avoiding objectionable actions, striving on the path with the conduct of total nobility.
Through this one gains warmth in the meditative equipoise of the stage of completion. The secret conduct practiced in concealment then involves meat, alcohol, and consorts. When stability is gained in both meditative equipoise and postmeditation, in the company of one’s consort, one adopts the attributes of a yogic practitioner and overtly engages in conduct in group practice; this is known as the spiritual deportment of pure awareness.
Once one has gained sublime capability and is free of the bonds of conditioned existence, there is truly total victory, for one is free of apprehension, tramples on counterproductive circumstances,
and overwhelms the three states of conditioned existence.
Conduct is explained as being in order to ensure benefit for others who are to be guided.
All its modes lead one to the most sublime spiritual attainments.
The foregoing constitutes the third part concerning an analysis of conduct, the process of enhancement that is an auxiliary aspect of the spiritual path.

The Early Translation School’s tradition of explaining the correspondence between outer and inner levels is, generally speaking, as follows: the cakra at the navel corresponds to the path of accumulation, that at the heart to the four phases of the path of linkage, that at the throat to the path of seeing, and that at the crown of the head to the path of meditation.
In this interpretation, when the unity of subtle energy and mind associated with these four centers has become adaptable, the qualities associated with these four paths arise in succession.

Within the central channel are twenty-one blockages of the lateral channels.
With adaptability in the nirmāṇacakra, the first pair are freed, and so on, as these blockages are freed in pairs and one gains each of the ten levels.
Finally, the sublime pinnacle level above the crown of the head is attained.

In particular, the root of the yogas is the tradition of the Web of Magical Display.
Through the three kinds of sublime intelligence, one arouses five aspects of bodhicitta:
directed resolve, aspiration, application, abiding, and consummation.
On the direct path that is far superior to four other approaches, with the resolve to gain release that they entail,…

…one traverses the path of accumulation through the fourfold process that addresses both corruptibility and regression.

In the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual, with corruptibility but not the possibility for regression, the results of the path of linkage are the three paths of seeing nonduality,
meditation,
and consummation and the four levels of a master of awareness.
Masters of Awareness Still Subject to the Complete
Maturation

Although one has realization of the actual nature of phenomena on the path of seeing, the residual traces of one’s physical body have not been refined away, so one has the three qualities of someone still subject to the complete maturation of karma.
One’s positive qualities are augmented, one gains mastery of the four kinds of enlightened activities, and one gains deeper levels of insight and other qualities, so that one can benefit beings throughout a world system.

There is accomplishment through alchemical means, the descent and holding of bindu through subtle energy, but the indestructible vajrakāya, in which corruptibility is finished with, is far superior to these.
With power over longevity through completing the path, omnipresent distortions are refined away,
and due to the four kinds of spiritual miracles, the six levels of deeper discernment, and the twenty-five aspects of sense consciousness, one benefits beings in a three-thousandfold universe.

On the path of meditation, masters of mahāmudrā have illusory forms of timeless awareness.
Beginning with the level of The Stainless One, and up to the pathway of complete freedom on the tenth level, they are subsumed within five families of masters of awareness: vajra, cakra,
ratna,
padma, and karma. Indwelling distortions are refined away, and enlightened activities are carried out in whatever way necessary to guide beings, on a scale equal to that of a sambhogakāya pure realm.

On the path of consummation, for masters of spontaneously present awareness, regents of the sixth family, the vajralike state refines away distortions of the three successive steps of subtle experience.
Their deeds, emanations, and sublime intelligence are somewhat like those of victorious ones.

There are parallels to the ordinary levels of The Utterly
Joyful One, The Immutable One, and The Cloud of Dharma, but although the degrees of progress are equivalent, there is superiority of intent and conduct.

Meditative equipoise is the one-pointed meditative stability specific to a level, while postmeditation involves three kinds of conduct: the pursuit of virtue like that of a youth; like that of a madman; and like that of a ruler holding the throne.
Decisiveness comes through the paths of skillful means and freedom and eight aspects of conduct.

In Anu, for the highest level of mind, the paths and levels are traversed in one fell swoop; the intermediate and lesser levels are either traversed in succession or in a nonlinear way,
moreover,…

…so two levels, that of unpredictable change and that of the basis of reliance, constitute the path of accumulation (the directing of will), in which the deity’s embodiment is an expression of one’s dedicated intent.
This ensures the more common accomplishments, such as deeper levels of insight and levels of deeper discernment.

The levels of the major refining process, the continuity, and the basis of merit constitute the path of linkage (the affirmation of one’s birthright), in which the embodiment of the deity’s form is an expression of the unity of subtle energy and mind.

Due to the expedient cause, changeable bliss is done away with, and all that is corruptible comes to an end.
Improvement constitutes the path of seeing, in which the embodiment of the deity is an expression of the unity of bliss and emptiness.

The framework that ushers in the fruition constitutes the path of meditation, the receiving of the supreme transmission.
The embodiment of the deity is an expression of the uninterrupted state of primordial unity that still involves training.

Three levels—abiding without change, permeation, and the universal range of perfection—constitute the path of consummation, the perfecting of supreme dynamic energy. Through the pathway without obstacles that lies at the very threshold of enlightenment, the empowerment of supreme passion refines away subtle distortions, bringing the experience of primordial unity that requires no more training.

The paths and levels of Ati transcend developmental effort.
Nonetheless, within the four stages of empowerment found in the extraordinary secret cycles,
some sixteen subdivisions of the aspects of manifest realization are differentiated.
The same is true for the levels of dedicated interest, involvement, transformation, and decisiveness.
Together these are thirty-two factors. Timeless awareness is analyzed into four aspects of abiding,
awakening, attainment, and arising, giving sixty-four factors that contribute to the perfection of the sublime level of Vajradhara.

Immersion in genuine being, supreme immersion, analysis, and realization: each is further analyzed into four subdivisions, giving sixteen levels of masters of awareness.
These are causal levels, attained through recollection of the four stages of empowerment.

The four visions each involve stages of manifestation, increase, attainment, and complete attainment, so the levels of the visions associated with the fruition are sixteen measures in one’s experience of timeless awareness.

Perception of truth, recognition, familiarity, luminous vision, timeless awareness, enlightened form in full evidence, consummation, unwavering state, perfection of qualities, tranquil state, group formations, nonattachment, circles, abiding vision, gaining of certainty, and the level of original purity: on that level there is nothing higher than tranquil timeless awareness.
Beginning with the level of The Utterly Joyful One, up to that of Total Illumination, The
Lotus-Bearing One,
The Circles of Letters, Meditative Absorption, The Vajra
Holder, and Unsurpassable Timeless Awareness, these levels are all approached in a similar manner,
but because they are visions of a single state of utter lucidity, they are not the ten ordinary levels.

Nevertheless, with the expansion of pathways of light in the central channel, once the first two blockages in the subtle channels dissolve into light, one experiences such qualities as the
“twelve hundredfold.”
With this enhancement, manifest aspects of realization arise effortlessly as awareness’s own manifestations.

Conduct as ongoing immersion in genuine being can be at the beginning stage, in delineating the gap,
and in pursuing the path of spiritual deportment.
Of the latter’s twenty-one aspects, one engages primarily in seven, such as that like a bee’s,
and gains mastery of all one perceives.

According to individual spiritual instructions, the ways in which the paths and levels are traversed are beyond enumerating; the fundamentals are summarized here.
The foregoing constitutes the fourth part concerning a detailed treatment of the paths and levels in the three yogas of the Early Translation School’s approach.

Nirvāṇa is the fruition to be attained through the three spiritual approaches.
Nirvāṇa as the natural state is the suchness of phenomena.
Nirvāṇa as a state of cessation is either nominal (attained through devoted intent) or authentic
(attained through the paths of seeing and meditation), the latter being incomplete on the path of training and complete on that of no more training.
Nonlimited nirvāṇa does not fall into the extreme of either conditioned existence or personal salvation.

Endowed with three supreme properties,…

…buddhahood is comparable to a lotus.

Once the development of merit has been completed through bodhicitta, the fully matured fruition is the accomplishment of the rūpakāyas, while dharmakāya is the fruition of divestment through a deepening of the experience of timeless awareness.

That is to say, in the pinnacle pure realm of supreme
Akaniṣṭha, dharmakāya makes itself evident on the basis of the sambhogakāya. Throughout the three-thousandfold universe, nirmāṇakāyas simultaneously demonstrate the way to enlightenment.
As the consummation of both kinds of benefit, the two kāyas are support and supported.
They do not exist as actual things and so do not manifest, yet are present and so do manifest,
bringing enjoyment of all one could desire. Thus they constitute liberation.

The basic space of phenomena, endowed with all inexhaustible qualities of enlightenment, is the supportive kāya that is the actual nature of phenomena, imbued with twofold purity.
It has eight characteristics: evenness, profundity, continuity, uniqueness, authenticity,
immaculacy, utter lucidity, and perfect connectedness.

Some assign the perfection of the process of elimination to svabhāvikakāya and the perfection of the process of realization to dharmakāya.

Sambhogakāya, in the realm of Ghanavyūha,661 is adorned with major and minor marks of perfect form.
There is uninterrupted enjoyment of the Mahāyāna teachings in the company of spiritually advanced beings.
It has eight characteristics: retinue, realm, embodiment, marks, teaching, deeds, spontaneous presence, and absence of independent nature.

It can be analyzed as either greater and lesser, or actual and nominal.
There are three opinions based on uniqueness, distinctness, and gradation.

For as long as saṃsāra endures and for the sake of beings, nirmāṇakāya emanates in various ways,
ensuring benefit. It has eight characteristics: support, cause, realms, time frame, nature,
edification, maturation, and freedom.

Nirmāṇakāyas of skill, birth, and sublimity reveal themselves through enlightened deeds.

In the Highest Continuum, there is discussion of the essence as one of immaculacy, presence,
bliss,
and constancy, and of the three kāyas each being characterized as having five attributes.

There is equalness of support, enlightened intent, and enlightened activity.

There is constancy due to nature, an unimpaired quality, and continuity.

There is manifestation due to their being pure of cognitive, afflictive, and karmic obscurations.

Timeless awareness, as what is supported, consists of five incorruptible ways of knowing.

Awareness as the basic space of phenomena constitutes nonduality, threefold freedom, and nonconceptuality.

Without ordinary fixated perception, there is the manifestation of all objects of knowledge as though in a mirror.

Pure meditation is the equalness of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.

Discerning awareness of things in all their multiplicity is the avenue to meditative absorption and the power of recall.

Ensured fulfillment lies in the manifold display of countless skillful means.

Experience of these aspects comes about by one’s eliminating faults through such activities as hearing teachings; retaining the teachings; meditating on equalness; presenting teachings; and ensuring others’ welfare.

The emptiness and lucidity of consciousness as the basis of all ordinary experience, the afflictive aspect of consciousness, consciousness as the coordinating mental faculty, and the five sense consciousnesses—their transformation constitutes the very essence of being itself.

A pair of aspects is subsumed in each of the first two kāyas, with ensured fulfillment subsumed in nirmāṇakāya.
Because they transcend the ordinary intellect, they are free of such conceptual elaboration as being existent or nonexistent.
In their true nature they are nonmanifest; their way of manifesting is merely by way of interdependence; these ways of knowing are beyond the ordinary mind’s comprehension.

While the qualities of enlightenment are limitless, they can be summarized as twofold: due to divestment and maturation.

On the ultimate level, there are thirty-two qualities due to divestment.

Knowledge of appropriateness, consequences, capacity, temperament, aspiration, destiny,
afflictive states versus enlightenment, recollection, birth and death, and the end of all that is corruptible—
the ten powers of knowledge are like a vajra, overcoming obscurations.

Concerning enlightenment, the end of what is corruptible, declaration, and the path of the will to be free, there is fearlessness, like that of a lion, in teaching to bring the two kinds of benefit.

Six each falling under conduct and realization, three each under deeds and knowledge: the eighteen qualities that distinguish buddhas from others are comparable to space.

In a more detailed way, there are twenty-one categories of incorruptibility: the factors that contribute to enlightenment, the immeasurable attitudes, the modes of liberation, the stages of meditative equipoise, the states of total immersion, the sense fields that eclipse ordinary perceptions, the absence of afflictive states, wisdom born of aspiration, the levels of deeper discernment, the states of authentic discernment, the four aspects of complete purity, the kinds of control, the powers, the four states of fearlessness, the factors that need not be closely guarded,
the applications of mindfulness, the absence of oblivion, the overcoming of habitual patterns,
supreme innate compassion, the distinctive qualities, and omniscience.

The two kinds of rūpakāya are like the moon in the sky and its reflection in water.
Their qualities, which are due to complete spiritual maturation, are manifest yet cannot be found to exist as such.

There are thirty-two marks, such as soles that are exceedingly level and marked with wheels, and eighty, such as nails that are copper colored, glossy, and raised.
A supreme being is adorned with these major and minor marks of perfect form.
Enlightened speech is endowed with sixty melodious qualities.

Enlightened activity is spontaneously accomplished, without bias or distinction, integrated,
uninterrupted, a myriad array of skillful methods, in accord with an individual’s fortune, and completely protective.

Because it presents those to be guided with the basis for the spiritual path, the actual path,
and the consummate result, to summarize it can be subsumed under two principles: spontaneous accomplishment and uninterruptedness.
The foregoing constitutes the first part, concerning a definitive conclusion about the fruition in the cause-based dialectical approach.

The results of the two stages of the mantra approach are the more common and the sublime.
In the Guhyasamāja cycle, they are attainments of mantra and of timeless awareness.
In the Kālacakra cycle, it is said that a single attainment comes from the seven empowerments,
while three kinds come from following the path of the higher empowerments.

The stage of development is the application of tantric principles that primarily ensure accomplishment of enlightened activities in the short term, as well as lesser, intermediate, or greater siddhis….

…Pacification, enrichment, power, forceful intervention: these are the four basic activities,
with an entire range of secondary ones.
Pacifying, enriching, exercising power, summoning, slaying, banishing, driving mad, and paralyzing:
these are well known as the eight, or twelve, major activities.

The eight lesser siddhis are those of pills, eye medicine, seeing underground, the sword, the enjoyment of space, invisibility, immortality, and curing illness.
Alternatively, the eight are those of the sword, eye medicine, pills, foot ointment, alchemical powers, magical boots, mercury, and seeing underground.
In the Concise Tantra, there is much discussion of such siddhis as the sword, the magic power of touch, alchemical powers, nectar, pills, magic potion, fleetness of foot, and other topics, such as world rulers, but these can be summarized as those of masters of awareness through material means,
in a physical body, or with wealth.

The intermediate siddhis, which come from the common attainment of meditative warmth and conduct,

They employ all mantras of awareness and siddhis, and have power over longevity.
They possess the eight mundane qualities of powerful mastery, being subtle, light, governing,
able to move everywhere, worthy of honor, able to ensure all that is wished for, imbued with stable joy and satisfaction, and possessed of mastery.
Even though they move through this realm, ordinary people cannot see them.

The greater siddhis are those of sublime masters of awareness in the realm of desire and of masters of awareness in the realm of form, who engage in unelaborate conduct.
With status equal to that of gods in the realm of form, their qualities are far superior to those.
Their actual bodies do not appear, but they benefit beings through emanations.
Through the path of masters of awareness, one gains power over longevity, and through the longevity of a master of awareness, one accomplishes buddhahood.

In conjunction with these siddhis, the greater state of
Khecara is one endowed with the eight qualities such as subtle form.
The full experience of one’s realization is a naturally manifesting realm of complete purity.

The lesser states of Khecara are seventeen associated with the realm of form, six associated with the gods of the realm of desire, and the indeterminate one associated with the human realm,
which can be seen by pure yogic practitioners.
One may arrive there without discarding the physical body, or having discarded it, or be led there by yakṣī spirits or siddhas (a temporary magical experience).
Some reach there through meditation; because this involves engaging in meditative stability and attaining a rainbow body, they progress along the spiritual path, taking a firm stance.
The foregoing constitutes the second part, concerning a definitive conclusion about the more common spiritual attainments of the mantra approach.

The fruition aspect of tantra is accomplished through three incorruptible processes of spiritual development.
It constitutes the consummate and most sublime spiritual attainment, mahāmudrā.

In essence, due to the cessation of breath and the stabilization of the masculine and feminine energies, moon, sun, and Rāhu are free of obscurations as the three vajras.
Evaṃ means equal taste: primordial unity that has two dimensions.

As for an enumeration of the synonymous terms for this, there are primarily twenty.
But it can be described by many others as well, as many as ten thousand.

The actual fruition is supreme Vajradhara. The nominal results are those of the illusory body and of an ordinary being who has realized primordial unity; these results, respectively, are the flawless embodiment of timeless awareness and a flawed embodiment.

The working basis for the causes (the aspects contributing to manifest enlightenment) is the impure illusory body.

In essence, the fruition constitutes timeless awareness associated with the path of seeing, in which the eighty overt patterns of thought have been eliminated….

…As for the methods of application, by moon and sun one meditates on the phases of
“manifestation”
and
“increase”; with the setting of the sun, on the timeless awareness of the phase of “attainment.”
At daybreak comes enlightenment. These are the external aspects of manifest enlightenment.

At twilight, one performs a gaṇacakra feast and familiarizes oneself with the ongoing experience of timeless awareness associated with the empowerment into timeless awareness. At dawn one perceives ultimate reality.
With the internal aspects contributing to manifest enlightenment, bindu, which is a product of the elements, constitutes the natural and pervasive radiance of timeless awareness when one awakens to buddhahood.

Even the path of the transcendent perfections depends on this ultimate state.

In summary, having attained the state of illusory body, and relying on conduct, within the state of utter lucidity induced by the two methods of meditative stability, one brings the two methods of the aspects contributing to manifest enlightenment to completion, and so perceives utter lucidity in the ultimate sense.

Within the context purified of ordinary dualistic perception, the three successive steps of subtle experience unfold in reverse order, and primordial unity on the path of training is achieved.
One still moves in and out of that state: this tendency is only eliminated once the seventh bodhisattva level has been completed.

There is primordial unity of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa; of deeply ingrained negative emotionality and enlightenment; of the tangible and intangible; of perceived object and perceiving subject; of naïve affirmation and nihilistic denial; of compassion and emptiness; of skillful means and sublime intelligence; of what entails residual traces and what does not; of the two aspects of the lack of identity; of illusory body and utter lucidity; of instantaneous collapse and gradual dissolution; of the two levels of truth; of focus; of sleep and waking consciousness; of meditative equipoise and postmeditation; of what is substantial and nonsubstantial; of mindfulness and its absence; of bliss and emptiness; of the object and agent of action; of development and completion; of purity and impurity; and of what has form and what is formless.
These are the twenty-three aspects….

…Thirty-one auxiliary aspects are complete.
In addition, one gains other powers, avenues of total recall, and so forth.

To summarize, manifestation and emptiness are found to be identical in essence, the indivisibility of the kāyas and timeless awareness. This is primordial unity.

Once that is attained, in reliance on the deathless kāya of timeless awareness, one will definitely awaken to buddhahood. There are a number of variations to this delineation, however.
If one has perceived the anticipatory state of utter lucidity, one will attain nirvāṇa during the intermediate state after death; if utter lucidity in the ultimate sense, in this lifetime.
With the consummate level of the stage of development, one arouses the realization associated with manifestation and increase; one will definitely awaken to buddhahood in the next lifetime.

An illusionist’s trick, the reflection of the moon in water, a hallucination, a mirage, a dream image, an echo, an optical illusion, a city of the gandharvas, a rainbow, a flash of lightning,
bubbles on water, and a reflection in a mirror: these are the twelve metaphors that illustrate the vajrakāya.

Without the aggregates being impaired, there is simply the kāya of timeless awareness.
With their impairment, there is the kāya of timeless awareness of a master of awareness,
involving meditative absorption, having levels of deeper discernment, engaging in conduct for the sake of beings, not being subject to ordinary desire, enjoying supreme bliss, transcending the usual limits of longevity, and constituting a mental embodiment: It is endowed with these seven distinctive attributes.

With the cessation of the three ordinary avenues of being, there is the embodiment of timeless awareness.
Primordial unity that involves no more training becomes fully evident on a basis that is in every respect analogous to sambhogakāya.

As for the occasion, when the external and internal aspects of manifest enlightenment have been finalized, to the accompaniment of offerings and omens, one attains the state of a spiritual being of the consort of awareness.

In essence pervasive and constant,…

…characterized by supreme elimination and realization,…

…primordial unity has thirty-nine auxiliary attributes.

Enjoyment of the richness of being, integration, supreme bliss, absence of any independent nature,
compassion, continuity, and absence of cessation— since timeless awareness that brings power over these attributes becomes familiar to one while on the path, the kāya attained is also endowed with these seven attributes.

There are eight qualities due to the purity of the six elements and the solar and lunar energies.

There are the eight experiential qualities of constancy, absence of torment, soothing calm,
oneness,
bliss, immaculacy, joy, and inspiration.

There is powerful mastery of the three secrets, miraculous powers, omnipresence, states of being,
desired goals, and arousal….

…Subtlety and lightness are more exalted than previously.

Emptiness free of elaboration is the level of buddhahood; the bhaga of the vajra queen is the context for awakening to buddhahood.

In essence, the kāyas are the maṇḍala of timeless awareness.

Primordial unity is singular. The two kāyas are dharmakāya and rūpakāya.
There are the three vajras, and adding the kāya of innate presence makes four.
There are the five kāyas of the five family types, and adding the universal principle makes six.
By analyzing the four kāyas into mind, speech, form, and timeless awareness, there are sixteen;
and there are other models of multiple kāyas.

Dharmakāya is equalness, the nature of suchness.
Sambhogakāya is the enjoyment of full richness and the seven consummate attributes of integration.
Nirmāṇakāya is spontaneously accomplished enlightened activity.
Each of the two rūpakāyas has two further kāyas: the symbolic expression and the actuality.
The four kāyas constitute the freedom from obscuration of the four ordinary states and the purified state of subtle energy, feminine energy, masculine energy, and ordinary consciousness.
By nature they are, respectively, unconditioned, unafflicted, liberating through compassion, and supremely blissful primordial unity.

Based on the specific expressions of twenty-one aggregates, the analysis into family types of maṇḍalas accounts for an infinite range of maṇḍalas.

The subsumed models are those of some ninety-five minor types, while the subsuming model is that of the family types of the five victorious ones, giving one hundred family types.
Each of the five major types has five subsidiary types, and each of these is analyzed according to the four feminine consorts, again giving one hundred, and so on.
There are countless specific expressions. The freedom of the six elements from obscuration gives six family types, and these can further be subsumed within five, or even three, types.
The dance of the many unfolds within the mood of oneness.

Because, in the context of the ground of being, there are the natural manifestations of body,
speech, and mind, in the context of the fruition, the very nature of the family types is that of supreme bliss.

Timeless awareness has five extraordinary aspects: the completely pure analogues of the five mental poisons.

Alternatively, it has seven aspects: profundity, extent, pervasiveness, constancy, supreme bliss,
embodiment, and primordial unity….

…Its profundity entails five characteristics: the absence of independent nature, self-knowing awareness, absence of fluctuation, nonconceptuality, and clear manifestation.
Its vast extent applies to merit, timeless awareness, environment, scope, involvement,
enlightened activity, and so forth.
Its pervasiveness applies to space, time, continua, emptiness, and equalness.
Its constancy entails its being uninterrupted, without cessation, without subtle traits,
unchanging,
and inconceivable.
Its bliss has seven ramifications: the three of integration, naturalness, compassion, and the dissolution of conceptual mind and subtle energy,
“melting,” and inexhaustibility.
Its embodiment has seven ramifications: born of emptiness, entailing the cessation of suffering,
omnipresent, unwavering, being an embodiment of mind and subtle energy, emanating in an instant,
and epitomizing major and minor marks of perfection.
Its primordial unity has six ramifications: having no dualistic framework, nonconceptual,
appreciating reality just as it is, involving no ordinary perception, ensuring benefit, and never wavering.

In addition, it sustains ten completely pure aspects of knowledge and so forth.

Its qualities and activity can be understood from the previous explanation.
In brief, the fruition entails three supreme principles and two qualities, that of being ongoing and constant presences, and that of being as pervasive as space.
The foregoing constitutes the third part, concerning a definitive conclusion about the consummate fruition in the Vajrayāna.

In the tradition of the Web of Magical Display, what is to be understood is the fruition aspect of tantra.

The full experience of the very ground of being, just as it is, is free of any elimination or attainment: it is the innate manifestation of the maṇḍala of kāyas and timeless awareness.

It is characterized as being already free of limitations without these having to be eliminated,
and equal in taste to the enlightened intent of all victorious ones, like water poured into water.

As for an enumeration of the terms, these are “sugata,”
“buddha,” and so forth.

In essence, the ever-present aspects of the kāyas and so forth are unimaginable.

The enumeration includes dharmakāya, sambhogakāya, nirmāṇakāya, [4.217.b] unchanging vajrakāya,
and abhisambodhikāya.
The five aspects of enlightened speech are those of the ultimate unborn nature, the symbolic expression of enlightened intent, the utterance of words, the vajra state of inseparability, and manifest enlightenment.
The five sublime aspects of enlightened mind are those of nonconceptuality, equalness, the liberation of beings, indivisibility, and knowledge of anything whatsoever.
Realms of complete purity, immeasurable mansions free of fixed dimensions, pure and radiant luminosity, distinctive seats, and the wealth of all delights: these are the five aspects of the qualities of enlightenment.
Enlightened activities are those of pacification, enrichment, power, wrath, and spontaneous presence.

The features can be subsumed within the kāyas, speech, mind, qualities, and activity.

Alternatively, there are the two categories of the kāyas and timeless awareness.

The five kāyas are identical in their spontaneous presence, yet manifest as though distinct.

The five supported aspects of timeless awareness are the transmuted analogues of the basis of experience as the true ground and as true linkage, the afflictive aspect of consciousness,
conceptual mind, and the five sensory avenues.

Because the twenty-five factors entailed in the fruition can be summarized as the qualities of the
“sixth,” they are inseparable in their very essence of spontaneous presence.

One perceives in three ways that involve nonconceptual, yet naturally lucid perception.
Innate compassion is aroused as an ever-present flow, as a natural force, as an invoked presence,
and in response to an object.
Like a gem, this acts to ensure spontaneously present benefit for beings.

Dharmakāya involves three topics: essence, characteristics, and blessing.

Sambhogakāya involves what can be experienced and the means for experiencing it.

Nirmāṇakāya involves those to be guided and the means to guide.
Gyalwa Yungtön analyzed the distinctions between the dialectical and tantric interpretations.

According to the “vajra pinnacle,” there are specific degrees of acumen.

For those of lesser acumen, there is a tendency that carries over into the intermediate state of becoming, from which they are inspired to attain naturally occurring nirmāṇakāya pure realms.

For those of middling acumen, there is a fourfold dissolution process in the intermediate state of the actual nature of phenomena.
When eight modes of arising, states of recollection, levels of deeper discernment, powers of complete recall, and states of meditative absorption ensue, freedom is gained through eight modes of dissolution, in accord with twenty levels of acumen.

For those of higher acumen, there is disintegration on the level of primordial resolution, like the passing of a ḍākinī, like the passing of a master of awareness, like a roaring fire, like space.
All these cases, however, are identical within the precious and secret embrace.

The kāyas and timeless awareness are inseparable: the three kāyas of enlightenment, in essence,
constitute original purity, spontaneous presence, and the occurrence of whatever serves to guide beings.

The derivation of terms for these is that they signify the unity of emptiness and lucidity,
perfection of what is clearly evident, and harmonious manifestation.

Their characteristics are those of being beyond imagining, lucid yet involving no concepts, and revealing a myriad array.

Their natures are those of emptiness, lucidity, and unceasing overt manifestation.

The mode of their abiding is comparable to that of space, a rainbow, and an illusion.

Their pure realms are those of original purity, timeless awareness, and the manifestation of animate and inanimate universes.

Those to be guided are those of complete purity, those who are awareness’s own natural manifestations, and the six classes of ordinary beings.
All of these situations, furthermore, are endowed with fivefold excellence.

The function of the kāyas is that of not straying, being spontaneously present, and being like reflections of the moon in water.

The measure of indwelling confidence lies in a freedom from elaboration, a natural lucidity, and the ensuring of two kinds of benefit.

To analyze them, the three kāyas each constitute a fivefold continuum of inexhaustible adornment,
which means that, generally speaking, there are certainly fifteen categories of enlightened being.

As for the detailed analysis of the nature of their distinct expressions, dharmakāya can be analyzed into aspects of dharmakāya, sambhogakāya, and nirmāṇakāya; as can the rest.
This gives nine categories, each with its pure realm, environment, meditative absorption,
retinue,
teaching, and occasion.

Timeless awareness abides as the heart essence of being, which is a primordial quality of knowing.

It is timelessly lucid, and awareness that is direct due to realization.

Dharmakāya abides as the ground of being, comparable to the sun, serving as the ground from which everything arises.
Timeless awareness is threefold, abiding in its natural resting place of profound lucidity.

Sambhogakāya, in exhibiting attributes, presents reflected forms.
From an analysis of five aspects of timeless awareness come twenty-five.

Nirmāṇakāya, all-pervasive, ensures all that is meaningful for those to be guided.
It entails four aspects of sublime intelligence, two for each of the two: knowing reality just as it is and knowing things in all their multiplicity.

In summary, while one’s own welfare is perfect within basic space, as one is embraced by the vase body, endowed with six distinctive attributes, the welfare of others is found in the emerging of sambhogakāya, awareness’s own natural manifestation.
Its dynamic energy ensures that enlightened activity takes place, spontaneously and without interruption, for those to be tamed, in both pure and impure realms.
The foregoing constitutes the fourth part, concerning a definitive conclusion about the specific fruition according to the tradition of the Early Translation School of the secret mantra approach.

[The Nature of the Treasury of Knowledge]

Since works composed in a rigid way by presumptuous people adopt a superficial or biased perspective,
how could what is put together randomly by the untrained and immature ever be able to arouse admiration in the learned?

[The Purpose for Writing the Treasury of Knowledge]

Nevertheless, in these later days of the teachings, if those who are mere shadows of spiritual practitioners are unaware of the authentic origins of the Buddhadharma, how could they have even a partial understanding of its characteristics?

I composed this work well, thinking it would serve to nourish such people.
I have not told anything that has not been told before, nor spoken out of any sense of competitiveness.
But people nowadays are of such small intelligence and diligence that they cannot cross to the far shore of the ocean of the mainstream Buddhist traditions, so I have summarized these spiritual approaches to benefit those like me.

[How the Treasury of Knowledge Came to Be Written]
Those who have read and are familiar with a few major source texts use their minds to skim over the general range of knowledge in the most cursory manner.
Those whose path is one of laboring with minor secular fields of knowledge find the eye of their intelligence dulled for viewing the vast scope of the Buddha’s excellent teachings.
I myself have not realized these in any authentic way.
Nevertheless, due to my having heard many teachings and having relied on the writings of holy masters,
I have composed this work with the intention of benefiting others.
May it serve to illuminate the Sage’s flawless teachings for a long time!

Prayer of Aspiration
Through this, may beings enjoy happiness, well-being, and increase of spirituality; observe completely pure discipline; train themselves by hearing, contemplating, and meditating on teachings; reach the consummation of the spiritual paths and levels, with their manifest states of realization; and attain as one the state of the three kāyas!

Confession of Errors and Auspicious Prayers

For any contradictions or errors, in the presence of the
Three Roots and those endowed with the eye of spirituality,
I request forbearance, and ask that you grant that I be inspired to attain the most sublime state of purity and absolution; please ensure the auspicious conditions for this treatise to endure as long as the Sage’s teachings, casting illumination on all, like the sun and moon!

Colophon
This treatise was written by me, who has heard many teachings, the positive effect of which has given rise in me to constant faith and a pure attitude toward the entire tradition of the Sage’s teachings and those who uphold it, without any sectarian bias. I have been guided by the compassionate embrace of many holy masters, including the lord Maitreya,
Tai Situ. I, Karma Ngawang Yönten Gyatso Trinlé Kunchap Pal Zangpo, also known as Lodrö Tayé Pai Dé,
composed this at Kunzang Dechen Ösel Ling, in front of the cliff face of Tsadra Rinchendrak on Devikoṭi,
the site of the retreat center associated with Palpung Tupten Chökorling. May this work bring great benefit to the teachings and to beings.
May all that is positive and excellent flourish!

As a concise summary, let me elucidate the very essence of this work.
Positive at the outset is the introductory section, which discusses the title and includes the invocation and my statement of intention to compose this.
Positive in the middle are the ten books, each with four chapters.
The first book discusses the animate and inanimate universe as a field in which beings are guided spiritually, and the causes thereof: the general cosmology of the Mahāyāna tradition; an analysis of the common treatment of our world-system, Endurance; a classification of space and time according to the
Kālacakra system, as well as the dimensions of the universe; the process of causation according to the
Abhidharma; and the Dzogchen tradition, which frees one of confusion.

</d>
<d e="2">
The second book discusses the way in which the Teacher appeared in this world as a guide: the way in which the Teacher followed the path to enlightenment; the descriptions of buddhahood according to the
Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna approaches; the twelve deeds the Victorious One performed in this world; and the analysis of the kāyas and pure realms that is specific to the pinnacle approach.

The third book discusses the classifications of the sacred dharma that was taught: identifying the sublime and sacred teachings of the dharma; analyzing the specific cycles of the scriptural transmission of the teachings; describing how the Buddha’s Word was compiled in three successive stages; and detailing the way in which the classes of tantra and sādhana of the Early Translation School were transmitted.

The fourth book discusses the origins and historical development of the dharma in India and Tibet: the way in which Buddhism spread in India; the earlier and later traditions of teachings in Tibet; the way in which the eight lineages of spiritual accomplishment and other schools came about; the secular fields of knowledge; and the way in which Buddhism spread in other regions.

The fifth book discusses the higher training in ethical discipline: the means of relying on a spiritual teacher and how the teachings are explained and heard; the vows of individual liberation according to the Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna; the two spiritual vehicles of bodhisattva training; the tantric vows of the early and later schools; and the general theme of the three levels of ordination.

The sixth book discusses the topics for hearing teachings on all that is to be known: the major and minor fields of knowledge in the secular context; a general classification of fields of knowledge in general, including the five bases; the philosophical systems of the greater and lesser dialectical approaches; and the older and newer schools of the Vajrayāna.

</d>
<d e="2">
The seventh book discusses how sublime intelligence develops through hearing the teachings: the four keys of understanding for evaluating the teachings; the topics to be evaluated (the two levels of provisional and definitive truth and the phenomena of interdependent origination); the view of the lack of identity in things, which is crucial to all approaches in general; and the four contemplations that turn the mind, providing the foundation for meditative discipline.

The eighth book discusses how higher states of absorption develop through meditation: calm abiding and deeper insight, the two common foundations of meditative absorption; the stages of meditation in the greater and lesser cause-based approaches; the tradition that emphasizes the Anuttara tantras of the secret mantra approach; and the traditions of the eight lineages of spiritual accomplishment, with emphasis on their esoteric instructions.

The ninth book discusses how, through spiritual practice, one traverses the paths and levels: the paths and levels of the dialectical approach; general and specific classifications of the tantric paths and levels; the ways in which conduct is an enhancement of practice, as an auxiliary to the path; and the particular presentation of the inner tantras of the
Early Translation School.

The tenth book discusses the consummate fruition of complete freedom: the way of awakening to buddhahood according to the ordinary Pāramitāyāna; the more common activities and attainments in the
Vajrayāna; the extraordinary and sublime attainment of mahāmudrā, the state of primordial unity; and the fruition aspect of tantra — the level of freedom according to the Early Translation School.

Positive in the final analysis is the conclusion, which discusses the nature of the work, its purpose,
how it came to be written, prayers of aspiration, and auspicious prayers.
May the sublime and quintessential nectar of excellent explanation, received through the guru’s grace,
nourish the teachings and those who uphold the teachings, so that, for a vast range of eons in this universe, all these may live long and their enlightened activities pervade everywhere throughout the three planes of existence!
Immediately upon my receiving permission from the sovereign lord, my guru the omniscient Jamyang
Khyentsei Wangpo, who is the very embodiment of supreme and nonreferential compassion, this was composed at Kunzang Dechen Ösel Ling, the retreat center of Palpung Monastery, by me, the deluded, ignorant, and worthless one, Karma Ngawang Yönten Gyatso Trinlé Kunkhyab Pal Zangpo.
May virtue and excellence flourish!
