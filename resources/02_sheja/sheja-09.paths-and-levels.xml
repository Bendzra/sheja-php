On the basis of one’s having practiced both the common and distinctive stages of meditation,[26] actual states of realization that are associated with the spiritual paths and levels occur progressively in one’s experience. As well, there are modes of conduct involved that enhance this process, causing the qualities related to these states of realization to develop where they have not yet developed and to become stable once they have developed. Since one needs to be aware of these states and qualities, Book 9 analyzes the paths and levels to be traversed. This book has four parts, which provide detailed treatments of the paths and levels in the cause-based dialectical approach; the paths and levels in the fruition-based Vajrayāna; the process of enhancement, which is an auxiliary aspect of the spiritual path; and the paths and levels in the “three yogas” of the Early Translation School’s approach.

A spiritual path to be traversed constitutes, in essence, a process that allows one to traverse to more sublime states, whether states within this world or transcendent states. As for what characterizes a spiritual path, some commentators are of the opinion that it constitutes “the virtue that serves as the cause of liberation” or “the capacity to remove any factors that are to be eliminated.” But these characterizations are not accurate because these they also apply to spiritual levels and antidotal techniques, which would mean that the latter were the equivalent of paths. Others hold that an aspect of a spiritual path is the action of proceeding, but this also is not an accurate characterization because a path is likened to a passage that allows one to proceed, [4.103.b] whereas the one performing the action of proceeding is actually some individual.

Generally speaking, there are countless ways to analyze spiritual paths. There are three paths, in the sense of the three spiritual approaches.[27] There are various analyses that distinguish two kinds of paths, such as those leading either to higher states of rebirth or to liberation; those leading to “states of edification” or to “definitive excellence”;[28] those that are of this world or those that are transcendent; and those that are corruptible vis-à-vis those that are incorruptible.[29] The words “and so forth” in the foregoing source verses refer implicitly to alternative analyses, such as:
▶ the four paths of linkage and so forth[30]
▶ four paths classified on the basis of being swift or slow, difficulty or easy
▶ two paths, one still requiring training and one of no more training being necessary[31]
▶ or the two paths of meditative equipoise and postmeditation awareness.
Although there are many such ways of analyzing spiritual paths de-pending on context, the common format accepted by all is that of what is renowned as the “five paths”: those of accumulation, linkage, seeing, meditation, and no more training.

</d>
<d e="2">
The Sanskrit pathi,[32] formed from the verb stem panth, “to go,” is the term for “path.” The derivation of the term is as follows: It is called a “path” because it serves as a passage that is to be traversed or the basis of what is to be traversed. It is “what is to be traversed” because it is that which is to be traversed by individuals who embark on this path. According to the sūtra the Compendium:
It is that which, when all beings participate in it, allows them to cross over to nirvāṇa.[33]
As this states, to participate in it (which is to say, to rely on it) allows one to go to nirvāṇa, and so it is also referred to as an “approach,” from the standpoint of it resembling a vehicle or mount.

For śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, the spiritual path is what is truly authentic because it involves progress to higher states, [4.104.a] while the fruition is nominally imputed.[34] For those of the Mahāyāna, the path is imputed, while the fruition is truly authentic because it constitutes the consummate degree of elimination and realization. In addition, according to the master Jñānamitra:
Given that the paths of accumulation and linkage still pertain to this world, they do not constitute the Truth of the Path[35] but rather are auxiliary components of the path because they cause it to come about.[36]
In accord with this quotation, Sherab Bar of Dri[37] and others state that because the two paths of accumulation and linkage involve conceptual consciousness (and so are corruptible), they do not constitute the actual path.
Nevertheless, this is a case of the term for the result being applicable to the cause. If we adopt this interpretation, there is a purpose in referring to the two paths of accumulation and linkage as conceptually based components of the path because they prepare one for the actual state of direct realization, that of the path of seeing.

<d e="2">
The Amassing of the Rare and Sublime uses the analogy of fire being produced by rubbing two sticks together to illustrate that even though these two are conceptually based paths, nonconceptual awareness can come about through a legitimate conceptual process. As well, these paths are analogous to seeds; thus, even though they are explained as being corruptible, to the extent that the basis of all ordinary experience[38] involved with these paths is relevant to the whole path, there is an incorruptible element, and the authentic path comes about due to these paths.

The cultivation of the four applications of mindfulness[41] constitutes the initial degree of the path of accumulation, at which point it is uncertain whether one will eventually embark on the path of linkage. The cultivation of the four aspects of correct renunciation[42] constitutes the intermediate degree of the path of accumulation, at which point it is certain that one will eventually embark on the path of linkage. When one is cultivating the four bases of supernormal powers,[43] this constitutes the final degree of the path of accumulation, at which point it is certain that one will experience the meditative warmth of the path of linkage. Thus, there are these three degrees: initial, intermediate, and final. Alternatively, there is an analysis of this path into four stages: the beginner’s stage, the stage of faith, the anticipation of liberation, and the “accomplishment of armor.”[44]

With what distinctive qualities are bodhisattvas[54] on the path of accumulation endowed? Their spiritual potential for the Mahāyāna has awakened; they have aroused the two kinds of bodhicitta, the awakening attitude;[55] and their conduct is that of training in the six transcendent perfections. With these as a basis, they are endowed with five qualities: they rely on the discipline that pertains to ordinary individuals; they exercise control over their senses; they eat in moderation; they do not sleep during the late evening and early morning but devote themselves to spiritual practice; and they take real delight in maintaining ongoing alertness of mind.
As for the first of these qualities, they do not, of course, lack the discipline of meditative stability or ordination; rather they rely on one of the seven kinds of Mahāyāna ordination for individual liberation, whichever is appropriate.[56]
As for the second quality, these bodhisattvas exercise control over their senses by applying mindfulness that is both respectful and continuous, functioning in a powerful way. With this as their general approach, they engage in conduct that emphasizes the profundity of the teachings and the principle of sublime intelligence, by imbuing all that they do with an appreciation of the transcendent perfection of sublime intelligence. They also engage in conduct that emphasizes the vast extent of the teachings and the principle of skillful means, by acting for the sake of others and formulating aspirations to engage in the completely refined conduct of the bodhisattva ideal.
As for the third quality, they partake of food and other necessities that have been offered to them by people with faith and, knowing which foods are allowed or proscribed, eat a moderate amount. They eat with the intention of nourishing the organisms that live in their bodies [4.105.b] and of sustaining their bodies as supports for spiritual practice.
As for the fourth quality, at the start and finish of their daily sessions they apply mindfulness to avoid becoming caught up in time-consuming activities and instead meditate on the unattractive features of something, cultivate the immeasurable attitudes,[57] and so forth. That is to say, they exert themselves in spiritual practice that completely refines away obscurations.[58]
As for the fifth quality, they ensure that they never lack the vigilance of an alert mind in all situations calling for such moral choices as what to accept or reject in their physical, verbal, or mental actions. They take delight in maintaining this alertness, in order to engage in behavior that is appropriate and avoid what is inappropriate.
In addition, they gain other qualities that pertain to the path of accumulation (such as the five deeper levels of insight[59] and five levels of deeper discernment[60]) and attain an ongoing state of meditative absorption, which is the fruition that constitutes the distinctive consummation of this path. In this regard, without straying from this absorption they gain entrance to a vast range of buddha realms throughout the ten directions and hear teachings of the sacred dharma from the lips of a vast array of buddhas. As the Ornament of the Sūtras states:
At that point, through the ongoing flow of spirituality,
in the presence of buddhas one gains calm abiding
and a spacious experience of timeless awareness,
and so receives very extensive spiritual advice.[61]

Let me explain the respective functions of the three degrees of that path: the initial, intermediate, and final degrees.
In the initial degree of the path of accumulation, for those following the śrāvaka approach the function of the four applications of mindfulness is to cause the mind to embrace the Four Truths of noble ones[62] and turn away from the four kinds of erroneous opinions.[63] For those following the Mahāyāna, the function of these applications is to cause the mind to embrace the two levels of truth[64] and turn away from the limitless ways in which things are naïvely taken to be real.
In the intermediate degree, the function of the first two of the four aspects of correct renunciation [4.106.a] is to eliminate counterproductive factors, while the function of the latter two aspects is to arouse positive factors and cause these to increase.
In the final degree, the function of the four bases of supernormal powers is to eliminate the eight kinds of erroneous and mundane thought patterns[65] (such as thoughts of desire) and to give one control over one-pointed meditative absorption.

As for the derivation or meaning of the term, this is called the “path of accumulation” because it is the path on which one accumulates positive factors on a vast scale, in order for one to be made a suitable recipient for realization such as that of meditative warmth[66] to awaken in one. It is also referred to as:[67]
▶ the “positive foundation that anticipates liberation” because it causes one to think in ways that anticipate the liberation of nirvāṇa;
▶ the “level of faith” because it strengthens one’s devotion toward the Three Jewels and one’s envisioning of emptiness; and
▶ the “antidote involving direct confrontation” because for those who follow the śrāvaka approach it involves the view that the mind-body aggregates (which perpetuate saṃsāra) are as disadvantageous as some kind of skin disease, while for those who follow the Mahāyāna approach it involves the view that these aggregates have no independent nature.

As for an analysis of this path, it can be analyzed according to the natural progression involved, into such divisions as the “level of engagement with dedicated intent,”[70] the “corruptible path of meditation,”[71] the “phases that anticipate the decisive breakthrough,” and the “accomplishment that brings engagement.”[72]
Concerning the distinction between the paths of accumulation and linkage, there is an aspect of the path of linkage that also pertains to that of accumulation, and an aspect that pertains to the path of linkage but not to that of accumulation. The first aspect is the continuity of experience gained on the path of accumulation, which is still present on the path of linkage. The latter aspect is that which “links” one to the Four Truths (or the two implications of the lack of identity,[73] as the case may be), which therefore pertains to linkage but is not the actual path of accumulation, and so does not pertain to that path.
If we analyze it into lesser and greater degrees, the path of linkage can be divided into three degrees: initial, intermediate, and final. Of these, with the initial degree it is uncertain whether one will eventually experience the path of seeing; with the intermediate degree, there is certainty that one will; and with the final degree, it is certain that one will experience the path of seeing in this lifetime.
While there are many ways to analyze this path, the most well-known of these is that of analyzing the path on the basis of how realization occurs:
(1) In this regard, there is the phase of meditative warmth.[74] Just as there is warmth when two sticks are rubbed together, as a foreshadowing of the fire that will come about, so there comes a foreshadowing that one will experience the path of seeing (that is, nonconceptual timeless awareness), which is comparable to the fire in the analogy.
(2) Then there is the phase of the peak experience, when the fundamentally positive factors that are still volatile[75] reach their climax (that is, their highest or most sublime degree).[76] An equivalent Sanskrit term for “peak experience” is mūrti,[77] which can be translated as “a momentary occurrence,” and so this is also referred to as the peak (in the sense of transitory) experience because it does not last for long.
(3) Next, one gains the phase of a patient acceptance of the profound nature of phenomena, an acceptance that parallels the path of seeing the truth in an unwavering manner. This constitutes patient acceptance in the sense that one is not daunted by emptiness.[78]
(4) The phase of the highest mundane experience is so called because it constitutes the most sublime experience within the context of this world, for it is capable of ushering in the paths of the spiritually advanced beings[79] (although it is not the congruent cause[80] of these paths).[81] [4.107.a] It serves as the governing condition[82] for the path of seeing, which is incorruptible. The Ornament of Manifest Realization states:
…involving lower, intermediate, and highest degrees…[83]
Thus, there are three degrees to all of the above phases,[84] so that some Mahāyāna commentators consider the path of linkage to be divided into a total of twelve degrees. This model is as follows:

Using one’s individual self-knowing timeless awareness, one meditates by focusing on the topics of the Four Truths.[85] This bring about the realization that objects that are reified externally have no independent nature, being nothing more than mere descriptions imposed by the inner perceiving mind. The attainment of a lesser degree of mental clarity concerning this realization involves both meditative absorption (that is, calm abiding) and sublime intelligence (that is, deeper insight), as well as their corresponding states of mind and mental events. Three degrees of meditative warmth (lesser, intermediate, and greater) are assigned on the basis of whether this experience of clarity (concerning emptiness or the absence of independent nature) is intermittent, fairly predominant, or even more prevalent and evident. The timeless awareness associated with meditative warmth is sometimes referred to as being “aroused on the lesser path of seeing”[86] since to a slight extent one sees something meaningful that one has not seen before. Nevertheless, in comparison to the peak experience and other phases, in this phase one is experiencing the lowest level of this clarity concerning emptiness or the absence of independent nature.

One exerts oneself as before with constant diligence, so that the foregoing perception (that is, the realization that reified objects have no independent nature) increases and develops beyond the previous phase, leading to the meditative absorption and sublime intelligence associated with the attainment of the intermediate level of this experience of clarity, together with the corresponding accompanying factors. There are three degrees of this phase (lesser, intermediate, and greater) on the basis of whether the realization that things lack any independent nature is clearly recalled only intermittently during the dream state, or fairly predominantly, or even more frequently.

One continues to meditate as before, so that all that appears as meaningful objects in one’s perception manifests solely as expressions of mind. One attains this experience of clarity to a great degree, having done away with distractions caused by one’s reifying objects, and also gains the lesser degree of another experience of clarity (the realization that even the subjective perceiving mind is empty and lacks any independent nature), with its attendant meditative absorption and sublime intelligence, [4.107.b] together with their corresponding factors. There are three degrees of this phase (lesser, intermediate, and greater) due to there being the three alternatives of one’s being undaunted by emptiness occasionally, for the most part, or at all times.

One continues to meditate as before, coming to the realization that the subjective perceiving mind has no independent nature, so that the path of seeing ensues immediately in the wake of this realization. With respect to the mundane path,[87] one has attained the greatest degree of the experience of clarity concerning the fact that the perceiving mind has no independent nature, while with respect to the transcendent path[88] one has attained the middling degree of the experience of suchness; these entail meditative absorption and sublime intelligence, together with their corresponding factors. There are three degrees of this phase (lesser, intermediate, and greater) due to this state of clarity (that is, the experience that the subjective perceiving mind has no independent nature) being realized to a lesser, a middling, or an excellent degree.
The higher and lower schools of the Abhidharma[89] are in accord in that they both classify the phase of patient acceptance into three degrees (lesser, intermediate, and greater) but not the other phases that anticipate the decisive breakthrough.[90] As for the essential mode of consciousness experienced during these phases, it is conceptual when compared to the nonconceptual timeless awareness of the path of seeing but can be seen as a nonconceptual mode of direct perception when compared to ordinary consciousness (which ascertains words and meanings); for the former is explained as involving the attainment of an experience of clarity concerning that fact that reified objects have no independent nature).[91]
During these four phases, one cultivates in meditation the five governing powers[92] and the five strengths[93] in turn. One cultivates the powers during the two phases of meditative warmth and the peak experience, and the five strengths during the two phases of patient acceptance and the highest mundane experience.

In order for one to come to a definitive conclusion concerning the nature of this path, there are three points: those whose experience serves as the basis for the onset of this path; the levels of attainment on which it is dependent; and the context on which one focuses. As for the first of these, it is said that the path of linkage can be experienced only by men and women of three continents,[94] or by gods in any of the six states within the realm of desire[95] (that is, it can be experienced by someone who formerly, while a human being, gained an experience of the path of linkage and then was reborn in one of the states of the gods of the realm of desire). In certain Mahāyāna sources that adopt an extraordinary perspective,[96] it is also explained that it can be experienced by nāgas and certain other kinds of animals. [4.108.a]
The second feature concerns the levels of attainment on which the path of linkage is dependent. The path of linkage in the śrāvaka approach is dependent on the six levels of meditative stability: that is, the entirely sufficient preparatory phase of the first level of meditative stability, the actual level per se, the distinctive aspect of this level, and the three actual remaining levels.[97] Those who have not previously become free of desire depend on the preparatory phase of the first level of meditative stability, while those who still have intention but are free of desire depend on the actual level. The path of linkage in the approach of pratyekabuddhas who participate in groups is dependent on any of these six levels of meditative stability; in the approach of those who are said to be “like a rhinoceros,” it is dependent on the actual stage of the fourth level of stability.[98] As for a bodhisattva,[99] a Vaibhāṣika source states:[100]
The Teacher and those who are like rhinoceroses, when they become enlightened, attain all in a single, final state of meditative stability.[101]
That is to say, the Vaibhāṣikas hold that this path is dependent on the fourth level of meditative stability. Alternatively, some Mahāyāna authorities maintain that it is dependent on the actual stage of any one of the four levels of meditative stability.
As for the third feature, the context on which one focuses, the Sautrāntikas hold that during the three phases of meditative warmth, peak experience, and patient acceptance one focuses on the lack of any independent nature in perceived objects, while during that of the highest mundane experience one focuses on the lack of any independent nature of the perceiving mind. Concerning the realization that perceived objects have no independent nature, the Sautrāntikas further state that the phase of meditative warmth entails one’s gaining this experience to a slight degree, the phase of the peak experience entails this increasing to a middling degree, and the phase of patient acceptance entails a great degree of stable realization.
Certain Mahāyāna authorities hold that with the phase of meditative warmth one realizes that perceived objects have no independent nature, while with the phases of patient acceptance and the highest mundane experience one realizes that the perceiving mind has no independent nature. That is to say, they maintain the following: The phase of meditative warmth entails the realization that those perceived objects connected with deeply ingrained afflictive states[102] have no independent nature, while the phase of the peak experience entails the realization that those perceived objects connected with the completely refined state of enlightenment have no independent nature. Concerning the realization that the perceiving mind has no independent nature, they maintain that the phase of patient acceptance entails the realization that the perceiving mind, as it constitutes the basis for the substantial existence of the individual,[103] has no independent nature; the phase of the highest mundane experience entails the same realization regarding the perceiving mind [4.108.b] as it constitutes the basis for the imputed existence of the individual.[104] As the Ornament of Manifest Realization states:
Due to the ground of being and the antidotes it entails,
there are two ways in which perceived objects are conceptualized;
through the specific points of delusion, the mind-body aggregates, and so forth,
these have nine distinct implications.
On the basis of what is, in essence, a seemingly autonomous self, for example,
as well as such factors as the mind-body aggregates,
it is also held that there are two ways in which the perceiving mind is experienced:
as the basis for substantial existence and that of imputed existence.[105]
“In what kind of mind,” one might wonder, “are the experiences of the anticipatory phases to be found?” They are found primarily in the reflexive consciousness[106] that has become familiarized with them through the three kinds of sublime intelligence;[107] for example, the reflexive consciousness that is familiar with desire and other afflictive states.[108]

Elimination takes place through a process of completely doing away with the conceptual labeling that is associated with the afflictive and cognitive obscurations.[110] With respect to the Truths, realization concerns the lack of any independent nature in perceived objects (that is, one-half of the equation that constitutes the seeming identity of phenomena).[111]
Alternatively, some Mahāyāna authorities hold that the respective paths of linkage in the three spiritual approaches entail the following states of realization:
(1) For the śrāvaka approach, the phases of meditative warmth and the peak experience bring realization of the lack of any independent nature in the seeming identity of the individual personality, while the phases of patient acceptance and the highest mundane experience bring this realization as it relates to the perceiving mind associated with the individual personality.
(2) For the pratyekabuddha approach, the phases of meditative warmth and the peak experience bring a partial degree of realization that perceived objects (that is, both the seeming identity of the individual personality and that of phenomena) lack any independent nature, while the phases of patient acceptance and the highest mundane experience bring a partial degree of this realization as it relates to the perceiving mind associated with both kinds of seeming identity.
(3) For the bodhisattva approach, the phases of meditative warmth and the peak experience bring realization that perceived objects (that is, both the seeming identity of the individual personality and that of phenomena) lack any independent nature, while the phases of patient acceptance and the highest mundane experience bring this realization as it relates to the perceiving mind associated with both kinds of seeming identity.
Concerning the path of linkage in these three approaches, the exalted Nāgārjuna states that, aside from differences in the methods used and differences in the precision of one’s focus during each of the four anticipatory phases, [4.109.a] there is no difference with respect to the realization of the lack of identity in things.[112] This is also the enlightened intention found in extensive and middle-length sources of the Buddha’s word,[113] such as in the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras, in which it is stated:
Those who wish to train on the levels of the śrāvakas, moreover, should…train in this transcendent perfection of sublime intelligence,…[114]
and the Compendium, which remarks:
Those who intend to become śrāvaka followers of the Sugata,
or who wish to become pratyekabuddhas, or likewise rulers of the dharma,[115]
cannot attain these states without relying on this acceptance.[116]

And the sūtra the Cloud of the Rare and Excellent states that one is free of the deterioration experienced by an ordinary individual and is endowed with many qualities, such as meditative absorption, the power of complete recall,[120] complete liberation, and levels of deeper discernment.[121] As well, the “Mother” and the Ornament [122] state that those of keen acumen experience incontrovertible signs that they will attain perfect enlightenment.

The terms are derived in the following ways:
▶ Completely nonconceptual timeless awareness associated with the path of seeing, which is comparable to a fire, utterly eradicates all the erroneous concepts of ordinary individuals and so constitutes a decisive breakthrough. If the path of seeing is taken to be the actual breakthrough, these are “phases that anticipate the decisive breakthrough” because they are in accord with it.
▶ Through the influence of one’s firm conviction concerning the actual nature of phenomena, [4.109.b] one experiences patient acceptance, and so this is referred to as “the level of engagement through firm conviction.”[125]
▶ This is a process whereby the sublime intelligence born of mundane states of meditation eradicates the seemingly self-justifying concepts based on dualistic perception, and links one to the path of seeing, that is, the direct realization of ultimate reality, the basic space of phenomena. Therefore, it is called “the path of linkage.”
▶ “Engagement through firm conviction” is in fact a term that is explained as applying to both the path of accumulation and that of linkage.

If we analyze this path from the standpoint of the individual on whose experience it is based, there are two steps: initial entrance into a state and stable abiding in it.[127] If we analyze it from the standpoint of spiritual approaches, there are three versions of the path of seeing as it relates to the śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, and bodhisattva approaches. If we analyze it from the standpoint of what it is in essence, it can be analyzed into sixteen steps, for example; but that model is according to the śrāvaka interpretation. In its very essence, the path of seeing is not divisible because it is subsumed within a single instant. On this path one trains in authentic mindfulness and the rest of the seven aids to enlightenment.[128]

The detailed analysis has two topics: an analysis based on what these are in essence and an analysis based on how they are eliminated.
The first analysis also has two topics: primary and secondary afflictive states. If the primary afflictive states are eliminated, the secondary ones are eliminated as a matter of course.
To discuss the former first, then, there are six afflictive states: desire, anger, pride, ignorance, doubt, and ideological fixation. There are five kinds of ideological fixation: three are the fixations of holding the transitory mind-body aggregates to constitute something real,[130] of holding to philosophical absolutes,[131] and of holding erroneous philosophical opinions[132] and two are the fixations of regarding one’s biased opinions to be absolutes and of regarding personal rules of deportment to be absolutes.[133]
The second analysis also has two topics: the factors to be eliminated on the path of seeing, and those to be eliminated on the path of meditation.
In the first case, in the Vaibhāṣika tradition, the Treasury of Abhidharma states:
There are ten factors, then seven, seven, and eight—
omitting the three and the two belief systems—
that are eliminated in the realms of desire and so forth
through one’s perceiving suffering and the other Truths.[134]
With this, they hold that there are eighty-eight factors to be eliminated.[135]
The Summary discusses 94 factors to be eliminated on the path of seeing.[136] The Compendium of Abhidharma [137] explains that there are 40 factors in the context of the realm of desire: 10 factors (the 5 states of deeply ingrained afflictive states plus the 5 factors included under the heading of ideological fixation) for each of the Four Truths. In the context of the two higher realms, in each there are 9 factors (since anger is absent) for each of the Four Truths, making 36 (that is, 9 times 4) times 2, to give 72. [4.110.b] This makes for a total of 112 factors.
One might object, “But there are 4 factors that do not apply to the realm of formlessness. It is untenable that in that realm one regards discipline and personal rules of deportment to be absolutes, taking physical and verbal conduct to be the causes of purification and liberation. So this means there are only 108 factors to be eliminated on the path of seeing.” But this is not the case.[138] Even though physical and verbal conduct are absent in this realm, and so not taken to be the causes of purification and liberation, there is the perception that the mental outlook in that realm does serve as the cause of natural freedom, and this is classified as regarding discipline and personal rules of deportment to be absolutes. One might further object, “If that is so, doesn’t that make these factors cases of regarding one’s opinions to be absolutes?” But such is not the case. Regarding one’s opinions to be absolutes takes the form of regarding them to be supreme or foremost, while regarding discipline and personal rules of deportment to be absolutes takes the form of regarding them to cause purification, liberation, and so forth. So the manner in which they are regarded is different. “Well,” one might persist, “although suffering and its origin pertain to all three realms, the cessation of suffering and the path to this, which are incorruptible, do not, so it is untenable to posit cessation and the path to each of the three realms.” But in fact this poses no problem, for as the Synopsis explains:
…this is from the standpoint of all three realms.[139]
That is to say, in the case of all of the painful factors to be eliminated being factors that pertain to the realm of desire, the term “the cessation of suffering in the realm of desire” designates the cessation of this suffering and its attendant causes, while “the path in the realm of desire” designates the means by which that cessation becomes fully evident. The cessation and the path as they apply to the two higher realms are designated in a similar manner.
A further objection might be, “The Compendium of Abhidharma discusses 112 factors to be eliminated on the path of seeing, while the Synopsis discusses only 94. Isn’t this a contradiction?” Concerning this point, some say that the difference is one between the Yogacāra and Sautrāntika traditions, but there is a preferable explanation: that these texts are explaining the enlightened intent underlying different sūtras, classifying these factors on a more obvious or more subtle level.

Third, as to the way such factors are eliminated, from the tradition of the śrāvakas,[140] the Treasury of Abhidharma states: [4.111.a]
Through a process that causes the cessation of prior influences,
the obscurations pertaining to that path are utterly eliminated.[141]
Thus, they hold that these factors are eliminated through a process that causes these prior influences to cease.[142]
Those who follow the interpretation common to the śrāvaka and Mahāyāna approaches[143] would alter the above lines to the following:
Through a process that causes new influences to come into being,
the obscurations pertaining to that path are utterly eliminated.
This is due to the fact that they hold that these factors are eliminated through a process that causes new influences (that is, antidotes) to come into being.
According to those who follow the extraordinary interpretation specific to the Mahāyāna approach,[144] neither factors to be eliminated nor their antidotes can be found to exist in any ultimate sense, and so both processes (whether bringing new influences into being or causing prior ones to cease) are untenable. As the Ornament of Manifest Realization states:
There is nothing whatsoever to be removed from this,
nor anything in the slightest to be added.[145]
And in Engaging in the Conduct of a Bodhisattva:
With things being thus empty,
what is there to gain, what is there to lose?[146]

There are four distinctive features: onset, dependence, the way realization occurs, and sequential steps.

As for the first of these, it is said that the onset of this path can be experienced only by men and women of three continents, or by gods of the realm of desire (more specifically, those who are of keen acumen, hold the oral transmission of the Buddha’s teachings, and have a great degree of disenchantment with the world). The onset of this path is not experienced by beings in the three lower realms (for they are prevented from doing so by the great obscurations imposed by the inevitable consequences of their karma), nor by humans on the continent of Kuru or gods in the two higher realms (for they cannot feel this disenchantment).

<d e="2">
As for the second feature (the level of realization on which this path depends), for śrāvakas, the path of seeing depends on any of the six levels of meditative stability. In this regard, those who have not previously become free of desire [4.111.b] depend on the preparatory stage of the first level of meditative stability, while those who are free of desire depend on the actual level itself. The path does not depend on any level within the realm of desire; the path of seeing embodies a harmonious accord between calm abiding and deeper insight, and the realm of desire allows for only a small degree of calm abiding, for there is a great deal of mental distraction. It also does not depend on the realm of form, for this realm allows only a small degree of deeper insight. While it would be possible for the path of seeing to be awakened if one strove to attain the preparatory stages of the second level of meditative stability and other levels, it would be difficult for it to awaken, for these allow only a small degree of calm abiding.
One might object, “But if that is the case, doesn’t the same shortcoming apply to the preparatory stage of the first level?” No, it doesn’t. Why is this so? Because the onset of the path of seeing must depend on one’s state of mind when experiencing the actual stage of the first level of meditative stability, but if the actual stage has not been attained, it is easy to attain the preparatory stage of the first level. As well, it does not depend on the preparatory stage of the second level, for it is sufficient that it depend on the actual stage of the first level, which is easier to attain.
For pratyekabuddhas, in the case of those who live in groups the path of seeing depends on any of the six levels of meditative stability, while for those who dwell alone like a rhinoceros it depends on the actual stage of the fourth level of meditative stability. “Well,” one might object, “it is unreasonable to assert that those pratyekabuddhas who live alone, when they die, are only reborn in the realm of desire because they have eliminated the afflictive states associated with the third level of meditative stability and lower.” But this assertion poses no problem.

<d e="2">
As for the third feature (the way in which realization occurs), according to the tradition common to the śrāvaka and Mahāyāna approaches,[147] śrāvakas have realization of the lack of identity in the individual personality within the context of the Four Truths. They focus not on the Truths just as a formal set of topics but on the specific characteristics of the aspects of the Truths as laid out in a traditional classification.[148] Pratyekabuddhas have realization of the lack of any independent nature in either the seeming identity of the individual personality or that of phenomena perceived as objects. [4.112.a] Bodhisattvas have realization of both aspects of this lack of identity.[149]
Concerning the extraordinary interpretation within the Mahāyāna approach,[150] the “Mother” states:
Those who wish to train on the levels of the śrāvakas, moreover, should …train in this transcendent perfection of sublime intelligence,…[151]
Following this and similar quotations from scriptures, the Exalted One and his followers[152] maintain that there is no difference, in terms of the realization of the lack of identity, between the foregoing three kinds of practitioners.[153]

<d e="2">
As for the fourth feature, the development of this path through numerous sequential steps, there are two interpretations: that of the ordinary approach[154] and that of the extraordinary approach.[155] Concerning the first, the Treasury of Abhidharma states:
From the phase of the highest mundane experience
comes incorruptible patient acceptance that produces an understanding of the Truth.[156]
In the case of the suffering in the realm of desire,
from that comes patient acceptance producing subsequent understanding.
Similarly, in the case of suffering in the remaining realms, from that comes patient acceptance producing subsequent understanding.
A similar process applies to the other three Truths.[157]
In accord with such scriptural sources, the Vaibhāṣikas hold that in the wake of the highest mundane experience there are four steps:
(1) patient acceptance producing an understanding of the phenomenon of suffering as it applies to the realm of desire;
(2) the understanding of this phenomenon that ensues;
(3) patient acceptance producing subsequent understanding of the suffering found in the higher realms; and
(4) the subsequent understanding of this.[158]
Applying this model to the remaining three Truths, they hold that these Truths are perceived through an incorruptible state of sublime intelligence that involves some sixteen steps. Concerning this, the Treasury of Abhidharma states:
According to the successive stages of patient acceptance and understanding,
there is the pathway without obstacles and the pathway of complete freedom.
There are fifteen steps to this process.
Because what has not been seen before is seen, it is the path of seeing.…
…Its result lies in the sixteenth step.[159]

<d e="2">
As this quotation indicates, eight steps of patient acceptance[160] constitute the “pathway without obstacles,”[161] which defines the attainment that comes from eliminating factors on the path of seeing, while eight steps of understanding constitute the “pathway of complete freedom,” which brings about the experience of attainment that comes from being free of these factors. The first fifteen of these steps [4.112.b] constitute the actual path of seeing, while the sixteenth pertains to the path of meditation, for it is the result of, and the continuation of, the path of seeing.
According to the Middle Way tradition of the Mahāyāna approach,[162] the path of seeing is to be considered a single step,[163] from the point of view that it is not ultimately divisible, for the all-pervasive mode of the actual nature of phenomena[164] means that seeing anything “newer” is not logically valid;[165] thus, the assigning of sixteen steps is a means of eradicating speculative assumptions and enhancing one’s realization. That is to say, the four steps of patient acceptance constitute the pathway without obstacles, which removes the factors to be eliminated on the path of seeing (that is, the suffering that is entailed in the three realms). The four steps of understanding constitute the pathway of complete freedom, once these factors have been eliminated. The four steps of patient acceptance producing subsequent understanding constitute the pathway without obstacles, which eradicates the speculative assumptions that the foregoing steps do not serve as causes of the future circumstances of a spiritually advanced being. The four steps of subsequent understanding constitute the pathway of complete freedom, once these assumptions have been eliminated.

The Major Commentary on the Transcendent Perfection of Sublime Intelligence in Eight Thousand Verses states that there is only a single step with respect to the higher realization that results but sixteen steps from the standpoint of dispelling incorrect opinions concerning each of the Four Truths.[166] The Adornment of the Sage’s Intent states that the patient acceptance producing an understanding of the phenomenon of suffering constitutes the path of seeing in the actual sense, while the other steps constitute this path in the purely nominal sense.[167] On the basis of varying levels of acumen, other sources hold that there are anywhere from one to sixteen steps. The interpretation clearly expressed in the Compendium of Abhidharma is that there are sixteen steps that occur in an uninterrupted succession, for to say otherwise would be at odds with divisions of the path into stages of “initial entrance” and “stable abiding,”[168] into strictly demarcated levels of acumen, and so forth.[169]
In all such contexts, the term “step”[170] refers to “the time needed to complete some function,” that is, defining such a step on the basis of this or that function having come to completion.
According to the extraordinary interpretation,[171] the idiom used is that in actual fact a bodhisattva gains patient acceptance of the fact that things are not produced;[172] the position is not one of the onset of the path of seeing taking place in any ultimate sense. [4.113.a] For as one of the sūtras states:
The single truth is that things are not produced.
Some extrapolate four truths from that fact.
When one is resting in the very essence of enlightenment,
even a single truth cannot be found to exist,[173] so how possibly could four?[174]
And as the Sixty Verses of Reasoning states:
If there were still distinctions to be made in the wake of the understanding of phenomena,[175]
and someone were to discern production of some extremely subtle thing,[176]
that person, being completely unwise,[177]
would not have seen how things are only conditionally produced.[178]

One might raise the point, “How can it be, then, that the sūtras describe the path of seeing as consisting of anywhere from one to sixteen steps?” The Buddha’s intention underlying these models was one of guiding those who are proponents of materialist philosophies.[179] The basis for this intention lies in the process of interdependent origination, and its purpose is one of engaging those with overt materialist fixations. In undermining this materialist position, the Source Verses on Sublime Intelligence states:
Neither from themselves, nor from anything other,
neither from both, nor without cause,
no thing whatsoever, under any circumstances,
ever entails production.[180]
It thus refutes the production of things by disproving it through these four alternatives. Furthermore, if one determines that the onset of the path of seeing occurs through numerous sequential steps, then one should be able to determine the breakdown of these numerous sequential steps, which in this interpretation is logically absurd. Again, as the Source Verses on Sublime Intelligence states:
You might think, “What I have ‘seen’ is the occurrence and breakdown of things.”
But the occurrence and breakdown of things are corruptions due to ignorance.[181]
One might then object, “Doesn’t the fact that things occur interdependently constitute some kind of production?” No, it does not. The sūtra the Request of Anavatapta states:
Whatever is produced through dependence is not, in fact, produced;
it does not have production in its nature.
Whatever relies on circumstances, that is emptiness.
Whoever understands this to be emptiness is prudent.[182]

And the exalted Nāgārjuna states: [4.113.b]
I am not refuting the mundane habit of saying,
“Depending on that, this occurs.”
But whatever occurs in interdependent origination has no independent nature;
how, with any certainty, can one say about it, “It exists”?[183]
And he also stated:
Because there is no phenomenon
that does not occur through interdependent origination,
therefore there is no phenomenon
that is not emptiness.[184]
Given these and other extensive discussions, all phenomena are unproduced.

Someone on the path of seeing is, for example, free of five states of fear,[186] including [the fear of] lower states of rebirth, and gains the capacity to experience twelve hundredfold qualities (such as the attainment of one hundred simultaneous states of meditative absorption).[187] However, it is also held that there is still a residual inborn sense of individual selfhood, and so the afflictive states that derive from that are still present as latent instincts; therefore, even though there is no fixation on anything whatsoever as “real,” there can still be circumstances that provoke momentary states of anxiety, just as a person might be frightened upon seeing a human-shaped cairn on a mountain pass. Likewise, there are definitely still traces of all-consuming conceptual labeling, such as the fear of falling back into saṃsāra should one’s attention wander, or the desire for fame and reputation.
These are not, however, firmly established, as they are in ordinary individuals. Rather, they are undermined by a moment’s recollection, without one having to rely on some antidote. Briefly stated, therefore, it is said that once one has attained the path of seeing, even though ordinary thoughts arise, they are undermined in the next moment, and timeless awareness holds sway, so that henceforth one traverses the paths as a matter of course, without concerted effort being necessary, [4.114.a] like an arrow in flight.

This path is described by such terms as “incorruptible virtue,” serving as the antidote to what is substantial and therefore corruptible; “the antidote involving elimination” since it brings about the utter elimination of afflictive states, which constitute the factors to be eliminated on the path of seeing; and “the initial arousal of transcendent mind” since it constitutes the first experience of a spiritually advanced being. The meaning behind the derivation of the term “the path of seeing” lies in the fact that there is direct “seeing” of what has not been seen before, that is, the actual nature of phenomena, free of elaboration,[188] which is the truth for the spiritually advanced.
“Well,” one might wonder, “what is the difference between this and the realization that takes place within the context of the path of linkage?” Realization in the path of seeing constitutes directly perceiving the specific characteristics of the nature of phenomena, while realization in the path of linkage constitutes partial realization of that nature in a way that approximates the former.

The incorruptible path of meditation directed toward nirvāṇa can be analyzed in five ways, according to: the working basis; what factors are to be eliminated; the pathways entailed; its essence; and what becomes familiar.
(1) In the first place, there are three versions of the path of meditation: for the śrāvaka, the pratyekabuddha, and the bodhisattva.
(2) In the second place, to analyze this path according to the factors to be eliminated, there are 414 factors[190] to be eliminated on the path of meditation, and as well an equal number of antidotes to these.
(3) In the third place, to analyze it into the pathways it includes, there are four: the pathway of linkage, the pathway without obstacles, the pathway of complete freedom, and the pathway of distinctive features.
(4) In the fourth place, to analyze it according to its essence, it has three degrees: greater, middling, and lesser.
(5) In the fifth place, to analyze the path of meditation according to what becomes familiar, it is twofold, with this familiarization being brought about through meditative equipoise and postmeditation awareness.
Within the context of this path, one trains in authentic view and the rest of the branches of the eightfold path of noble ones.[191]

<d e="2">
As for the first consideration, there are three further points: the characteristics of the factors to be eliminated on the path of meditation, a detailed analysis of these factors, and the way in which they are eliminated through antidotes.
First, these are factors associated with the inborn sense of individual selfhood, which ensure that the mind is utterly unable to experience a state of peace.
Second, there are six inborn afflictive states associated with the realm of desire.[192] There are forty associated with the two higher realms, five (since anger is absent) for each of the eight levels (the first level of meditative stability and the rest). Taken together, these total 46 factors. Each of these has three degrees (greater, middling, and lesser), and each of these in turn is subdivided into the greater of the greater and so forth, making nine degrees for each factor, giving a final total of 414 factors.
Third, one should understand that the way in which these factors are eliminated through antidotes is similar to the process explained under the path of seeing.

<d e="2">
As for the second consideration, the development of the path of seeing, there are three features: those whose experience serves as the basis for the development of this path, the levels of attainment on which it is dependent, and the context on which one focuses. As for the first of these, the development of this path can be experienced by men and women of three continents, or by gods other than those in states devoid of perception[193] and those at the pinnacle of conditioned existence;[194] this is because all of their merit is such that it can serve to support the experience. The development of this path cannot be experienced by beings in the three lower states, by humans on the continent of Uttarakuru, or by those who are asexual or hermaphroditic since their obscurations are too great.[195] Gods in states devoid of perception also cannot experience this since their minds are unclear, nor can those at the pinnacle of conditioned existence since they do not see the alternative of a state of peace higher than their state.[196]
As for the second feature, in the śrāvaka approach the path of meditation is dependent on nine levels, that is, the four actual levels of meditative stability, the preparatory phase of the first level of meditative stability, the distinctive aspect of this actual level,[197] and the three resultant levels in the realm of formlessness.[198] The reasons that it is not dependent on any other levels are as follows: the minds of beings in the realm of desire are not adaptable enough,[199] while the minds of those at the pinnacle of conditioned existence lack clarity. This path is also not dependent on the preparatory stages of the other three levels of meditative stability[200] and the first three states of the realm of formlessness, [4.115.b] for these stages entail concerted effort to attain the next higher stage and thus allow for only a small degree of calm abiding, and on that basis there can be no integration of calm abiding and deeper insight in these states.
As for the path of meditation in the pratyekabuddha approach, for those who live in groups this path depends on any of the six levels of meditative stability, while for those who dwell alone like a rhinoceros it depends on the actual stage of the fourth level of meditative stability.
The path of meditation in the bodhisattva approach depends on the utterly pure fourth level of meditative stability. However, as for the level on which one is reborn, due to one’s karma and aspirations one can be reborn in the two realms of desire and form (not that of formlessness) and then, when one is training in meditative absorption (resting in the meditative equipoise through such approaches as that of “the majestic lion” or “progress in leaps and bounds”[201]), one is resting in the equipoise of these states of formlessness and cessation.
As for the third feature, the context on which one focuses, according to the interpretation common to the śrāvaka and Mahāyāna approaches,[202] in the wake of the path of seeing one becomes more familiar with a harmonious accord between calm abiding and deeper insight that focuses on the actual nature of the Four Truths. According to the extraordinary interpretation specific to the Mahāyāna approach,[203] one becomes more familiar with the connection that the actual nature of phenomena and timeless awareness (which are realized on the path of seeing) have with all limitless objects in the phenomenal world.[204]

The factors to be eliminated on the path of meditation are all the remaining entrapping factors[205] that could not be removed on the path of seeing; these are gradually eliminated. In particular, in the Mahāyāna approach, as the Ornament of the Sūtras states:
Once the afflictive states that are to be eliminated through the path of seeing have all been thoroughly exhausted,
in order to remove the cognitive obscurations,
one engages intensively in meditation.[206]
Thus, it is the cognitive obscurations that are primarily eliminated. And as Haribhadra states:
because the focus is no different than what is described as being
directly perceived through the path of seeing…[207]
This means that the direct realization of the actual nature of phenomena is in complete harmony with that of the path of seeing. [4.116.a] That is to say, this is primarily due to the transcendent path of meditation; the mundane path of meditation brings about saṃsāra as its result, and so is inferior to the path of seeing.

The basis underlying the characteristics of this path (which constitutes the antidote that leads to the culmination of the process of elimination) is that of abiding on the eleventh level, that of buddhahood, or “Total Illumination,” once the vajralike meditative absorption, the final limit of the continuum of the ten spiritual levels, has eliminated the obscurations; these are both the afflictive states that seem to be ingrained like marrow or butterfat,[212] and even the most subtle of the cognitive obscurations.

If we analyze this path according to spiritual approaches, there are three versions: the path of no more training for śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas. Alternatively, it can be analyzed into two pathways: the pathway without obstacles and the pathway of complete freedom. Or it can be analyzed into three levels, namely, that of the factors that require no more training, the level of realization that “the task is finished,” and the level on which obscurations have been eliminated. Two further factors that are specific to the path of no more training are the knowledge that the afflictive states, which were to have been eliminated, have in fact been removed, and the knowledge that suffering, which will no longer occur, will in fact no longer occur.
In the above contexts, there are ten factors that require no more training: the consummate stages of the branches of the eightfold path of noble ones (from the view that requires no more training, up to meditative absorption that requires no more training); the utterly liberated state of authentic mind that requires no more training; and the utterly liberated state of authentic sublime intelligence that requires no more training. These ten factors can also be considered from the standpoint of the five “incorruptible components”: (1) three factors (authentic speech, activity, and livelihood that require no more training) constitute the component of discipline; (2) two factors (meditative absorption and mindfulness) constitute the component of meditative absorption; (3) three factors (view, thought, and diligence) constitute the component of sublime intelligence;[213] (4) the utterly liberated state of mind constitutes the component of complete freedom; and (5) the utterly liberated state of sublime intelligence constitutes the component of the vision that is the utterly liberated state of timeless awareness.[214]

In coming to a definitive conclusion concerning the nature of this path, there are three features: those whose experience serves as the basis for the onset of this path; the levels of attainment on which it is dependent; and the context on which one focuses.
As for the first and second of these, according to the śrāvaka tradition it is held that the path of consummation is similar to the transcendent path of meditation discussed previously. According to the interpretation of the common Mahāyāna approach,[215] a human rebirth serves as the basis for this path, and in particular the bodhisattva[216] takes rebirth in a central country[217] of our world, in a priestly or warrior class;[218] as for the level of attainment, this path is held to ensue from the vajralike samādhi on the fourth level of meditative stability. According to the interpretation of the extraordinary Mahāyāna approach,[219] a bodhisattva on the tenth level of realization serves as the basis for this path, while the path itself is held to ensue from the governing condition of the vajralike samādhi, which takes place after the extremely pure fourth level of meditative stability.
As for the third feature, the context on which one focuses, according to the interpretation common to the śrāvaka and Mahāyāna approaches,[220] through the vajralike samādhi one focuses on the Four Truths, or the Truth of Cessation, or else the ten factors that require no more training. According to the extraordinary interpretation specific to the Mahāyāna approach,[221] one focuses on nirvāṇa that is in no way static or limited.[222]

The distinctive processes of elimination and realization on this path are such that all the hindrances to the state of liberation specific to a given approach[223] have been eliminated without exception, while the significance of reality just as it is—the actual nature of phenomena—is realized in its purity, unadulterated by absolutely any factors to be eliminated as these are defined in any given approach. Concerning the significance of things in all their multiplicity, according to the Treasury of Abhidharma, this is realized as follows:
Arhats, rhinoceros-like ones, and teachers,[224] respectively,
perceive two-thousandfold, three-thousandfold, and countless universes.[225]

This path is referred to as “the foundation of incorruptible virtue” since it is free of absolutely all that is corruptible; as “the antidote to conditioned existence”[228] since it ensures that the afflictive states that have been eliminated do not occur again; and as “the path of consummation” since one has journeyed to the final point at which what is to be eliminated has been eliminated and what is to be known has become known. It is also called “the path of no more training” since one’s training has been completed.
“Well,” one might say, “why, then, is the term ‘path’ applied in this case?” In the earlier “moment” of the vajralike samādhi, there is something to be eliminated and something to be attained, while in the later “moment” there is the cause of that elimination and the cause of that attainment, and so this is referred to as the “path” of consummation.
Concerning the foregoing, the interpretation common to the śrāvaka and Mahāyāna approaches[229] follows the Treasury of Abhidharma, which states:
In order to bring about mastery in the attainment,
higher and higher, of nirvāṇa and other states,
there is the faculty that brings all-knowing awareness,[230]
the faculty of all-knowing awareness,[231] and the faculty endowed with all-knowing awareness.[232]
In accord with this quotation, the common interpretation maintains that the faculty that brings all-knowing awareness of what was previously unknown and that ensures mastery of the path of seeing is already present during the path of linkage; the faculty of all-knowing awareness, which ensures mastery of the path of meditation, is present during the path of seeing; and the faculty endowed with all-knowing awareness, which ensures mastery of the path of consummation, is in fact present during the path of meditation. The extraordinary interpretation specific to the Mahāyāna approach, however, does not employ the conventional designations of these faculties.

What is termed “the level of freedom from attachment” is, in fact, a reference to eight secondary levels that pertain to the basic Hīnayāna approach and primarily involve meditation on the lack of identity in the individual personality and on the Four Truths of noble ones. These levels are termed those of “spiritual potential,” “the eighth,” “seeing,” “subtlety,” “freedom from attachment,”[234] “realization of what has been accomplished,” “śrāvaka,” and “pratyekabuddha.” It is in reference to these levels that the expression “powerful master of the eight levels”[235] is employed.
▶ Initially, one gains the “level of completely perceiving what is positive.” This is the path of accumulation in the śrāvaka approach. It is so termed because the virtue undertaken on this path contributes to one’s liberation, so that it is liberation that is here termed entirely positive, while to focus on that liberation is in itself virtuous.
▶ The “level of spiritual potential” refers to both the greater degree of the phase of patient acceptance and the phase of the highest mundane experience on the path of linkage. Up to and including the phases of meditative warmth and the peak experience, it is still possible that one could turn to the Mahāyāna approach;[236] up to the intermediate degree of the phase of patient acceptance, it is still possible that one could turn to the pratyekabuddha approach. However, from the greater degree of patient acceptance onward there is no possibility that one will turn to any other approach, and so one’s spiritual potential in the śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha approaches is ensured.
▶ The “level of the eighth” is that of initial entrance into the state of a stream-winner, that is, one who is entering the first of the eight fruition levels, counting back from that of an arhat.[237] [4.118.b]
▶ The “level of seeing” is that of the fruition of a stream-winner[238] because one directly perceives the topics of the Four Truths.
▶ The “level of subtlety” is that of the fruition of a once-returner[239] because the majority of afflictive states with the realm of desire have been eliminated.
▶ The “level of freedom from attachment” is that of the fruition of a nonreturner[240] because there is freedom from attachment even while one is still in the realm of desire.
▶ The “level of realization of what has been accomplished” is that of the fruition of an arhat,[241] that is, the path of the direct realization of the Four Truths.
▶ The “levels of the śrāvaka” refers collectively to the levels that are the basis for this analysis. Alternatively, this term can refer to the three remaining levels of initial entrance into the state of a once-returner and the rest[242] because the other manifest states of realization for śrāvakas are called by other specific names, and so a general term can here be understood to refer to specific levels.
▶ The “level of the pratyekabuddha” is that of one who gives rise to an attitude that holds the thirty-seven factors that contribute to enlightenment[243] to be solely for one’s own awakening to buddhahood. With that, one pursues one’s spiritual development by serving buddhas for a hundred eons or more, whereupon, in one’s final rebirth, one is reborn in a realm devoid of either buddhas or śrāvakas. There, without relying on another to be one’s spiritual guide, one fully experiences enlightenment through one’s own power. This level will not be considered in my discussion of the spiritual levels.[244]

As for what are called “the levels associated with completely perfect buddhahood,” this refers to the ten spiritual levels that pertain to the Mahāyāna approach and primarily involve the cultivation of meditative absorption concerning the lack of both kinds of identity[245] and emptiness as the nature of all phenomena. These ten levels, from that of “The Utterly Joyful One” to “The Cloud of Dharma,” are treated in the discussion that follows. Concerning these levels, the Precious Garland states:
Just as the teachings of the śrāvaka approach explain
that there are eight levels of the śrāvakas,
similarly, the teachings of the Mahāyāna approach demonstrate
that there are ten bodhisattva levels.[246]
Concerning the level of buddhahood, there are analyses (for example, the explanation found in the Sublimely Unchanging State)[247] that divides this further into two: the “level of reaching the state of suchness ( tathāgata)” and [4.119.a] “the level of buddhahood.” This explanation is in accord with the intention found in certain commentarial treatises, which treat the ten transcendent levels as those of bodhisattvas and the eleventh as the level of buddhahood.

One might wonder, “What are the distinctions between the two systems of levels?”[248] In fact, there are many. Thus, depending on the system, there are two kinds of supernormal powers: on the levels of freedom from attachment, more temporary powers that are limited in scope; and on the levels associated with buddhahood, powers that are fully developed.
Similarly, levels of deeper discernment are of two kinds. On the former (śrāvaka) levels,[249] there are the five states other than that of knowledge of the exhaustion of all that is corruptible.[250] On the latter (bodhisattva) levels, there are all six states, including the deeper discernment that entails knowledge of the exhaustion of any and all potential for the corrupting influences of afflictive states.
The realization of the lack of identity is also of two kinds. On the śrāvaka levels, there is simply the realization that the individual personality (which is imputed to the continuity of the five mind-body aggregates that perpetuate cyclic existence as its material causes) has no identity. On the bodhisattva levels, there is realization of the lack of identity in both the individual personality and in all imputed phenomena associated with it.
The way in which one meditates on the path of meditation is also of two kinds. On the śrāvaka levels, one meditates on the Four Truths of noble ones. On the bodhisattva levels, one cultivates the meditative absorption on emptiness (that is, the lack of any truly inherent nature in any and all phenomena).
The insight involved, too, has two aspects. On the śrāvaka levels, one becomes aware of finite numbers of objects formerly hidden from one’s direct experience. On the bodhisattva levels, one becomes aware of the enumerations of all things in their infinitude.
There are, as well, two aspects to the language used, the spiritual teachings given, and the benefit that is ensured. On the śrāvaka levels, one can use the languages of certain limited numbers of beings, give certain limited teachings, and ensure a certain limited amount of benefit thereby. On the bodhisattva levels, these factors are magnified [4.119.b] on a scale that includes countless beings.
Nirvāṇa, too, is of two kinds. The distinction lies in the fact that, through the śrāvaka levels, there remain residual traces of the mind-body aggregates since all the habitual patterns underlying the obscurations have not been eliminated without exception; while through the bodhisattva levels, there are no such residual traces since these patterns have all been eliminated without exception.

If one wonders why the term “level” is employed, the Ornament of the Sūtras states:
Because one abides joyfully,
engaging thoroughly[251] in all ways
in various pursuits of virtue,
it is held that this abiding constitutes the levels of the bodhisattvas.[252]
That is to say, these are termed “levels” since, like the great earth, they serve as foundations, contexts, or supports for limitless positive qualities. Alternatively, the same source states:
In order that countless beings become fearless,
there is a process of proceeding further and further
through these immeasurable states,
they are held to be levels.[253]
The equivalent Sanskrit term (for the Tibetan sa) is bhūmi. This is definitely to be seen as a compound term. [4.120.a] Bhū derives from bhūta (that is, elements[254]) for, like the great elements, these levels serve as supports for the amassing of positive qualities. Mi derives from amita (immensity) since they are attained through an immensity of effort in meeting challenges. According to another interpretation, bhū derives from abhaya (fearlessness) since once one has attained these levels, one has dispensed with the five states of fear, for example. Alternatively, bhū derives from bhūya[s] (furthering) and so the term “level” implies something that serves as a support for one to proceed higher and higher, by going further on the basis of something that preceded it. In brief, then, the general derivation of the term “level” comes from using this word as a referent since these levels, similar to the earth as a foundation, serve as supports for positive qualities.

Generally speaking, there are four ways of analyzing these levels: a distinction between those of ordinary individuals and spiritually advanced beings; an analysis on the basis of how the levels are attained; an analysis on the basis of how spiritual attainment comes about; and an analysis on the basis of the pride involved.
The first case has two divisions: the levels of ordinary individuals in the world and the levels that transcend this ordinary world.
The characteristics of the first kind of levels are such that these levels serve as supports for the qualities that permit one to proceed to the state of a spiritually advanced being. As for the underlying basis of what can be so characterized, it is appropriate to analyze this into the two further levels of (a) one who is a beginning practitioner and (b) one who practices with dedicated intent.
(a) The former is the case of those who experience the awakening of their spiritual potential for the Mahāyāna approach, from the point that they first arouse the motivation of bodhicitta up to and including the circumstances of the path of accumulation since this is the process that matures their personal experience, which previously had not been matured.
(b) The latter level constitutes the circumstances of the path of linkage since they are simply developing a dedicated intent concerning the meaning of emptiness.
The characteristics of the second kind of levels (those that transcend this ordinary world) are such that these levels serve as supports for the qualities that are unique to spiritually advanced beings. As for the underlying basis of what can be so characterized, this constitutes the circumstances from the path of seeing to the path of consummation, [4.120.b] since the process is one of bringing one increasing familiarity with incorruptible meditative absorption, that is, with the timeless awareness of suchness that one had some direct realization of on the first bodhisattva level.
The second analysis is on the basis of how the levels are attained. This analysis includes four stages:
(a) the level attained through dedicated intent, which one gains by engaging in the teachings[255] primarily through that dedicated intent;
(b) the level attained through one’s conduct, by applying oneself, according to one’s personal inclinations, to the ten kinds of spiritual practice;[256]
(c) the level attained through realization (that is, one’s direct understanding of the actual nature of phenomena, from the first bodhisattva level onward); and
(d) the level of spiritual attainment (that is, one’s progress in a spontaneous and effortless way from the eighth bodhisattva level onward).
As the Ornament of the Sūtras states:
As for the attainment of the levels,
this happens in four stages:
that of dedicated intent, that of engaging in pure conduct,
that of realization, and that of attainment of the levels.[257]
The third analysis is on the basis of how spiritual attainment comes. This is a fourfold analysis:
(a) In the context of the paths of accumulation and linkage, the level is one of practicing with dedicated intent, and spiritual attainment has not yet come about.
(b) In the context of the paths of seeing and meditation, the level is one of completely pure altruistic motivation, and spiritual attainment has nominally come about.
(c) However, as regards this attainment, from the first to the seventh bodhisattva level, concerted effort is involved, and from that point of view it can be said that attainment has not truly come about.
(d) Because there is no concerted effort involved from the eighth bodhisattva level onward, spiritual attainment has truly come about.
This can be gathered in the following passage from the same source:[258]
One should understand these levels all to be ones
in which spiritual attainment has or has not truly come about.
Even the ones in which there is attainment are held to be ones
in which it both has or has not come about.[259]
The fourth analysis is on the basis of the degree of pride involved. This is a threefold analysis:
(a) On the level of one practicing with dedicated intent, there is still a good deal of pride involved.
(b) On the first seven impure bodhisattva levels, there is more subtle pride involved.
(c) On the final three pure bodhisattva levels, there is no pride involved. As the same source states:
It is held that these involve a good deal of pride,
more subtle pride, or no pride.[260]

These are the names that refer to the bodhisattva levels, from the first to the tenth. As for their derivations:
(1) The first level is called that of “The Utterly Joyful One” because one’s seeing the significance of the actual nature of phenomena (which one had not seen previously) arouses in one an intense sense of joy. One sees that, as far oneself is concerned, one is approaching the sublime state of enlightenment, while as far as others are concerned, one can ensure benefit for beings on an enormous scale.
(2) The second level is called that of “The Immaculate One” because one has dispensed with violations of one’s discipline and ideas of following the Hīnayāna approach.
(3) The third level is called that of “The Illuminating One” because through the power of one’s meditative absorption one seeks countless spiritual teachings and then casts a great spiritual illumination on others.
(4) The fourth level is called that of “The Radiant One” because the fire of sublime intelligence that contributes to one’s enlightenment incinerates the two kinds of obscuration.
(5) The fifth level is called that of “The One Who Meets the Challenge” because when one brings beings to spiritual maturity, one does not react negatively to the perverse behavior of others but refines two factors that are difficult to refine (that is, the beings one is relating to and one’s own mind).
(6) The sixth level is called that of “The One Who Makes Evident” because one makes evident the equalness of conditioned existence and the state of peace[261] by relying on the transcendent perfection of sublime intelligence.
(7) The seventh level is called that of “The One Who Has Gone Far” because one is approaching the eighth bodhisattva level (called “the path that leads in only one direction”[262]), is already connected with it, and has come to the final limit of having to apply oneself with deliberate effort.
(8) The eighth level is called that of “The Immutable One” because one is unmoved by deliberate ideas concerning either conceptual frameworks or the state that involves no such frameworks.
(9) The ninth level is called that of “The One of Brilliant Intelligence” because one has gained a noble intelligence that entails the four states of authentic discernment.[263]
(10) The tenth level is called that of “The Cloud of Dharma” because one’s meditative absorption and power of complete recall are compared to clouds, [4.121.b] which permeate the spacelike expanse of all the spiritual teachings that one has received from buddhas while one was on the first nine bodhisattva levels.
Such are the descriptive terms that are employed.

(1) One attains the first bodhisattva level through ten kinds of thorough training,[264] such as that of contemplating all things without fickleness.
(2) In a similar way, one attains the second level through eight kinds of thorough training,[265] such as that of observing discipline and expressing gratitude.
(3) One attains the third level through five kinds of thorough training,[266] such as that of being insatiable in listening to teachings.
(4) One attains the fourth level through ten kinds of thorough training,[267] such as that of dwelling in solitude.
(5) One attains the fifth level through ten kinds of thorough training,[268] such as that of avoiding having connections with mundane people for personal gain or other selfish reasons.
(6) One attains the sixth level through twelve kinds of thorough training,[269] such as that of training in perfecting generosity and the rest of the six factors and avoiding six other factors (such as yearning for the śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha approach).
(7) One attains the seventh level through twenty (or forty) kinds of thorough training,[270] such as that of eliminating twenty factors (such as falsely imputing identity to things) and relying on twenty others that are their opposites (such as gaining understanding of the three avenues to complete liberation[271]).
(8) One attains the eighth level through eight kinds of thorough training,[272] such as that of understanding the behavior of all beings.
(9) One attains the ninth level through twelve kinds of thorough training,[273] such as that of formulating limitless prayers of aspiration.
(10) One attains the tenth level through ten kinds of thorough training, such as that of using one’s power of discernment to analyze in great detail all the things one has understood in the first nine levels.
This progress is referred to in The Ornament of Manifest Realization:
Through ten kinds of thorough training,
one attains the first level.
One employs the processes of contemplation and bringing benefit…[274]
As for the way in which one progresses, one remains on any given level, from the first to the tenth, for as long as it takes to complete the thorough training specific to that level; once it has been completed, one progresses to the next highest level. [4.122.a] As the Major Commentary on the Transcendent Perfection of Sublime Intelligence in Eight Thousand Verses states:
One should understand that whatever kinds of thorough training are associated with whatever level, one is on that level until that training has been completed; once it has been thoroughly completed, one proceeds to another level.[275]

From a bodhisattva on the first level (who practices primarily the transcendent perfection of generosity and engages in the remaining transcendent perfections in a peripheral manner), up to one on the tenth level (who practices primarily the transcendent perfection of timeless awareness and engages in the remaining perfections in a peripheral manner), the ten transcendent perfections are associated one-to-one with the ten levels. These ten are as described in Distinguishing Center and Limit:
Generosity, discipline, forbearance, diligence,
meditative stability, sublime intelligence, skillful means,
aspiration, spiritual power, and timeless awareness:
these are the ten transcendent perfections….
…One should understand that these ten levels are distinguished
by certain distinctive features and yet indistinguishable.[276]
(1) Thus, those who are on the first bodhisattva level are called “individual practitioners with a completely pure view” because they have realized the basic space of phenomena to be devoid of both kinds of identity.[277]
(2) In a similar way, those on the second level are called “those with completely pure discipline” because they are unsullied by even the slightest ethical flaw.
(3) Those on the third level are called “those resting utterly in meditative equipoise” because they have attained limitless states of meditative stability and absorption.
(4) Those on the fourth level are called “those without preconceptions concerning the separateness of phenomena” because they are without deeply ingrained fixations.
(5) Those on the fifth level are called “those without preconceptions concerning the separateness of their mental continuum” because they have gained evenness of mind.
(6) Those on the sixth level are called “those without preconceptions concerning the separateness of deeply ingrained afflictive states and complete enlightenment” because they experience these both as pure by their very nature. [4.122.b]
(7) Those on the seventh level are called “those who have attained the intelligence to meditate each and every moment on factors contributing to enlightenment” because they abide in the experience of what cannot be characterized.
(8) Those on the eighth level are called “those who are impartial and thoroughly refined” because they are truly spontaneous.
(9) Those on the ninth level are called “those who are skilled in bringing beings to spiritual maturity” because they have gained mastery of the four states of authentic discernment.
(10) Those on the tenth level are called “individual practitioners who have been empowered by all the buddhas” because they have attained levels of deeper discernment to an enormous degree. Therefore, they have completely perfected their physical bodies through meditative absorption and the power of complete recall, so that they are destined to cause emanations to manifest, residing in such realms as Tuṣita.[278]

On the first bodhisattva level, one trains in the causes leading to the three perfectly pure higher trainings. On the second level, one applies oneself to the higher training in discipline; on the third level, to that of mind; and on the fourth, fifth, and sixth levels, to that of sublime intelligence. Thus, one focuses in succession on factors that contribute to enlightenment, the Truths, and interdependent origination.
The results of these trainings are as follows: On the seventh level, timeless awareness of what cannot be characterized is ensured; on the eighth level, the spontaneously present experience of timeless awareness;[279] on the ninth level, the spiritual maturation of all beings; and on the tenth level, all the supports for meditative stability and power of complete recall.
Once one has directly realized the actual nature of phenomena on the first level, on the second level one trains successively in the component of discipline; on the third level, in the component of meditative stability; on the fourth, fifth, and sixth levels, in the component of sublime intelligence; and on the seventh and higher levels, in the component of complete freedom from anything obscuring the four aforementioned results. On the level of buddhahood, there is total refinement of the component of complete freedom from anything obscuring any possible object of knowledge, [4.123.a] as well as the component of the vision that is the liberated state of timeless awareness.

Due to three causes (those of making offerings to the Three Jewels, bringing beings to complete spiritual maturity, and dedicating one’s fundamentally positive qualities[280] toward enlightenment) carried out over eons, from the first to the tenth levels these fundamentally positive factors become ever more completely purified. Analogies are used to describe the different degrees of purification that apply to the successive levels; one can learn about these in the sūtra the Ten Spiritual Levels.
As for the distinct states of elimination and realization that pertain to those on these levels, the 112 factors to be eliminated on the path of seeing are removed on that path, and those to be eliminated on the path of meditation are removed on that path. But when we discuss the ten levels, on these respective levels there are specific aspects of timeless awareness (that is, of realization concerning the basic space of phenomena) that successively eliminate the cognitive obscurations that are the counterproductive factors specific to any given level.
As well, the five states of fear are eliminated, as the sūtra the Ten Spiritual Levels states:
Immediately upon attaining this level,[281] one is free of the five kinds of fear:
free of the fear of being without livelihood, of death, of not being acknowledged,
of lower states of rebirth, and of one’s retinue. One has no feelings of anxiety concerning these.
And why, one might ask? These no longer have any hold over one.[282]
And as the Highest Continuum states:
Spiritually advanced beings have thoroughly removed
the sufferings of death, illness, and aging.
Rebirth takes place due to the influence of karma and afflictive states;
but because they are not subject to these, they are not subject to the rest.[283]
Which is to say, one has eliminated the four “rivers of suffering.”[284] In these and other ways, one has been freed from an inconceivable amount of fear. The point to be understood [4.123.b] is that these processes continue to increase from the first bodhisattva level to the tenth.
Even though one is freed from these four kinds of suffering, one manifests as though one were still not freed, which is to say one consciously takes rebirth in conditioned existence. As the same source states:
Because they perceive reality authentically, just as it is,
they have transcended birth and so forth;
nevertheless, through the power of their compassion
they demonstrate birth, death, illness, and aging.[285]
As concerns realization, in meditative equipoise, those on all ten levels realize the spacelike nature of phenomena (that is, the ultimate mode of reality, just as it is, free of the limitations of conceptual elaboration). In postmeditation, they realize the illusion-like quality of objects in the phenomenal world (that is, the relative mode of things in all their multiplicity, apparent yet lacking any independent nature of their own).
Other than the authenticity of this actual nature of phenomena, which is initially perceived on the path of seeing, there is no other kind of realization, nothing “new” to be seen; nevertheless, when we consider the distinctions between these ten levels, we can analyze ten aspects of realization as the certain knowledge that derives from eradicating false assumptions in the aftermath of factors to be eliminated having been removed.
(1) Thus, on the first level, one realizes that the actual nature of phenomena is omnipresent since one understands that the basic space of phenomena permeates every object of one’s experience.
(2) On the second level, one realizes that this nature is the most sublime quality of all phenomena since one perceives that its nature is one of utter lucidity.
(3) On the third level, one realizes that the teachings that are given are completely in accord with one’s realization.
(4) On the fourth level, one realizes that there is, in no way whatsoever, any tendency to invest experience with some “I” that has personal identity.
(5) On the fifth level, one realizes the fact that, within completely pure basic space, one’s own mental continuum and those of others are not separate.
(6) On the sixth level, one realizes the fact that there are no longer any deeply ingrained afflictive states (since such distortions are adventitious) and that complete purity is nothing new (since things are pure by their very nature).
(7) On the seventh level, one realizes that the sūtras and other classes of spiritual teachings cannot be characterized such that they are separate from one another.
(8) On the eighth level, one realizes that afflictive states are diminishing (since one has gained a patient acceptance of the unborn aspect of phenomena), [4.124.a] that complete enlightenment does not evolve; in addition, one gains mastery of completely nonconceptual awareness (since the afflictive aspect of one’s consciousness[286] has been transmuted) and realizes the fact that one has mastery of pure realms of experience (since one’s sense consciousnesses have been transmuted).
(9) On the ninth level, one realizes the fact that one has mastery of authentic discerning timeless awareness (since consciousness as the coordinating mental faculty has been transmuted).
(10) On the tenth level, one realizes the fact that one has mastery of enlightened activities, ensuring benefit for beings through one’s emanations, just as is described in the teachings. These states of realization are spoken of in the Ornament of the Sūtras and Distinguishing Center and Limit.
In the foregoing cases, the factors to be eliminated are ten kinds of cognitive obscurations that do not involve afflictive states; thus, purely from the standpoint that one gains realization of these ten levels on the basis of the antidotes that eliminate those factors, some ten aspects of timeless awareness are assigned. Furthermore, these ten distinct aspects of realization pertain to postmeditation; there are no such distinctions with respect to what one simply realizes in the context of meditative equipoise. And so, in the meditative equipoise associated with the first bodhisattva level, nonconceptual timeless awareness entails realization of the significance of all the aforementioned ten aspects (the all-pervasive quality of the actual nature of phenomena, and so forth) in toto; a similar situation applies to the other levels, from the second to the tenth. Nevertheless, the certainty one has in postmeditation is experienced in distinct ways. Thus, on the first level one experiences a certainty born from the realization of the significance of the actual nature of phenomena being all-pervasive; on the second level, one experiences a certainty born from the realization of the significance that this nature is most sublime; and so on. In these ways, these ten kinds of certain knowledge eliminate the cognitive obscurations.

On the first bodhisattva level, one attains twelve hundredfold qualities, [4.124.b] which come into being each and every moment. These are mentioned in the “Chapter of the Bodhisattva Hayagrīva” from the sūtra the Ten Spiritual Levels [287] and can be summarized in the following verses:
One gains (1) one hundred states of meditative absorption, and (2) engages in these,
(3) beholds one hundred buddhas, (4) knows that one has received their blessings,
(5) causes one hundred worlds to quake, (6) journeys to one hundred realms,
(7) illuminates these one hundred realms, (8) brings one hundred beings to spiritual maturity,
(9) experiences one hundred eons,
(10) is aware of one hundred previous and future lifetimes, (11) opens up one hundred avenues of spiritual teachings, and
(12) manifests in one hundred forms, each of which is completely surrounded by a retinue of one hundred bodhisattvas.
In like fashion, on the second level, one gains such qualities a thousandfold; on the third, one hundred thousandfold; on the fourth, one billionfold; on the fifth, ten billionfold; on the sixth, one trillionfold; on the seventh, one hundred quintillionfold; on the eighth, to a degree equal to the number of atoms in one hundred thousand three-thousandfold universes; on the ninth, to a degree equal to the number of atoms in one million times ten to the sixtieth power three-thousandfold universes; and on the tenth, to a degree equal to, and even greater than, the number of atoms in an incalculably large number of a yet more incalculably large number of buddha realms.
It is also said that on the eighth level one acquires ten kinds of control. These ten are stated in the sūtra the Complete Consolidation of Spiritual Teachings:
You might ask, “What are the ten kind of control for bodhisattvas?” They are control over longevity, mind, material objects, activity, rebirth, miraculous powers, devoted intent, aspiration, timeless awareness, and phenomena. Such are the ten kinds of control.[288]
Of these:
(1) the first control allows one to live at will for as many eons as one wishes;
(2) the second gives one the capability of resting in equipoise, each and every moment, in countless states of meditative absorption;
(3) the third gives one the capability, simply upon thinking of it, [4.125.a] of filling the universe with various kinds of food and material wealth;
(4) the fourth allows one to engage as one wishes in all aspects of the arts and other activities;
(5) the fifth allows one to take rebirth at will among gods or human beings;
(6) the sixth allows one to transform the entire earth into various kinds of jewels, for example (that is, to transform things into whatever one wishes, so that ordinary beings can actually see and use them);
(7) the seventh allows one to fulfill one’s wishes, such as the intention that the entire universe be filled with buddhas;
(8) the eighth gives one the capability of emanating whatever one wishes, such as containing countless realms within the space on the tip of a single hair;
(9) the ninth grants one awareness of whatever object of knowledge one wishes to understand; and
(10) the tenth grants one wisdom in knowing all the classifications of phenomena with their specific names.
Generally speaking, the acquisition of these ten kinds of control takes place on the first seven impure bodhisattva levels, but the fuller expression of these ten takes place on the last three pure levels, while the completely pure degree of these is found on the level of buddhahood. So the statement that these ten kinds of control are first acquired on the eighth level is in accord with the statements found in the sūtras. The statement in the concise summary of the Wheel of Time entitled the Sublimely Unchanging State [289] to the effect that these powers are acquired on the tenth level is made with the following intention: Once one has attained that tenth level and only a single rebirth remains to one,[290] the capacity of these ten kinds of control reaches a consummate degree and one truly acquires them in the most complete sense.
In addition, on the tenth level one receives a special empowerment. The Ornament of the Sūtras states:
All buddhas confer the empowerment of supreme radiance;
this endows one completely with all the controls over phenomena.
One understands the ways in which buddhas manifest the maṇḍalas of their retinues.
Having set the training in motion, one strives at annihilation and nurturing.[291]
In addition, the sūtras each speak of countless positive qualities in their respective presentations, [4.125.b] so that it is impossible to quantify these qualities in any definitive and exhaustive way.
As to how one who dwells on these levels takes rebirth, generally speaking bodhisattvas take rebirth in one of two ways: (1) through power or (2) through natural consequences.
(1) Rebirth through power is in one of four ways: (a) rebirth through karma, (b) rebirth through aspiration, (c) rebirth through meditative absorption, or (d) rebirth through mastery.
(a) The first alternative applies to bodhisattvas abiding on the level of engagement through firm conviction.
(b) The second alternative applies to those bodhisattvas dwelling on one of the ten levels who take rebirth as animals and other forms of life for the sake of others.
(c) The third alternative applies to those bodhisattvas dwelling in the realm of form who take rebirth in the realm of desire without straying from meditative absorption.
(d) The fourth alternative applies to those bodhisattvas who take rebirth for the sake of others through the avenue of emanations.
(2) As for rebirth through natural consequences, it is explained that bodhisattvas dwelling on the first level take rebirth, for the most part, as world rulers with dominion over the entire earth. In a similar way, those on the second level take rebirth as rulers with dominion over all four continents. Those on the third level take rebirth as Indra, with power over the realm of the Thirty-three Gods.[292] Those on the fourth level take rebirth as rulers over the Gods Free of Conflict.[293] Those on the fifth level take rebirth as rulers over the Joyous Realm.[294] Those on the sixth level take rebirth as rulers over the Gods Who Enjoy Emanations.[295] Those on the seventh level take rebirth as rulers over the Gods Who Enjoy the Emanations of Others.[296] Those on the eighth level take rebirth as Brahmā, ruler over a thousandfold universe. Those on the ninth level take rebirth as rulers over two-thousandfold universes. And bodhisattvas dwelling on the tenth level take rebirth as forms of the powerful lord Maheśvara, as rulers over the “immaculate abodes.”[297]

<d e="2">
Concerning these ten levels in general, [4.126.a] there is no distinction with respect to meditative equipoise, which is that of nonreferential compassion[298] and the realization that all phenomena are by nature emptiness. In postmeditation, however, there are ten distinct aspects of experience concerning the basic space of phenomena[299] and the ten transcendent perfections[300] in which one trains thoroughly. It is on the basis of these distinctions that we can analyze ten levels and arrive at this definitive enumeration.
In the context of this analysis of spiritual paths and levels, there is another point to be considered. “Under what circumstances,” one might ask, “do the paths and levels begin, whether these pertain to the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, or bodhisattvas?” Clear discussions of this point are not found in most of the sūtras or tantras, but the Manifest Enlightenment of Vairocana states:
On the level of practice with dedicated intent,
with thorough cultivation of the three stages of the mind in meditation,
the six transcendent perfections,
and the four means of gathering students,[301]
make this level of dedicated intent without parallel.[302]
This passage explains that on the level of practice with dedicated intent, there are three stages of mind: as it enters into, abides in, and moves out of meditation. Of these, when the mind moves out of meditation, out of great compassion one engages in the six transcendent perfections and the four means of gathering students. Then, this source goes on to say, one passes from that level of dedicated intent and enters the paths of the Mahāyāna approach. This interpretation should be taken to be the definitive statement on the matter.

In the tradition of the secret mantra approach, or Vajrayāna, there are two presentations: the paths and levels pertaining primarily to the stage of development and the paths and levels pertaining primarily to the stage of completion. Without recourse to the latter presentation, [4.126.b] the former cannot set forth the paths and levels in their entirety, but if we explain the latter interpretation, the former is included as a matter of course, so we will proceed in this way.
In the Vajrayāna, the stages of the path that are connected with the common factors that contribute to enlightenment (to give one example, the applications of mindfulness that constitute the initial degree of the path of accumulation) are parallel to those found in the sūtra tradition. As for the factors that are unique to the Vajrayāna tradition, it is that everything is to be “embellished by supreme bliss.”
Let us examine this principle by giving one example: In the initial degree of the path of accumulation, the four methods found in the approach of the Pāramitāyāna[304] are the applications of mindfulness concerning the body, sensations, mind, and phenomena. Here one meditates on these with a special emphasis. In the first case, one focuses one’s attention on mindfulness by using the framework of deity yoga,[305] which involves the insight: “The nature of the body is one of bliss, and the essence of both body and bliss is one of emptiness.” This applies to the rest of the applications as well. Thus, in the second application, one focuses either on the simple bliss of meditative absorption (“The nature of the sensations that are felt as painful in light of confusion is that of the illuminating aspect of mind, and in essence that is supremely blissful”), or on the methods that induce “melting bliss.”[306] In the third application, one understands, “Although all the avenues of consciousness associated with the senses are alike in that they are emptiness in essence, their nature is one of nonconceptual timeless awareness, which is the cause of supreme bliss.” And in the fourth application, one understands, “All manifestations on the physical level of the body and all states of ordinary mind are, in their essence, emptiness, but for those who fail to recognize these as such, they acts as causal factors that perpetuate confusion. Nevertheless, their nature remains that of supreme bliss.” In all of these cases one integrates one’s awareness with the unity of bliss and emptiness.[307]
In this context, gurus of the past who were learned in the Cakrasaṃvara cycles[308] spoke of sixteen gradations of the bliss that is integrated with emptiness, by referring to what they called the explanation according to pith instructions: (1) four gradations of joy associated with the stage of development, (2) four gradations associated with the stage of completion, (3) four gradations associated with the path, [4.127.a] and (4) four gradations associated with the fruition state—sixteen gradations that are “unrivalled.”[309]
(1) The first group of four consists of the following:
(a) the “joy” of meditating on the masculine and feminine deities in union;
(b) the “sublime joy” of engaging in union oneself, with either an actual consort or a visualized one;[310]
(c) once that joy has reduced the ordinary thinking process to a subtle level, the “joy beyond joy” of using visualization to cause thoughts to proliferate and resolve; and
(d) the “innate joy” of integrating one’s awareness of emptiness.
(2) The second group is associated with the well-known system of the four cakras,[311] explained according to the following major and excellent interpretation:
(e) the “joy” of an externalized experience that is characterized as blissful;
(f) the “sublime joy” of an internalized experience of bliss;
(g) the “joy beyond joy” of the mind focusing on the bliss; and
(h) the “innate joy” that can be characterized as the integration of one’s awareness of emptiness.
Thus, in the context of the applications of mindfulness that constitute the initial degree of the path of accumulation, the foregoing are the eight aspects of bliss that are actually cultivated in meditation; the remaining eight aspects[312] are still objects of one’s intention.[313]
Let us discuss the significance of the accomplishment of these aspects in a way that is easy to understand. The four applications of mindfulness according to the sūtra tradition are as follows: their four objects (the body, and so forth)[314] are experienced as being impure and so forth on the relative level, while one meditates that on the ultimate level they cannot be found to exist in any way whatsoever. Thus, the process is, in essence, subsumed within meditation on the essential lack of the two kinds of identity.[315]
The four applications of mindfulness according to the unsurpassable path[316] within the secret mantra tradition are as follows: In meditating on one’s body as the form of a deity, one integrates one’s awareness of the unity of bliss and emptiness, and in addition integrates this same awareness of bliss and emptiness concerning all sensations, aspects of ordinary consciousness, and mental events and objects of perception.[317]
In the intermediate degree of the path of accumulation, the focus is on the four aspects of correct renunciation; in the final degree, the four bases of supernormal powers.
On the path of linkage, during the two phases of meditative warmth and the peak experience, the focus is on the five governing powers; during the two phases of patient acceptance and the highest mundane experience, the focus is on the five strengths. In all of these cases, the methods of meditation are for the most part parallel to the more common approach,[318] with the same distinctive feature in each case, that is, the object of emptiness expressing itself as supreme bliss.
(3) The governing powers and strengths of meditative absorption [4.127.b] both constitute supremely blissful timeless awareness, while those of sublime intelligence constitute timeless awareness of emptiness while focusing within that framework. The focus for both these aspects of awareness is one’s mindful recollection of the form of the deity, which is an expression of the nonduality of manifest appearance and emptiness. The bliss in this context constitutes the four aspects of joy associated with the path. These are as follows:
(i) “joy” is the bliss that comes from the subsiding of more obvious states of perception that reify sense objects as something external;
(j) “sublime joy” is the bliss that comes from the subsiding of more obvious states of fixation on internal experiences;
(k) “exceptional joy”[319] is the bliss that comes from the subsiding of more obvious states of reifying ordinary mind and mental states; this is the blissful meditative absorption associated with the five governing powers (the realizations entailed by these first three gradations of joy develops in stages); and
(l) the innate aspect of supreme bliss comes from the subsiding of the eighty overt patterns of thought,[320] due to the simultaneous subsiding of all the more obvious states of dualistic perception; this is inwardly directed meditative absorption associated with the five powers.
On the path of seeing, all seven aids to enlightenment are, in essence, this unity of bliss and emptiness. In particular, thorough pliancy[321] leads to all the force of the subtle channels, subtle energies, and bindu being drawn into the central channel, bringing about the bliss that comes from transmuting the refined essence of the subtle channels and elements that are subsumed within the cakras of the subtle body.
(4) Meditative absorption constitutes the four aspects of joy associated with the fruition state; this is the blissful meditative absorption that comes from the removal of the possibility for any of the eighty overt patterns of thought. Sublime intelligence constitutes timeless awareness as the ground of emptiness; since it is free of all conceptual elaboration, it is identical in essence with the bliss. It is experienced in both the presence and absence of any given manifestation in one’s perception.
On the path of meditation, of the branches of the eightfold path of noble ones, the authentic view[322] is that of emptiness that entails all possibilities.[323] Meditative absorption[324] is the enlightened embodiment of the deity, which expresses the unity of bliss and emptiness revealed by the transmutation of the subtle channels and elements in the remaining places of the body.[325] Three branches (effort,[326] livelihood,[327] and ethical choices[328]) primarily entail, in their essence, [4.128.a] the three aspects of conduct.[329] Mindfulness[330] constitutes mindfulness that has the function of causing the three successive steps of subtle experience[331] to resolve in basic space. Thought[332] and speech[333] play similar roles to the foregoing.
The foregoing explanations are according to the intent of the learned and accomplished masters of the holy country of India, as interpreted by the most important masters who upheld the Cakrasaṃvara tradition, such as Purang Lochung[334] and Malgyo.[335] So even though the Well-Sealed Locket does not treat these as anything other than simply principles from the ordinary teachings,[336] do not entertain any qualms that I might have fabricated them myself.
The truly extraordinary interpretation of the thirty-seven factors that contribute to enlightenment is that of the timeless awareness that comes from some thirty-seven aspects of the subtle channels, subtle energies, and bindu being purified within the central channel. This becomes fully evident in the context of the fruition state.

In particular, one invokes timeless awareness by meditating on the stages of development and completion.
In the initial degree of the path of accumulation, meditative equipoise consists of these two stages,
while in postmeditation benefit is ensured by applying the methods of the tantras. [338]
In the intermediate degree, meditation does not falter, even in dreams,

Using the four applications of mindfulness, one meditates energetically on the two stages of development and completion, gaining some small measure of clarity in visualizing a rough image of the maṇḍala. Once there awakens in one the realization that comes from invoking timeless awareness (something that other spiritual approaches are incapable of rivaling),[339] one has gained the initial degree of the path of accumulation. One then practices the two stages in meditative equipoise, while in postmeditation one benefits other beings by applying the methods of the tantras.
Due to one’s cultivating the four aspects of correct renunciation, one can maintain meditation on the two stages (even in postmeditation activities, deep sleep, and dreams), so that it becomes an ongoing flow, while the clarity of one’s visualization increases to include finer details; [4.128.b] one has gained the intermediate degree of the path of accumulation.
Then, relying on the four bases of supernormal powers, one practices energetically and one-pointedly on the form of the deity and the meditative absorption of bliss and emptiness. The clarity of one’s visualization increases to an even greater degree, so that one is able to see the face of the deity, can effect various activities associated with the practice without impediment, and becomes capable of gaining the main kinds of more common states of spiritual attainment. When the realization that brings one mastery of timeless awareness thus awakens in one, one has gained the final degree of the path of accumulation.
Then, by one’s exerting oneself solely in the practice of the two stages, the five levels of deeper discernment gradually arise, deriving from one’s experience of the unity of bliss and emptiness. If one then pursues the more common spiritual attainments as short-term goals, one gains a degree of “warmth”[340] in this regard and can engage in the appropriate conduct. One can attain the state of a master of awareness through material means[341] (with these five levels of deeper discernment and the eight spiritual attainments, for example) or that of a master of awareness in a physical body[342] (such as a master of awareness in the realm of desire[343] or a master of awareness in the realm of form). But this kind of conduct, based as it is on the intention to gain more common states of spiritual attainment, acts as an impediment to the more sublime spiritual attainment,[344] and one can not gain that sublime attainment within the span of an ordinary human lifetime. However, because one gains mastery of longevity, one can gradually awaken to buddhahood in that same physical form.[345]

Having already attained the four bases of supernormal powers, those who wish for sublime spiritual attainment to come swiftly will, for the time being, not engage in conduct for the sake of the more common spiritual attainments. They may meditate on some appropriate method of the stage of development, but regardless of whether they do or not they strive at practicing the stage of completion. Due to the circumstances of subtle energy and mind dissolving into the avadhūti channel,[346] one experiences states of realization, variously described as three degrees (lesser, intermediate, and greater) of timeless awareness whose nature is that of the unity of bliss and emptiness, or the three successive steps of subtle experience, or the first aspects of joy associated with the path. When such realization awakens in one, [4.129.a] this is considered to be the awakening of realization associated with the three degrees (lesser, intermediate, and greater) of meditative warmth on the path of linkage.
At this point, there is no certainty that one must rely on the practice of karmamudrā.[347] The final limit of the greatest degree of meditative warmth on the path of linkage is that of the greatest degree of “complete attainment,” also known as the utter lucidity of the consummate isolation of mind[348] (which is an aspect of the gradation of exceptional joy), or the consummate step that foreshadows the actual state of utter lucidity. Once one has achieved that (that is, once the experiences associated with the progressive dissolution of the elements[349] occur just as they would in the state of utter lucidity at the time of death), one “engages in conduct,”[350] or failing that at least one should rely on a mudrā consort. But the realization associated with the lesser degree of meditative warmth is that of the stage of completion, and until this at least has awakened, it is inappropriate for one to engage in the conduct associated with the stage of completion because this would delay the achievement of an enlightened embodiment of timeless awareness to some extent.[351]

Once one has gained the greater degree of meditative warmth, one energetically practices the yoga of karmamudrā, gaining the greatest degree of “complete attainment,” that is, the consummate experience that foreshadows the actual state of utter lucidity. Immediately upon one arising from meditation within the constant presence of that state, an enlightened embodiment is achieved that is simply the unity of one’s subtle energy and mind. Having achieved this, one has entered the peak experience on the path of linkage.
Then, due to the yoga of karmamudrā, one’s impure physical body is transformed into a more subtle and refined state. Once this has merged in one’s experience with the enlightened embodiment that is simply the unity of subtle energy and mind, this is termed “the vajra embodiment of the rainbow body,” or “master of awareness.” This is not considered to be a body within any of the three realms.[352] However, since one lacks direct experience of the actual nature of phenomena, one is not yet considered a master of awareness who has transcended the ordinary world. And even though the enlightened embodiment that is simply the unity of subtle energy and mind may have been achieved, if the gross physical body has not yet been transformed, it is not considered the enlightened embodiment of a master of awareness. [4.129.b] But once what is termed “the enlightened embodiment of nondual timeless awareness” has been achieved, it is impossible for the gross physical body not to be transformed; and so the enlightened embodiment of primordial unity constitutes that of a master of awareness who has transcended the ordinary world.
In any case, with the achievement of the enlightened embodiment that is simply the unity of subtle energy and mind, until the eighty overt patterns of thought are eliminated this constitutes the peak experience on the path of linkage, and the clear image of the maṇḍala manifests uninterruptedly in one’s perception.

In this regard, there are four sites: Pullira-malaya at the forehead, Jālandhara at the crown of the head, Oḍḍiyāna in the right ear, and Arbuda at the nape of the neck.

The same process of arrest described previously applies in the following cases. The four secondary sacred sites are: Godāvarī in the left ear, Rameśvara at the mid-brow point, Devīkoṭa in both eyes, and Māllava on the shoulders. These allow one to traverse to the second level. [4.130.a] Kāmarūpa in the armpits and Oṭe on the two breasts are associated with the third level; Triśakune at the navel and Kosala in the nose, with the fourth level; Kaliṅga in the mouth and Lampāka in the middle of the throat, with the fifth level; Kāñci in the heart and Himala in the secret channel, with the sixth level; Pretapuri in the genitals and Gṛhadeva in the anus, with the seventh level; Saurāṣṭra in the thighs and Suvarṇadvīpa in both calves, with the eighth level; Nagara in the nails and Sindhu in the ankles, with the ninth level; and Maru in both large toes and Kuluha in the knees, with the tenth level. These pairs are referred to, respectively, by the names Domain, Inner Domain, Intent, Inner Intent, Gathering, Inner Gathering, Charnel Ground, and Inner Charnel Ground. As was just explained, in these sacred sites of the body (paired together), the subtle channels, subtle energies, and bindu are purified within the central channel, so that the realization associated with the respective level awakens, and one traverses these ten levels in succession. Following these levels, the sites Quenching of Thirst and Inner Quenching of Thirst are assigned to the attainment of the enlightened embodiment of nondual timeless awareness on the path of seeing.

When one is engaging in the conduct of the peak experience, in both meditative equipoise and postmeditation, one primarily cultivates the unity of bliss and emptiness that constitutes the path of the mudrā consort, and later on enjoys oneself through the conduct of the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual.[354] Principally, one cultivates the five governing powers in meditation, so that the eighty overt patterns of thought subside and one gains patient acceptance on the path of linkage. Then, once manifest timeless awareness[355] (the direct cause[356] of the experience of the ultimate state of utter lucidity) has awakened, one gains the highest mundane experience. During these two phases, one principally cultivates the five powers.

The highest mundane experience entails three steps: those of the three successive steps of manifestation, increase, and attainment. The third step is termed “innate awareness in the context of the path”; it is the consummate degree to which innate awareness can be experienced within the sphere of this ordinary world. Generally speaking, one has attained innate awareness on the path, in the sense that the eighty overt patterns of thought have dissolved. From this third step onward, when the path of seeing then dawns with the uninterrupted perception of the ultimate state of utter lucidity, one has received the empowerment into nirmāṇakāya and eliminated the potential for the eighty overt patterns of thought.
On this path one cultivates the seven aids to enlightenment, and immediately upon one’s arising from that third step, the enlightened embodiment of nondual timeless awareness is achieved.

What transpires once the enlightened embodiment of timeless awareness has been achieved constitutes the path of meditation, and the levels of this constitute, in essence, timeless awareness endowed with seven attributes of integration,[357] as the foundation for superior qualities. It is impossible for one to become separated from timeless awareness as the unity of bliss and emptiness, and the enlightened embodiment of timeless awareness is an uninterrupted continuum, so that the embodiment and timeless awareness are considered to constitute a primordial unity. On the ten bodhisattva levels, one cultivates the eightfold path of noble ones, engages in conduct in one’s direct experience, and brings incalculable benefit to beings through one’s emanations, thus perfecting the realization of each respective level very swiftly. Eventually, one fully experiences the state of the great Vajradhara.
The factors to be eliminated on the path of meditation can be analyzed into nine degrees, lesser and greater, of the three successive steps of subtle experience; thus, one eliminates these factors through the remaining nine levels.[358] All aspects of ordinary mind and all mental events are transformed. The nature of all ordinary mental events is identified as being that of the three successive steps of subtle experience, and other than the specific means of elimination, the remaining aspects of the transformation process are similar to those of the common approach.[359]
Although the more obvious aspects of the mind-body aggregates, sense fields, and components of perception [4.131.a] have already been transformed, here even the most subtle aspect of these is transformed. The qualities of these bodhisattva levels should be understood to correspond to those described in the part on the common approach.
In this regard, the twelve levels described in the section on meditative absorption from the tantra the Wheel of Time and the twelve described in the Path and Fruition cycle should be understood to be the same twelve levels described above in the context of the path of linkage.[360]

At the final limit of this continuum, the path of meditation, one is empowered by the sambhogakāya, which brings one to the consummate path of no more training. In the circumstances of ordinary individuals, there are many who fully experience the consummation that foreshadows the actual state of utter lucidity through the agency of an empowerment they receive. But the particular case in question depends on the path of seeing as a factor contributing to manifest enlightenment and the definitive empowerment that takes place when one awakens to buddhahood.
In this regard, empowerment is conferred by the sambhogakāya buddha Vajradhara and the rest of the buddhas throughout the limitless range of the ten directions. With the conferral of such an empowerment, the vajralike samādhi (the final limit of the continuum of sublime intelligence and timeless awareness that lies at the very threshold of enlightenment) eliminates even the most subtle habitual patterns of change.[362] With the transformation of the basis of all ordinary experience, in the next moment one awakens to actual buddhahood. It is at this point that the aspects of manifest enlightenment and the excellent array of offerings associated with these occur, together with other auspicious signs.
“Well,” one might object, “isn’t the explanation of the factors contributing to manifest enlightenment given in the tantras concerned with the path of seeing?” While it is indeed the case that the explanations of the signs of attainment experienced by a practitioner relying on a consort constitute just such an explicit description, what occurs at this present point we are discussing is far more vast—infinite, even—in scope that the former.

The most majestic of all texts in the tantra class is that of the glorious tantra The Wheel of Time. According to the extraordinary tradition that is unique to this cycle, the pathway of the central channel is purified to some degree through one’s practice of the stage of development (focusing on the deity with retinue) and the branch of “consolidation.”[363] One gains mastery of the abiding quality of mind, so that thoughts do not cause interruptions and the ten indications of utter lucidity are experienced for the first time.[364] If one pursues this process with stability in practicing the stage of development, one gains the final degree of the path of accumulation according to the tantric interpretation.

Through the branch of meditative stability, the pathway of the central channel becomes thoroughly pliant, so that one understands one’s own mind, the empty forms of the deities, and all perceptions that manifest due to one’s karma to be inseparable in their nature, which is free of conceptual elaboration. The aforementioned ten indications become stable in one’s experience, taking on even more significance than before. Once individuals who have gained stability in the stage of development have brought this branch to a consummate level, they have gained the first degree of meditative warmth on the path of linkage, whereas those who still have not gained stability in the stage of development, if they meditate and bring this to consummation, have simply come to the initial degree of the path of accumulation in the tantric context.
Next, due to the branch of harnessing and channeling subtle energy, the ten subtle energies dissolve in the central channel, which arrests the overt thought patterns based on dualistic perceptions of object and subject as separate from one another. One gains miraculous powers, levels of deeper discernment, and so forth, which give one some degree of mastery of the outer and inner elements,[366] [4.132.a] so that one then has some slight degree of spiritual power. The warmth of caṇḍalī [367] blazes to some small extent, so that one clearly experiences the unity of bliss and emptiness. Whether one has previously gained stability in practicing the stage of development or not, through this branch one will gain it by the time one comes to the intermediate, or even the lesser degree of meditative warmth.
Through the branch of attention, all the limitless aspects of subtle energy dissolve into those of bindu within the central channel, so that the warmth of caṇḍalī blazes uninterruptedly, in and of itself. One’s spiritual power and qualities are magnified anywhere from ten to one hundred times more than before. Once the timeless awareness associated with the greater degree of meditative warmth has awakened in one, this provides the link to the peak experience.
The branch of recollection ensures that the enlightened embodiment of nondual timeless awareness is achieved to a small degree. The warmth of caṇḍalī blazes with extra force, ushering in the fours aspects of joy associated with the undiminishing process of melting bliss.[368] The more obvious expressions of afflictive states are eliminated. This brings one to the consummate degree of the peak experience.
The branch of meditative absorption brings patient acceptance and the highest mundane experience. The subtle energies of karma are arrested, bindu is stabilized: in these and other ways, this is the process that ensures the actual elimination of the three avenues of body, speech, and mind that constitute the state of saṃsāra.

In this branch of meditative absorption, the first level is ensured by the first half of the cakra in the secret center filling with the nectar of unchanging bodhicitta; the second level, by the filling of the remaining half; and so on, with the same process applying to the other five cakras,[369] so that the twelfth level is ensured by the filling of the remaining half of the cakra at the crown of the head, so that the entire crown of the head is stabilized. The next step involves what is termed “the achievement of the enlightened embodiment of nondual timeless awareness.” [4.132.b] Of the two kinds of levels (conceptually designated and actual, or lower and higher), one has gained the twelve lower, or conceptually desig-nated, levels.[370]
In this context, the twelve links of interdependent origination,[371] together with their attendant subtle energies, are arrested, beginning with aging and death (on the first level) up to ignorance. With each group of three links, one of the situations of ordinary body, speech, mind, and thought patterns based on attachment is eliminated. This ensures the accomplishment of the four vajras in the context of the path.
Let me explain this in more detail. Aging and death are arrested on the first level of meditative absorption, birth on the second level, and becoming[372] on the third level; this eliminates the experience of the ordinary body and ensures the form vajra[373] in the context of the spiritual path. Perpetuation[374] is arrested on the fourth level, compulsion[375] on the fifth level, and sensation[376] on the sixth level; this eliminates the experience of ordinary speech and ensures the speech vajra[377] in the context of the spiritual path. Contact[378] is arrested on the seventh level, the sense fields[379] on the eighth, and the formation of the mind-body complex[380] on the ninth; this eliminates the experience of ordinary mind and ensures the mind vajra[381] in the context of the spiritual path. Ordinary consciousness[382] is arrested on the tenth level, formative patterning[383] on the eleventh, and ignorance on the twelfth; this eliminates the fourth situation of ordinary experience, that of thought patterns based on attachment, and ensures the timeless awareness vajra[384] in the context of the spiritual path.
Thus, on these levels there occurs what those who proceed developmentally[385] term “the accomplishment of the four vajras,” but this actually refers to the fact that the causes for these accomplishments are being gathered together in their entirety. As for the elimination of the experiences of ordinary body, speech, and mind and of thought patterns based on attachment, and the arresting of the twelve links, it is acceptable to use the term “arrest” to designate a process involving, for example, the dissolving of the causes and subtle energies associated with these links. However, since the final step of the branch of meditative absorption constitutes the path of seeing, it is at that point that these links are actually arrested all at once, for the potentials for these have been eliminated. Although it is indeed the case that, simultaneous with these events, the four vajras are attained, the particular ways in which these events express their functions occur immediately upon one’s moving beyond the step of the path of seeing,[386] [4.133.a] and so it is at that point that the conventional designation of “attaining” can be used.
Therefore, the first eleven levels of the branch of meditative absorption constitute patient acceptance on the path of linkage, while the first 1,799 “moments” of the twelfth level constitute the highest mundane experience on the path of linkage.

In the final moment of the 1,800 moments that make up the highest mundane experience on the path of linkage, the path of seeing of a spiritually advanced being awakens in one’s experience. The experiences of body, speech, and mind that pertain to saṃsāra, and the thought patterns based on attachment, have already been eliminated. In the step following this, the enlightened embodiment of nondual timeless awareness (that is, the form, speech, mind, and timeless awareness vajras, which by nature constitute a state of primordial unity) is fully experienced.
Thus, when the experiences of ordinary body, speech, and mind that pertain to saṃsāra are eliminated, all the other aspects of the mind-body aggregates are transformed. Under those circumstances, the expression “the accomplishment of the vajrakāya, the rainbow body” is used since the impure experience of ordinary body has been transformed; as well, the expression “the accomplishment of the enlightened embodiment of nondual timeless awareness” is used since what has been gained is the experience of the “equal taste” of the four vajras.[387]
Given that what is actually taking place here is the first bodhisattva level of The Utterly Joyful One, due to the path of the secret mantra approach being extremely direct, one finds other terms, such as “buddhahood itself,” “perfect buddhahood,” and even the name “Vajrasattva,” also being used to describe this level. There are various reasons for this: one is extremely close to perfect buddhahood itself; henceforth, there remains only the attainment of buddhahood through similar kinds of paths; this path accords in principle with perfect buddhahood itself; and this path constitutes the completion of the steps associated with unchanging bliss.

Once the vajrakāya has been accomplished, it serves as the foundation for superior qualities, and so there is also the attainment of twelve distinctive features of timeless awareness that are given the names of levels. An enumeration of these is given in the section on timeless awareness from the Sublimely Unchanging State:
…similarly, there are the following:
the level “Total Illumination, the Lovely and Supreme Orb of the Sun”;
the level “Light of Nectar, the Clear Light of the Supreme Moon”;
the level “Light of Space, Abiding Totally Like Space”;
the level “Vajra Light, Delighting the Mind”;
the level “Jewel Light, Abiding as the Actual Conferral of Empowerment”;
the level “Lotus Light, Completely Upholding the Flawless State Pure by Its Very Nature”;
the level “Enacting the Activity of Buddhahood”;
the level “Incomparable”;
the level “Ensuring Total Realization of the Metaphor of All Metaphors”;
the level “Unsurpassable Light of Sublime Intelligence”;
the level “Omniscience Itself, the Supreme State of Utter Lucidity”;
and the level “Merging with Genuine Awareness, the Epitome of Self-Knowing Discernment.”[388]
These levels are primarily discussed in “The Section on the Qualities of the Tathāgata.” However, because they are attained simultaneously at the conclusion of the twelfth level of meditative absorption,[389] these twelve levels are all complete, just like the individual bodhisattva levels of The Utterly Joyful One and the rest.
As well, all twelve pertain to perfect buddhahood. The qualities of buddha nature and the actual nature of phenomena, which are inseparable by nature, are timelessly and spontaneously perfect. So these twelve levels of Total Illumination and so forth (which constitute the process whereby the capacity to realize this or that aspect of these qualities is developed) [4.134.a] are subsumed within the process that eliminates obscurations. As well, in the context of the path of training followed by spiritually advanced beings, each of these levels has, in its entirety, a complete range of both meditative equipoise and postmeditation.[390] The twelve levels associated with buddhahood are attained in the sense that these primordial levels of being become fully evident; they are not subsumed within the path, nor are these cases of something new coming into being.
Concerning these levels, the tantra the Adornment of the Vajra Heart Essence states:
The supreme level of Total Illumination
is itself comparable to the orb of the sun…[391]
Concerning the significance of this passage, it is indeed true that some learned masters of Tibet interpreted it to refer solely to the levels associated with buddhahood, while others interpreted it to refer to the twelve levels of the path of spiritually advanced beings, while still others interpreted it to refer to the twelve levels associated with the Six Branches of Union from the Kālacakra cycle.[392] But in what appears to be a dissenting interpretation that contradicts each of the foregoing interpretations, the learned and accomplished masters of India and the great and venerable master of the Jonang tradition[393] explain this passage as follows:
The number twelve is arrived at by analyzing distinct aspects of the state of primordial unity (the timeless awareness that constitutes the path of spiritually advanced beings), while the term “level” is used due to this awareness’s serving as the foundation for superior qualities. In their respective order, these twelve aspects are:[394]
(1) the dispelling of the darkness of the ignorance imposed by cognitive obscurations;
(2) the reshaping of desire through undiminishing bliss;
(3) the perception of all phenomena as being like space;
(4) a stable altruistic motivation that takes delight in the welfare of others since it cannot be undermined by self-centered thoughts;
(5) timeless awareness that is empowered by one’s chosen deity;[395]
(6) the perception that mind is pure by its very nature;
(7) the enacting of enlightened activity by emanating buddhas and so forth through the power of aspiration;
(8) the perception of what is ineffable, that is, timeless awareness, which is beyond any comparison;
(9) the realization of the analogies and underlying reasons for all phenomena;
(10) the unfolding of unsurpassable intelligence concerning all knowable objects;
(11) the dispelling of habitual patterns associated with the darkness of cognitive obscurations; and
(12) the full experience of self-knowing and discerning timeless awareness. [4.134.b]

Immediately in the wake of one’s having attained the path of seeing, from that point onward one cultivates the six transcendent branches in meditation equally, following the path of meditation through the levels of “Abode” and the rest (that is, the level of The Utterly Joyful One and the other levels). And one is engaged in the spiritual deportment of pure awareness, conduct whose nature is inconceivable to the ordinary mind, thus bringing countless beings to spiritual maturity and freedom. While doing all of this, one traverses these twelve levels and the supreme higher, or actual, context they constitute.

As the result of bringing the foregoing paths and levels to consummation, perfect buddhahood is attained: the totality of the four kāyas;[396] an inexhaustible ocean of the qualities of enlightenment and the aspects of timeless awareness (including the twelve aspects of the meaning of truth and the sixteen aspects of suchness),[397] which are in essence a state of primordial unity; and the uninterrupted embodiment of enlightened activity that is equal in extent to space itself. Those with good fortune and diligence, if they apply themselves to this sublime and unerring path, can ensure that the state of Vajrasattva, or Kālacakra, is swiftly attained in this very lifetime.
Thus, the foregoing discussions of this especially exalted tradition, as expounded by the mahāsiddha Śāntipāda and other learned and accomplished masters of the holy country of India, have been set forth in the flawless presentations of the Great Venerable One, Tāranātha, who was Vajradhara in these troubled times.[398]

Once one has received an empowerment as the factor that matures one spiritually, one stabilizes one’s mind through the two stages of development and completion, as the factors that bring one freedom.[401] Through one’s practice, based on conviction,[402] which focuses on the primordial unity of the two levels of truth (the state of suchness), one experiences countless circumstances in one’s life as supports for one’s practice. With the awakening of meditative experiences that, though still corruptible, are nonetheless excellent, and through the process of integrating sense pleasures into one’s spiritual path, one traverses the level of a beginning practitioner, that is, the path of accumulation.

Attaining the experience that foreshadows the actual state of utter lucidity, and the experience of the hidden meaning of the illusory body,[403] one fully experiences a foreshadowing of the innate nature of being (that is, the inseparability of bliss and emptiness) through the process of subtle energy and mind entering the central channel, whereby the four descending gradations of joy are experienced.[404] As qualities associated with the subtle channels and energies unfold, one traverses the level of one who practices out of a sense of dedication, that is, the four phases of the path of linkage.

Through the process whereby the subtle vital essence is stabilized in an ascending manner,[405] this essence is blocked in the four subtle channels of the “banner of victory” (that is, the tip of the glans in the secret organ),[406] leading to the full experience of the actual state of utter lucidity. This corresponds to the first bodhisattva level, the path of directly seeing the truth that is the actual nature of phenomena.

As the subtle vital essence is gradually stabilized in an ascending manner, the four corresponding gradations of joy arise in the reverse order from before, reaching consummation.

When even the most subtle aspects of the subtle channels, energies, and bindu have been refined so that they are free of obscuration, one is purified of the ordinary experience of the body and abides on the thirteenth level. This is the actual accomplishment of the state of Vajradhara, that is, the enlightened embodiment of timeless awareness, the rainbow body of the consummate path of no more training. The mere fact that there are stages of development is due to the actions of beginners who have initially entered the path practicing, which is to say bringing this into their experience in accordance with the key points found in the pith instructions. As for the individuals concerned, they may be either of two types: those who progress in a developmental manner and those who progress in a nonlinear fashion.

Concerning the first topic, the Unsurpassable Definitive Expression states:
…The Utterly Joyful One, The Immaculate One,
The Illuminating One, The Radiant One,
The One Who Meets the Challenge, The One Who Makes Evident,
The One Who Has Gone Far, The Immutable One,
The One of Brilliant Intelligence, The Cloud of Dharma,
The Incomparable One, The One Endowed with Timeless Awareness, and
The Vajra Level (the thirteenth).[408]
In this source, other than the latter three levels, the others accord in name and meaning with those discussed in the teachings of the Pāramitāyāna. The Adornment of the Vajra Heart Essence speaks of twelve levels (Light of Nectar and so forth) as discussed previously.[409] The glorious tantra the Wheel of Time lists twelve levels, adding the level without obstacles and the level of complete freedom to the usual ten levels of spiritually advanced beings. The Vajra Garland [410] explains that there are fourteen levels, the Sphere of the Supreme Seal [411] fifteen, and so on. Although there are many such classifications of more or fewer levels, [4.136.a] these are not in contradiction to one another since they derive from more or less detailed analyses of specific points concerning the qualities found on the levels of ordinary individuals and the ten or eleven bodhisattva levels. In brief, then, as explained in the various classes of tantra, the levels are named in one of three ways: by applying a name relating to the fruition in a causal context, (such as “The Utterly Joyful One”); by demonstrating the very essence of that fruition through the use of a metaphor that accords with the state it describes (such as “Total Illumination”); or by applying a name from the standpoint of qualities that awaken (such as “Abode”). The former two cases have already been covered. As for the latter, The Well-Sealed Locket states:
Abode corresponds to The Utterly Joyful One.
Similarly, Inner Abode corresponds to The Immaculate One,
Domain to The Illuminating One,
and Inner Domain to The Radiant One.
Intent definitely corresponds to The One Who Meets the Challenge,
Inner Intent to The One Who Makes Evident,
Gathering to The One Who Has Gone Far,
Inner Gathering to The Immutable One,
Charnel Ground to The One of Brilliant Intelligence,
and Inner Charnel Ground to The Cloud of Dharma.
Concerning the levels of the ten transcendent perfections,
contemplate on an outer and inner level what they are referred to
as (“Pula” and the rest)
in the arcane language of yoginīs.[412]
This passage refers to the unique names in the unrefined language of yoginīs[413] that correspond to the more ordinary names for the levels.
(1) Regarding the first level, that of The Utterly Joyful One, the term “abode” used in the expression “Abode” means “support.” It is called “Abode” because it is the support for positive qualities. There are abundant qualities that ensure one’s own benefit, such as the states of meditative absorption and levels of deeper discernment associated with the first bodhisattva level, which involve so much utter joy because one finally sees the state of suchness directly, which has been unseen through successive lifetimes throughout the beginningless cycle of saṃsāra. There are also abundant qualities that ensure benefit for others, for one satisfies the minds of countless beings by relying on the transcendent perfection of generosity.
(2) The second level is called “Inner Abode.” The prefix in this case[414] does not carry its more usual sense of proximity, as in proximity of place or time. [4.136.b] Rather, it denotes “inner,” in the sense of the relationship between cause and effect, or the mutual connection between something being benefited and something benefiting it. On the outer level, Abode and Inner Abode are explained as follows: since the yoginīs dwelling there mutually benefit one another, this is termed “inner” and applied to the environment. On the inner level, the terms “Abode” and “Inner Abode” are used to indicate what would be more conventionally described as a cause ensuring benefit for a result, while that result is what is benefited by that cause. In a similar way, this principle applies to the terms “Domain” and “Inner Domain” and the rest. Therefore, this level is called “Inner Abode” because it constitutes the support for one to engage in the ten kinds of completely pure action by relying on the transcendent perfection of discipline and to gain mastery of states of meditative absorption and levels of deeper discernment.
(3) The third level is called “Domain.” Just as a field is a domain[415] where excellent crops can grow, due to the consummate degree to which the transcendent perfection of forbearance is developed, a supreme spiritual vision grows through an undiminishing state of meditative absorption.
(4) The fourth level is called “Inner Domain” since the transcendent perfection of diligence ensures that positive qualities develop to an even greater extent than before.
(5) The fifth level is called “Candhoha.” Candha means “aspiration” or “intent” (that is, the aspiration for the most excellent benefit for oneself and others). The suffix uha [416] denotes “I will fulfill this aspiration just as I expressed it” (that is, it denotes taking responsibility for it). Therefore, it is called “Candhoha” since one can bring beings to complete spiritual maturity by relying on the transcendent perfection of meditative stability, as well as by committing oneself to seeking out the teachings of the buddhas and perfecting one’s experience of these.
(6) The sixth level is called “Inner Intent,” for by relying on the full experience of the transcendent perfection of sublime intelligence, one can truly embody the aforementioned qualities to the highest degree.
(7) The seventh level is called “Gathering.” There is a gathering in the sense that this level brings about an amassing, or to put it in other terms, it ensures attainment. Therefore, it is a gathering in that, relying on the transcendent perfection of skillful means, [4.137.a] one ensures the gathering of such qualities as the aspects of meditative stability[417] and complete liberation[418] by making effort without ascribing any subtle traits[419] to these qualities.
(8) The eighth level is called “Inner Gathering,” for the transcendent perfection of aspiration ensures the effortless and spontaneous attainment of experiencing the complete purity of the animate and inanimate universe.
(9) The ninth level is called “Charnel Ground.” It is called “Charnel Ground” due to the fact that this signifies the lack of identity in things. By relying on the transcendent perfection of spiritual power one realizes for oneself that all phenomena lack identity and teaches this to others, thus ensuring the most complete benefit for oneself and others.
(10) The tenth level is called “Inner Charnel Ground,” for due to the transcendent perfection of timeless awareness, one ensures consummate benefit for oneself and others and perfects the ultimate faculties.[420]
At this point, the Well-Sealed Locket does not actually use the terms “Quenching of Thirst” and “Inner Quenching of Thirst” to apply to any levels, although its intention is to be implicitly understood as such. The Frond of Pith Instructions [421]explains Quenching of Thirst as referring to the level of one who practices out of a sense of dedication and Inner Quenching of Thirst to the level of buddhahood. But the commentary entitled the White Lily states:
Quenching of Thirst is Incomparable Timeless Awareness;
Inner Quenching of Thirst is Supreme Timeless Awareness.[422]
(11) In accord with this passage cited from the extensive tantra, the eleventh level is called “Quenching of Thirst.”[423] “Thirst” refers to afflictive states, while “quenching” connotes engaging in positive actions. Alternatively, this level quenches in the sense of eradicating the masses of afflictive states; or, it is Quenching of Thirst since it eradicates tendencies that perpetuate ignoble states of existence, due to the momentum of distinctive features from the tenth level.[424] And since it would be difficult for the preceding levels to serve even as comparable states to this, it is Incomparable.
(12) The twelfth level is called “Inner Quenching of Thirst”[425] since afflictive states are eliminated without exception, together with their underlying habitual patterns. And since such a level constitutes timeless awareness in the greatest sense, it is Supreme Timeless Awareness.
One might ask, “Why is the thirteenth level not mentioned?” It is not discussed because, while the previous levels are bodhisattva levels, the thirteenth is that of Vajradhara.[426] [4.137.b] For, as the Unsurpassable Definitive Expression states:
The Vajra Level is the thirteenth.[427]

One might ask, “How are these levels attained?” One attains the levels of the tathāgatas through the successive “moments” of supreme and unchanging bliss, which derive from the “passion” of sublime intelligence. Let me explain this in more detail: When the first moment of this sublimely unchanging state occurs, the masculine essence is focused in the tip of the glans, the feminine essence in the very crown of the head. Of 21,600 breaths,[428] one is arrested. At that point, one experiences the nonduality of self and other, and whatever one perceives merges in the single taste of supreme bliss.

In a similar succession, the first of the twelve aspects of the meaning of truth is completed in 1,800 steps associated with the sublimely unchanging state. With this, there is the arrest of the first of twelve “junctures” (involving an equal number of expressions of the subtle energy of karma) and the first of the twelve links of interdependent origination (that of ignorance). The masculine and feminine essences (focused respectively in the tip of the glans and in the very crown of the head) shift, with the masculine essence moving upward and the feminine essence downward. [4.138.a] The bindu of bodhicitta[430] fills the lower half of the secret cakra and is stabilized there. At that point one experiences the least gradation of joy, the first of the twelve degrees of joy (the four gradations with three degrees each) that are stabilized in an ascending manner. The cakra at the very crown of the head fills with the feminine essence, so that one directly realizes the least degree of emptiness, the first of the twelve degrees of “manifestation,” or emptiness (four gradations with three degrees each).[431] Of the twelve levels, one attains the first, called “Abode” and “The Utterly Joyful One.” The first of thirty-two blockages in the central channel is freed, and the center at the very crown of the head emerges to the first of twelve successive degrees.[432] At this point, since one benefits countless beings, one is “a foremost and supreme master of generosity,” which is to say, one thoroughly purifies and perfects the transcendent perfection of generosity.

Next, ten series of 1,800 moments of the unchanging state (which encompass the aspects of the meaning of truth from the second to the furthest limit of the eleventh) are completed in succession. An equal number of junctures and expressions of subtle energy are arrested,[435] as well as the links of interdependent origination. The white energy[436] moves upward in stages from the secret cakra, while the red energy[437] moves downward in stages from the very crown of the head, stabilizing the six cakras one half at a time. In each case, three blockages in the central channel are freed. One’s experience of joy and realization of emptiness increase, and one traverses the second and following levels, completing the transcendent perfections of discipline and so forth.
Finally, upon completion of the eleventh level, the final blockage in the central channel (the thirty-second) is freed. [4.138.b] The center at the very crown of the head emerges to the twelfth degree.
In this way, the twelfth aspect of the meaning of truth is completed in 1,800 moments of unchanging bliss, thus completing all 21,600 moments of supreme and unchanging bliss. An equal number of expressions of subtle energy, associated with the twelfth juncture, are arrested, so that all 21,600 expressions of the subtle energy of karma are arrested. The interdependent link of aging and death is arrested, so that the entire cycle of conditioned existence, constituting all twelve links, is arrested.

At that point, the moon of bodhicitta, located above the cakra at the very crown of the head, reaches fullness, all sixteen of its aspects fully complete; one experiences the supreme state of innate joy that comes from an ascending process of stabilization. The tip of the “vajra gem”[438] beneath the secret cakra is filled with feminine essence and thus stabilized, so that one directly realizes utter lucidity, that is to say, the supreme state of total emptiness. One attains the twelfth level, called “Inner Quenching of Thirst” or “[Supreme] Timeless Awareness.” Supreme compassion is completely perfected. In brief, the ten transcendent perfections are brought to consummation, and the entire processes of elimination and realization are thoroughly completed. This is perfect buddhahood itself, “the thirteenth level of the vajra holder” (which is the term used to describe the furthest limit beyond the twelfth level).[439]
The foregoing are the twelve levels that constitute the arrest of the twelve junctures of subtle life force energy (deriving from an analysis of the twelve solar mansions) and the twelve links of interdependent origination. This is the meaning of the following lines from the Web of Magical Display:
The root of conditioned existence (comprising the twelve links) has been dug up.
One takes possession of twelve aspects of purity….
…One embodies the twelve aspects of the meaning of truth.[440]

Through an analysis of the sixteen aspects of the moon,[441] [4.139.a] the sixteen descending gradations of mundane joy (the joyful gradation of joy, the sublimely joyful gradation of joy, and so forth) come to an end, while the sixteen gradations of transcendent joy stabilized upwardly are brought to completion. As well, the sixteen gradations of emptiness (the empty gradation of emptiness, the extremely empty gradation of emptiness, and so forth) are directly realized. And so it is said that there are sixteen corresponding levels. The Web of Magical Display states:
Endowed with the capacity for manifestation, yet nonmanifest—
one takes possession of the bindu of the two halves of the
sixteenth…
…one is aware of the sixteen aspects of suchness.[442]
Thus, the analysis of twelve levels derives from the arrest of the twelve junctures, while that of sixteen derives from the completion of the sixteen gradations of joy. Therefore, given that the arrest of the twelve junctures and the completion of the sixteen gradations of joy take place simultaneously, one should realize that these two analyses do not stand in contradiction to one another. Therefore, these sixteen levels are understood to be subsumed within the former analysis.

Conduct, or spiritual deportment,[444] allows for the spiritual path to be traversed swiftly. In the most general sense, according to the Lamp That Integrates Conduct, [445] our Teacher[446] taught conduct in three ways: conduct free of the passions to those to be guided who are on the lesser level; the conduct of the bodhisattva levels and the transcendent perfections to those who are inspired by a greater context;[447] and the conduct of desire and passion for those who are inspired by a profound approach.[448] It is the latter of these topics that I will discuss at this point.
In this regard, there are the following kinds of conduct: There is conduct that renders one a suitable candidate for cultivating meditation as a spiritual path (that is, conduct in the context of the empowerment that matures one spiritually). There is conduct that develops aspects of the spiritual path that have not previously been developed (that is, conduct from the initial stages of the path until the sublime attainment is realized). And there is conduct in order to enhance aspects of the path that have been developed (that is, conduct to encourage the flourishing of all the countless aspects of realization gained through the two stages of practice).

Of the three aforementioned interpretations of conduct, the latter (that is, conduct that involves passion) is spoken of at great length in the tantras of the Anuttara class. The glorious scripture The Gathering of Secrets [449] speaks of many cases of meditation and contemplation associated with these three kinds of conduct and gives a concise summary of conduct in the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual. The explanatory tantra of this cycle, the Adornment of the Vajra Heart Essence, speaks of the extremely unelaborate mode of conduct,[450] while the Equal Union with All Buddhas [451] deals extensively with the elaborate mode of conduct in the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual. [4.140.a] In the three source tantras of the Cakrasaṃvara cycle, including the text in twenty-seven chapters, as well as the first and the eighth; the latter two analyses in the fifth chapter of the Well-Sealed Locket; the Origin of Sublime Bliss in twenty-one chapters; the sixth section of the first chapter and the second section of the second chapter of the tantra the Vajra of Delight—in all four of these tantric cycles[452] there are extensive treatments. Furthermore, in the chapter on engaging in spiritual deportment from A Share of Mantra, the explanatory tantra of the Caturpīṭha cycle,[453] there is an extensive discussion that emphasizes the unelaborate mode.
In fact, the majority of tantras in the Anuttara class speak to at least some degree about conduct, but the foregoing will suffice as a summary of these.

In all the tantras, such as the Gathering of Secrets and the Equal Union, three modes of conduct are described: elaborate, unelaborate, and extremely unelaborate. This constitutes an analysis from the standpoint of what conduct is in essence.
In analyzing conduct from the standpoint of environment, the Origin of Sublime Bliss describes three modes: engaging in conduct in one’s own household; engaging in conduct in a charnel ground; and moving through sacred realms. Moreover, the glorious scripture The Accomplishment of Secrets [454] describes two modes, those of engaging in conduct in pure realms and in one’s household, in the following words:
By focusing in that way on the conduct that is one’s samaya,
accomplishment comes about even within one’s household.
But if the conduct that is one’s samaya deteriorates,
conduct will not ensure this, nor will being in the household.
In analyzing conduct from the standpoint of its modes, such source tantras as Sublime Bliss, the Vajra of Delight, and the Well-Sealed Locket describe these with three conventional designations: the “conduct of avadhūti” (which involves eliminating duality);[455] the “conduct of complete nobility”; and the “conduct of total victory.” The sixth chapter of the Accomplishment of Secrets discusses the mode of “secret conduct”; the seventh chapter, that of the “conduct of pure awareness”; and the eighth chapter, that of “conduct in the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual.” To these the ninth chapter adds the mode of the “mad yogic practitioner’s conduct.” [4.140.b] The first two of these correspond to subdivisions of the conduct of avadhūti, while the latter two correspond to the extremely unelaborate mode of conduct. The foregoing is an analysis of conduct from the standpoint of its various modes.
The terms “the all-engaging conduct of a protector” and “the conduct of total victory in all ways” refer to one and the same mode. Likewise, “the conduct of a youthful monarch,” “the conduct of a glorious regent,” and “the spiritual deportment with an all-noble consort of pure awareness” all refer to the same mode. While the expression “tantric conduct” certainly applies in a general way to all conduct from the more ordinary level upward,[456] in particular, it refers to the foregoing modes. As for the term “the spiritual deportment of pure awareness,” there are two contexts in which this can be used: one in referring to all modes of conduct and the other in referring solely to conduct in the sense of engaging fully in the world while shedding all its influences. One should also know that the term “secret conduct” can have two meanings: that of all modes of tantric conduct, and that solely of conduct that is carried out in secret and in which all mundane influences are shed.

In essence, this mode of conduct concerns beginning practitioners, who in the periods between practice sessions still rely on all manner of sense pleasures (such as sexual activity, food and drink, and clothing), as well as on such positive postmeditation activities as casting small stūpas in clay, performing prostrations, and making offerings. All of this is imbued with a recollection of the deity yoga the person is practicing. [4.141.a]
Since this kind of conduct is not imbued with the actual experience of completely nonconceptual timeless awareness, the mind has both the motivation of intent and the sense of involvement in the actual activity, and both of these factors share some accord with those of ordinary mundane people. Hence this is called “intent and involvement.”

Of the three modes mentioned (elaborate, and so forth) the elaborate mode is one of meditating with the concept that everything one perceives is masculine and feminine deities, and so relying on one’s experience of sense pleasures in whatever way is supportive of this outlook. This occurs in all situations when one is practicing the stage of development. Since this comes entirely from training in perceiving things as one’s deity and knowing things to be one’s deity, this mode is called “the single guideline of training,” or “the single point to be known.”
The unelaborate mode is not one of primarily examining things conceptually but rather of perceiving the objects of one’s senses as the enlightened embodiment of one’s deity and so relying on one’s experience of sense pleasures. Given that this is the context of the stage of completion (before concepts concerning one’s perceptions have a chance to arise), one proceeds with awareness and trains in perceiving the deity’s form, and in perceiving this in turn as simply a manifestation of mind, and so there are “two guidelines of training,” or “the two points to be known.”
The extremely unelaborate mode is one of perceiving the natural manifestation of the unity of bliss and emptiness as the deity’s form, so that by relying on one’s experience of the objects of one’s senses one can appreciate the way in which the deity and the bliss have no independent nature of their own. There are three factors (of deity, mind, and their illusory quality) that are called the “three guidelines of training,” or “the three points to be known.”
Any and all of these modes apply as long as concepts arise concerning one’s perceptions, up until the point at which one attains the path of seeing. They are called modes of “reliance and training” because one relies one’s experiences of sense pleasures and trains accordingly. In the case of any of these three modes, one’s conduct might be a case either of alternation or of combination, depending on whether or not any of the three guidelines of training occur simultaneously with one’s experiences of sense pleasures. That is to say, when one is clearly perceiving things as the deity but does not experience the bliss of sense pleasure just as it is, or is experiencing it, but one’s perception of the deity is no longer clear, then one’s conduct is a case of switching between these two alternatives from moment to moment; this is conduct that involves alternation. Once one has gained some familiarity, [4.141.b] these can occur simultaneously; this is conduct that involves combination. The foregoing is the elaborate mode of reliance and training.

<d e="2">
During practice sessions, all mundane situations in which sensory experiences (visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, or tactile) takes place, whether nominally taken to be of an excellent, average, or inferior quality, are brought together in the single forms of the respective goddesses of vajra form and so forth,[458] meditated on as being of surpassing beauty, artful and alluring, and bearing objects of their respective sense pleasures.[459] One meditates until one has indications of actually seeing them. Once these indications have made themselves felt, this elicits an experience of supreme bliss, arousing a distinctive sense of delight in one’s mind. This causes the sense faculties, and the experiences that depend on them, to evolve, so that these serve as causes to connect one to the experience of timeless awareness. When one is engaging in conduct in the periods between practice sessions, in any and every situation in which any given sense faculty encounters any given object of sense pleasure, one relies on, and engages fully in, that experience by, for example, meditating on the sense faculty as a masculine deity and the object as a feminine deity.
The Lamp That Integrates Conduct [460] explains that these modes serve as the cause for one to be capable of engaging henceforth in the spiritual deportment of pure awareness. And given that these modes constitute tantric conduct, they can be summarized in this context as approximations of that spiritual deportment.

There are extremely complex elaborations, such as wearing the attributes of one’s deity, ensuring that one’s fellow practitioners[461] are equal in number to the deities, and such creative activities as song, dance, and other symbolic forms of physical and verbal expression. These may also be used more randomly and to a lesser extent. Or, one may put aside these external elaborations [4.142.a] and rely exclusively on meditative absorption. These alternatives constitute a progression from an elaborate mode to what the above word “others” implies, that is, an unelaborate and extremely unelaborate mode. These three modes are explained in the Lamp That Integrates Conduct as what conduct is in essence.[462]

Individuals may be of three types, depending on the degree to which their minds delight in elaboration, the degree of youthfulness depending on their ages, the extent of their material wealth, the degree of their intelligence, or the degree of their desire. The elaborate mode is for those who take great delight in elaboration, who are young, who have many material possessions, and who have a great deal of desire. The unelaborate mode is for those who have a moderate degree of the above and are more middle-aged. The extremely unelaborate mode is for those who have a lesser degree of the above qualities (taking delight in elaboration and so forth), and who are older. This is how one classifies the distinctions among those who engage in this conduct.

If we analyze the foregoing three modes of conduct further, there are the three modes of conduct as it relates to rituals or activities; the three modes of conduct as it relates to meditation and contemplation; and the three modes of conduct as it relates to occasions. The first context has been explained above.
In the second context, the elaborate mode of conduct is one of meditating and contemplating because all conduct that pertains to one’s practice of the stage of development consists solely of meditation and contemplation that develops the practice through the use of concepts. In this case, even emptiness is allied with concepts, and the bliss, moreover, is nothing more than just a temporary experience. Once one has gained a significant experience of the unity of bliss and emptiness, from that point on the unity of bliss and emptiness that one cultivates in meditative equipoise integrates itself into all one’s perceptions. This is called the “unelaborate mode” because one experiences sense pleasures as the arising of perceptions of the deity’s form, without this relying on meditation that uses concepts exclusively. [4.142.b] In this case, the experience of emptiness is nonconceptual in nature, and bliss, moreover, occurs effortlessly and to a greater extent. When one experiences the state of primordial unity, one experiences sense pleasures arising naturally as an ongoing state of purity, without anything among all that one perceives straying from being the manifest display of this unity of bliss and emptiness itself. Since this mode does not entail overt conceptual thought, it is called the “extremely unelaborate mode” of conduct as it relates to meditation and contemplation. It takes place as a blissful, pervasive experience of the unity of the manifestation of things and their emptiness. The three modes of conduct (elaborate and so forth) as it relates to activities also apply in all three of the above cases.
The third context is an analysis of conduct in the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual, as the Equal Union with All Buddhas states:
Each day, or each month,
or likewise each year,
bless yourself thus through ritual and perform the dance of the buddha Saṃvara.[463]
The elaborate mode is one of engaging in this conduct continually, that is, every day; the unelaborate mode, to engage in it once every month; the extremely unelaborate mode, to engage in it once a year on an appropriate occasion.
Thus, the three cases of conduct as they relate to activity apply to the elaborate mode of meditation and contemplation, and so on, giving nine situations due to applying the three cases of meditation and contemplation to each of the three of activity. In the case of six of these situations (those that pertain to the elaborate and unelaborate modes of activity), there are three further categories to each situation (that is, the elaborate and other modes of conduct in the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual, with respect to the occasion), giving eighteen. Added to this are the three cases of extremely unelaborate conduct,[464] making twenty-one. These become forty-two since one can either be staying in a single place or moving about to major sacred sites. Discounting the fourteen situations pertaining to the elaborate mode of conduct, one can further categorize the remaining situations as being of three kinds, involving either the conduct of eliminating all duality, that of complete nobility, or that of total victory. This gives a final total of 108 situations of conduct. This analysis is the oral instruction of Guru Lhochokpa—some drops from the vast ocean of secret meanings as recorded by the venerable Tāranātha.[465]
The foregoing cases are the general guidelines of the spiritual deportment of pure awareness as emphasized in the mother tantras.

In essence, the conduct that is under discussion here constitutes distinctive conduct of three kinds (physical, verbal, and mental) that brings enhancement through one’s having already gained an excellent degree of stability in meditative absorption with respect to one’s practice of the two stages. The meaning of the term “special” is that one can enjoy sense pleasures just as one wishes, without having to block these, for this is conduct that causes one’s experience of timeless awareness that is blissful yet empty (an experience that has already been stabilized to an excellent degree) to increase more and more.

<d e="2">
The general occasion on which one engages in conduct is that of the attainment of meditative warmth. One must have received permission directly, having pleased one’s chosen deity due to the states of spiritual attainment one has gained through one’s practice of the stage of development. One has attained this meditative warmth when one is not overwhelmed by harmful events (on either the outer or inner level); when one’s meditative absorption cannot be shaken by any circumstances whatsoever; when one is equally indifferent to the eight mundane values; and when the sense objects one perceives in general (and sense pleasures in particular) become supports for one’s meditative absorption to increase. The meaning of this “warmth” is that it is like the warmth that is the precursor heralding the onset of fire (to which spiritual attainments may be compared). In the tantras the Vajra of Delight and the Well-Sealed Locket,[466] as well, are found such statements as:
Meditative warmth is attained to some slight degree…[467]
and the Source Tantra of the Circle of Bliss states:
Just as one should gain realization through striving
at any activities associated with meditative warmth,…[468]
There are three degrees to the meditative warmth of the stage of completion: lesser, intermediate, and greater. The lesser degree has just been explained; [4.143.b] however, in particular one must attain the aforementioned states by relying on the practice of the stage of completion itself. This degree of warmth is endowed with an unlimited and exceptional potential leading to further accomplishments, that is, the intermediate degree (which entails such thorough accomplishments as that of the four gazes of annihilation) and the greater degree (which entails accomplishment of the gaze of nurturing).[469]

There are special occasions for this conduct.
▶ One occasion is associated with the accomplishment of major (though ordinary) spiritual attainments, such as the eight siddhis,[470] through one’s abiding in the yogic practice that brings mastery of timeless awareness; this is the consummation of the stage of development on the obvious level, whether or not one also meditates on the stage of completion.
▶ Another occasion is that of engaging in conduct for the sake of attaining the state of a master of awareness in the realm of desire or that of form; this is the point at which one has gained the fourth level of yoga through some slight stabilization of one’s realization of the stage of completion.
The foregoing are the two occasions associated with gaining states of ordinary spiritual attainment through the stage of either development or completion.
▶ Once one has attained the meditative warmth of the stage of completion, one engages in conduct in order for an enlightened embodiment to be achieved, an embodiment that is simply the unity of one’s subtle energy and mind.
▶ Once that has been achieved, one engages in conduct in order to attain the state of primordial unity, that of actual timeless awareness.
▶ Once one has attained the experience of primordial unity that still requires training, one engages in conduct in order to attain the experience of primordial unity that requires no more training.[471]
These three occasions are dependent on a certain level having been gained, for it is indeed the case that conduct becomes the primary emphasis once the meditative warmth of the stage of completion has been attained.
Thus there are five special occasions. It is not necessary for one to engage in conduct in order for an enlightened embodiment that is simply the unity of one’s subtle energy and mind to be achieved. The first two occasions, which are associated with more ordinary attainments, do not definitively require that one engage in conduct. It is the latter two occasions that involve the necessity of one’s engaging in conduct.

<d e="2">
The purpose of this conduct is to ensure that the two kinds of spiritual attainment are completely accomplished and to cause those attainments to flourish and to be brought to consummation. Given that this is so, through the process involving one’s own body and the bodies of others,[472] one may have already awakened an experience of timeless awareness that had not awakened before and stabilized what has been awakened.
Yet there still remains the purification of the body that is one’s physical support and many ways in which the experience of timeless awareness that it supports can be enhanced. And even though one has become familiar with the causes for all of this through one’s prior path of practice, one might still not be capable of bringing this to consummation in this lifetime.
But if one were to enhance one’s practice by focusing entirely on the conduct of enjoying the pleasures of the five senses (emphasizing the pleasures of union with a consort) together with any auxiliary methods, one could swiftly bring one’s practice to a consummate level, through the stages of this especially exalted process in which one is engaged.
Such conduct can elicit many different specific experiences of supremely blissful timeless awareness, depending on certain distinctions pertaining to the consorts chosen, such as their essential qualities, number, distinctive individual features, and degree of spiritual capability. This accounts for individual variations in the way in which such experiences lead to the realization of emptiness; just as, for example, individual and specific experiences in meditation can be awakened due to one’s focusing intently on certain key places in the body. It is for this reason that the Vajra Ḍāka speaks of the many distinct variations in the way that the nectar of bodhicitta can be controlled, depending on the distinctive configuration of the spiritual consort’s sexual organs.[473]

<d e="2">
If the ways in which one engages in conduct of the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual are analyzed, there are three. The first, that of avadhūti (also known as “the conduct of shaking everything off,” or “secret conduct”) is predominantly the unelaborate mode. [4.144.b] The second, the conduct of complete nobility, is a balance of the elaborate and unelaborate modes. The third, the conduct of total victory, is conduct that is primarily the elaborate mode.
The term avadhūti can be translated as deriving from avadhūnoti, which means “banishing the harmful effects of actions.” It can also be translated as “eliminating duality,” or “shaking everything off.” The Well-Sealed Locket states:
This ensures the swift attainment of what does away with harmful effects….
…The practitioner of yoga carries out meditation in the context that is inconceivable to the ordinary mind;
this is explained to be the conduct of avadhūti.
All concepts are totally eliminated.[474]
This means that initially this conduct ensures that the harmful effects of one’s actions and concepts based on dualistic perception are done away with, with the further meaning that it ensures that one’s tendencies to conceive of things in terms of their ordinary characteristics and to misconstrue them as having true existence are undermined and shaken off, or banished.
The term “complete nobility” means that this conduct is such that any and all actions one commits, whether they nominally appear to be good or bad, are always and entirely positive in their essence. The term “total victory” is used because this conduct is such that one is truly victorious over afflictive states and tames the four māras,[475] is endowed with the power to benefit beings, while one also does away with cognitive obscurations.
Of these, the first two kinds of conduct apply primarily to the path of linkage, while the latter applies primarily to the path of spiritually advanced beings. But in fact all three kinds of conduct can be found among both ordinary individuals and spiritually advanced beings.

The sense to be inferred from the words “complete in number” is that there are heralds dwelling there who have attained one of the ten levels (whether higher or lower), [4.145.a] and that they can act as allies in awakening one’s realization. Therefore, there are distinct locations, primarily major sacred sites.
In certain cases, conduct on the path of the father tantras does not involve one’s roaming through various realms because the presentation in these tantras does not focus on the mantras of the yoginīs.[476] But such tantras as that of Cakrasaṃvara speaks of specific features of conduct (that is, spiritual accomplishment through numerous specific gatherings of heralds) and the necessity of roaming through such realms is in order to achieve that purpose. Therefore, since they involve such skillful means, the tantras of sublime intelligence[477] are especially exalted because their path is swifter.

As for one’s companions in conduct,[478] practitioners of the stage of completion treat all who are in any way appropriate equally regardless of social station, from those of the highest class to those of the lowest.[479] Similarly, these practitioners rely on companions in an unbiased way, without regard for whether their individual bodies, youth, race, and other characteristics are ideal or not.[480]
Generally speaking, practitioners of the stage of development ensure that their principal consorts are of their own type. In particular, according to the tradition of the Cakrasaṃvara cycle,[481] when one embarks on spiritual practice in order to participate in gatherings of yoginīs “born in pure realms,”[482] one relies solely on “herald consorts born of mantra” and on no others[483] because to do otherwise would create obstacles. Once one is participating in these gatherings of those born in pure realms, one relies on both.[484] The foregoing constitutes one tradition of practice focusing on the herald consort. Alternatively, a second tradition involves practice involving yakṣī spirits and other beings, and of giving them food and other gifts.[485]
For practitioners who are involved in both stages of practice, the consorts are those who are motivated tantric practitioners mindful of the teachings; who have received the empowerments and samaya commitments that have passed down through a lineage of gurus; [4.145.b] who have thoroughly cultivated a spiritual practice based on meditative absorption in the two stages; who delight in being generous; who have little fascination with the distractions of mere sense pleasure; who are capable of achieving supreme bliss without being fixated on sense objects; who observe the discipline of controlling the senses according to the tantric approach; and who are able to cause the complete experience of timeless awareness to awaken in the practitioner. Such are the characteristics of those who are the consort companions for conduct as practiced in the two stages; they are heralds whose attainment comes from training. “And others” refers to the general characteristics of herald consorts, which one can learn from other sources. Likewise, one should be skilled in the way one interacts with a herald.

The sole attitude with which to engage in conduct is in order to ensure the two kinds of benefit: freedom for oneself and for other beings. It is inappropriate to engage in conduct to show oneself to be noble, or to secure such things as food, drink, and clothing. In addition, one’s attitude should not be one of fixating on personal wealth but of having great compassion for beings and of feeling that one has totally given one’s body to beings as a gift. One should be motivated by these five points of attitude. The tantra the Vajra of Delight states:
Having given the gift of the body,
one goes forth and trains in authentic conduct.[486]
As long as one has not gained sublime miraculous powers, the meaning of giving one’s body to beings is not one of cutting it up and giving it to them. Rather, if one commits the slightest physical action, even breathing in and then out again, one imagines this being for the purpose of liberating all limitless beings. This is what it means to give one’s body to all beings.

If it is a case of conduct on the stage of development, one meditates constantly on deity yoga, including the protection circle and the armoring process.[487] Imagining the entire animate and inanimate universe as having the nature of threefold purity,[488] one views them within that framework.
As for the conduct on the stage of completion, in all practice sessions and in all the periods between sessions, one integrates one’s perception of everything with one’s awareness of utter lucidity and timeless awareness that is the nonduality of bliss and emptiness.

Fine earrings for the ears,
a wheel worn firmly on the crown of the head,
bracelets on the wrists,
a sash around the waist,
anklets in similar fashion on the legs,
armlets on the upper arms,
a garland of bones around the neck,
and a tiger skin for raiment….
…a turban fashioned from the hair of thieves,
to which a Hūṃ is applied….
…adorned with a multicolored skirt
and likewise with the ash from cremated corpses.[489]
These and many similar passages speak of the five (or six) symbolic ornaments.[490] One should also carry the authentic insignia of the deity, such as a khatvaṅga staff, skull cup, and hand drum.[491]

Rising early in the morning, with a completely pure intent one greets one’s spiritual master and asks that one’s conduct develop well, requesting permission to engage in it. Once this has been obtained, one maintains practice of deity yoga while employing purificatory techniques involving deity and mantra, such as smearing such substances as the five kinds of meat and five kinds of nectar[492] on one’s body and performing the triple process of armoring. Should one see one’s master or chosen deity, one performs prostrations and recites the deity’s primary mantra. All this is due to one’s eliminating ordinary attitudes concerning what is nominally held to be “good” or “bad.”

At this point, one’s circumstances are such that everything one perceives is experienced as blissful and so, with a completely nonconceptual frame of mind, one engages in conduct in a state of equalness, without any judgmental attitude toward what is nominally good or bad. As is said:
As for food, and likewise drink,
partake of whatever is found with enjoyment.
Because “attractive” and “unattractive” are just concepts,
do not pander to simplistic fixations.
A tantrika does not pander to what are just concepts
by indulging in thoughts of “edible” versus “inedible,”
or “drinkable” versus “undrinkable,”
or even “indulging” versus “not indulging.”[493]

As for the training that applies in the context of conduct, this is grounded in one’s maintaining the general and specific samaya commitments that I explained in the part concerning the tantric vows.[494] The source tantra of the Cakrasaṃvara cycle explains that there are three aspects to the ritual purity observed in the gaṇacakra ritual: (1) practitioners of the stage of development do not show disrespect toward the deity’s insignia, while practitioners of both stages do not express anger towards those who uphold the samaya commitments; (2) other than in specific allowable situations, one does not transgress the samaya commitments of empowerments; and (3) during the four periods of the day and night, one cultivates bliss in union with one’s mudrā consort.
The Origin of Sublime Bliss speaks of the kinds of conduct for beginning practitioners in such passages as the following:
Eliminate desire, anger, fear,
craving, ignorance, and pride.
Always eliminate naïve affirmation and nihilistic denial,
as well as avoiding the editing and compilation of ritual texts.[495]…
…Completely eliminate anger, overweening pride,
and reactions to praise or censure.
Always be without attachments and without frivolity.
Remain as ordinary as everyone else….
…One should remain without doubt,
treating oneself and others equally.
As for the conduct that is without desire,
one may engage in all small desires.[496] [4.147.a]
Next, the Well-Sealed Locket and the Two Sections state:
One should definitely never indulge in the slightest fear
of any god or human being,
even if it is someone like Indra.[497]
Act in the manner of a lion.[498]
And the Origin of Sublime Bliss states:
Having completely eliminated all hesitations,
the yogic practitioner acts like a lion.[499]
As the foregoing passages indicate, the samaya commitments for all cases of conduct involve the discipline that brings the attainment of stability, through engaging in any situation whatsoever without fear; enjoying whatever food and drink one finds; giving up such external activities as fire rituals; being without superstition regarding dates or planetary events; giving up any certainty regarding commitments that concern one’s diet; gaining definitive freedom from vows that control one’s physical and verbal actions. As well, one does away with shame, timidity, and ordinary states of sleep.
As for the samaya commitments of conduct for one who has gained stability in the stage of completion, they are as follows:
▶ to experience the eating of all food as an inner fire ritual;[500]
▶ to continually create visualizations of maṇḍalas in one’s meditation;
▶ to consecrate all things whatsoever one perceives by knowing them to be the three vajras;
▶ to engage in an uninterrupted flow of mantra repetition by knowing speech to be mantra;
▶ to be constantly inseparable from the experience of timeless awareness;
▶ to give spiritual advice to human and nonhuman students;
▶ to ensure benefit for beings through annihilation and nurturing;
▶ to delight all buddhas by honoring one’s own true nature;
▶ never to relinquish the experience of sleep as the state of utter lucidity;
▶ not to relinquish sexual activity; and
▶ not to prevent oneself from enjoying the pleasure of the senses.[501]
Once one has gained a great degree of stability in this stage, one does not prostrate to any statue, [4.147.b] only to that of one’s spiritual master or a guru of one’s lineage, and so (it goes without saying) not to others. One does not perform any rituals such as those associated with the maṇḍala principle; such is the spiritual deportment of one who has gained this great degree of stability.

Although the benefits and qualities that derive from engaging in conduct are limitless, let us consider just a representative sampling. In the section on conduct in the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual from The Accomplishment of Secrets, we find the following passage:
If one engages in the spiritual deportment of pure awareness
in environments just as discussed in the teachings,
one is purified of the effects of all harmful actions without exception
and gains freedom in the company of the mudrā consort of awareness.[502]
And that is not all, for one can purify limitless other beings simply by touching or holding conversation with them. the Five Stages states:
Knowing how to discern what manifest phenomena are by nature,[503]
one relies on the fourth aspect, suchness.[504]
Whoever trains in the three aspects,[505]
they will swiftly attain the fruition.
Although the potential for fire is present in sticks of wood,
it will not occur unless they are rubbed together;
similarly, without the training leading to enlightenment,
it will not occur by itself.[506]
In this passage, the words “the three aspects” refer to the three modes of conduct.[507] Other than those who attain a lesser state of nirvāṇa,[508] the circumstances bringing about the path of seeing and the consummation of the attainment of buddhahood depend solely on conduct, and the swift accomplishment of spiritual attainments also depends solely on conduct. If sticks of wood are not rubbed vigorously, fire will not occur, only a slight smoldering. Similarly, if one lacks training in conduct, even if one gains the consummate experience that foreshadows the actual state of utter lucidity, the most sublime goal will not be accomplished in this lifetime. But if one engages in conduct, it is impossible that this goal will not be accomplished in this lifetime.

Initially, one engages in secret conduct. The source tantra of the Cakrasaṃvara cycle states: [4.148.a]
Though always being open at night,
one should maintain secrecy by day.
The timeless awareness one enacts should be extremely hidden.[509]
And the tantra the Vajra of Delight states:
Engage in conduct in secrecy for one month.[510]
In order for one to determine whether or not one’s mind is stable, by night one roams in charnel grounds and such places, either accompanied by one’s mudrā consort or relying on a consort of timeless awareness. One engages in various kinds of conduct that contradict mundane values. If, at that point, it turns out that one’s experience of timeless awareness is slightly unstable, one temporarily does not engage in conduct, but meditates in order to stabilize one’s yogic practice.
If, however, one has stability, one should familiarize oneself with that conduct for a month. It is then that one receives a prophecy concerning one’s mudrā consort. Next, having requested one’s spiritual master’s permission, one engages in the conduct of avadhūti in full view of mundane people. But regardless of which mode one adopts, whether elaborate or unelaborate, one must disguise this so that ordinary people in the world are unaware of it. And so one pretends to be a lunatic, a bastard, a fool, a low-class person, and so forth, and trains thoroughly with a mudrā consort regarding whom one has received an important prophecy. Within a month one gains the good fortune to engage in conduct in company with that consort; alternatively, it is also appropriate for one to engage in conduct in the company of hosts of ḍākinīs [511] or of yoginīs either born in pure realms or born of mantra.
One embarks on a variety of unpredictable modes of conduct by singing, dancing, talking randomly, playing, laughing, quarrelling, jumping, running, and so forth—all the ways in which one knows how to bring about a change in the minds of ordinary people. One meditates without one’s mind shifting its focus, while engaging in conduct so that all kinds of base behavior could be experienced as supports for one’s meditative absorption: behavior such as eating the five kinds of meat and the five kinds of nectar, tormas intended for nonhuman spirits, or the leftovers discarded at a ritual feast; or engaging in sexual relations with one’s mother or sister, or someone else who would not ordinarily be a suitable partner.[512] [4.148.b] In this context, vajra songs and dances that a practitioner can learn are not performed for the time being.[513]
Once overt concepts have subsided within the foregoing context, and one has moved to the intermediate degree of meditative warmth, one engages in the conduct of complete nobility. While previously one may not have requested one’s spiritual master’s permission with regard to the objects and so forth one enjoys in one’s conduct, at this point one definitely must request this permission; for it is at this point that one makes people in the world aware of the fact that one is truly involved in yogic practice. Using various supernormal powers to turn around the attitudes of even those who lack faith, one employs such methods as the four ways of gazing to bring about benefit for beings in numerous ways. And it is at this point that one participates in incredible gatherings of heralds born in pure realms, without having to make effort to do so.
Once one has attained the greater degree of meditative warmth in the foregoing context, one has begun to engage in the conduct of total victory in all ways. On the levels prior to this, objective circumstances may have exerted a slightly harmful influence, but from this point on this is not the case. In this situation, which is the initial stage of the conduct of total victory in all ways, one may rely on the mudrā consorts described previously. But since one definitely gains great capacity in this present context, one can call on goddesses who are relatively easy to summon (such as “the goddess of the water element” or “the sublime goddess of bindu”) and can even call on great goddesses, nāgīs, yakṣīs, or mātṛis. Thus, one relies on either consorts born of mantra or born in pure realms (whose status derives from their training), or any of the foregoing four kinds (who are called on in the moment), and invokes Vajrasattva so that one fully experiences the path of seeing more or less immediately. Even once one has thus attained the level of a spiritually advanced being, one relies primarily on this same level of conduct. This last level of conduct becomes for the most part a case of conduct in the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual.
The beginning stages of the conduct of total victory in all ways is conduct that serves as the expedient cause in the context of the highest mundane experience on the path of linkage; it is thus total victory in all ways as this applies to ordinary individuals. [4.149.a] The conduct of avadhūti corresponds to the situation in which one focuses on the more obvious factors to be abandoned on the path of spiritually advanced beings and infuses these with the supremely blissful experience of timeless awareness, for one is as yet unable to overwhelm them. The conduct of complete nobility is that of overwhelming the overt expressions of these factors. The conduct that ensures that these factors will not occur in the future is that of total victory in all ways, as this applies to the three modes of conduct subsumed within the path of spiritually advanced beings. Generally speaking, the conduct of spiritually advanced beings is considered to be that of total victory in all ways, but the foregoing cases show a fundamental consistency between this and the other two levels of conduct.

In particular, elaborate conduct in gaṇacakras involves the practice of accomplishment concerning the maṇḍala.
Through symbolic song and dance, one partakes of the inner fire ritual
and engages in the union of equipoise, embracing the pleasures of the senses.
In the Cakrasaṃvara tradition, one invokes the three kinds of heralds.

Among the kinds of conduct, the discussion of the distinctive kind of elaborate conduct in the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual has three topics: how the practice concerning the maṇḍala for conduct in the group practice is accomplished; how one enjoys sense pleasures within that context; and the particular way in which one participates in gatherings of the three kinds of heralds[514] according to the Cakrasaṃvara tradition.

First, in environments described in the tantras, one erects a building for gaṇacakra rituals that has all the necessary features. Of its three concentric “layers,” the outermost holds the storeroom and kitchen; the intermediate layer is the place for song, dance, and music; and the innermost sanctum is where the maṇḍala is drawn out. In the places associated with the deities, spread seats of corpses, tiger skins, and so forth. The male and female practitioners wear masks or paint their skin with color; hold the deity’s insignia, such as vajras, bells, and khatvaṅga staffs; and wear the five symbolic ornaments.
The principal participant occupies the central position, while the others arrange themselves in the cardinal and intermediate directions, ascertaining their respective family types. In this regard, one’s family is that of the deity on whom one’s flower fell.[515] [4.149.b] Alternatively, it is determined by the shape of one’s body and the formation of the subtle channel in one’s ring finger; or by the particular power of one’s mind, as in the following quotation:
Stable of mind, courageous of heart, very wealthy,
able to influence the minds of others, and diligent in carrying out activities:
such progressions apply to Vairocana and the others.[516]
It may also be determined by one’s specific tendencies to colors, emotions, and so on. Those who are women place themselves in the respective positions of the deities on the basis of such family types as that of the Lotus-Bearer.[517]
If one is engaging in conduct in unpredictable places, one performs the foregoing extensive gaṇacakra ritual whenever appropriate (once a month, even once a year) enjoying sense pleasures on a grand scale, including all elaborations such as symbolic gestures, song, and dance. But one does not need to practice constantly with the building for the gathering, the seats, and so on, just as outlined above. Since one also does not need to adhere strictly to the colors, insignia, and the like, it is sufficient for one to be adorned with the five ornaments,[518] to wear a tiger skin or the shroud of a corpse, or to bear such insignia of the deity as are appropriate (such as a club or a hand drum).
In gaṇacakra settings in which the maṇḍala includes fewer masculine deities and many yoginīs, it is fine to have a number of the latter seated in each of the places assigned to masculine deities; or to them seated so as to serve in the role of offering goddesses (such as the eight goddesses).[519]
If one is engaging in the conduct of “shaking everything off” while wandering in towns and cities, it could prove problematic if one insists on wearing the attributes of one’s deity to the letter, or if one does not exercise some caution in pretending to be a lunatic. It is therefore acceptable, for example, to adopt more unobtrusive attributes and to consider this to be in the true spirit of wearing the deity’s attributes.

Second, when one is engaging in conduct while practicing the stage of development, one visualizes the principal deity and the retinue all in accordance with the stages set forth in the sādhana text; while one is practicing the stage of completion, these are visualized instantaneously. All sense experiences are consecrated with blessings, so that one partakes of food and drink as an inner fire ritual, just as one does during the gaṇacakra ritual. [4.150.a] One ensures that the maṇḍala of one’s body, with all the mind-body aggregates, sense fields, and components of perception, is completely suffused with supreme bliss. From among the goddesses who engage in conduct as one’s consorts, or those who are one’s students, one then participates at will, in any activity desired, with one who is skilled in the arts of desire. One thus perfects the spiritual attainment of mahāmudrā.[520]
The foregoing means that, with firm intent, one employs the three concepts[521] in arousing the six aspects of passion, and uses the relevant sexual techniques to engage in the actual act of union. In doing so, through the four successive degrees of joy one comes to experience fully the innate state of timeless awareness, resting in equipoise in supreme bliss. When one rises from that state, one meditates on everything one perceives as being like an illusion, thus ensuring that everything that manifests is experienced as the embodiment of the deity.
In the periods between these practice sessions, without one’s mind losing its focus, one engages in play on a grand scale: One participates in the stages of such rituals as the “dance of the buddhas.” One joins with the yoginīs in offering mudrā gestures to the principal deity and receiving mudrās in turn (in answer to these) from the consort of awareness. Similarly, one participates in a process of performing various actions and receiving like actions in return, such as prostrations, offerings, songs, dances, and other physical and verbal gestures. In addition, one relies, according to one’s wishes, on such aids as dramatic performances, music, postures, and the nine moods of dance,[522] embracing all of these activities with one’s senses.

Third, regardless of which conduct one adopts (whether that of staying in one place or roaming in various regions), in this tradition one must definitely invoke heralds. By one’s relying on authentic heralds who have developed through training, those who are born of mantra enter into the bodies of the former and accept the offering of supreme bliss. This delights the latter heralds and they consent to actually gather, so that one can actually rely on them. This process ensures that one can supplicate heralds born in pure realms, of a kind that will accord with the environment one inhabits. [4.150.b] One invokes them by saying, “Please take this practitioner under your care!” so that heralds born in pure realms enter into the bodies of those born of mantra. Once these heralds born in pure realms have accepted the offering of supreme bliss and thus have been delighted, they consent to actually gather themselves.
Once one has relied on them, this process invokes the innately present goddesses who are the foremost of one’s particular family. These innately present goddesses bless, and so enter into, the bodies of the heralds born in pure realms, and accept one’s offering. Delighted, they actually convene a gathering of innately present goddesses that one experiences directly. It is within that context that one gains freedom.
Through the three kinds of heralds accepting offerings, one’s own accumulation of merit is augmented. As well, each successive level of practice is that much stronger in bringing one’s obscurations to an end. If one encounters one of the three kinds of heralds, spiritual attainments of one of three degrees (lesser, intermediate, and greater) are accomplished by that very fact. But for those of little merit, no other “gathering” can occur than that imposed by the constraints of their karma; hence the necessity for such means for augmentation and diminution.[523] This is, for example, like the case of a powerful alchemical method:[524] although theoretically anyone using it could indeed attain the state of rainbow body, practically speaking those lacking in capacity and good fortune will not attain this.
As for those who embark on the path of the herald,[525] what happens at the outset is the conduct of participating in gatherings of heralds born of mantra. For those who meditate exclusively on the path of yogic practice, however, the initial stage of conduct is that of relying on consorts of awareness who have become so through training. By relying on them, one invokes heralds born of mantra and only later participates in those gatherings. There are few who can participate from the outset, for even though a consort may be one who is prophesied to be such, this does not necessarily entail that consort’s being, for example, born of mantra. This is because the three kinds of heralds do not require training, while the ones referred to here are said to undergo training.

In the second case, what is to be understood from a supplementary discussion that follows from the foregoing, one should be aware that in general there are three treatments of the gaṇacakra ritual: an ordinary one; an extraordinary one; and one that involves elaborations. [4.151.a]
As for the differences in how these treatments describe the location in which the practitioners gather, in the ordinary context this is a windowless building in a somewhat isolated location. As for the extraordinary treatment, we may cite Ḍombipa’s treatise on the gaṇacakra ritual, entitled Five Samaya Commitments, in which the characteristics for choosing or rejecting a site are discussed in detail:
Ah! Vajra holders, rejoice! These sacred circles are not to be performed in ordinary places. You should avoid performing them where business is being conducted. You should also avoid towns with their distractions, or the houses of brahmins, or the palaces of rulers, or the parks where the monastic saṅghas live, or places where uncivilized barbarians dwell. You should also avoid towns inhabited by those who hold extreme views, or wilderness hermitages, or places frequented by dangerous wild animals. Going to places where ḍākinīs roam, or areas on the fringes of settled communities, or solitary areas, or temples, or charnel grounds, or empty caves, or under trees, or forested areas, there you erect a building for gaṇacakra rituals that has three concentric layers…[526]
As for the elaborate treatment, in any suitable place one constructs a building for gaṇacakra rituals that has three concentric walls from the outside wall in to the center. Of these layered walls, the innermost and lowest is entirely underground; the middle wall rises halfway above ground, and the outermost and highest is above ground. Thus, people who view the building from the outside have the impression that it has only one wall.
As for the differences in the yogic practitioners who gather in these places, in the ordinary context they have proficiency in either of the two stages, that of development or that of completion. In the extraordinary context, they are those who have gained the status of true yogic practitioners, or are heroic gods and goddesses who are spiritually accomplished by nature. [4.151.b] In the elaborate context, they are solely those who are involved in yogic practice.
In any of these three contexts, a gathering in which the male and female practitioners are equal in number to the corresponding deities constitutes a gaṇacakra. When it is entirely made up of male practitioners, and is for the purpose of partaking of alcohol, a single female practitioner is seated to the left of the principal male, and this constitutes a “heroes’ banquet.” When it is entirely made up of female practitioners, and is for the purpose of partaking of meat, a single male practitioner is seated to the right of the principal female, and this constitutes a “heroines’ banquet.” The Frond of Pith Instructions [527] explains that a mudrā consort should definitely be offered to the guru in the case of a heroes’ banquet. A ritual performed by equal numbers of men and women on the basis of intent, relying on the consort of timeless awareness,[528] is the kind of gaṇacakra for tantric practitioners nowadays; it is an approximation of a true gaṇacakra ritual. As for the legitimacy of relying on a jñānamudrā consort (a consort who embodies timeless awareness), the Five Samaya Commitments states:
They embrace their consorts of self-knowing awareness;
if unable to, they should do so with those of meditative stability.[529]
Similarly, if the five kinds of meat and five kinds of nectar are not available, one can include them through a process of meditation. The same source states:
If there is any of these that I cannot find,
or anyone for whom I am concerned they may not be suitable,
the five kinds of meat and five kinds of nectar
can be conceptualized intently through meditative stability.[530]
In all three contexts, the masters who are invited to gaṇacakra rituals may or may not be spiritually accomplished; either is appropriate. In all three cases a fully ordained monk who is a vajra holder[531] is definitely considered to be ideal, and so such a master would certainly be honored with a higher seat than a lay master, unless the latter had attained a level of realization and was the elder in terms of the experience of timeless awareness.[532] If a fully ordained vajra holder is invited to a gaṇacakra otherwise made up entirely of lay vajra holders and needs a place, he should not be seated below them in the ranks but should be assigned to another location; this is described as the allocation of one’s share in the gaṇacakra.[533]
These gaṇacakra rituals can be called by various names. A gaṇacakra is “a gathering of friends” if the people who gather are engaged in numerous different methods of the deity yoga; [4.152.a] in this case the term is applied in consideration of the deity yoga involved. In the context of a consecration ritual or a fire ritual, a gaṇacakra is called “a sumptuous feast,” in consideration of the occasion. If a gaṇacakra is performed when masks are used equal in number to the deities and such activities as those of annihilation are carried out, it is called “the dance of the buddhas,” in consideration of the purpose. If a gaṇacakra is solely for the purpose of making offerings to ḍākinīs, both transcendent and of the world, it is called “the offering to the goddesses of the family,” or a “maidens’ feast.” These variant terms were described by the learned masters of Tibet.
As for the different occasions on which gaṇacakra rituals are performed, the seventh part of the First Section states:
On the day of the pretas, half-moon, the fourteenth,
and similarly on the eighth.[534]
And the seventh section of the ninth chapter of the Well-Sealed Locket states:
On the fourteenth day of the waning moon,
and in particular on the eighth,
and on the tenth of the waxing moon,
offerings become the very epitome of offerings.[535]
In the foregoing passages, the dates mentioned refer to the nighttime. In the elaborate context, one engages in this conduct for at least one month, or even three years and three fortnights or longer, without missing an occasion.
As for the successive activities of those who gather for a gaṇacakra, in the ordinary context this involves drawing out the maṇḍala. The Five Samaya Commitments states:
Until the master has granted permission, do not perform symbolic gestures. Until you have performed a supplication, do not open the gate. Until you have made a purificatory torma offering, do not enter. Until you have invited the worthy participants and sponsors, do not engage in conversation. Until you have offered flowers to the master, do not take your seat. Until the masculine and feminine bodhisattvas in charge of activities have granted permission, do not join the ranks.[536]
Following this advice, one meditates on the circle of the maṇḍala. Beginning with the consecration of the alcohol and nectar, one participates in all aspects of the conduct. If the gaṇacakra is held in connection with “the empowerment of the great master” to attain siddhis, [4.152.b] in this stage of the path that involves one in conduct, the vajra master confers a truly authentic empowerment.[537] One can learn about the extensive ways to implement this method in the ancient manuals of the Indian and Tibetan traditions of Buddhism. As for the activities in the extraordinary context, these are as explained above, but following these there should be the enactment of a vast range of activities, and Khecara (the “enjoyment of space”),[538] in which as many participants as are gathered gain states of accomplishment.

<d e="2">
For the unelaborate mode of conduct in gaṇacakras, one relies on some appropriate part of the foregoing. There may be as many mudrā consorts as there are deities, or more; but there can also be just one awareness consort. One engages in any aspect of conduct that one feels appropriate, such as adopting the attributes, employing the maṇḍala, erecting the building for the gaṇacakra, and any of the activities associated with a gaṇacakra. But one uses fewer elaborations, so that this mode is far less extensive than the former; at times one may, for example, forego the majority of activities and just perform a few. With this mode, one can practice in order to bind yakṣīs and gods of the forest to one’s service, so that they procure one’s material needs. In the two latter modes of conduct,[539] there are cases of those who engage in conduct while nourishing themselves with fruits of the forest. The Gathering of Secrets states:
One may engage in conduct
on a diet of roots, herbs, and fruit;
nevertheless, one can swiftly awaken to buddhahood.[540]
And so it may be that the activities of the gaṇacakra are somewhat less than complete.

As for the extremely unelaborate mode of conduct, one practices to bind yakṣīs and similar beings to one’s service in any suitable environment, such as a mountaintop, on the banks of a river, in a charnel ground, or in one’s own home. [4.153.a] One can also go about begging for alms, or have others obtain one’s food. Doing away with all distractions, one lets go of deeply ingrained attitudes of fixation, not coveting even so much as a sesame seed, and practices assiduously by engaging in union with a jñānamudrā consort visualized as emerging from one’s own heart center.
In particular, practitioners of the stage of completion meditate constantly on the utterly lucid state of sleep. This mode is also known as “the conduct of the bhusuku.” Bhu derives from bhuñja, that is, “eating”; su from supta,[541] that is, “sleeping”; and ku from kuṭhara, that is, “moving only to defecate and urinate.”[542] The term implies that one does away with all concepts other than those concerned with eating just enough to nourish one’s body, falling asleep in the state of utter lucidity, and going to the toilet. In this context, meditating on the utterly lucid state of sleep does not refer to one’s entering into this state of utter lucidity simply by falling asleep in a perfectly natural manner. That practice in fact exists in the other two modes of conduct in this section. Therefore, as a substitute for relying on a mudrā consort external to oneself (as practiced in the other two modes of conduct), in this mode one meditates on the utterly lucid state of sleep, which is to say that one is constantly asleep. Therefore, the term “the conduct of the bhusuku” is not used to refer to the extremely unelaborate mode of conduct for practitioners of the stage of development.
Let us analyze this mode more precisely. There are two kinds of such conduct. The mere conduct for passionate practitioners, involving sexual activity, is the extremely unelaborate mode of conduct solely for the stage of development. The conduct for diligent practitioners, bringing the awakening to buddhahood in this lifetime, is the one which has just been explained (that of integrating the jñānamudrā consort with the state of sleep) and constitutes the extremely unelaborate mode of conduct in the true sense of the term.
There are also three kinds of conduct that parallel this extremely unelaborate mode:
(1) When one passes into the intermediate state after death, one’s involvement in the path that leads to the perception of the state of utter lucidity at death can itself be integrated into the process of dying.
(2) The conduct of integrating awareness with the state of sleep can bring awakening to buddhahood in succeeding lifetimes: Since one has attained the phase of meditative warmth, one can focus one-pointedly on the utterly lucid state of sleep; while one might not attain the state of illusory body in this lifetime, one will attain it in the intermediate state after death and, on the basis of that, accomplish the enlightened embodiment of primordial unity; [4.153.b] alternately, there is also the possibility that one will attain nirvāṇa on the basis of one’s accomplishment of the distinctive body of a master of awareness.
(3) Having traversed the ten bodhisattva levels to their furthest limit according to the sūtra tradition, one then embarks on the Vajrayāna approach, in which one engages in the conduct that constitutes the powerful means that is the expedient cause of attainment.[543]
Of these three parallel kinds of conduct, the two possibilities of the middle kind are not, strictly speaking, conduct in the true sense. While the latter kind is a case of relying on a physical karmamudrā consort, it is nevertheless included in the extremely unelaborate mode; this is a special case.

Concerning the conduct that ensures accomplishment of the consummate step that foreshadows the actual state of utter lucidity, generally speaking, one must definitely engage in whatever mode is appropriate, regardless of which of the three principal modes this might be, whether elaborate or unelaborate. After one has accomplished the enlightened embodiment that is simply the unity of subtle energy and mind, it is alright to rely on any one of the three modes of conduct.
One engages in these three modes (elaborate or otherwise) in accord with one’s degree of acumen. That is to say, the elaborate mode is for those of duller acumen, the unelaborate mode for those of middling acumen, and the extremely unelaborate mode for those of keener acumen; these are progressively swifter processes.

For the yogic practitioner who is engaged in conduct, in very close connection with the conferral of empowerment is what is termed “the expedient cause as a factor contributing to manifest enlightenment.” When the time is right to engage in conduct, a vajra master (one in human form) confers empowerment on a yogic practitioner who has attained isolation of mind.[544] In this case, it is not simply a case of forging one’s path through aspiration, but an empowerment in the true sense, complete with an actual consort.[545] [4.154.a] Due to the auspicious circumstances of the practitioner maintaining samaya commitments without impairment, the empowerment into the expedient cause (as a more introductory factor that contributes to manifest enlightenment) is empowerment conferred by nirmāṇakāya buddhas. This empowerment may be conferred by an actual nirmāṇakāya, or by the previous vajra master serving in that capacity, or by that master being blessed by a nirmāṇakāya.[546] As a more advanced factor contributing to manifest enlightenment, one receives empowerment conferred by sambhogakāyas.
Generally speaking, this expedient cause, as it relates to the most sublime spiritual attainment, is in three steps: the initial onset; the conclusion; and the bridge that connects these two. The first aspect is that of empowerment conferred by a nirmāṇakāya and the middle aspect that of empowerment conferred by a sambhogakāya, while the latter aspect is all that constitutes spiritual deportment with a consort of pure awareness. The stages of empowerment from those of the water and the crown up to and including the secret empowerment[547] are conferred within the maṇḍala of the gaṇacakra ritual. Once the sun is setting, one relies on the causal factor connected with the conferral of the empowerment into sublime intelligence and timeless awareness; then, oneself and one’s consort awaken to manifest enlightenment at dawn. This is referred to in one of the tantras:
Once the vajra sun has set,
one begins the practice wholeheartedly.
At the time that dawn breaks,
the most sublime state of meditation is realized.[548]

From among these, concerning the conduct of the four vajras, the concise tantra states:
Through the purification of bindu by day and by night,
there comes a steady flow of the white element,
which is Māmakī, the goddess of alcohol. [4.154.b]
Beef and the other meats delight the eyes and other organs each and every day,
but not so other kinds of flesh, not even occasionally.
The pure forms of the deities dwelling in one’s self-knowing awareness are nourished by the five kinds of nectar.
With the mind utterly immersed in emptiness,
the sexual intercourse that ensures the equal taste of everything is not an avenue for rebirth.[550]
On the relative level, this passage means that a yogic practitioner who has gained some degree of capacity drinks the five kinds of alcohol, eats the five kinds of meat and the five kinds of nectar, and relies on the five families of mudrā consorts. But on the more definitive level, the meaning of the foregoing lines is that, in succession, one trains in bodhicitta; arrests the subtle energies (and the concepts these produce) associated with the five sense faculties; harnesses the bindu in the energy centers of the subtle channels through channeling subtle energies; and rests in the equipoise of bodhicitta as the stable experience of empty forms.

Concerning the second kind of conduct, that of the six family types, the tantra states:
It is certainly the case that those of the vajra family should take life. Those of the sword should tell untruths.
Those of the jewel should rob others of their wealth, while those of the sublime lotus family should take the spouses of others.
Those of the wheel should guard alcohol, lamps, buddhas, and all objects of beauty.
Those of the kartarī knife should not disparage the lotus of space—that is, women of any and all kinds, even those of a low social class.
For the sake of beings, one should give away one’s body and one’s wealth: one should not hold on to these.
O child of spiritual heritage, thus will you become a buddha in truth, but the Victorious One[551] states that in other situations you would not do so for limitless eons.[552]
The provisional meaning of these lines is that the lucid experience of meditative absorption as the unity of emptiness and compassion unfolds, while one gains the capability to carry out enlightened activities without hindrance. If it is certain that these means alone serve to benefit beings, without recourse to any other means, even the actions of taking life, telling lies, [4.155.a] stealing others’ wealth, and taking others’ spouses become supports for an enormous degree of spiritual development. Given that this is due to one’s capability and power, it is not a case of ordinary harmful actions, like the use of poisons or weaponry. The way in which one relies on alcohol, “lamps” (that is, meat), and “buddha” (that is, the five kinds of nectar) is as explained previously. One also relies on the five kinds of sense objects, such as lovely forms and pleasant sounds. If one is able to harness the melting bliss that is not subject to degeneration, one practices with mudrā consorts of random social classes, including those of low class. In brief, conduct that goes against noble principles also serves to ensure benefit for beings.
The definitive meaning of these lines has four implications:
(1) arresting the 21,000 aspects of the subtle energy of karma;
(2) revealing spiritual teachings in whatever way benefits any being whatsoever;
(3) striving at the means to accomplish unchanging bliss; and
(4) striving at the means to accomplish mahāmudrā, the embodiment of emptiness that is endowed with all qualities.[553]
To these are added the following:
(5) the four samayas of the definitive level, which were discussed previously, counted together as one; and
(6) the arresting of bindu within the central channel through the experience of mahāmudrā, the embodiment of emptiness.
Once the foregoing are all the case, one may have two, or even three, mudrā consorts. Thus, there are samaya commitments for each of the six family types. The injunction to have the attitude of giving away one’s body and wealth to benefit beings is the samaya commitment common to all six families.

Concerning the third kind of conduct, that of the six transcendent perfections, the tantra states:
Generosity is giving up wealth and possessions. Discipline lies in not shifting, though your mind consorts with women.[554]
Forbearance is not getting caught up in sounds and other stimuli. Diligence consists of subtle energy putting an end to the dualistic process.
Meditative stability and sublime intelligence, furthermore, constitute a mind that dwells in its innate nature, as well as its omnipresence and the language of all. [4.155.b]
The other four[555] are found in the attainment of human rebirth, ensuring benefit for beings and performing miracles until the end of conditioned existence.[556]
Fourfold independence[557] constitutes generosity; recollection constitutes diligence; consolidation and meditative stability constitute forbearance; harnessing and channeling subtle energy, and attention, constitute diligence; the unchanging bliss innate to mind and body, which derives from meditative absorption, constitutes meditative stability; the indestructible melody that is the speech factor of that meditative absorption constitutes sublime intelligence. Similarly, to say nothing of one’s purifying oneself, giving spiritual teachings, and so forth, there is benefit for all beings who see, hear, think of, or touch one, in that they are brought swiftly to enlightenment; this constitutes skillful means. In order to guide any and all beings in any and all ways, one has various miraculous powers that derive from one’s unconditional resolve; this constitutes aspiration. Due to meditative absorption in the state of primordial unity, one eliminates the seemingly self-justifying factors of conditioned existence (that is, afflictive states) and brings an end to the suffering of others; this constitutes spiritual power. One fully experiences the primordial nature of things (the unborn and unceasing state); this constitutes timeless awareness, which is to say, the transcendent perfection of timeless awareness. One strives to accomplish the foregoing as much as possible.

An auxiliary function of conduct is that of the activity of “forceful application,” also known as “planting the kīla dagger” or the “application of wrath,” which is to say, the application that strikes at the vital point of deity practice. This application is of two kinds. It occurs in conjunction with the stage of development; and also with the stage of completion since it is possible for there to be occasions on which [4.156.a] those who are familiar with the yoga of emptiness may need to perform it.
Concerning the first case, that of the application of wrath in conjunction with the stage of development, generally speaking there are two kinds of individuals who are involved in the yogic practice of the stage of development: those yogic practitioners who are more deeply involved in this stage, and those who are involved in the practice of mantra. The former kind do not require the application of wrathful activity; the latter kind are, in essence, those who have gained stability in the more obvious aspects of the stage of development. Those individuals who are involved in mantra practice engage in conduct three times over in order to experience such spiritual attainments as pills and eye medicine.[558] If one engages in conduct for six months or more without these attainments being accomplished, at that point one practices such wrathful activity as “slaying Vajrasattva” (which is to say, stabbing the deity dwelling in the lotus of the consort with the kīla dagger). Thus, it is explained that in order that the deities confer spiritual attainments, one invokes them by driving home the key point of practice and so encounters the deities in a very short time, so that the most sublime attainments are ensured.
For yogic practitioners of the stage of completion, generally speaking it is held that the application of wrathful activity is not necessary. But if one is involved in the stage of completion and engages in conduct three times over, for six months or more, without gaining spiritual attainments, one then puts aside any continued practice of the stage of completion for the time being and brings about accomplishment by embarking on the conduct of the stage of development (which involves conceptual elaboration), including the application of wrathful activity. To give an analogy, if those who are trying to take a mountaintop mount elephants but fail to emerge victorious from the turmoil of battle, by dismounting and riding horses, they can emerge victorious. Therefore, according to the oral tradition of the great siddha Dechen Gönpo,[559] for some yogic practitioners who are involved in the stage of completion, there exist occasions when it is necessary for them to embark on the conduct involving conceptual elaboration, including the application of wrathful activity.

According to the explanatory styles of the majority of gurus in Tibet, the situation of a beginning practitioner is one of properly observing one’s ordinary and more extraordinary samaya commitments and vows and of striving at cultivating a spiritual path without committing any objectionable actions[560] specific to laypeople or monastics (whichever one is); this is what these masters mean by “the conduct of complete nobility.”
This brings about the attainment of the signs of warmth during the meditative equipoise of the stage of completion. With this, the situation is such that one has some small measure of mastery in the experience of timeless awareness. One still does not overtly engage in the activities of a true yogic practitioner but continues to avoid committing any objectionable actions, while in secret one relies on a consort, the five kinds of meat, the five kinds of nectar, and so forth. One engages in all the countless aspects of conduct for a tantric practitioner, in what is meant by “concealed conduct,” or “secret conduct.”
This in turn brings stability in both meditative equipoise and postmeditation. With this, the situation is such that one has a great degree of mastery in the experience of timeless awareness. Accompanied by one’s consort, one adopts the attributes of a true yogic practitioner and overtly engages, in group practices, in all the countless aspects of the spiritual deportment of a tantric practitioner. This is what is known as “the spiritual deportment of pure awareness.”

Through the aforementioned process, one gains extremely stable realization and sublime capability, so that one is completely free of all the bonds of conditioned existence. One is free of apprehension concerning anything whatsoever. The conduct of overwhelming all counterproductive circumstances, [4.157.a] as well as the three states of conditioned existence, is what is meant by “total victory in all ways.” Although this is primarily done for the benefit of others who are to be guided, in the shorter term all modes of conduct provide enhancement that accords with the levels that are demarcated on the spiritual path, and in the longer term they bring one to the most sublime spiritual attainments that one seeks.

The Early Translation School’s tradition of explaining the correspondence between outer and inner levels is, generally speaking, as follows:
the cakra at the navel corresponds to the path of accumulation, that at the heart to the four phases of the path of linkage,
that at the throat to the path of seeing, and that at the crown of the head to the path of meditation.
In this interpretation, when the unity of subtle energy and mind associated with these four centers has become adaptable,
the qualities associated with these four paths arise in succession.

There are many variant treatments in the Early Translation School of the secret mantra approach, but generally speaking the tradition of explaining the correspondence between outer and inner levels is according to the vajra words spoken by Longchen Rabjam, who was Samantabhadra in person. He stated that in general the factor that led to the traversal of the paths is the twofold process, whereby the unity of subtle energy and mind becomes adaptable and refined. The adaptability comes when energy and mind penetrate the respective cakras; for there to be refinement, there must be a freeing of the blockages therein, including those of the minor subtle channels.
That is to say, with the unity of subtle energy and mind becoming adaptable in the secondary channels that branch out from the navel, one experiences the signs of meditative warmth associated with the three degrees (lesser, intermediate, and greater) of the path of accumulation. One beholds the presence of nirmāṇakāya buddhas. Through the accomplishment of the five deeper levels of insight, the levels of deeper discernment, and the minor supernormal powers, one is capable of emanation and transformation. [4.157.b]
With the unity of subtle energy and mind becoming adaptable in the dharmacakra in the heart center, one traverses the four phases of the path of linkage. Since one cultivates the five governing powers during the two phases of meditative warmth and the peak experience, the experience of timeless awareness as the subtle experience of manifestation (associated with the phase of warmth) is indicated by such signs as a nonconceptual state and the exhaustion of doubt and anxiety, while the experience of timeless awareness as the subtle experience of increase (associated with the phase of the peak experience) brings the attainment of stability in one’s fundamentally positive qualities. One realizes all phenomena to be similar to dream images. During the two phases of patient acceptance and the highest mundane experience, due to the five strengths there comes the experience of timeless awareness as the subtle experience of attainment (the orientation in the direction of the experience of suchness that is associated with the phase of patient acceptance), which prevents lower states of rebirth; and one gains the meditative absorption that follows immediately in the wake of that, that is, the experience of timeless awareness as the subtle experience of complete attainment, which is associated with the phase of the highest mundane experience. One’s fundamentally positive qualities do not contribute to anything other than liberation and enlightenment, and one gains meditative absorption, supernormal powers, and so forth in greater measure than previously.
With the unity of subtle energy and mind becoming adaptable in the sambhogacakra in the throat, one gains the first level of a spiritually advanced being (that is, the path of seeing) and mastery of the twelve hundredfold qualities. One gains the ability to journey to the pure realms of the sambhogakāya buddhas of the five family types and receive spiritual teachings there.
With the unity of subtle energy and mind becoming adaptable in the cakra of supreme bliss in the crown of the head, one attains the nine levels of the path of meditation, from the three divisions of the lesser degree, starting with the second level of “The Immaculate One” (the lesser division of the lesser degree), through the third, and so on until the tenth level of The Cloud of Dharma (the greater division of the greater degree).
In the cases of the foregoing levels, the subtle energy of timeless awareness penetrates the respective cakras in order to free the equally subtle blockages, while at the same time there occurs in those cakras what is termed the “withering,” or “incapacitation,” of the subtle energy that can promote afflictive states, together with its attendant subtle channels. On these levels, the twelve hundredfold qualities increase simultaneously with each step.
In addition, on the eighth level consciousness as the coordinating mental faculty is transformed, so that one gains mastery of the experience of nonconceptual awareness. On the ninth level, the avenues of consciousness associated with the five senses (which are involved with perception) are transformed; one gains mastery of the experience of pure realms. On the tenth level, consciousness as the basis of all ordinary experience is transformed, so that one gains consummate mastery of enlightened activity. [4.158.a] The foregoing constitute mastery of both the experience of timeless awareness and enlightened activity.
Thus, when the unity of subtle energy and mind associated with these four cakras becomes adaptable in stages, the qualities associated with the perfecting of the four paths of accumulation, linkage, seeing, and meditation arise in corresponding stages.

Within the central subtle channel there are twenty-one blockages of the two lateral channels (the rasanā and lalanā),[562] that bind one to cyclic existence. As one pursues meditation on the spiritual path, the unity of subtle energy and mind becomes adaptable in the nirmāṇacakra at the navel. At that point, the first pair of blockages is freed and one attains the first spiritual level. In like fashion, pairs of blockages are freed, leading to one’s attainment of each of the ten levels, so that one experiences the arising of their respective qualities. With the freeing of the last two blockages, the sublime level of the vajra pinnacle above the crown of the head (the “epitome of the sixth family”[563]) is attained. The Pinnacle of Definitive Expression states:
Blockages in the rasanā, the lalanā, and the avadhūti channels
create the perceptions of cyclic existence, which are based on confusion.
When these are freed, there is timeless awareness, which is nirvāṇa.[564]
The foregoing points are the interpretation of the Omniscient Lord of Dharma,[565] who synthesized the main principles underlying the intent found in the sūtras and tantras, the Old School and the Newer Schools of Tibetan Buddhism.[566]

In the extensive lineage of the Early Translation School, renowned as that of the “three yogas,” one approach in particular is that of Mahāyoga (which is based on the tantras), which is the tradition of Vajrasattva entitled the Web of Magical Display, the fundamental cycle among those of eighteen major tantras.[567] According to this tradition, [4.158.b] as the Three Stages states:
It is taught that, in essence, one arouses five aspects of bodhicitta[568] through the three aspects of sublime intelligence.[569]
That is to say, the essence of this path comes about through five aspects of bodhicitta. As to the way in which one’s motivation awakens, there are said to be the following kinds of motivation: “motivation awakening on the level of the ground,” that is, when it awakens in the situation in which one has not yet embarked on any spiritual approach whatsoever; “motivation awakening on the level of the path,” when one first embarks on the approach of the śrāvaka or the pratyekabuddha and then abandons that path to embark on this approach; and “motivation awakening on the level of the fruition,” when one trains in the lower approaches up to their fruition and then embarks on this path of mantra.
As to the process whereby one’s motivation awakens:
▶ “bodhicitta as directed resolve” occurs when one’s mind is free of the fixed opinions found in lower approaches (such as those of ordinary individuals, who are benighted by nature, or those who hold extreme views, who are benighted by design) and instead directs itself toward the Mahāyoga approach;
▶ “bodhicitta as aspiration” occurs when, on the foregoing basis, one aspires to thoroughly assimilate the meaning of the Mahāyoga teachings;
▶ “bodhicitta as application” occurs when one applies oneself to experiencing that meaning;
▶ “bodhicitta as abiding” occurs when, having embarked on this approach, one maintains one’s efforts to put the principle of inseparability into practice;[570] and
▶ “bodhicitta as consummation” occurs when maintaining this effort brings one to the consummation of the five paths.
Once one has aroused these five aspects, one has entered the direct path of the unsurpassable yoga that is far superior to the four alternatives: (1) the approach of gods and humans, which entails the resolve to gain release from lower states of rebirth; the approaches of (2) the śrāvaka and (3) the pratyekabuddha, which entail the resolve to gain release from cyclic existence; and (4) the approach of the transcendent perfections, which entails the resolve to gain release from the two extremes.[571] Having entered this direct path, through these five aspects of bodhicitta one brings to a conclusion both alternatives: the path of complete freedom (through the principle of sublime intelligence) and the path of certainty (through the principle of skillful means).

As for the first alternative, if we evaluate this path in a general way, once one has realized the view, one’s mind directs itself with resolve toward the meditative absorption of suchness.[572] Then one develops the aspiration to experience the illusoriness of things. That leads to one’s application to meditating on the single form of the deity. [4.159.a] One abides in the spiritual practice focusing on the elaborate version of the maṇḍala and the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual. And one brings this process to consummation on the four levels of a master of awareness.
If we evaluate this alternative solely in terms of factors that are still corruptible,[573] three aspects pertain to the view: directed resolve; aspiration; and application. Abiding pertains to the four steps from the meditative absorption of suchness up to and including the elaborate version of the maṇḍala.[574] Consummation pertains to the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual.
The foregoing discussion illustrates how each of the five paths in fact entails these five aspects of bodhicitta.

</d>
<d e="2">
As for the second alternative, there is a process whereby the mere onset of a directed stirring of bindu within the centers of the subtle channels brings about the arousal of bliss: this constitutes bodhicitta as directed resolve. The former moment of bliss fades, and one applies oneself to the succeeding moment: this constitutes bodhicitta as application. The subtle channels and bindu of one’s body abide in their natural condition, so that the bliss that has awakened abides without ceasing: this constitutes bodhicitta as abiding. Taking the former moment of bliss as one’s frame of reference, one aspires to the succeeding moment of bliss: this constitutes bodhicitta as aspiration. Through the process of bindu descending and being reversed, bodhicitta resides, shifting back and forth, in the tips of the channels in the vajra and lotus: this constitutes bodhicitta as a process of shifting.
It is said that the foregoing factors define someone following this path, from the point of view that they are the bases on which the five aspects of bodhicitta are awakened. However, they define the essence of that path from the standpoint of what is awakened.

Generally speaking, in the context of the spiritual path there are four alternatives, depending on the presence or absence of corruptibility and the possibility for regression. The alternative that addresses both corruptibility and the possibility of regression constitutes the four yogic practices of the path of accumulation through which one traverses this path: supreme emptiness, compassion, illusoriness, and the elaborations based on the single form of the deity.
In conjunction with this, the alternative of there being corruptibility but not the possibility for regression constitutes the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual, which is the path of linkage that will be discussed next; this is because it is the pathway without obstacles, linking one directly with the incorruptible state, in which conduct is carried out on specific occasions. [4.159.b]
The alternative of there being the possibility for regression but not corruptibility constitutes the case, for example, of an arhat, a spiritually advanced being who has already passed through the lower paths, being involved in the path of accumulation according to the mantra approach; this is because there exists the possibility that such a one might regress, due to an attitude based on self-centered thinking.
The absence of both corruptibility and the possibility for regression will be discussed in the next section. In the foregoing alternatives, corruptibility is explained as being of two types: primary and secondary. The primary type consists of the karma that entails deeply ingrained afflictive states, which causes one to fall into, and move within, the corruptible states of the three realms. The secondary type consists of three factors of corruptibility: the corruptibility involved in the process of rebirth, of physical embodiment being perpetuated without one having any control; the corruptibility involved in states of existence, in which pleasant and unpleasant states are experienced without one having any control; and the corruptibility involved in the physical body, in that the body must be discarded without one having any control.

In the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual, which involves corruptibility but not the possibility for regression, the foundation is established through the five aspects of excellence.[575] The mainstream practice is carried out through the four branches of approach and accomplishment.[576] By practicing in this way (including any supportive rituals) for six months, one traverses the pathway without obstacles, which links one directly with the state that is not subject to degeneration, so that the fruition of a master of awareness is accomplished.
For a practitioner of the stage of development, the more common spiritual attainments (the distinctive factors of karmamudrā or jñānamudrā) link one with the state of a master of awareness in either the realm of desire or the realm of form, whichever is appropriate. One practicing the stage of completion may employ any of the alternative modes (elaborate, unelaborate, or extremely unelaborate) in the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual, using the four yogic practices of supreme emptiness and the rest. Depending on one’s level of acumen (keen, middling, or dull) one practices, respectively for six months, one year and two months, or one year and four months. This links one with the fruition states that result from this path, that is, the four levels of a master of awareness,[577] which are themselves subsumed within the three paths of seeing, meditation, and consummation; these constitute the paths that involve neither corruptibility nor the possibility for regression.

Although those on the path of seeing are alike in their realization of the actual nature of phenomena, due to the degree of power and strength of their minds they are of two kinds: masters of awareness still subject to the complete maturation of karma[579] (for whom the residual traces of their bodies have not been refined away by the experience of timeless awareness) and masters of awareness with power over longevity[580] (for whom the residual traces have been refined away). The Short Exposition of the Path states:
Since capability may or may not have been gained,
the path of seeing can occur in two ways.[581]
Masters of awareness who are still subject to the complete maturation of karma have gained stability in the meditative absorption of elaborating the single form of the deity, and so they engage in the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual to some degree (whether ideal, middling, or minimum). Due to this, they have the three qualities of one still subject to the complete maturation of karma:
(1) they are not yet free of the flesh and blood body that is the result of that complete maturation;
(2) their minds have matured into the experience of the utterly lucid embodiment of the deity; and
(3) they have the certainty that, in whatever way they wish, they will be brought to the state of masters of mahāmudrā awareness immediately after becoming free of the confines of the physical body.[582] The Graduated Path states:
While the mind holds the image of the deity’s form,
when one becomes free of the constraints of the physical body,
the symbolic embodiment of the deity becomes evident:
this refers to those “still subject to complete maturation.”[583]
As for the conduct in which they engage, for their own benefit such activities as those associated with the configuration of the maṇḍala serve to perfect their twofold spiritual development, while they ensure complete benefit for others by way of their mastery of the four kinds of enlightened activities.[584] And being endowed with the completely pure level of the incorruptible divine eye[585] and other powers, they ensure benefit through their actual form, but only throughout a single world system,[586] for the way in which they cause emanated forms to manifest is only somewhat similar to that of masters of awareness with power over longevity.

Generally speaking, power over longevity comes about in one of four ways: (1) by relying on medicines resulting from an alchemical process; (2) by relying on the process of bindu descending and being held; (3) by relying on the “lamp,” the focal center of subtle energy; and (4) through the final completion of the sublime spiritual path.
Of these four alternatives, here we are concerned with the latter, which is far superior to the former three. One engages in the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual with a mind that is distinguished by its familiarity with realization born of the view and meditative absorption that come about through the three kinds of sublime intelligence. Due to this practice, one brings to consummation the realization of the first spiritual level, so that all that is corruptible is finished with. One’s mind and body have both matured into the experience of the utterly lucid embodiment of the deity, so that one has the vajrakāya, which is unborn and indestructible and endowed with the distinctive qualities of the rainbow body, such as subtlety and lightness.[588] One is a master of awareness with power over longevity through one’s final completion of the sublime spiritual path. The Graduated Path states:
Having seen what is truly meaningful and taken one’s involvement to its conclusion,
through the spiritual attainments of practicing the conduct of the gaṇacakra,
one finishes with all that is corruptible in the components of one’s body and the process of rebirth.
One has a vajra body and is of the type with power over longevity.[589]
As for the conduct in which these masters engage, for their own benefit they refine away the omnipresent distortions in their makeup, while for the benefit of others they act for the sake of beings through the four kinds of spiritual miracles,[590] the four kinds of enlightened activities, and so forth. As for their attributes, the Heart Essence of Secrets states:
Although they do indeed take completely pure rebirths
as human beings, or gods, or even as Brahmā,
they abide on the special spiritual levels.[591]
These are, in fact, the attributes of their emanated forms; these masters are, in essence, such that the physical bodies they had in their most recent lifetimes have been carried forward as vajra bodies, keeping the same forms as the previous physical bases, but in general endowed with the six levels of deeper discernment.
In particular, at this point they have left the domain of ordinary consciousness and entered the domain of timeless awareness, in which what is perceived are awareness’s own manifestations. It is due to this key point that their visual consciousness alone can not only see forms, [4.161.a] but can also perform the functions of all five sense consciousnesses, also hearing sounds, smelling odors, tasting flavors, and being aware of tactile sensations. The same principle applies to the other four sense consciousnesses, so that there are twenty-five aspects of sense consciousness with which these masters are able to ensure benefit within a sphere of influence that is equal to a billion world systems.
For their own benefit, they are brought gradually or all at once to the state of either a master of mahāmudrā awareness[592] or a master of spontaneously present awareness,[593] whichever is appropriate. There may also be those whose minds are so vast that they are brought to the ultimate level of buddhahood.

There is a momentum to one’s familiarization with the meditative absorption of elaborating the single form of the deity; and there is an unwavering state of meditative absorption that is due to the object of meditation becoming fully evident once one has become purified of the omnipresent obscurations. These factors refine away indwelling distortions, after which one’s own mind fully experiences the state of mahāmudrā. Thus, on the path of meditation one becomes a master of mahāmudrā awareness, endowed with an illusory embodiment of timeless awareness. The Graduated Path states:
One’s own mind is the supreme seal, mahāmudrā,
the deity that becomes fully evident through meditation,
with major and minor marks of more common and sublime attainment.
This is sambhogakāya, the second[594]—family of mahāmudrā masters….
…Endowed with the attributes of an illusory embodiment of timeless awareness,
the ordinary elements are freed within the vajra body.[595]
That is to say, beginning with the second level, that of The Stainless One, up to and including the pathway of complete freedom on the tenth level, these masters are subsumed within five families: vajra, cakra (wheel), ratna (jewel), padma (lotus), and karma (activity). The former source states:
They become masters of awareness:
vajra, wheel, jewel, lotus, and sword.[596]
In regard to this passage, it is said that the term “master of awareness of the vajra” refers to those from the second to the fifth level because it is the vajra state of timeless awareness, born of realization, that does away with the more obvious levels of obscuration. [4.161.b] The term “master of awareness of the wheel” refers to two levels: the sixth because one engages in conduct primarily focusing on the transcendent perfection of sublime intelligence and presents spiritual teachings; and the seventh because one’s skill in means becomes ongoing, like a wheel. The term “master of awareness of the jewel” refers to the eighth level, on which one gains mastery of the experience of nonconceptual timeless awareness.[597] The term “master of awareness of the lotus” refers to the ninth level since one refines one’s sphere of experience and acts for the benefit of beings without attachment.[598] And the term “master of awareness of the sword” refers to the tenth level because one ensures benefit for countless beings through an abundance of enlightened activities.[599] But there are, in fact, varying ways of classifying these demarcations according to the spiritual levels.
The attributes of the deity’s form (that is, of primordial unity) are the major and minor marks that express the very embodiment of complete perfection. For one’s own benefit, this refines away indwelling distortions, while for the benefit of others one can manifest emanated forms to guide beings in any way possible, even such forms as those of hunters and prostitutes. The Graduated Path states:
While not straying from the context of meditative equipoise,…
…they ensure guidance with emanated forms,
such as those of hunters and prostitutes.[600]
As for the scope and beneficial function of their deeper levels of discernment, they share the qualities of the twenty-five aspects of sense consciousness with masters of awareness with power over longevity; but in this case these aspects are distinctly clearer and more stable, and these masters act for the benefit of beings who are on a scale equal to that of a sambhogakāya pure realm.

During the path of meditation, the power of one’s familiarity with what took place on the path of seeing is perfected, so that the three kinds of sublime intelligence purify one of indwelling distortions, such that one is by nature poised to abide on the path of consummation, without actually having yet attained the level of buddhahood. According to the enlightened intent underlying the lower and higher classes of tantra, they may be classified into three families, five families, and other models. In this case, however, we are concerned with the totality of the five spontaneously present kāyas, [4.162.a] bearing the attributes of supreme Vajradhara and functioning as regent of the sixth family, such as Guhyapati, or the Lord of Secrets.[601]
As for the conduct in which these masters engage, for their own benefit there is the vajralike samādhi; this is the inner factor contributing to manifest enlightenment that refines away the most subtle cognitive obscurations, which are the distortions of the three successive steps of subtle experience. For the benefit of others, in postmeditation they act to benefit beings in a manner somewhat similar to that of buddhas. As for their emanated forms, they manifest these in ways that approximate those of the sublime nirmāṇakāya manifestations, such as performing the twelve enlightened deeds.[602] As for the scope and beneficial function of their levels of deeper discernment, the scope is that of the sublime intelligence that discerns things in all their multiplicity, somewhat similar to that of victorious ones; this ensures any appropriate degree of benefit on a scale as pervasive as that of space. The Graduated Path states:
Thus, pure timeless awareness itself constitutes the totality of the five spontaneously present kāyas,
those of the vajra holders.
Without straying from this state, spontaneous and uniform,
they abide in nonconceptuality,
and having done away with latent tendencies,
in a few steps they are the highest masters of awareness.[603]

A master of awareness who is still subject to the complete maturation of karma is functionally equivalent to a bodhisattva on the path of seeing (which is to say, the level of The Utterly Joyful One) in the caused-based approach. Furthermore, masters of awareness with power over longevity and the other kinds of masters are functionally equivalent to bodhisattvas on the first, eighth, and tenth levels of the caused-based approach (although even given these correspondences concerning the degree of progress on the path, the enlightened intent and the deeds and conduct of masters of awareness are far superior to those of bodhisattvas for numerous reasons). Thus, it is held that the eighth level of the cause-based approach is equal to that of a master of awareness with power over longevity, the tenth level to that of a master of mahāmudrā awareness, and the level of no more training (called “Total Illumination”) to that of a master of spontaneously present awareness. The Short Exposition of the Path states:
Furthermore, the first master is equal in circumstances to the first level,
while the sublime master of the second kind
is equal in circumstances to the bodhisattva of the eighth level.
The third kind is definitely equal in circumstances to the tenth level, [4.162.b]

As to what conduct constitutes in essence, the Three Stages states:
Because there are distinct states of meditative absorption,
conduct complies with this, and one engages in it in accord with the scriptural sources.[605]
That is to say, conduct is any action committed by someone on the spiritual path through any of the three avenues of being, when that action is influenced by special skillful means. In this regard, conduct is of two kinds: conduct during meditative equipoise, and conduct during postmeditation. As for conduct during meditative equipoise, one engages in conduct through the one-pointed meditative stability specific to any of the five paths or the four levels of masters of awareness.
Here, though, we are primarily concerned with postmeditation. As to the way in which one engages in such conduct, one involves oneself by integrating sublime intelligence, imbued with the view of the lack of identity, with the skillful means of supreme compassion. It is this involvement that purifies one of distortions affecting the three avenues of one’s being.
As for the derivation of the term, “conduct” corresponds to the Sanskrit term carya,[606] and connotes that one carries out activities by engaging in the conduct of the mantra approach, in order to make one’s physical, verbal, and mental actions truly meaningful.
If we analyze this conduct, generally speaking, it is to thoroughly purify one’s body, speech, and mind. But if we elaborate on this slightly, when one is a beginning practitioner one has not yet gained stability in meditative absorption, and so one trains assiduously and carefully, remaining heedful, so that one’s behavior is like that of a “youthful” spiritual practitioner.[607] The Pinnacle states:
Until one has gained stability,
one is unsullied by objectionable actions
and maintains the three levels of ordination.[608]
That is to say, in a heedful manner one guards the realization one gains during meditative equipoise, while in between practice sessions one carries out the ten kinds of spiritual practice[609] and other postmeditation activities. [4.163.a] Once one has gained some small degree of stability in one’s meditative absorption and so is able to blend meditative equipoise with postmeditation awareness, one’s conduct is that of a “madman,” that is, conduct ensuring that one’s realization is able to stand up to any and all circumstances. And when one’s meditation absorption has become very stable and one’s realization does not undergo any fluctuation, one’s conduct is like that of a ruler holding the throne; one applies oneself solely to benefiting others. These are the three kinds of conduct.
More specifically, conduct is explained as being of two types: the spiritual deportment of the path of skillful means, and the heedful conduct of the path of freedom. In the case of the latter, there are eight forms of conduct. Seven of these are the conduct of people who progress in a developmental manner: (1) conduct based on faith and diligence; (2) conduct in accord with sublime intelligence; (3) conduct in accord with skillful means; (4) conduct that is focused on one point; (5) conduct that is involved with elaboration; (6) conduct that is involved with group practice; and (7) conduct that involves miraculous powers.
The eighth kind is the conduct of people who progress in a nonlinear fashion, which is superb conduct free of moral judgments.
The first aspect, that of conduct based on faith and diligence, applies to the situation of someone coming to a definitive understanding of the view. With three aspects of faith (that is, faith based on awe, a desire to emulate, and trust[610]), one engages in hearing and contemplating spiritual teachings, pursuing these to their conclusion with unflagging diligence.
The second aspect, that of conduct in accord with sublime intelligence, applies to the situation of someone experiencing supreme emptiness. In meditative equipoise, one maintains the meditative absorption of supreme emptiness. In postmeditation, one engages in conduct in the aftermath of that.
The third aspect, that of conduct in accord with skillful means, applies to the situation of someone experiencing compassion and the illusoriness of things. In meditative equipoise, one cultivates illusion-like compassion toward all beings included in the six classes, without naïve attachment to any of them. In postmeditation, one views everything within one’s sphere of perception as being like an illusion.
The fourth aspect, that of conduct focused on one point, applies to the situation of someone meditating on the single form of the deity. In meditative equipoise, one meditates on the single form of the deity (peaceful if a peaceful deity practice, wrathful if a wrathful one), the enlightened embodiment expressing the primordial unity of emptiness and compassion. In postmeditation, too, one maintains the continuity of that practice.
The fifth aspect, that of conduct involved with elaboration, [4.163.b] applies to the situation of someone meditating on the elaborated maṇḍala of the deity. In both meditative equipoise and postmeditation, one trains in increasing the previous single form of the deity so that the vision of the deity unfolds, becoming the manifestation of a maṇḍala of deities, with a principal figure or figures and the retinue, as an expression of this primordial unity that one integrates continuously into one’s awareness as a naturally arising manifestation.
The sixth aspect, that of conduct involved with group practice, applies to the situation of someone engaging in the group practice of the gaṇacakra ritual. In both meditative equipoise and postmeditation, one engages without interruption in conduct that involves five ritual elements. The Graduated Path states:
One engages in conduct that involves five ritual elements;
there are two kinds of actual offerings.[611]
As for the five ritual elements mentioned, the same source describes them as follows:
Raiment, ornaments, food and drink, song and chant, and dance—
if one engages wholeheartedly in these as the massing clouds of the gaṇacakra,
knowing them to embody Hūṃ,
the maṇḍala that is the source of marvels is delighted.[612]
The seventh aspect, that of conduct involving miraculous powers, applies to the situations of the four levels of masters of awareness. Thus, there are four contexts: that of a master of awareness still subject to the complete maturation of karma; that of a master of awareness with power over longevity; that of a master of mahāmudrā awareness; and that of a master of spontaneously present awareness.
In the first context, for one’s own benefit one uses the activities associated with the configuration of the maṇḍala to perfect one’s twofold spiritual development. For the benefit of others, one ensures complete benefit through the four kinds of enlightened activities.
In the second context, for one’s own benefit one refines one’s dynamic experience of pure awareness by cultivating one’s view, so that omnipresent distortions are refined away. For the benefit of others, one ensures benefit through the four kinds of spiritual miracles, the four kinds of enlightened activities, and other means.
In the third context, for one’s own benefit one refines away indwelling distortions. For the benefit of others, without straying from the context of one’s enlightened intent, one acts for the welfare of all, in impure and relatively pure states, through myriad emanations.
In the fourth context, for one’s own benefit one relies on the victorious ones of the five families and others, refining away the cognitive obscurations. For the benefit of others, one manifests the myriad deeds of the nirmāṇakāya, such as the twelve enlightened deeds, in buddha realms without limit, and acts as a codifier of the secret tantras.
The eighth form of conduct is that of people who progress on the path of freedom in a nonlinear fashion. [4.164.a] This is superb conduct, for in postmeditation awareness one has no fixed conceptual framework, has no attachment, and is free of any deliberate effort or reifying concepts. As the All-Embracing Intent states:
Engage in yogic conduct with no fixed conceptual framework;
although one engages in all conduct in such a manner,
ultimate reality is the most sublime form of conduct.[613]
Which is to say, the decisive experience of this comes about through the foregoing aspects of conduct.

In the Anuyoga tradition, generally speaking, those whose minds are of the highest level, and very powerful, reach the conclusion of this path by accomplishing all the states of realization, and the familiarity thereof, in one fell swoop. So they are saved any of the effort involved in traversing the paths and levels in succession. Those on both the intermediate and the lesser levels traverse the four paths that require training (including the ten spiritual levels) either in succession or in a nonlinear fashion, whichever is appropriate under the circumstances; this brings them to the final fruition state, the path of no more training. The word “moreover” signifies that this line of verse is grammatically connected in with the following one.

In the first place, there are two levels that constitute the path of accumulation: “the level of unpredictable change”[617] and “the level of the basis of reliance.”[618] They are subsumed within “the yoga of the mind’s directed intent,”[619] in which the embodiment of the deity is an expression of one’s dedicated intent. This phase ensures the accomplishment of the more common spiritual attainments, such as the deeper levels of insight and the levels of deeper discernment.

Next, three levels (the eighth, the “level of abiding without change”;[627] the ninth, the “level of the permeation of the actual nature of phenomena”;[628] and the tenth, the “level of the universal range of perfection”[629]) constitute the path of consummation, subsumed within what is called “the yoga of perfecting supreme dynamic energy.”[630] The outcome of this is the path of no more training: by one’s relying on the pathway without obstacles that lies at the very threshold of enlightenment, one follows the path of supreme passion that confers empowerment into the fruition state, the empowerment that refines away the subtle habitual patterns associated with the progression of the three successive steps of subtle experience.[631] This brings mastery of the state of the glorious Samantabhadra; which is to say, the totality of the four kāyas and five aspects of timeless awareness, the very essence of spontaneous presence, and the inseparability of the twenty-five factors of the fruition state[632] of primordial unity that requires no more training. [4.165.a] Thus, one can act to benefit those to be guided through enlightened activities that are ever-present, all-pervasive, and spontaneously accomplished. The Synopsis states:
The fruition, in truth, is perfect buddhahood.
There are countless factors subsumed within twenty-five
of form, speech, mind, qualities, and activity.
This is omniscience, spontaneously present and complete.[633]
Each of the ten levels has its corresponding set of circumstances, such as those levels that pertain to the situation in which one directs one’s will. In these ten sets of circumstances, one meditates with a process specific to that level (a process that accords to some degree with the actual nature of phenomena, the very essence of things just as it is), so that one progresses in stages. Each of the ten levels has its specific factor to be refined away; these are, respectively, (1) the more obvious and (2) the more subtle habitual patterns of karma, which function as conditioning factors;[634] (3) the more obvious, (4) the less obvious, and (5) the more subtle habitual patterns that account for overt behavior; (6) the omnipresent factors;[635] (7) the indwelling obscurations;[636] and (8) the more obvious, (9) the less obvious, and (10) the more subtle latent obscurations.[637] One is purified of these successively and so brought to higher and higher levels through the ten aspects of bodhicitta (bodhicitta as directedness and so forth). The traversal of these ten aspects is discussed at great length in the principal sūtra, explanatory tantras, and pith instructions[638]—for example, the second chapter of the source tantra the All-Embracing Intent—in conjunction with ten analogies, such as that of a tiny star.

The paths and levels of Ati transcend developmental effort.
Nonetheless, within the four stages of empowerment found in the extraordinary secret cycles,
some sixteen subdivisions of the aspects of manifest realization are differentiated.
The same is true for the levels of dedicated interest, involvement, transformation, and decisiveness.
Together these are thirty-two factors. Timeless awareness is analyzed into four aspects [4.165.b] of abiding,
awakening, attainment, and arising, giving sixty-four factors that contribute
to the perfection of the sublime level of Vajradhara.

In this effortless approach of Atiyoga, the state of utter lucidity is made fully evident in one’s experience, and so one is already engaged in lower approaches (primordially so); this approach transcends the concerted effort required to traverse some graduated path, or to follow some step-by-step process of refinement. So the Dzogchen, or Great Perfection, approach is said to consist of a single level and to require no process of refining away or traversing anything, for the intention underlying this statement is that when the higher approach is completed, the lower ones are completed as a matter of course. The single level referred to is that of pure and spontaneously present awareness. As the All-Creating Monarch states:
The level of pure and spontaneously perfect awareness, uncontrived and unrefined.[640]
Nevertheless, even in this specific path it is necessary for one to be purified of distortions affecting the three avenues of one’s being, of the physical body, of thoughts stirring the mind, and of the more obvious expressions of the interaction between subtle energy and mind. When one is purified of these, the paths and levels of lower approaches are completed as a matter of course; therefore, while the Dzogchen approach parallels these lower approaches, it is far superior to them, for on its single level are all the factors of manifest realization that can be differentiated as aspects of timeless awareness and the qualities of enlightenment. A systematic presentation of these factors is discussed in the tantras of the extraordinary secret cycles. According to these discussions, generally speaking, the bases on which this path is completed are the four stages of empowerment, the elaborate one and the rest.[641] Within these four stages of empowerment, however, there are some sixteen subdivisions (the elaborate subdivision of the elaborate empowerment and the other subdivisions) that are discussed below; these serve as the bases for perfecting the qualities associated with the causal, or more ordinary, levels.
There are also sixteen subdivisions to four distinctive levels: those of dedicated interest; engagement; transformation; and decisiveness. Each of these has its internal subdivisions, such as the dedicated interest of dedicated interest. If we add the former and the latter subdivisions together, we arrive at a total of thirty-two factors, which are said to serve as the causes for one to attain Vajradhara’s thirty-two distinctive and sublime marks of perfection.
In the case of each of the sixteen subdivisions of the special levels, timeless awareness can be analyzed into four aspects termed “abiding,” “awakening,” “attainment,” and “arising.” This gives a total of sixty-four factors, which are described as perfecting the sublime levels of Vajradhara. [4.166.a]
Generally speaking, the way in which the path is completed through the four stages of empowerment is as follows: The elaborate empowerment serves as the basis for the attainment of the qualities that are associated with completing the twelve steps on the path of accumulation. The unelaborate empowerment serves as the basis for completing the four phases that anticipate the decisive breakthrough on the path of linkage. The extremely unelaborate empowerment serves as the basis for completing the path of seeing. The utterly unelaborate empowerment serves as the basis for completing the nine levels of the path on meditation.
The sixteen subdivisions within the four stages of empowerment serve to purify one on the outer level of sixteen influences exerted by the elements, on the inner level of sixteen thought patterns in the mind, and on the secret level of sixteen unstable fluctuations of bindu. This being the case, these sixteen empowerments are acknowledged since they contribute to one’s gaining the certainty of abiding on the corresponding sixteen levels of the unsurpassable approach.
As to how the sixteen empowerments correspond to the four special levels, the elaborate subdivision of the elaborate empowerment corresponds to the special level on which one is endowed with dedicated interest: one is distinguished by one’s yearning and merit. The unelaborate subdivision of this empowerment corresponds to the level of pure engagement: by relying on a certainty born of one’s faith, one becomes involved with a growing sense of self-determination. The extremely unelaborate subdivision of this empowerment corresponds to the level of the transformation of things into their purest form: one is no longer caught up in the bonds of ordinary body and speech. The utterly unelaborate subdivision of this empowerment corresponds to the level of the decisive termination of karma: one is no longer caught up in conceptual structures and cyclic existence. A similar correspondence applies to the subdivisions of the remaining three empowerments.
As to the detailed analysis of the sixteen levels and what they constitute in essence:
(1) the dedicated phase of dedicated interest constitutes the certainty born of faith;
(2) the involved phase of dedicated interest constitutes the certainty of compassion;
(3) the transformative phase of dedicated interest constitutes the application of skillful means;
(4) the decisive phase of dedicated interest constitutes the decisiveness concerning what is truly meaningful that is arrived at through sublime intelligence;
(5) the dedicated phase of engagement constitutes a dedicated interest in developing calm abiding;
(6) the involved phase of engagement constitutes engagement in developing deeper insight;
(7) the transformative phase of engagement constitutes the transformation of the realization gained in meditative equipoise into distinct states;
(8) the decisive phase of engagement constitutes the decisive arrest of thoughts stirring in the mind during postmeditation;
(9) the dedicated phase of transformation constitutes freedom from fixation on clothing oneself;
(10) the involved phase of transformation constitutes freedom from fixation on food; [4.166.b]
(11) the transformative phase of transformation constitutes freeing the dream state into that of utter lucidity;
(12) the decisive phase of transformation constitutes freedom from habitual patterns and afflictive states;
(13) the dedicated phase of decisiveness is one in which, due to one’s conduct, one is no longer caught in cyclic existence;
(14) the involved phase of decisiveness is one in which, due to one’s meditation, one abides in meditative stability;
(15) the transformative phase of decisiveness is one in which, due to one’s view, one is no longer caught up in perceptions based on confusion but can transform one’s experience of the three realms into that of the three kāyas; and
(16) the decisive phase of decisiveness constitutes the fruition state, in which one eradicates both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa at one and the same time.

The four levels referred to are those of the level of immersion in genuine being,[642] the level of supreme immersion, the level of immersion in analytical discernment, and the level of immersion in realization. In a general context, these are further divided into eight: two aspects, transformative or nontransformative, for each level. But they may be analyzed more precisely into four aspects for each level: The first level involves four subdivisions, termed “immersion in genuine being,” “immersion in genuine action,” “immersion in genuine conduct,” and “immersion in genuine transformation.” The second level involves four subdivisions, termed “the level of total immersion in genuine being,” “the level of immersion in genuine certainty of one’s natural state,” “the level of immersion in conceptual elaboration,” and “the level of immersion in perfect freedom from anything needing to be done.” The third level involves four subdivisions, termed “the level of symbol,” “the level of meaning,” “the level of the inseparability of symbol and meaning,” and “the level of their distinctness.” The fourth level involves four subdivisions, termed “the level of exercising miraculous powers,” “the level of special realization,” “the level of manifest onset,” and “the level of ascertaining the hero’s birthright.”
Taken together, these subdivisions constitute some sixteen levels. On these sixteen levels, moreover, on the first level one can demonstrate seven miraculous powers of discerning consciousness; from this level up to the fifteenth, one can demonstrate seven further powers on each level; and someone on the sixteenth level is capable of demonstrating nineteen kinds of spiritual miracles. Thus, one gains mastery of more than one hundred miraculous powers. [4.167.a] These are called “the levels of masters of awareness.” They are causal levels that are attained through one’s recollection in the wake of the four stages of empowerment.

In each of the four visions (that of the direct experience of the actual nature of phenomena and the rest[643]) there are four stages: those of manifestation, increase, attainment, and complete attainment. So there are, in fact, some sixteen stages of visionary experience; these serve as measures of one’s experience maturing into that of timeless awareness, and so they are termed “the fruition levels of the protector Vajradhara.”
These sixteen stages of visionary experience are, in their essence, as follows:
As for the vision of the direct experience of the actual nature of phenomena:[644]
(1) one’s eyes allow the onset of its manifestation;
(2) the very nature of the visual faculty constitutes a further degree of increase;
(3) the perception of the “chain formation”[645] constitutes its attainment; and
(4) the gaining of familiarity with that constitutes a further degree of attainment.
As for the vision of the enrichment of meditative experience:[646]
(5) light constitutes the onset of its manifestation;
(6) spheres of light constitute a further degree of increase;
(7) the clear vision of spheres of five colors constitutes its attainment; and
(8) their vibrating and shimmering, giving off rays of light, constitutes a further degree of attainment.
As for the vision of pure awareness reaching full expression:[647]
(9) enlightened forms constitute the onset of its manifestation;
(10) the appearance of these as masculine and feminine forms in union constitutes a further degree of increase;
(11) their arrangement in groupings of five constitutes its attainment; and
(12) the perfect appearance of the maṇḍala constitutes a further degree of attainment.
As for the vision of resolution:[648]
(13) one’s awareness not remaining focused on the forms and the aspects of timeless awareness constitutes the onset of its manifestation;
(14) emptiness without any fixed reference point constitutes a further degree of increase;
(15) the inexpressible state constitutes its attainment; and
(16) the experience of the actual nature of phenomena, which cannot be objectified or found to exist as anything whatsoever, constitutes a further degree of attainment.
These, then, are the sixteen stages.

Thus, the sixteen stages that are termed “causal” or “fruition” levels, moreover, are complete in either of two situations: that of one’s gaining freedom in a body of light in this lifetime, and that of one’s gaining freedom in the intermediate state after death. Naturally Arising Awareness states:
What are termed “levels” do not, in fact, exist in and of themselves. In a single individual who has perceived truth the levels[649] are present, having been thus completed. When individuals who have been introduced to their true nature first perceive the truth, this arouses in them a sense of joy; this is the first level, that of The Utterly Joyful One.
Next, they understand what they perceive to be awareness’s own manifestation; they attain the second level, that of The Immaculate One.
Next, they become familiar with that recognition; they master the third level, that of The Illuminating One.
Next, having become familiar with that, they perceive the luminous visions; they master[650] the fourth level, that of The Radiant One.
Next, due to their familiarity with their perception of these visions of timeless awareness, they naturally refine away all[651] afflictive states and experience timeless awareness; they master the fifth level, that of The One Who Meets the Challenge.
Next, they experience a body formed of light becoming fully evident; they master the sixth level, that of The One Who Makes Evident.
Next, their familiarity reaches consummation, so that they have gone far beyond afflictive states; they master the seventh level, that of The One Who Has Gone Far.
Next, they do not waver[652] from that context[653]; they master the eighth level, that of The Immutable One.
Next, their qualities become perfected; they master the ninth level, that of The One of Brilliant Intelligence.
Next, their own awareness apprehends the visions of timeless awareness, leading to the experience of tranquillity. They see all phenomena to be like clouds and become familiar with this insight; they master the tenth level, that of The Cloud of Dharma.
The foregoing situation is of those individuals who have perceived truth but not yet cast off the physical envelope. Individuals who have cast this envelope off do not master[654] levels in quite this way. [4.168.a] Having brought perceptions based on confusion to an end, they experience visions of forms in group formations; they master the eleventh level, that of Total Illumination.
Next, having no attachment to these visions, they are untarnished by any phenomenon experienced outwardly or inwardly; they master the twelfth level, that of The Lotus-Bearing One.
Next, they experience rays of light shining from their heart centers, manifesting as clusters of five-colored light, like circles spinning, high up in space; they master the thirteenth level, that of The Supreme Assembly of the Circles of Letters.
Next, they abide in the visions of timeless awareness; they master the fourteenth level, that of Supreme Meditative Absorption.[655]
Next, they gain certainty concerning the level of spontaneous presence; they attain the fifteenth level, that of The Vajra Holder.
Then, they comprehend the level of original purity to be tranquil timeless awareness and that there is nothing higher than this; they attain the sixteenth level, that of Unsurpassable Timeless Awareness.[656]
As this passage indicates, one is brought in stages from the first level, that of The Utterly Joyful One (the direct experience that constitutes perception of the Truth of the Path), to the eleventh, that of Total Illumination, and thence to the special levels such as The Lotus-Bearing One. However, although they are all approached in a similar manner from the point of view of how they manifest in one’s experience, fundamentally these levels are distinguished from the perspective of their being aspects of the manifestation of a single level of utterly lucid awareness, which involves neither training nor traversal. Given that there is just a single level in actuality, that of awareness, in order for one to attain the buddhahood of Vajradhara there is no need to train deliberately and specifically in the causal levels. These levels are not the ten actual bodhisattva levels. Therefore, according to the ordinary approach there is a way in which one attains each level through a developmental process of cause and effect, while in the outer and inner tantric approaches these are attained through effort and achievement in the stages of development and completion; in this case, however, there is nothing to attain or in which to train. The same source states:
Therefore, although there is an inconceivable number of beings, there is no more than a single timeless awareness that is their essence. What are termed “paths” and “levels” do not, in fact, exist in and of themselves. [4.168.b] One should understand that there is no need to train on, or traverse, paths and levels.[657]

Notwithstanding the foregoing discussion, in this approach the key point of the exceptionally superior instructions involved allow the subtle energies to settle into a naturally quiescent state. This leads to a natural purification of the respective subtle energies in the secondary channels, at which point the subtle energy of timeless awareness that is associated with the subtle pathways of light is naturally lucid in its natural state, so that there is only pure perception, that is, the enlightened forms and pure realms that constitute the visions of timeless awareness. There is no opportunity for perceptions based on confusion to arise, only that which is of the nature of light. Pathways of light in the central channel expand, so that those factors that take the form of blockages in the subtle channels gradually dissolve into light; the benefit of this is felt in manifest aspects of one’s realization arising as awareness’s own manifestations.
With the first pair of blockages dissolving into light, what one perceives outwardly is the arising, within a field of light, of hundreds of pure buddha realms, each giving off rays of light. One “journeys” to them in the sense that they are subsumed within awareness as its own manifestations. As one’s body moves, this causes a hundred realms to move. Inwardly, one enters into, and arises out of, a hundred nonconceptual states of meditative absorption on the actual nature of phenomena. As the foregoing indicates, one experiences such qualities as the twelve distinctive hundredfold qualities. Extraordinary indications of one’s realization increase more and more and, due to this enhancement, exceptionally superior manifest aspects of one’s realization are experienced as arising effortlessly, as awareness’s own manifestations.

The tantra Naturally Arising Awareness discusses some twelve themes of conduct, such as the “yoga of words on the level of characterizing things.”[658] It is said that the first eight of these apply to those who have not yet gained the level of primordial freedom, [4.169.a] while the last four (the yoga of the consummate fruition state, the yoga of authentic meaning, the yoga of consummate freedom, and the yoga of the perfection of all that is to be done) apply to the attainment of that level of freedom. The significance of what such a yogic practitioner is putting into practice lies in the four yogas of continually ensuring view, meditation, conduct, and fruition. The way in which these four are put into practice entails some twenty topics, which are discussed in the tantras the Array of Inset Gems and the Heaped Jewels.
Here, however, let us speak concisely about conduct in the sense of an ongoing immersion in genuine being. In this case, there are three ways to see conduct as timely in that it defines (and is defined by) one’s level of progress:
(1) the conduct of a beginning practitioner is that of training gradually in the ten kinds of spiritual practice;
(2) the conduct that delineates the gap between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is that of distinguishing saṃsāra from nirvāṇa, by putting these profound instructions into practice and by engaging in physical, verbal, and mental conduct as preliminaries to the third empowerment; one then restores oneself through the conduct of settling into a state of genuine being; and
(3) the conduct of pursuing the path of spiritual deportment is explained in the tantra the Conjunction of Sun and Moon in twenty-one ways.[659]
Of these twenty-one aspects of conduct, in this present context one engages primarily in the first seven aspects (for example, conduct like that of a bee).
In this regard, the first aspect is that of gathering all spiritual methods together and pursuing the goal of practicing them in an integrated manner in light of one’s immediate experience. This is like a bee seeking out its hive. By hearing teachings, one can distinguish between what is spiritual and what is not; by contemplating them, one realizes their meaning and suppresses afflictive states; by meditating, one rests in the immediacy of that realization and definitively uproots these afflictive states.
As a support for that, there is conduct that is without doubt, like that of a dove. Before that species of bird returns to its nest, it first determines that there are no potentially harmful humans present and so approaches with no indecision. Similarly, having already eradicated speculation by hearing and contemplating spiritual teachings, one puts into practice the pith instructions one has come to trust.
As a support for that, there is conduct like that of a wild deer, which is not conduct suitable for everyone. [4.169.b] Still concerned about lapsing back into saṃsāra, the yogic practitioner practices while dwelling alone on a mountain unfrequented by people, like a wounded deer that stays off by itself.
As a support for that, there is the conduct like that of a mute; one observes silence, not conversing with anyone. When one acts thus, one’s mind becomes rather tight, so the conduct like that of a madman follows as a matter of course; like those of a madman, one’s physical, verbal, and mental actions have no fixed point of reference. At this point, the conduct like that of a dog or pig, with no attitude of what is clean or unclean, follows as a matter of course; one partakes of food and clothing without picking and choosing.
When these six aspects of conduct have been completed, there follows the conduct like that of a lion, in which one is not overshadowed by anyone else but can overshadow everyone else. Just as a lion has no fear or anxiety toward anything or anyone whatsoever, the yogic practitioner is free of all harm due to anything that is perceived or any influence human or otherwise, and so becomes capable of exercising mastery in any situation whatsoever.
If we apply a label to the foregoing aspects of conduct, they are collectively termed “conduct that brings mastery of the phenomenal world.” This is due to that fact that one becomes capable of converting those without faith and resuscitating those who have been killed, gains miraculous powers, and deepens one’s experience of the actual nature of phenomena. Like someone under the influence of alcohol, one is unrestrained and free of hope and fear, becoming capable of mastering the four elements.[660]
