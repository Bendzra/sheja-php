In this regard, once the wisdom of realization—the awareness that primordially exists as undifferentiated from *sugatagarbha as the expanse (dhātu)— arises from the expanse that is the profound abode of the Tathāgata, all seeds of obscurations are abandoned. This self-awareness that is the wisdom of realization is accomplished in immeasurable accumulations [of merits and knowledge] through the wisdom of fundamental transformation (gnas gyur pa'i ye shes).

Reply: Within the discerning awareness of sentient beings possessing obscurations, the cognition that makes them free from defilements is infused with blessings by the inconceivable power of wisdom. The aspect of wisdom is also present in the aspect of cognition that is free from defilements. [Thus] it is through the capacities (nus pa) of both [liberating and liberated cognition] that discerning awareness is fundamentally transformed into stainlessness, whereby the wisdom of realization and the dharmakāya have assumed one flavor. Then the tathāgata itself, which is indistinguishable from the buddha-qualities (yon tan)—the primordially present attributes (chos) of a buddha—performs the deeds that accomplish the consummate aims of oneself and others.

Reply: The expanse (dhātu) of all tathāgatas is directly ascertained. The realization-awareness that ascertains it is the actual vajra-like samādhi [at the end of the tenth bhūmi] and, until that point, the closely associated modes of realization-awarenesses, which comprise the ten emancipations from the first through the tenth spiritual levels, are present.

That this realization-awareness is primordially present means that the weariness associated with all the practices by way of this path that depends on the mind and mental factors of ordinary beings is not pointless but functions as the ground or basis for purposeful aspiration in a correct and appropriate manner.
Thus, the means to generate the actual vajra-like realization-awareness are as follows. Initially, the mind and mental factors of ordinary sentient beings are thoroughly purified through the power of the three [aspects] of studying, thinking, and meditating. Subsequently, one does not need to rely on the power of any study, thought, and meditation: For in the instant that self-occuring vajra-like realization wisdom, the orb of the sun, dawns, the darkness of latent tendencies is eradicated. Likewise, the meaning of “vajra” is the capacity to vanquish [ignorance] in the very moment when the two—the illumination of wisdom and the forces of ignorance—simultaneously encounter each other. This is the meaning of vajra and therefore it is also the meaning of the seven vajra points in the Uttaratantra [RGV].

Moreover, in this system, tathāgatagarbha, dharmakāya, the expanse of nirvāṇa, and complete and perfect awakening are only different in name but the same in meaning. The actualization of tathāgata itself is described as the dharmakāya. Although the so-called dharmakāya is present throughout the three phases, when it is actualized through eliminating the host of obscurations, it is the pervader in the sense that it pervades all phenomena, and it has the capacity to inexhaustibly reveal the spiritual embodiments (kāya) of engagement. Hence, it is the “embodiment of reality” (dharmakāya). And likewise, it is the complete and perfect buddha that is primordial perfect awakening. Moreover, it is the state of awakening that remains unchanging throughout the three phases. Thus it has never itself been contaminated by defilements and is utterly pure by nature. This shows vis-à-vis tathāgatagarbha that there was no initial contamination by defilements nor subsequent abandoning of the host of defilements. Thus, tathāgatagarbha is precisely the Three Jewels themselves in that it has the capacity to provide, temporarily, the accumulations of merit and wisdom and, ultimately, the excellent virtue of self-occuring wisdom.

Reply: It is described as the ultimate truth, that is, tathāgatagarbha. But where that tathāgatagarbha, as the unsurpassable expanse, is taken as the lofty goal of personally realized wisdom (pratyātmavedanīyajñāna), this is the meaning of the statement that “in this world, the unexcelled complete and perfect buddhas have gone (gshegs) directly to the seat of awakening (byang chub snying po : bodhimaṇḍa).”

Thus, because tathāgatagarbha is the nature (bdag nyid) of all qualities, as soon as the linkages [to saṃsāra] through the latent tendencies of all sentient beings' afflictions have been sundered, the spontaneous and uninterrupted deeds of a tathāgata manifest as the very tathāgata's sphere of activity. At that time, the true nature of a tathāgata is the capacity of the tathāgata to instantaneously reveal to students on the great spiritual levels the wheel of Dharma that is of definitive meaning and the inconceivable topics (gnas pa) through the power of mastering all phenomena.

In this regard, some who pride themselves on being Mahāyāna Mādhyamikas, not comprehending the teaching of the irreversible Dharma wheel, cling to the point that ultimate truth is utterly ineffable due to having analyzed tathāgata only in terms of emptiness. [But this] does not count as the definitive meaning, the ultimate abiding nature, in the Mahāyāna. Why is that? Because it would thus be akin to the emptiness of total cessation of śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha arhats. Conversely, unsurpassable and perfect buddhahood is the full accomplishment of the aims of oneself and others. That is, a tathāgata reveals manifold wonders via overwhelming and limitless manifestations. Since these never come to an end point later, the qualities and activities of a buddha are of the nature of being permanent and enduring. The venerable Asaṅga, the great Mādhyamika, explained that this is the ultimate truth.

Reply: The bodies of ordinary beings and dedicated aspirants [on the paths of Accumulation and Application] are composed of the five aggregates that are appropriated (upādānaskandha) and that are contaminated (sāsrava). The bodies of arhats and of bodhisattvas, who abide on the spiritual levels, are manifestations of a mental nature and are uncontaminated. The body of a perfect buddha is the dharmakāya playing forth in manifold [aspects] which coalesce in the single all-pervading sovereign, the expanse of phenomena (dharmadhātu). Because this body of complete liberation (vimuktikāya) from everything contaminated and uncontaminated is free from birth, death, and transition, it is devoid of the conditioned aspect. Within it, the host of discursive elaborations is primordially at rest and the ocean of buddha-qualities is spontaneously present.
The subject, namely, the realization-awareness that realizes that [dharmakāya], does not depend on the extraneous host of discursive elaborations because it is by nature self-awareness. Due to the purity of it being pure self-awareness itself, it does not depend on [anything] else. This is the unsurpassable system. {It is not the domain of those Mādhyamikas who act like Vaibhāṣikas}. By virtue of its qualities, it clears away the defilements of other sentient beings through knowing and caring, [which fulfill] the aims of self and others.

Therefore, the venerable Asaṅga said that this wisdom in the moment of a tathāgata's complete and perfect buddhahood refers to “complete and perfect buddhahood that is ineffable in nature … by virtue of the self-occuring wisdom without a teacher.” In accordance with this meaning, the Sūtrālaṃkāra commentary by the Sthavira Vasubandhu says,

The wisdom of a pratyekabuddha, just as it is, is not different from the initial preparation of a perfect buddha.

Others say, “Thus, in the moment a fully realized buddha becomes a buddha, through the empowerment of the great light-rays of all tathāgatas, he becomes the teacher. And in the Mantra system it is said that the moment a buddha awakens, he dwells in the meditation of adamantine luminosity, the extraordinary ultimate mind of the tathāgatas.” However, these are merely skillful means, whereas a buddha's own wisdom arises from itself because its own self-mastery does not depend on the mind-streams of other tathāgatas. Rather, it is based solely on the particularity (svalakṣana) of becoming a buddha. Once a buddha, he is undifferentiated from all buddhas.
Thus, according to the venerable great Mādhyamika Asaṅga, at the end of the Path of Cultivation, the tathāgata is present in the very continuum that unfolds into buddhahood. Therein, the remedy of self-awareness dawns, relinquishing what is to be relinquished without exception. In contrast to that, as for the other factors to be overcome through the Paths of Seeing and Cultivation, the coarse and subtle afflictions of the continuum that unfolds into buddhahood are said to be dispelled through the vajraand sword-like capacities of compassion and wisdom of other tathāgatas. This tradition must be traced from the innermost instructions of the noble Maitreya, besides which one will have no chance [to fathom] this profound meaning.

The wondrous manifestations of the buddhas who have actualized this tathāgatagarbha are of the nature of immaculate wisdom. Being neither existent nor nonexistent, [nor both] existent and nonexistent, nor anything other than both, tathāgatahood abides as the very nature of self-aware awareness and peace. However, since ordinary beings who are endowed with buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) are unable, with an ordinary person's cognition, to examine the qualities that abide in the *sugatagarbha expanse, and since it is beyond definitions, they do not infer the mode of abiding of the ultimate qualities. When qualities are examined with the cognition of ordinary beings, their not finding it as anything existent or nonexistent, nor both existent and nonexistent, nor other than both is not a case of correctly seeing (samanupaśyati) the mode of abiding of phenomena. Why? Because the evaluating cognition of ordinary beings is not valid. The master Asaṅga and his brother have said that these [beings] do not behold the real, valid mode of abiding of phenomena.

Candrakīrti, Haribhadra, and others maintain that this unfindability by the cognition of ordinary sentient beings, through having examined the realm of phenomena by means of reasoning regarding existence, nonexistence, origination, and cessation, is the ultimate mode of abiding. [But] in this [system], the exalted Asaṅga and his brother maintain the following: Any mode of abiding that can be inferred through words, utterances, speech, definitions, conventions, and signs, is not an aspect of the ultimate. Also, regardless of any efforts by the intellectual capacities of sophists as to whether [the ultimate] is analyzed as nonexistent, existent, [both] existent and nonexistent, or neither, [the result is] of limited scope. Through the power of 'attunement to the natural' (rnal 'byor : yoga), without thinking and without conception or expression, the welter of unfounded concepts, which is the source of karma and afflictions, comes to an end. Once this has stopped, there arises the self-occurring wisdom that is the insight without attachment or impediment, which discerns the abiding and appearing of phenomena and the nature of phenomena.

This arising of insight without attachment or impediment is the very tathāgata. Why? Because that which stems from the power of “attunement to the natural,” i.e., well-grounded mental engagement, is not engendered by ignorance. And the key point here is that it is not connected with the substratum mind, the afflictive ego-mind, and the cognition that conceptualizes objects. [Hence,] well-grounded mental engagement is that which is unborn and unceasing. This profound point is not within the scope of ordinary beings. {[Even so] some contemporary Mahāmudrā proponents in Tibet claim that this profound actuality arises also in ordinary beings.}
Thus, since the adventitious elements have, from the beginning, never arisen, never occurred, and are without extinction, [such] adventitious elements are free from extinction and cessation. In this system, it is claimed that when personally realized wisdom, by looking at the aspects of adventitious defilements in its own continuum, does not see any of the properties (dharma) and bearers of properties (dharmin) that make up the adventitious defilements, it is then free from all defilements and the meaning of the ultimate is thereby actualized.

Candrakīrti and others take 'seeing ultimate truth' as [implying that] the ultimate nature of phenomena does not see the nature of phenomena. However, with this, they would have to accept many contradictions in their own system, not only with regard to the ultimate—which goes without saying—but also in terms of the conventional. Thus, to dispel this flaw, they proclaim, “we Mādhyamikas don't have any thesis at all.”

In this system, the ultimate is the object that is seen by the tathāgatas. It is what really exists, just as it is. The pure vision of tathāgatas consists in the fully awakened wisdom of equality where there is nothing to be removed since ultimate truth is in essence untainted by obscuring defilements, and [where] there is no other wisdom to add to this [ultimate truth]. After becoming completely free from adventitious defilements, as an antidote to the belief in true reality as nonexistence, it has been recommended in the Tathāgata's Dharma wheel that one must make an effort on the Paths of Seeing and Cultivation to accomplish the nonconceptual wisdom that is the cause for attaining the state of the dharmakāya. Moreover, to say that one needs to practice the cause for the dharmakāya
is not to say one needs to bring to light a previously nonexistent cause. Rather, it means that one has to make efforts in the means of having a pre-existent cause be clearly evident later on.
In this regard, some who pride themselves on being Mādhyamikas widely claim that one is freed from the host of discursive elaborations through logically reasoning about [whether] effects exist or do not exist at the time of the cause.
However, the definitive meaning here is that when it comes to ultimate *sugatagarbha in any of its states, cause and effect do not exist as two. Rather, just as in the case of the elements of water, gold, and the sky, it is shown to be present at all times without any difference between the cause itself and its result.

Consequently, the natural luminous mind of ordinary sentient beings comes into rapport with tathāgatagarbha. That mind is naturally luminous means that [the samsaric] mind vanishes into the expanse of [its own] nature. Thus, conventional phenomena, which are empty of inherent essence, are inseparable from tathāgatagarbha, which is luminous—and the essence of this inseparability is the natural embodiment (svabhāvikakāya). If it did not exist, neither saṃsāra nor nirvāṇa would be possible at all. Mind, ego-mind, consciousness, karma, afflictions, and suffering are adventitious. Because afflictions are not established from causes and conditions, they are without essence. If causes that produce adventitious afflictions existed, they would have an essence. However, the productive cause does not exist and since the adventitious is precisely without cause, it is inadmissible that it has an essence.

Some others who pride themselves on being Mādhyamikas claim that in the same way that adventitious defilements have no essence, ultimate truth has no essence.

Thus, tathāgatagarbha exists just as it is in all sentient beings. Tathāgatagarbha is understood by the name “the selfless self.” However, it is not the case that there initially were two kinds of self [i.e., of persons and phenomena] that were later destroyed. Rather, [this buddha nature] is primordially the nature of peace, being thoroughly pure. Thus, both natural luminosity and adventitious afflictions are able to coexist in the uncontaminated expanse. Yet the adventitious afflictions are unable to touch the natural luminosity and natural luminosity is unable to touch the afflictions. Now this natural luminosity itself does not require anything else to bring it to light. The afflicted cognitions become afflicted through these very afflictions, but natural luminosity does not conceive of and cling to the afflictions.

Thus, in this system, it is explained that understanding things as they really are means that exalted ones realize tathāgatagarbha in their own mind-streams.

Thus, in this system, the final refuge exists ultimately. If that did not exist, then the basis of the path, the essence of the path, and the result of the path would also not exist. This would render all teachings of the Buddha pointless and the extraordinary discourses of definitive meaning would constitute a wheel of the true Dharma that is of provisional meaning and deceptive. Therefore, also the tathāgata which is the final stainlessness exists.
The basis of the path, when precisely distinguished, is tathāgatagarbha possessing defilements. This is the potential, which is inseparable from the expanse of all phenomena. The meaning of this is explained by the analogy of the great silk cloth covering the trichiliocosm. The basis for accomplishing this [potential] is the individuals who have set out by way of the three vehicles. Yet, those who have set out by way of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha [vehicles] remain much farther away from this tathāgata-potential.
The essence of the path is also this tathāgata-potential. If this did not exist, then even if a tathāgata came to the world, since there would be no basis for the flourishing of, or ground for, the arising of the roots of virtue, one would not come into touch with perfect awakening.
Then, [as for the fruition of the path], the permanent, enduring and eternal refuge is the ultimate dharmakāya itself. The potential of this [ultimate] Jewel certainly exists. So those who realize the dharmakāya—their own aim—bring together in the mind-streams of themselves and others the qualities that are undifferentiated from the dharmakāya and curb in the mind-streams of themselves and others those factors antithetical to this dharmakāya. For them, what is to be taken up is tathāgatagarbha and what is to be given up are the adventitious defilements, and the imagined and dependent [natures]. Knowing the specific features of these for oneself and explaining these to others is the domain of omniscient wisdom alone.

Therefore, noble Asaṅga and his brother called the sugata that is present within the chaff of adventitious defilements the *sugatagarbha and the *sugatagarbha element. They described the aspect that can become emancipated from these as “unfolded potential” and as “dharmakāya in the process of total fundamental transformation.” And they called the freedom from these adventitious defilements “tathāgata, the bhagavān, and samyak[sam]buddha.”

Reply: It is not. [One can] be certain that there are no vacillations in *sugatagarbha whose nature cannot be destroyed by anything because *sugatagarbha does not produce false conceptions within the sphere of the associated afflictions (upakleśas). Once it is free from the obscurations, since there is no reciprocal relation, let alone any intrinsic relation [between buddha nature and the afflictions], it will remain on the level of irreversibility.

Thus, having generated the power of insight of the exalted ones regarding tathāgatagarbha, which is ultimate truth, the knot of conceptions is unraveled and the wisdom of a tathāgata is individually discerned. When one has become a tathāgata and has pointed out the path [to others], ordinary people are made to leave behind the limitless fetters of conceptions. Although a buddha's body, speech, and mind are beyond the adventitious defilements, the profound wondrous displays of the buddha's body, speech, and mind are nonetheless revealed to sentient beings whose mind-streams have these adventitious defilements. That certain beings who are to be guided behold the wondrous displays of the [buddha's] body, speech, and mind is due to the power of both [1] a tathāgata's compassion which blesses, manifests, and transforms the adventitious conventional [reality] through having mastered the powerful ultimate truth, and [2] tathāgatagarbha in those to be guided, whose mind-streams possess tathāgatagarbha. In this way, even ordinary sentient beings are able to fathom the wondrous displays of the bhagavāns, the indestructible vajra points.
Therefore, tathāgatagarbha in [its] purity from defilements, which is its own essence (rang gi ngo bo : svabhāva) and particular characteristic (rang gi mtshan nyid : svālakṣaṇa), is called “tathāgatagarbha that is free from adventitious defilements”. And its universal essence or characteristic (spyi'i ngo bo mtshan nyid), which is equal to the dharmadhātu in profundity and vastness, is called the “natural tathāgatagarbha.”

In short, ordinary beings are fettered by the shackles of clinging to their conventional appropriated bodies and minds as being permanent, joyful, a self, and pure. The śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha arhats are fettered by the shackle of believing that the ultimate state consists in impermanence, suffering, selflessness and [the clinging] to the impurity of inveterate worldly cravings. However, unsurpassable fully perfected buddhas know the modes of abiding and appearing of all phenomena. Thus, they fully realize that the mode of abiding, ultimate truth, consists in the perfection of purity, permanence, joy and authentic selfhood. At the same time, they fully realize that the mode of appearing consists in the adventitious elements of conventional sentient beings, which are impermanent, suffering, selfless, and impure. With these two modes, the two extremes of permanence and extinction are dispelled. This follows, moreover, because, conventionally, tathāgatas are primordially nonexistent, but, where ultimate truth is concerned, tathāgatagarbha, which is irreducible to the extremes or parameters of the conventional, exists.

Without comprehending these points, others who pride themselves on being Mādhyamikas do not accept [buddha nature] as being anything existent or nonexistent, even in a merely conventional [sense], in the context of practicing the accumulation of stores of merits by way of the illusion-like post[-meditative] cognition once they have emerged from meditative equipoise on the ultimate, buddha nature (*sugatagarbha).

Moreover, the sense in which the ultimate, buddha nature (*sugatagarbha), is the perfection of purity, permanence, joy, and authentic selfhood is [as follows]. The meaning of perfection (pha rol tu phyin pa) is also “to have reached the other side” (pha rol tu son pa) of purity, permanence, joy, and authentic selfhood because it overcomes the reductivist partiality of taking tathāgatagarbha to be nothing but purity, permanence, joy, and authentic selfhood. It is [thus] explained as “having a pervasive nature that transcends all partiality.”

In short, ultimate purity [means] total purity because of [its] general and specific natures and [its] being immaculate. Being free from self and no self is the meaning of authentic selfhood. Being free from all the tumultuous aspects of body and mind from ordinary beings up to the end of the tenth level is the meaning of joy. Not clinging to the nefarious deceptions of the impermanent world and not solely conceptualizing the permanence of nirvāṇa is the meaning of permanence.

Those who pride themselves on being Mādhyamika, yet do not comprehend the meaning of this [doctrine of the perfections of purity, permanence, joy, and authentic selfhood], declare that “emptiness is that which is beyond the intellectual scope of ordinary beings in the present.” However, [this] doctrine of nonexistence deduced from assumptions about the meaning of what amounts to mere words contradicts all the [accepted] theories of the conventional. Taking [this] as their sole mental object they declare, “This is the supreme Madhyamaka view.”
It indeed appears that teachers of Indian and Tibetan origin who were ordinary people styled the doctrinal system of the perfection of purity, permanence, bliss and authentic selfhood, which was of ultimate meaning, as being of provisional meaning. Yet [they took] the very extensive sūtras of definitive meaning that the Tathāgata taught as definitive in meaning to his foremost spiritual sons as having a hidden intent (dgongs pa can : ābhiprāyika) and as nonliteral (sgra ji bzhin ma yin pa : na yatharuta). This is not good. The meaning of purity, permanence, joy, and authentic selfhood was also elucidated in this [definitive] sense by the protectors, the three types of bodhisattvas such as Avalokiteśvāra, at the time of distilling the [quintessential] meaning of the tantras. And it was also explained more than once by the exalted Nāgārjuna and Asaṅga.

The special object of engagement of exalted ones is the dharmadhātu, and what engages is the dharmatā. The meaning is the same essential point as the dharmadhātu wisdom.

Reply: Having explained that phenomena as mere universals (chos spyi tsam) are adventitious defilements consisting in cognition and objects of cognition, it was explained that the nature of phenomena (dharmatā) is *sugatagarbha. However, regarding this expanse of phenomena (dharmadhātu), he explains that since the nature of phenomena (dharmatā) persists as the nature of all of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa in the manner of nonabiding—being without concepts or predispositions regarding everything—it is not empty of the expanse of phenomena (dharmadhātu). It is proclaimed that if one comprehends the meaning of this, then saṃsāra itself is nirvāṇa.

Therefore, the exalted ones are neither close to nor distant from sentient beings. Having cut though the craving for self with which the elements of all sentient beings are associated, there are no bonds of attachment to keep [them] close. Nor are they distant, because, owing to [their] great compassion, [they] do not give up on anyone at all. Hence the noble ones, by staying neither near nor far, are those whose nonconceptual sphere of operations comprises the sameness of both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, there being no nirvāṇa to take up and no saṃsāra to give up. Thus, it was explained as the “inseparability of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, the equality of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.”

Reply: Through the truth and inspiration of the naturally pure expanse of phenomena (dharmadhātu) and the unconditioned tathāgatagarbha, even though since beginningless time there are no causes and conditions, it is the conditioned adventitious defilements themselves which, although they are nonexistent, grow weary of suffering and turn toward and aspire for nirvāṇa. Subsequently, the light of wisdom arises from tathāgatagarbha and vanquishes the adventitious defilements. Thus, implicitly, these conditioned adventitious [defilements], which are [in reality] devoid of causes and conditions, are the impermanent counterpart [in this relation].

Although adventitious defilements are without causes and conditions, when it comes to the means of freeing tathāgatagarbha from defilements, so long as the phase of sentient beings [persists], there must be causes and conditions for clearing away these defilements. This is because as long as [such] causes and conditions are insufficient, one will not become a perfect buddha.

Reply: This is not the case.

Moreover, in the context of actualizing the [state of] tathāgata in the future, one must rouse one's efforts in the continuum of the authentic path whereby the [factors of] dharmakāya, wisdom, and great compassion are each brought to light in its own way. Since the dharmakāya, wisdom, and compassion are each hampered by their respective obscurations, these hindrances must be dispelled. The cause that is the path which brings [these factors] to light, is concordant with tathāgatagarbha and the dharmakāya; ultimately, they become indistinguishable.

Further, the essence of the embodiment of perfect buddhahood is the embodiment of true reality (dharmatākāya).

[Such] is the meaning of dharmakāya.

Moreover, the basis that is made distinctive through relinquishment is called “completely perfect buddha” and the basis having obscurations is called “sentient being.” Yet, the tathāgata in the mind-streams of both is neither good nor bad and neither waxes nor wanes. Furthermore, the Bhagavān taught the following:

Therefore, Śāriputra, the dharmakāya is nothing but the element of sentient beings. The element of sentient beings as such is dharmakāya and the dharmakāya as such is the element of sentient beings. These are in fact not two. They are only nominally different.

In this regard, some people appear to have taught that the element possessing sentient beings' adventitious defilements and the dharmakāya that is tathāgatagarbha are identical. This is not the case. [Rather,] it is explained that the element called the “element of sentient beings” (sattvadhātu) [in the above citation], namely, the element of the mind-streams of sentient beings, is synonymous with the potential (rigs) and *sugatagarbha in the ground phase. It is [further] explained that this [element] and the dharmakāya of the fruition phase are identical. So, the meaning of this [passage] pertains to that which has the nature of qualities, i.e., sugata, which is described by the noble Maitreya as follows:

As it was earlier, so it is later –
It is of an unchangeable nature.

Here, in this system, the exalted Asaṅga has explained that there is no distinction between purity of mind and well-grounded mind (tshul bzhin sems : yoniśo citta). And he explained that the mind that is inclined toward the nature of things and is not distinct from it, and the *sugatagarbha, which is the natural dharmatā that does not dwell in any phenomenon, are not different.

It is also taught that by failing to rely on what purifies the mind, the impure skandha, dhātu, āyatana, as well as karma and afflictions are progressively established. From the very beginning, however, what is to be relinquished and the antidotes which counter them have been primordially present in the mind-stream of everyone. The explanation of natural *sugatagarbha as being devoid of causes and conditions is illustrated by way of the analogy of the sky. Its meaning is explained such that [buddha nature] is not established as a collection, collocation, or aggregation and this is because there is nothing whatsoever that arises, ceases, or grasps. Yet it is explained that its inherent essence is present as a cause in the same way that the sky is present as a basis that makes room [for things to appear]. Likewise, since *sugatagarbha is present as the mode of abiding of all phenomena, it is established as undifferentiated from the cause.
Furthermore, ordinary beings make efforts in the means to make *sugatagarbha, which has not been seen previously, visible, and [bodhisattvas] rest in the meditative equipoise on aspects [of buddha nature], which has been seen previously. Neither of them goes astray, and it is upon attaining the fifth spiritual level that their [effort and meditation] become integrated through the power of mind (blo stobs). In this sense, it is additionally explained that the bodhisattvas from this phase onward master the ability to all at once, and without contradiction, arise from or enter into inconceivable channels for exercising contemplation and insight regarding [the factors of] both pollution and purification. This is a tangential point.

Moreover, the [buddha nature] that resides in sentient beings as their basic nature is primordial nirvāṇa, so [they] don't need to later pass into nirvāṇa.

Furthermore, [this] total passing into nirvāṇa of ordinary beings' bodies and minds is the nirmāṇakāya. For, through the fundamental transformation of their impurities, it is that embodiment (kāya) which manifests to all ordinary beings, superior to inferior. When the ultimate truth that is the svābhāvikakāya and the tathāgata co-mingle within each other as a single flavor, the embodiment of one victor is the embodiment of all [victors]. Hence, this is called the saṃbhogakāya. And because that is the mode of abiding of the whole of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, i.e., tathāgatagarbha, it is [called] the dharmakāya. As for what liberation is, the mastery of self-aware wisdom regarding the *sugatagarbha of one's own mindstream is liberation. By contrast, the transition from self-grasping to selflessness is not liberation, because becoming liberated by a mere nonexistent would be like [being liberated by] a hare's horn and the like.

Therefore, the definitive meaning of Mahāyāna taught in the final wheel [of Dharma] is the meaning summarized in terms of nine analogies by the noble Ajita [i.e., Maitreya]. Ordinary beings with inordinate desires are those who previously did not meet with the tathāgatas. So even though tathāgatagarbha is present in the mind-streams as an opportunity for attainment, due to all their afflictions and obscurations, it has not become even partially evident. Thus, it dwells within the chaff of afflictions. However, as small portions of the roots of virtue are amassed and the aspiration toward awakening is engendered, the obscuring factors, if only correspondingly, are [rendered] nonexistent. As to the meaning of this, it is explained that tathāgatagarbha becomes proportionately manifest in the cognitive streams of ordinary beings.

This point was discussed in detail by the exalted master [Nāgārjuna] in the Dharmadhātustava (DDhS) by means of the analogy of the lamp within a vase.
It was also explained by the analogy of the waxing moon. And the Kālacakra (KCT) explains that [certain] aspects of wisdom in the triad of body, speech, and mind and the triad of energy channels, currents, and potencies manifests partially in the coarse mind-streams of ordinary individuals. Thus this profound point would not otherwise [exist] if not for the instructions transmitted through the exalted Asaṅga. Therefore, becoming free from the chaff of afflictions depends on an attitude of dedication to striving for *sugatagarbha. While this attitude arises of its own accord, its arising is in the domain of those with supreme fortune. This process may be ascertained from my Expressions of Realization:

Even if one makes efforts for eons,
If self-luminosity, which is the key point, is not realized, A time for nirvāṇa will not come.

Thus, some who have deductively ascertained that ultimately there is only nonconceptuality explain emptiness in the sense of unreality (bden pa med pa).
This is not correct because, were that the case, one would not be able to directly realize the expanse of the Tathāgata's wisdom. Why is that? It is because mere nonconceptuality regarding the conventional aspects and mere emptiness of the reality of external substances are observed by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas as well. However, for śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, it is difficult to realize even a fraction of the multi-faceted *sugatagarbha.
In order to avoid mistakes about this issue, others claim that śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have an understanding of the essencelessness of phenomena. Thus, they say, “there is no difference between śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas and Mahāyāna when it comes to the Madhyamaka view of nonelaboration. However, based on [determining] the relative scope (rgyas bsdus) of the logical reasoning that ascertains this nonelaboration, there is no difference in degrees of profundity (zab mi zab) as to the essence of nonelaboration apart from how broad or narrow in scope [the views are].” Thus, there were many in India and Tibet who disparaged the comprehensive doctrine of the Buddha by overemphasizing certain partial aspects [of it].
The reason why it is difficult to realize the meaning of statements [regarding buddha nature] is that the quintessence of the Tathāgata (tathāgatagarbha) is the very quintessence (garbha) of dharmakāya. Thus, the quintessence of the mundane is the supramundane. And the quintessence of the supramundane is the quintessence of the dharma. And the quintessence of this is the quintessence of the Tathāgata (tathāgatagarbha). That is why the exalted protector Asaṅga has declared that it is difficult for others to realize it. Thus, this [buddha nature] is seen to a small extent by [bodhi]sattvas on the tenth spiritual level.

Query: In which way is it seen?
Reply: It is seen in such a way that the whole of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is indistinguishable from the wisdom of a tathāgata. Regarding this vision of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa as indistinguishable, it is maintained in this system that [they are] indistinguishable from tathāgatagarbha. However, others posit this vision of indistinguishability in line with the emptiness aspect alone. It has been proclaimed, however, that the vision of indistinguishability in terms of emptiness alone cannot eradicate the latent tendencies of ignorance. Why? Because even [in the case of] śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, just as there is emptiness consisting in their own selflessness, so too they have a vision of the emptiness of other beings' selves.

Reply: There is no fault here because [buddha nature] was explained so that ordinary beings could awaken [their] potential and relinquish the five drawbacks. And primarily, after explaining that all conventional phenomena are empty just like illusions, dreams, and clouds, it was explained that what remains, tathāgatagarbha, which is not empty of the essential unsurpassable qualities, exists.

In that regard, some scholars in the Land of Snows claim that the statement in the Uttaratantra [RGV] that “sentient beings have tathāgatagarbha” is of provisional meaning.

Why? Because its purpose is the abandonment of the five draw-backs. Were it the case [that buddha nature doctrine is of provisional meaning], then it would not be necessary to abandon the five drawbacks. There would also be no problem with disparaging sentient beings because sentient beings would not have tathāgatagarbha. And there would be no need to hold the *sugatagarbha doctrine as authentic because it would be of provisional meaning. There would also be no problem with deprecating buddha nature (*sugatagarbha), the dharmakāya, because to [present this] as primordially nonexistent would not be to subscribe to the extreme of deprecation, [but] would describe how things really are. Even feeling discouraged would be appropriate because *sugatagarbha would not be in one's mind-stream, so the arising of an attitude free from discouragement would be a belief that does not conform to reality.

Moreover, if one carries on like this, then the exalted Asaṅga and others would not be authoritative persons because the true teachings which in this tradition are classified by the Bhagavān, Maitreya and others [such as Asaṅga] as not having a hidden intended meaning (dgongs pa can; ābhiprāyika) [would instead] have a hidden agenda (dgos pa : prayojana) and [thus] diverge from the literal meaning (dngos la gnod byed : mukhyārthabādha).

Sugata (bde bar gshegs pa; “well-gone”) is a buddha possessing twofold purity. As for its garbha (snying po: “quintessence”), it is the mind (thugs) of a buddha, i.e., nonconceptual wisdom that is suchness. In terms of this possessing two purities, sugata consists in the admantine form embodiments (rūpakāya) and their display of indestructible illusory emanations. In terms of the second [aspect, i.e., garbha], it is the luminous dharmakāya and indestructible wisdom. Considering the former of these [i.e., sugata], it is reasoned [in RGV I.28a],

Because the body of the perfect Buddha is [all-]pervading, …

For these reasons, both sugata and garbha exist and thus one has the spiritual potential [whose buddha-qualities] are not recognized as being disconnected—like inalienable bliss (bde ba tha mi dad pa)—or rather one has never deviated from the nature of that [potential]. Concerning this last distinctive feature, it is also the embodiment of supreme bliss (mahāsukhakāya) that is explained in the Mantrayāna.

Thus, this buddhagarbha which is inseparable from the threefold rūpakāya, dharmakāya, and mahāsukhakāya is the quintessence of whatever embodied beings there are in all [phases] of purity and impurity.
Therefore, it is a quintessence in such a manner that it and the pure body (lus) or spiritual embodiment (sku) of liberation (vimuktikāya) remain inseparable by nature. As for the impure bodies, it is a quintessence (garbha) that is similar to what is hidden in a husk (sbun lkogs) or chaff (shun pa) that are adventitious, false, and not inherently existing. Considering this meaning, the [RGV I.28d] states,

All sentient beings are always endowed with buddha nature (buddhagarbha).

Thus, in light of this profound meaning, seeing that the meaning of the statement in the sūtra corpus that “all sentient beings are always endowed with buddha nature (buddhagarbha)” is an instance of definitive meaning, the Mahāsiddha Lalitavajra (a secret name of the master Rang byung rdo rje) eloquently explained in all his Zab mo nang don works—[i.e.,] the root text along with its auto-commentary and esoteric instructions—that all beings are solely buddha nature (buddhagarbha).

In this regard, some people have broadcasted their loud squawking of wrong notions: ['Gos lo's objection:] “According to you, the way buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) exists in sentient beings is that the buddhagarbha exists whereas the sentient being as chaff does not exist, these [two] being mutually related as quintessence (garbha) and chaff. If your manner of positing the quintessence is explained in this way, then it would be reasonable to posit a vase as the quintessence of a hare's horn because these two would be present as mutually related such that [one] exists and [the other] does not exist and [would thus] amount to a nonrelation. Accepting that would be a gross logical absurdity by which phenomena of incompatible categories, i.e., the chaff and quintessence, end up being posited as mutually related. Thus, it is established that x [e.g. hare's horn] [can]not be the nature of x [e.g. vase] and that therefore your position is an inferior one.”

As for the first, in general, the definition of the term “chaff” as it is discussed here is explained as precisely the sentient beings, i.e., embodied beings in the sense of adventitious defilements that are to be removed or relinquished. Yet, both the basis of the designation “sentient being” and the designation itself are not inherently established and are empty of intrinsic essence because this is established in both the Madhyamaka traditions of the causal [sūtra] and resultant [tantra] vehicles. And, in the case where [one] takes something inherently nonexistent [i.e., sentient being] to be the opposite of the inherently existent [i.e, quintessence], then [one] labels the one as the “chaff” of its counterpart and thus establishes it as something dissimilar to it or as an object that opposes it.

Now, if something does not inherently exist, then how can one establish something as a dissimilar instance or an object opposed to it? As far as positing that it exists as a dissimilar instance or an object opposed to it, it is not tenable to [have] a relationship of similarity between one thing and another based on the clinging [or belief] on the part of [ordinary] consciousness to all objects of knowledge as either compatible or opposite.

Even conventionally, in positing the quintessence, it looks as if the existence of the chaff is unnecessary. For example, consider a necklace of the most precious turquoise (g.yu drug dkar). When a person whose vision is unobscured, in contrast to everyone else who has obscured vision, says “this is the quintessence of turquoises” after having perceived an example (mtshan gzhi), he has [truly] determined the quintessence of turquoises, whereas the rest of the turquoises [seen with obscured vision] are not the quintessence of turquoises. If that is so, then these [others] haven't discovered the turquoise. If the remaining turquoises are not the quintessence of turquoises, then they are not [real] turquoise. [And] if that is so, then what could the chaff vis-à-vis turquoise be apart from [a misperception by] those having obscured vision as compared with those not having obscured vision? When we investigate the matter, [the alternatives] collapse.

In short, in this way of explaining the quintessence and chaff, the phenomena of whichever type of phenomena/nature of phenomena (dharma/dharmatā) [relation you consider] are not beyond the scope of the two – the existence or nonexistence of the quintessence which perdures as the mode of abiding [of phenomena]. Hence, it is incontrovertible that all quintessences that exist must exist as an essence (svabhāva), [whereas] everything without quintessence is nonexistent in relation to that existent quintessence and is [hence] established as chaff, a superimposition, and a delusion.

If in positing the quintessence and chaff it were necessary that their essences [or specific properties] are of a common type, that would be insufficient to posit them as quintessence and chaff. So, if in the case of the “quintessence of x” it was [deemed] necessary that x = the quintessence of x, then you would be subject to [all] the great fallacies of not needing to establish a quintessence [i.e., buddha nature]. In that regard, when it is [deemed] necessary that the quintessence and chaff share essences of a common type, then all referential objects would be mixed up, and the terms [referring to these objects] would be mistaken. This is because so long as one posits the chaff-cum-embodied being and quintessence-cum-buddha in this way, it absurdly follows that what is to be eliminated and what is to be attained belong to a common class.
In conventional terms, regarding the chaff [in terms] of a venomous snake, [the snake] has venom yet the quintessence of that [snake], which is bile, is a great medicine that neutralizes the venom of that [snake]. Now, were it necessary, in positing these two as quintessence and chaff, to [include] them in the same class, then it would also be necessary [to include] medicine and poison in the same class. Consequently, all terminological conventions would collapse.

Also, in general, when it comes to positing the quintessence and chaff, not only is it crucial to not mix up their essences, but even if taken exclusively from the perspective of a conceptual exclusion-of-other (gzhan sel : anyāpoha)—a mere universal class—there would not be a sufficient number of assembled causes for the mind to place the chaff and quintessence [in a single category]. For, if there emerged a single universal comprising these two, then since the chaff and quintessence could no longer occur as two separate things, the system of classifying chaff and quintessence would fall apart.

Moreover, when the quintessence of any given thing is identified as the quintessence of that thing and as the counterpart opposite to or compatible with it, it absurdly follows that inflecting in the sixth [case, i.e., the genitive] is pointless. For if, by the expression “quintessence of that thing,” you do not take it as some essence that is not itself that thing, then when you wished to identify the essence of the thing and you applied the term snying po, it was not necessary to use this term snying po'i because it would have been sufficient to identify [that thing] by simply applying the [zero] case-marker for an “essence” (ngo bo'i rkyen) instead. [Thus,] you have also made your system of grammar illogical.

In short, this buddha nature (buddhagarbha) that exists in all embodied beings is seen only by the Tathāgata, i.e., the ultimate buddha; it is not seen by anyone other than him. The reason for this is that the mode of abiding of the Bhagavān himself has never become imperceptible (parokṣa) to him, so he does not see any nature of beings other than his own tathāgata-nature (de bzhin gshegs pa nyid). Their tathāgata itself is not different from what is termed the “quintessence (garbha) of all embodied beings.” Thinking of it in that way, it was proclaimed that when the eyes of a buddha see things as they really are, they see buddha nature (buddhagarbha) as it also exists in sentient beings. On the other hand, it is not the case that this seeing consists in deducing the subject (chos can) [of an inference] like the existence of fire from a smoky [mountain] pass and the existence of moisture within an egg. Having thought about this, the venerable teacher Nāgārjuna who abides on the supreme plane of unity (zung 'jug : yuganaddha), proclaimed the following [in MMK XXII.16]:

What is the nature of a Tathāgata
Is the nature of this world. 
The Tathāgata is without own nature;
This world is without own nature.

[Let us] further describe the way the tathāgatagarbha exists in all sentient beings: [1] If, from the standpoint of assumption, the collection “sentient being” is taken as a universal (sāmānyalakṣaṇa), then from the standpoint of actuality, buddha nature (buddhagarbha) is precisely what is revealed as the particular (svalakṣaṇa). [2] As for buddha, there is no differentiation into intrinsic and extrinsic natures or into categories of universals and particulars. Yet, from the perspective of not simply disregarding this potential or abiding nature or essence, which is beyond identity and difference, we label it as “buddha nature” (buddhagarbha) and as the “result of complete awakening.” [3] Although metaphorically designated [as a result] in this way, because this [buddha nature] is unconditioned, one cannot establish it in terms of cause and effect. Having ascertained by these three reasons that all beings are universals (sāmānyalakṣaṇa), this buddha nature (buddhagarbha), the nondeceptive object, was said to exist in all phases of being obscured and unobscured, contaminated and uncontaminated by defilements, and of being or not being a sentient being.

[1] As for the first, concerning what is termed “sentient beings,” since each of their [constituent] substances are empty of nature, how could they be established as particulars? In the case of not being established, if one is [supposed] to identify something such as “this is a sentient being,” it is not found, so how could I possibly identify that? Now, from a deluded perspective, one may label a mere collection-universal—a nonexisting appearance—as “sentient being”. But apart from mistaking what is only this label for a substantially existing sentient being, it is certain that a sentient being apart from this could scarcely exist.

Query: What, then, persists as the mode of abiding or particular characteristic of all phenomena? As cited in the Mother of the Victors [Prajñāpāramitā sūtras], “only profound emptiness persists,” this being stated in accordance with the vision of those who abide on the spiritual levels. To describe it this way is not bad but according to the vision of the Tathāgata, from the viewpoint of actuality, only buddha wisdom or [buddha] nature is fully present [in these beings]. As is reasoned [in RGV I.27ab],

Because buddha wisdom is present in all [kinds of] sentient beings,
Because the natural nondefilement [of buddhas and sentient beings] is nondual, …

[2] As for a buddha, that which is free from conceptual elaborations of identity and difference is precisely its quintessence. If different things do not form a collection, a universal is not established. But for different things to form a collection, [their] identity [sameness] must be established first. Therefore, all these [constructs] dissolve just like clouds. If so, then how could there be universals or particulars as pertaining to self and other, given that universals don't exist? As the so-called classes (rigs : gotra) and universals (spyi : sāmānya), renowned among logicians, are proclaimed to be synonymous, how is it possible that [they] are the same as the quintessence in the sense of being co-implicates?

Now, the meaning of designating buddha nature (buddhagarbha) as a potential (rigs : gotra) is as follows. It is possible to render [buddha nature] as a plethora of knowable things according to derivations from the [Sanskrit] term dhātu. Thus, we here translate it as rigs [potential]. As for its meaning, it is necessary to explain it in terms of dharmadhātu because the wisdom of dharmadhātu is precisely that which is fully replete with all [buddha-]qualities (yon tan) such that the nature, mode of abiding, and essence of that buddha nature (buddhagarbha) are not disregarded.

As for the name of this state of abiding as the inseparability of buddhagarbha and dharmadhātujñāna, the Bhagavān designated it with the terms “result of buddhahood” [and] “the supreme point of awakening” (byang chub kyi snying po = bodhimaṇḍa). In some contexts, he referred to that [factor] by means of the term “cause of buddhahood.” But labeling this buddhagarbha in terms of “cause” and “result” is only metaphorical. It is not tenable to say this buddhagarbha is the result of anything because there is nothing in this buddhagarbha to [warrant] making such a distinction between substantial causes (upādānakāraṇa) and supporting conditions (sahakāripratyaya) that [together] produce [the result]. This is proven (siddha) because that which is thus unconditioned dharmadhātu, being unconditioned, is not established by [appeal to] the power of facts (vastubāla), namely, causes and conditions. For that to be a cause is untenable because it would then be established as a true self that is permanent. This is entailed (vyāpti) because the means of valid sources of knowledge do not establish causes and conditions of something permanent.

Now, the point of speaking in some cases of a cause of buddhahood and in others of a result of buddhahood is this. On the part of those trainees who are under the influence of [ordinary] consciousness, the quintessence (garbha) at the time when it appeared to become separated from the chaff, appeared as though it were a “result of emancipation” (bral 'bras). Bearing this in mind, [the buddha] spoke of it as a 'result'. And the quintessence at the time when it appeared to possess the chaff, appeared as though it were a cause, namely, the cause leading to the result of emancipation from that [chaff]. Bearing this in mind, [the buddha] spoke of it as a cause, a potential, and an element. From the perspective of consciousness, because the mind is mistaken concerning a quintessence, which is unchanging and unwavering, it cannot deeply penetrate these concepts, so sometimes [the quintessence] is mistaken for a cause, and sometimes it is mistaken it for a result. However, the quintessence is not established in any way in terms of causes and results. Having this in mind, it was reasoned [in RGV I.27c],

[3] What persists as the mode of abiding [is the first point] and the [buddha] nature [metaphorically] postulated as a result [is the second point].

According to this statement, what appears to be a sentient being, being a dependent [nature], exists only within the range of superimpositions. In that regard, the Bhagavān, wishing to point out that which exists nondeceptively as the way of abiding (gnas tshul), expressed it in the inconceivable sūtras and tantras that reveal precisely this buddha nature (buddhagarbha). On this very topic, the noble Maitreya explained it in detail by means of the seven adamantine points. It is precisely what [I] accept here. Thus, it is said [in RGV I.27d] that

“all beings are endowed with buddhagarbha.”

Since the buddhagarbha alluded to [here] is the very embodiment of primordially sublime freedom, it is the nondeceptive refuge and the authority (pramāṇa). It prevails for all time without departing from itself. In whichever ways sentient beings and the rest, who are of the nature of defilements, discards, chaff, adventitious factors and imputations—[all of] which have never been known to exist—may try to obstruct, manipulate, or violate the quintessence, forget about them being able to make it inconstant! For these [things] have no connection with the quintessence and are completely cut off from it. Thus, they are like a hare's horn in comparison to [the quintessence which is comparable] to real entities consisting of the four elements.

Not understanding that the delineation of three phases was a classification made with the intention to distinguish the threefold [gradation of] thick, thin, and cleansed on the part of [ordinary] consciousness—i.e., that aspect involving deluded perceptions of phenomena—you made the mistake of explaining them as three states of buddha nature (buddhagarbha) [according to how much this] essence is itself adulterated or unadulterated with the influence of the impurities. So, no sooner have you asserted that sentient beings have buddha nature (buddhagarbha) than you go on to assert that they don't have buddha[hood]! By thus asserting that sentient beings have buddhagarbha with this fixed idea [in mind], your own established conclusions collapse from deep within.

That there is nothing knowable apart from the knowledge of buddhas, sentient beings, and Hīna[yāna] arhants is a fundamental point of Mahāyāna. This being so, is that which is [in your view] a quintessence but not a buddha [1] the [1a] quintessence of a sentient being (sattvagarbha) or [1b] the quintessence of a buddha (buddhagarbha), or is it [2] the quintessence of an arhant of the Hīnayāna? [1] In the first case, [the quintessence of a sentient being] can be ruled out as it is not a buddhagarbha. [2] In the second case, it comes down to the fault of affirming that all sentient beings possess the quintessence of an arhant who is [either] a pratyekabuddha or śrāvaka.

In general, the three phases may have been schematized in that way from the perspective of [ordinary] consciousness, but from the perspective of buddha nature itself, forget about them being schematized in that way by wisdom. In this case, there is not even an appearance of them. That being so, how can it be maintained that the buddha nature (buddhagarbha) in the phase of impurity is not buddha? In your view, buddha nature (buddhagarbha) in the impure phase is not a buddha. Since it only becomes a buddha in the pure phase, the quintessence (garbha) does not possess any autonomy (rang dbang) and the impurities end up having greater efficacy (nus pa) than [buddha] nature!

In general, moreover, your buddhagarbha possessing twofold purity as posited from the standpoint of wisdom, and your garbha free from adventitious defilements as posited from the standpoint of consciousness, are reckoned to be one and the same from a conceptual standpoint. But it is because of this that such mistakes like the [above] occur. Moreover, when it comes to identifying the ultimate quintessence as it is associated with the phases of defilement, you have not understood it. Since the ultimate quintessence does not consist of states and thus cannot be subdivided, by separating it into three states you have gone astray from the intent of the noble father and son [Maitreya and Asaṅga].

Furthermore, having accepted the views and tenets of the precious Bla ma Blo bzang grags pa [Tsong kha pa] as authoritative, the teacher Yig bzang rtse pa ['Gos Lo tsā ba] nonetheless claims to be a lineage holder of the incomparable Dwags po bka' brgyud. If we closely investigate these [views], the basis to which the terms “self” and “sentient being” actually refer is explained [by them] as the [psychophysical] aggregates, the eye consciousness and the rest. If so, since these are an unstable flux, they are unable to be a basis for karma and results.
Query: Then what is able to [be such a basis]
['Gos lo tsā ba]: Because of [the relation of] founding and founded, there is no way that the tathāgatagarbha itself—natural luminosity—could not be the basis for karma and results. Consequently, the terms 'self' and 'sentient being' actually refer to this. This can also be proven by means of reasoning: it is due to the quintessence that one experiences suffering. Having thus become weary of [suffering], one strives for nirvāṇa [the extinction of suffering]. In order to arrive at it, there is also a special reasoning [that deduces cause] from effect. This has been stated by highly learned scholars such as Bhāvaviveka, Candrakīrti, and by Sher 'byung blo gros in his Bodhicaryāvatāra commentary.

[Mi bskyod rdo rje]: Citing many scriptures such as these, [you maintain that] natural luminosity or buddha nature (buddhagarbha) are able to be a basis for karma and results and that they are the extraordinary applicable objects ('jug yul) of the terms 'self' and 'sentient being'. This is [allegedly] stated not only among the Cittamātra [school] but also in the Madhyamaka tradition and especially [in] this supporting quotation from the Śrīmālā[devīsiṃhanāda]sūtra, sec. 13]:

Bhagavān, whatever be these six consciousnesses, and whatever be this [other] consciousness—Bhagavān, these seven factors are unstable, disconnected, momentary, and do not experience suffering… Bhagavān, the tathāgatagarbha, being inseparably connected and not momentary, does experience suffering.

Having copied [this] quotation, when [you] summarized its meaning as the final word [on the matter], it appears that you published the statement “given that in the phase of saṃsāra it is inadmissible that [samsaric phenomena could come] from [anything] other than space-like luminosity, there [must] exist subtle sentient beings who are the basis for karma and results.” This is inadmissible because, in point of fact, your assertion that luminosity and [buddha] nature are subtle sentient beings that serve as the basis for karma and results carries the implication that nature and luminosity are subtle selves that serve as a basis of karma and results. If so, then since the precious Bla ma [Tsong kha pa] Blo bzang, who you take as your authority, is known to have postulated a self that serves as the basis of karma and results, it is in this case [clear that] you, disciple and teacher, commit the following faults, one after the other.
It is inadmissible to claim that natural luminosity and buddha nature (buddhagarbha) are experiencers of karma and results, that they grow weary of saṃsāra, and that they strive for liberation from it. It is inadmissible that they are sentient beings. It is inadmissible that they are a self. It is inadmissible that natural luminosity is firmly immersed in the states of saṃsāra.

If *sugatagarbha were a self and sentient being that can be a basis for karma and results, it would absurdly follow that buddha nature (buddhagarbha) doctrine gives rise to the view of self (ātmadṛṣti) held by Buddhist and non-Buddhist extremists (tīrthika). And, if a sentient being were *sugatagarbha, it would absurdly follow either that [1] [this buddha nature] would never be liberated from saṃsāra or, conversely, that [2] for the deluded state of consciousness, saṃsāra would have never ever existed, even conventionally. The evidence (rtags) that sentient beings experience suffering is not acceptable as the proof from effect ('bras rtags) that buddha nature (buddhagarbha) is a sentient being because it does not logically follow that these two are [related as] cause and effect. It is also evident that the meaning of the quotation from the Śrīmālā does not support your explanation of it and that the intent of those having extensive learning you refer to also does not support that.

Let us explain this step by step. If the results of karmic joys and sorrows were experienced by natural luminosity and buddha nature (buddhagarbha) then this “experiencer” would have to have performed virtuous and nonvirtuous karma. More to the point, if it produced nonvirtue, then its mind-stream would have been encumbered with emotionally-afflicted intentions. And in this case, the natural luminosity and quintessence would have carried out karmic deeds and emotional afflictions. If so, one would have to accept that buddha nature (buddhagarbha) and natural luminosity commit the deeds that incur immediate results and the rest. Therefore, if the agent and experiencer is natural luminosity, then this so-called “natural luminosity” would be natural luminosity in name only. And in that case, by accepting that [buddha] nature and luminosity are encumbered with karma, emotional afflictions and their results, it would absurdly follow that they are not beyond the truths of suffering and its source and would therefore be something to relinquish.
Were it possible for buddha nature (buddhagarbha) and natural luminosity to experience karma and its results, it would absurdly follow that even later, when perfectly complete awakening [has occurred], karma would still be accumulated and its results experienced because there would be no fundamental difference between earlier and later. Also, were it possible for these to serve as the basis for karma and results, the fallacious consequence would follow that buddha nature (buddhagarbha) is beset by heat and cold, hunger and thirst. Not only that, but countless other deleterious [effects] would transpire, such as the flesh and blood of one buddha nature (buddhagarbha) becoming food for another buddha nature (buddhagarbha).

Furthermore, natural luminosity and buddha nature (buddhagarbha) do not need to strive for the goal of liberation because they are already fully liberated from the states of saṃsāra. [Buddha] nature and natural luminosity do not entertain thoughts of seeking liberation because they are beyond the sphere of intellectual thought. They do not need to attain liberation because they are already established as the ultimate object of refuge that is devoid of the dichotomy between cause and effect. They are not a sentient being because they are the great awakening, primordially endowed with the inconceivable, inexhaustible qualities of the five spiritual embodiments (kāya) that are completely beyond mind, ego-mind, and consciousness. They do not for a moment possess mind and mental factors because they are devoid of the unbroken chain of latent tendencies and have, in essence, never been contaminated by the defilement of debilitating malaise. They are not a sentient being because they are the embodiment of reality (dharmakāya) and the wisdom of the expanse of reality (dharmadhātu) that are fully replete with buddha-qualities. They are not a sentient being because it is not possible for their mode of abiding to come within reach until the stream of the ten spiritual levels has culminated in complete perfection. So, you can forget about natural luminosity and the like being a self!

[Mi bskyod rdo rje:] This would have the absurd consequence that all impure sentient beings would dwell exclusively in the supreme vehicle. Why? Because all these [beings] have the belief in self and this view of self [must be] based on natural luminosity and the quintessence which [you take as] the basis for the view of self. This is entailed because when anyone perceives buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) and natural luminosity, not only are these [seen to be] merely imputed as a self, but it is [further] taught that when an individual hears only “natural luminosity” and “*sugatagarbha” without being afraid of them, he must have previously heard the [Dharma] wheel of definitively overcoming the self (bdag ldog). Such [individuals] were described as “fortunate beings who performed sublime deeds for countless former buddhas”. Not only that, but it was taught that in the mind-streams of those who see natural luminosity and *sugatagarbha, thoughts of selves of phenomena and persons do not arise at all. So, this [argument] of yours is also not reasonable!

Further, if you explain that buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) is what is designated as self, then there follow drawbacks such as the absurdities that this buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) is nonexistent, that it is the false conventional, and that it is a baseless subject [of experience]. In particular, if [buddha] nature was that which is imputed as the self of persons, there would follow errors such as the absurdities that the natural luminosity is eliminated by [the Path of] Seeing of all three vehicles and that natural luminosity is [only] nominally existent.

Moreover, does this statement that “natural luminosity is firmly immersed in the states of saṃsāra” mean: [1] It is firmly immersed separately as a different essence from saṃsāra?

Moreover, were it the case that natural luminosity is firmly immersed in the states of saṃsāra, then even though saṃsāra is impermanent, if [luminosity] were firmly immersed in that flux, it would have to be immersed impermanently due to the necessity that it is immersed via equal entailment with the flux of saṃsāra. If so, it would absurdly follow that natural luminosity is impermanent. Moreover, it would absurdly follow that buddha nature (buddhagarbha) would have to circle around in the five life-worlds and nine levels of the three realms.
And if that was accepted, buddha nature (buddhagarbha)would have a body of karmic maturation as described [in the Mahākāruṇikakuvākyastotra (MKS)]:

Moreover, among the sūtras, it is said that if buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) doctrine is taught without being preceded by selflessness, then it would be wrongly imputed as a self among those of inferior intelligence, and thus be a great detriment. It is also said that those of great intelligence do not become attached in any way to *sugatagarbha as being self or no self, real or unreal, and so forth. But these statements would not be tenable [to you] because, on your account, the Bhagavān has taught that when those fortunate ones whose unrefined minds lack virtue analyze things carefully, *sugatagarbha itself turns out to be the self or sentient being that is able to serve as a basis for karma and results. From that it follows that the wheel of scriptural transmission of *sugatagarbha discourses clearly showed that it is *sugatagarbha, and not the [false] personalistic view, that is the [real] basis of the view of self [maintained by] Buddhist and non-Buddhist extremists. To that extent, you and your followers should make the announcement that it is really the “view of *sugatagarbha” and not the “personalistic view” that belongs to the set the five [wrong] views!

In short, you assert Gzhan stong is great and it appears you have also written a commentary on the Uttaratantra [RGV], but as for the pretense that you are commenting on the intent of the final wheel by reasoning along the lines of these [foregoing] proclamations—forget about them being a commentary on the final wheel [of Dharma]! They are a wrong explanation even of the meaning of the phrase “first, the rejection of demerit.” In that regard, even the lower of the [Buddhist] philosophical schools, the Vātsīputrīya sect, having falsely asserted a personal self which can be described as neither substantially separate from, nor identical with, the aggregates, was unable to definitely maintain a substantially existent self. Whereas you have settled on the understanding that the subtle sentient being and self constitute buddha nature (*sugatagarbha). Thus, you repudiate the general doctrinal system of the Buddhists according to which the aggregates and the like are nominalized as a “self.”

Moreover, it absurdly follows that the Bhagavān by having taught this buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) doctrine set up an obstacle to liberation because it would be a cause that produces a subtle view of the self that is exceedingly difficult to get rid of. And if a view of self is produced in this way, it is not like the view of self postulated among the personalistic views because it is not a self [identified with one or more] of the perishable aggregates. Although this [latter] view of self can be relinquished as it is a baseless subject (gzhi med pa'i yul can), according to your view, since buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) is claimed to be a self and sentient being, one is unable to reject the self if one doesn't reject [buddha] nature or natural luminosity. And, although it is [clearly] inappropriate to reject [buddha] nature and natural luminosity, according to you it is not inappropriate because you are compelled to knowingly explain things the wrong way around.

In this regard, you explain that *sugatagarbha is a self and also an agent, citing scriptural support from the Laṅkāvatāra. Were that the case, it would absurdly follow that sentient beings would have to persist permanently in saṃsāra without ever passing to nirvāṇa, like the Creator (byed po) preached by nonBuddhists. This follows because the primary cause for not taking rebirth in saṃsāra cannot be other than the insight that realizes selflessness which is a natural outflow of dharmadhātu and *sugatagarbha, yet, according to you, [buddha] nature itself is a self and a sentient being. How can you undermine yourself like that! On that account, to extinguish a fire, one needs water, but if the “water” [is only] fuel for the fire, what [other] strategies are you going to look for?

Moreover, based on the evidence that suffering is experienced by sentient beings, forget about this [counting as] correct reasoning from effect that sentient beings are buddhagarbha and dharmadhātu and natural luminosity. If one sets out to prove it in that way, it is nonprobative and is moreover proof of the opposite. It is like this: if one advances the proposition “the subject (dharmin) buddhagarbha is a sentient being because it [i.e., buddha nature] experiences suffering,” this is not proven. On the other hand, if one advances the proposition “the subject 'sentient being' is the buddhagarbha because it [i.e., the sentient being] experiences suffering,” this is proof of the opposite because given that buddhagarbha is characterized as genuine bliss, if it is established in terms of brute suffering, then this rules out that [the experiencer of suffering] is buddhagarbha.

In general, if you endorse a self that experiences sorrows and joys while at

Furthermore, [your] quotation from the Śrīmālā[devīsiṃhanādanirdeśasūtra] [ŚDS] is not scriptural support [for the view] that buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) experiences suffering. Rather, there were some instances where the Bhagavān indicated the ālayavijñāna by means of the term “[buddha] nature” in order to graciously take on board Mind Only proponents. With this intent, however, he in these cases considered the ālayavijñāna which experiences suffering to be the aspect of karmic ripening (vipāka) but he did not consider it to be the aspect of karmic seeds (bīja) and the like. Thus there is no chance that your wrong explanation can ever fool us.

Furthermore, it is not found among the intended meanings [articulated] by those teachers having extensive knowledge. As the Tarkajvālā [TJ] states,

Thus, in conventional language use, even we ascribe the word “self” to consciousness because it is said that “consciousness is the self because it is what takes rebirth.” Consequently, the label is applied to the assemblage of the body and the senses. In this regard, the following has been stated:
For example, just as the thought of a “chariot”
Is based on an assemblage of parts,
Likewise a “sentient being” is conventionally designated
Based upon the [assemblage of] psychophysical aggregates.

The upshot of this passage is: you can forget about [buddha] nature being a self. [The passage] has not even demonstrated that consciousness is a self, because what it clearly shows is that the basis of designation of the self is the perishable aggregates. In this regard, the idea in this context is not to precisely analyze a conventional “self,” but just to show that it is conventionally [imputed] in that way. Therefore, conventionally, consciousness is precisely the five aggregates together with the attendant factors that occur contemporaneously with them.

It is asserted from the Vaibhāṣikas upward that [consciousness] accumulates karma, which projects and establishes the five psychophysical aggregates of another rebirth. So, when this [identification] is taken as the basis, it is accordingly said that “consciousness (etc.) is the self because it is what takes rebirth.” The terms “cause for arising” and so on naturally summarize this. In this context, even the meaning of the expression “self” is not [meant] to show that the [aggregates] are a self but [to show] that they are the object of the mode of grasping belonging to the metaphysical view of self that is based on the instinctual clinging to a sense of “I.” It was therefore explained in this way from the perspective of this very consciousness being viewed as “I” and the other four aggregates being grasped as “mine.” To make this clear, that [text] goes on to say that it is only the assemblage of body and senses that is labeled as a self because scriptural citations like [the one above starting with] “For example…,” clearly showed that the collection-universal is precisely what is described conventionally in terms of “sentient being” and “self.” [But] as you cite this as scriptural support for your main premise that the assemblage is not described as a “sentient being,” I am astounded at how you thereby undermine your own claim!

As for the meaning of a quotation from Candrakīrti that you cite as scriptural support for your main premise: It is not the case that it shows [the quintessence] to be the agent [“doer”] of the karma of sentient beings or the experiencer of suffering. Rather, in order to indicate how the mind and mental factors function as causal and contemporaneous motivations of virtuous and nonvirtuous karma, that [passage, viz., MA VI.84d] states that [bodhisattvas] “understand that the agent is 'only mind.'

Furthermore, according to proponents of the rival position: “Even the true reality (de kho na nyid) of the self as explained in the extraordinary Unsurpassed [tantras], when examined by a subtle mind, is [seen to be] designated with the name 'true reality' and its meaning must actually be explained as a 'self'. When linked with the [Sanskrit] term āhaṃ (“I”), it is declared to be [the yoga of] higher union (shin tu 'byor ba).” This is untenable. If “the true reality of self” is explained as “self,” then in the context of the Creation Stages (bskyed rim), it absurdly follows that this in no way differs from the yogas of the non-Buddhist Mantra [systems]. When the [so-called] purification of self (bdag gi dag pa), which needs to be explained in the sense of “selflessness,” is instead explained along the lines of “self-identification” (bdag tu 'dzin pa), then it absurdly follows that it becomes necessary to explain the vital principal (srog) of the Creation Stages in a perverse way. And when explained in that way, it [also] follows that even the authentic selfhood (bdag dam pa), which constitutes the essence of dharmakāya, has to be identified with the [reified] self.

Moreover, the non-Buddhists do not accomplish the two embodiments (kāya) by amassing the two stores [of merits and wisdom] as the requisite purpose of generating the Secret Mantra deity. In particular, they do not understand, by way of amassing the store of wisdom, that the self in essence and the true reality of the deity are empty. Hence, they do not surmount the peak of worldly existence. As a consequence of these [factors], they are absorbed resolutely in the self and this is [their] meditation. This and your own methods of cultivating the Creation Stages are not different as [both] are methods that do not meditate on the true nature of the self as being empty. Even the vital points of your Creation Stages do not surmount the methods of deity meditation among the nonBuddhists.

The need to take the true reality of self in the sense of “purification of self” is the life-force of the path of Great Secret Vajrayāna. This is because if one hasn't done so, then the foundation for implementing the Creation Stages together with their practices becomes distorted. Thus, the purpose of the Creation Stages—i.e., the basis of creation which requires [imaginatively] creating step by step the embodiments (kāya) and wisdoms of the fully perfect buddha together with the created aspects [the objects of visualization]—must be explained in terms of the essence of the two kinds of selflessness. But by identifying it as a “self” you have misrepresented a great doctrinal point which concerns the quest for the goal of liberation.

This is because insofar as one accepts the very buddha nature (buddhagarbha) and natural luminosity as a self, buddha nature (buddhagarbha)—authentic selfhood (bdag dam pa)—is present only as that [reified self].

Moreover, for you, when buddha nature (buddhagarbha) [is said to] be present in all sentient beings, it is not buddha which is present. Rather, it is something that is of a similar kind to the buddha which is present. As for this similarity ('dra ba), it is the “distinct set of six cognitive domains” [advanced in Yogācāra gotra theory]. Thus, declaring that “something similar to that exists in sentient beings,” you cite as scriptural support the glorious Karmapa Rang byung [rdo rje]. But this is not justified because the inadmissibility of introducing a dichotomy between a “buddha” and “its nature” has already been shown above.

It is therefore inadmissible for you to cite [this] as the intent of the glorious Karmapa Rang byung [rdo rje] in line with your own speculative ideas. Why is that? Because [to speak of] that which is just “similar to” a buddha's uncontaminated [nature] is perforce to say that it is not really that. [But] in that case, there is no way not to explain that similarity as a [mere] representation (ākāra). Well then, the cause that transmits such a representation can be nothing other than the uncontaminated buddhagarbha [itself]. If so, the absurd consequence follows that buddha nature is taken as an apprehended object by all sentient beings because it has been stated [in Pramāṇavārttika (PV) II.224ab]:

Besides the reality of causes,
There is nothing else called “apprehended object.”

According to people like you, “our so-called 'similarity' is not explained as 'this object being like that one'. Rather, we explain similarity in the sense of a 'cause' [being concordant with its result]. Thus, we are [really] thinking about the cause of buddhahood.” Even so, the very drawbacks we outlined previously remain in force. That is not all: to declare such a simulacrum to be buddha nature (buddhagarbha) itself and to also declare that it is self-caused would be a violation [of norms of reasoning]. In general, moreover, buddha nature (buddhagarbha) is not an independently-existent [entity] because it remains essentially free from all doing and has involved no deliberate effort from the very start. Not only that, but contra [your] claim that an “aspect similar” (cha 'dra) to the uncontaminated exists in sentient beings, the meaning of the classical scriptures is that the actual uncontaminated awareness exists in sentient beings. It is conclusive that you have not understood this because the Ratnagotravibhāga [RGV I.104c] says that

…uncontaminated awareness exists in embodied beings, like honey.

Reply: Buddha nature (buddhagarbha) is not a case of “x is similar to y” because it is precisely what is termed “primordially present supreme buddha” or “completely illuminated primordial victor” or “primal protector.” Moreover, the meaning of the term “distinct set of six cognitive domains” is not explained as a special feature (khyad chos) of the “six cognitive domains”—i.e., the object having the special feature (khyad gzhi)—because it is explained as something that is distinct from (khyad par gyi chos shig), which is to say, “other than,” the six cognitive domains of sentient beings. This has also been designated as the “substratum wisdom” (kun gzhi'i ye shes).

Moreover, I shall explain the authoritative words of the glorious Karmapa Lalita[vajra, i.e., Rang byung rdo rje] that were quoted by you. In that regard, the following is quoted by you:

The spiritual potential (rigs) is such that the triad of body, speech, and mind of sentient beings body, speech, and mind (lus ngag yid) are aspects similar ('dra ba'i cha) to the body, speech, and mind (sku gsung thugs) of the Tathāgata. That is stated in the glorious Hevajra[tantra II.ii.45]:
[The (visualized) deity's form]
Is present only as something born,
Being an arrangement of arms, face, and colors.
However, [the visualization is meaningful] because of the ordinary latent tendencies.

And Hevajra[tantra II.iv.64d],
Sentient beings are [already] the Lord [Īśvara] of the ten levels.
These and other passages are discussed in detail.

If this presentation was explained in connection with the many [topics] such as the Maturation and Liberation [stages] respectively, the maṇḍala and its retinue, and the self-blessing (svādiṣṭhāna), there would be a torrent of many extensive explanations. But were we to explain it in that way, we would abandon what is here the subject of disputation. Therefore, if we stick with what is relevant here, then, in general, I see what is pertinent to be precisely the explanation in terms of [1] the ground of the clearing process, [2] the objects to be cleared, [3] the clearing process and [4] the result of the clearing process.

In this regard, there are [A] explanations of correspondence in terms of homologous phenomena, and [B] explanations of correspondence in terms of purification.

However, from the perspective of consciousness, things apprehended separately, being of the nature of interdependence, are thus interconnected as homologous phenomena insofar as they are mutually dependent as factors to be relinquished and their antidotes—this is the profound key point of the Unsurpassed Vajrayāna. So, in the case of such similarities, having first discussed them in language [emphasizing] connections according to homologous instances, they are ultimately ascertained as heterologous instances. By directly recognizing the factors to be relinquished and antidotes separately, one eliminates the factors to be relinquished and completes the activation of the antidotes. The purpose of the Vajra path is thereby fulfilled.

The category of impure psychophysical aggregates and elements and the rest are the body, speech, and mind of sentient beings, but these are only numerically similar to the [adamantine] body, speech, and mind of buddhas. Consequently, when you meditate on the imagined deities (kun btags kyi lha), there arise cognitions (rnam rig) of many things such as the four impure birth places, heads and limbs, and so forth. Also, among the assembly of deities belonging to the clearing process, there may be similarities [with humans] in terms of numbers and aspects. As for their difference, however, the aspects to be relinquished are the ordinary latent tendencies while, conversely, what does not form an unbroken series of latent tendencies is the essence of supreme wisdom.

[B] As for explanations of correspondence in terms of purification: When the triad of body, speech, and mind of sentient beings is purified away, the body, speech, and mind of buddhas that have been obscured by these [former], become apparent from the perspective of consciousness. Hence, insofar as impure aspects give way to pure ones, they are metaphorically designated as being “similar to them.” For example, it is said that “the triad of body, speech, and mind, once purified, is the three embodiements (kāya).” And [by way of commentary to Hevajra II.iv.64b],

When what has adhered to the womb of a sentient being for ten months together with its negativities has been purified, it becomes the Lord of the ten levels.

This is the main point (don po) of the Mantra scriptures of Vajrayāna. However, [you talk about] something “resembling a buddha” and sometimes talk about sentient beings as if they were real and other times as if they were not— [such] ideas are not well-grounded. Therefore, the meaning [of the tantric scriptures] is not that sentient beings possess a thing that is totally unreliable that [you] called “similar”.

In short, according to this teacher who propounds the rival position, “what obtains as the nature of things” (dharmatā)—viz., an aspect similar to ('dra ba'i cha) the buddha within sentient beings—is the naturally present spiritual potential. That aspect which becomes increasingly similar to a buddha—being of a similar kind (rigs 'dra ba) to it—by producing the roots of virtue such as learning and so on, is the unfolded spiritual potential. So, finally, when it becomes very similar (shin tu 'dra ba), it turns into this very buddha. Also, the means of turning into [a buddha] are the qualities for cleansing the spiritual element, such as faith.

To summarize, [you have] stated that “the quintessence (garbha), which exists in sentient beings is not the quintessence of a buddha (buddhagarbha) but rather the quintessence of a sentient being (sattvagarbha).” This is untenable. It was shown that it was a mistake to have not correctly identified the naturally present spiritual potential and the unfolded spiritual potential. [For you, they] are not actual, so however similar to it they may be, they do not [actually] become that. Hence, it was shown that in the system of this master and disciple, their claims have been adulterated by the views and tenets of Rje Tsong kha pa and his disciples.

In that regard, the naturally present potential is precisely the extinction of all flaws and the total consummation of qualities. It is primordial buddhahood. It is the state of complete spiritual awakening. Even when, from the perspective of consciousness, the potential later becomes the buddha[hood] in which defilements are purified away, it has not become better than before. Since this [potential] is always and already inseparable from buddha nature (buddhagarbha) that is free from defilements, it is able to fully display all the activities of a buddha. However, there are some who say that suchness possessing defilements is unable to display these buddha-activities because it is like a knife that cannot be taken from its scabbard and so forth. But this is only a belief-system of those who propound incorrect [views].

Having unerringly identified the naturally present potential, when it comes to the unfolded potential, it may seem from the standpoint of [mundane] consciousness as though certain aspects of buddha nature (buddhagarbha) manifest due to adventitious defilements having been purified away. Moreover, although the naturally present potential is present as the abiding condition for those under the influence of wisdom itself, when it comes to the unfolded potential, it seems from the perspective of conventional consciousness as if something not previously awakened had awakened. Hence, [this] is of provisional meaning because something already awakened (gdod 'tshang) cannot [actually] blossom (rgya) [into awakening]. Moreover, in taking what is not actual as the basis for that which is actual, however similar it ends up being, it will never become that because the very nature [of the actual] is undifferentiated. It is similar to identical twins [among] donkeys and cattle. According to a classical text on reasoning:

Because it is similar, it is not the actual one.

Furthermore, proponents of the rival position proclaim that “naturally luminous mind is seen by means of fixation [meditation] without the cessation of appearances of the sixfold [consciousness].” [Your] juxtaposition of [buddha] nature and the view of self is similar to aspects of the system of the master [Tsong kha pa] Blo bzang ba, yet [you] proclaim that [your] meditation system is in accord with whatever is maintained by those who are nowadays renowned as [Mahā]mudrā proponents. But whether or not there is freedom via such paths is discernable by those who have attained the great eye of dharma with regard to canonical literature. Thus, the master and disciple who are the authors of this so-called Rgyud gsum gsang ba are known to have knowingly accepted as “authentic dharma” and taken as the essence of their practice those teachings which had been identified as “heretical” (chos min) by [former scholar-translators] such as Lo chen Rin chen bzang po and Lo chen Blo ldan shes rab and Sa lo and Bu ston Lo tsā. To these people [master and disciple] let me say the following:

Because the six modes of consciousness Are adventitious defilements,
However people may fix [their minds] on these, They will never see natural luminosity.
This Melodious Joy that casts far away such Views and tenets intoxicates us with ecstatic bliss!

We shall now critically examine the presentation of [buddha] nature (garbha) of
the illustrious Shākya mchog ldan. In his Cakrasaṃvara Commentary, he states,

Thus, it is determined that samsaric phenomena are mere appearances before consciousness and that nirvanic phenomena are the experienced objects of wisdom. Among these, the latter do not need to be analyzed at this stage. Among the two factors of consciousness—i.e., [1] the factor of dual appearances [of] looking outward through the sense-gates at substances or characteristics and [2] the factor of the clear and knowing [cognition] (gsal rig) looking inward, [1] the first is [defined as] conventional saṃsāra, the factor consisting in the defilements that are posited as saṃsāra and the apprehended aspects of consciousness, the knowable objects. [2] The latter is defined as the ultimate saṃsāra, natural nirvāṇa, the apprehending aspect, and that which designated as 'wisdom.' Since the abiding nature of all conventional phenomena does not exist apart from these alone, it is impossible for them not to be pervaded by the tathāgatagarbha that is called a “continuum” (tantra) and that is the ultimate Saṃvara maṇḍala (don dam pa'i 'dus dkyil) of all phenomena. As has been stated [Hevajratantra (HT) I.viii.41cd], 
By me is this all pervaded.
Another nature of the world [of beings] is not seen. And, as noted by the venerable Ghaṇṭapāda.
All these beings are the naturally accomplished maṇḍala
That is nondual.

Though published this way, it is untenable.

It is not tenable that the abiding condition of saṃsāra is buddha nature (*sugatagarbha). Neither is it tenable that the factor of the [mundane] clear and knowing [cognition], which is the inwardlooking consciousness, is wisdom. Neither is it admissible that this clear and knowing consciousness is nirvāṇa. It is a mistake to identify “ultimate saṃsāra” with the saṃsāra appearing before conventional consciousness. Given that both the apprehended aspect—i.e., the outward orientation of consciousness—and the inward-looking self-awareness are adventitious defilements, it is untenable to distinguish them in line with the two truths. It is also a mistake to explain that which is called the “subjective aspect” ('dzin rnam) to be the nondual wisdom that is accepted by the Mādhyamikas. When you align the meanings of the [above] two quotations with [mundane] consciousness, you misrepresent a key point of the Vajrayāna.

In general, moreover, to the extent that something persists as the mode of abiding, it cannot be anything but the ultimate buddha nature (*sugatagarbha). Be that as it may, the abiding mode of saṃsāra is not empty in the sense of nonexistence (med stong): this is your basic premise and we accept it as well. So, in that case, if the *sugatagarbha were emptiness qua nonexistence, then it would transcend neither the extreme of nihilism nor discursive elaborations. So, all the refutations you have made in your own scriptures to repudiate claims that *sugatagarbha is emptiness qua nonexistence would end up undermining you yourself, the “Great One.” [Now,] you don't maintain, as some people do, that there is no mode of abiding, but [only] an imputed mode of abiding. Consequently, if you accept in conventional terms an abiding mode of all conventional phenomena or the whole of saṃsāra, then this abiding mode does not transcend the [truths of] suffering and its source. It follows that the abiding mode of saṃsāra is not established as a garbha (snying po).

The same holds for that which [you call] the inward-looking and outwardlooking [factors] of consciousness. Since there is no difference between them inasmuch as they are the clear and knowing factor, which is [just] a hallmark of [mundane] consciousness, even these two streams of this clear and knowing factor stem from the element (dhātu) of karmically conditioned predispositions (saṃskāra). And because it is [just] a hallmark of other-dependent cognition (paratantravijñāpti), and because such knowing also consists in the knowledgebearer (shes pa can), which arises from the substratum consciousness (ālayavijñāna) like waves from water, it does not transcend the adventitious defilements that are to be relinquished. So, how could that [clear and knowing cognition] possibly be wisdom?

Likewise, it could not possibly be nirvāṇa because being the inward-looking [factor] among the two basic factors stemming from the samsaric consciousness, it is [identified by you as] self-aware cognition. This self-aware direct perception (svasaṃvedanapratyakṣa) is not nirvāṇa because in the context of codifying types of thinking, this is said to exist in all ordinary individuals and is therefore sharply separated from yogic direct perception (yogipratyakṣa). So, it is not at all correct [to call it] nirvāṇa. Having asserted more than once that “ultimate saṃsāra” is *sugatagarbha, you nonetheless assert that this has no connection at all with [mundane] consciousness. Thus, by claiming that the inward-looking consciousness is ultimate saṃsāra, you contradict your own words!

That is not all: the inward-looking factor of a sentient being's cognition circles around in saṃsāra and all the representations (rnam pa : ākāra) that constitute the three realms appear before it. But this would mean that *sugatagarbha, which is [your] so-called “ultimate saṃsāra,” would circle in saṃsāra and would have the representational cognition that knows the appearances of all these aspects that constitute the three realms. This same consciousness engenders two modes of seeing—seeing its own self-nature and [seeing] its external objects. But these two remain cognitions of subject and object—they do not last for a moment, are fictitious and deceptive. Since you have thereby introduced a dichotomy within conventional truth between the ultimate truth as the inwardlooking and conventional truth as the outward-looking, you declare what is [generally] recognized as conventional truth to be the ultimate truth. As a result, your philosophy is fundamentally mistaken.

Reply: This is indeed claimed by the Alīkākāravāda-Cittamātra. According to the commentary on epistemology (tshad ma'i ṭīkā) that I wrote in my previous lifetime [as the seventh Karma pa],

During the time that external objects do not really exist, at that time, due to the power of the latent tendencies, subsequent thoughts cling to appearances as forms, sounds and the rest as objects. But apart from the apprehended aspect, there is no other knowable object. Consequently, the apprehended aspect—the awareness that is the part of the object that has the characteristic of experience—is the result ('bras bu), whereas the so-called “apprehending aspect”— i.e., that having the characteristic of determining the essence of the cognition itself—is the valid sources of knowledge (pramāṇa). For that reason, the designation “self-awareness” applies to all cognitions. Whatever is the apprehended aspect is the reliably knowable object (prameya) because until genuine wisdom has dawned, any apprehended aspect that is not invalidated by conventional valid sources of knowledge must itself be taken as the knowable object.
The way this account is presented is also how I maintain it in this lifetime. [But] the Alīkākāravāda-Cittamātra proponents, having ascertained the cognition of apparent objects as being self-awareness, establish this very self-awareness in terms of two modalities. Hence, they claim that the apprehended aspect is the factor consisting in defilements whereas the apprehending aspect is wisdom.

Furthermore, the meaning of the quotations [you cited above] is that apart from the Three Jewels specific to Vajrayāna and those within the circle of the maṇḍala, it is not possible, even by the power of a buddha's wisdom, to establish [the existence of] any so-called “transmigrating sentient beings.” Further, you should have explained that these sorts of things are, by nature, primordially nonexistent. But instead, you explained that the Vajrayāna maṇḍala-beings [i.e., deities] pervade [or encompass] transmigrating sentient beings. You have thereby misrepresented a profound secret point. Therefore, what [you] postulate as the highest of views and as something supreme—however [you may have] rearranged the doxographical categories of your philosophical systems—does not go beyond that of the Alīkākāravāda-Cittamātra proponents.

Those worthy persons who follow the venerable Karmapa Rang byung [rdo rje] and who expound the Yogācāra-Madhyamaka should make sure that they are not adversely influenced by the exegetical tradition of this system [of Shākya mchog ldan]. Furthermore, according to this treatise of the opponent:

Query: How does karmic ripening adventitiously arise from the dharmadhātu? To give an illustration, the continuum of the ground phase or wisdom of dharmadhātu, which is akin to Devadatta who sees [only] what is here and now, exists as something indeterminate that can flow either into the six classes of migratory beings in saṃsāra or onto the path of nirvāṇa. In that regard, after the agent (byed pa po), Devadatta, performs an action, committing some nonvirtue or contaminated virtue, in the second moment when [the action] has ceased, its latent tendencies or defilements arise in the dharmadhātu wisdom, in the manner of something separable and adventitious, like reflections of a face or the image of a moon [appearing] in a bright polished silver mirror on the surface of a lake. In the wake of their appearing, the agent again and again creates the conditions for arousing the latent tendencies so that these latent tendencies ripen into the states of any of the six classes of migratory beings. In that regard, [the deeds] are called “ripening” and “all seeds” because after they have already ripened—such as in the desires realm—they function as the seeds of latent tendencies of all states of being, and because they are [also] able to stimulate all change like the fructifying activities of water and manure.

It appears you have published this, [but] it is untenable. Devadatta's getting embroiled in committing sundry virtuous and nonvirtuous deeds has no bearing at all on buddha nature (*sugatagarbha). Were the [one] plausibly related to the [other] in any way, this would be the very height of absurdity! Were the pure to serve as the basis for the impure, it would be impossible to have [any] conviction in purity. If latent tendencies and defilements crop up in [buddha] nature, it would absurdly follow that [buddha] nature consists in the debilitating malaise of saṃsāra. If the dharmadhātu and [buddha] nature [can] go in divergent [directions], either along the paths of saṃsāra or nirvāṇa, it would absurdly follow that the [traditionally accepted] impossibility of [buddha] nature—as the perfect [nature] (pariniṣpanna)—to be fettered or liberated would not obtain. If the dharmadhātu itself were the basis of defilements, then your repeated maṇi-chanting[-like] recitation that “we must differentiate between substratum consciousness and substratum wisdom” would lose all relevance.

On the one hand, you say that “in the corpus of definitive meaning comprising both sūtras and tantras it is impossible for anything like conventional appearances to ever arise in buddha nature (buddhagarbha) and wisdom.” This is [like] fearfully avoiding a little water in a drainage ditch. On the other hand, you say that “the latent tendencies of saṃsāra deposited by conventional karma arise in that buddha nature.” This is [like] hiking up your lower robe and fording a big river. [Your] faults are exposed more and more! Moreover, the virtuous and nonvirtuous deeds committed by this-worldly Devadatta, apart from accruing to the mind-stream of this-worldly Devadatta himself, cannot possibly adulterate the *sugatagarbha, which is supreme and other (gzhan mchog). This is because it is impossible that conditioned activities proceed from the unconditioned.

Yet, since you [also] assert that buddha nature (buddhagarbha) is a functional surrogate of naturally pure awakening, it absurdly follows [from your claim] that this [so-called] surrogate of naturally pure awakening in oneself and others is [both] a warehouse manager who stores a whole range of latent tendencies of virtuous and nonvirtuous deeds of sentient beings and the warehouse [itself]. And, were it possible that [buddha nature] could be contaminated at all, then even in its state of fruition—i.e., as the buddhahood free from defilements, which you yourself accept—it would still store the latent tendencies of the karma of all sentient beings. This is because, in general, the dharmadhātu and buddha nature (buddhagarbha) would be what stores the latent tendencies of that karma. If these [tendencies] are stored by it, it stands to reason that even buddha nature in the phase of fruition would store and give rise to these karmic latent tendencies.

This is entailed because according to you, even the buddha nature (buddhagarbha) as fruition—apart from its conventional usage as a name for [its] mode of appearing—is the actual buddha nature (buddhagarbha) of the ground phase. This conclusion is deduced from accepting [your] basic premise. In general, if all nonvirtue and obscurations arise within *sugatagarbha, then all sins and downfalls would arise within *sugatagarbha and dharmadhātu as well. And if sins and downfalls arise in dharmadhātu, then even in the nature of things (dharmatā) [realized in] the meditative equipoise on the nature of things, the evils and downfalls of this-worldly Devadatta would arise. Such would be the [consequences] for you! Moreover, this theory about some dharmadhātu that is indeterminate in that it can go either into saṃsāra or nirvāṇa—that is, it may later go any which way according to conditions of contaminated or uncontaminated karma—has no precedent either in India or Tibet.

Moreover, if [buddha] nature possessing two purities is taken as the foundation and basis for the arising of impure obscurations and so forth, then it is impossible for it to be endowed with the two purities.

Reply: This is not entailed: since you have claimed that the buddhagarbha endowed with two purities is indeterminate, going either into saṃsāra or nirvāṇa, wherein lies the certainty that something that is only adventitiously pure in character will go to nirvāṇa? Moreover, the absurd consequence follows that the quintessence and dharmadhātu appropriates all the appearances of environments, sense objects, and bodies of saṃsāra. This is so because when all the causes and results of saṃsāra have been appropriated by that [buddha nature] just as reflections are taken up by a mirror, then [buddha nature undergoes] a series of rebirths via the paths of saṃsāra, [one of which] exclaims “I am the teacher Shākya mchog pa!” and he goes [as well].

If this dharmadhātu encounters conditions such as the source [of suffering, i.e., the second truth], it goes into saṃsāra and if it encounters [conditions] such as the path [i.e., the fourth truth], it becomes nirvāṇa. If that were so, it absurdly follows that the teaching that dharmadhātu is the perfect [nature] that does not become ensnared by any conditions and cannot be fettered or liberated in any way—[insofar as] it is not itself subject to dependence having four [features] such as “I am a true self”—actually does not obtain. This is because whatever goes down the path of saṃsāra due to dependence on nonvirtue, once it goes there, would have to be born from any of the four birth-places. Among these, during the phases of womb-birth, this dharmadhātu would be a mushy embryo (nur nur po : arbuda) that is utterly revolting. The proof is accepted and the entailment is validly ascertained. If you agree, then what is the point of such actions as abandoning the authentic teachings! You need to analyze [your] intentions concerning karma and results. When you maintain that the dharmadhātu is revolting and nauseating,, there are others in the vast territories of this kingdom who are content to settle [their minds] naturally in the dharmadhātu without feeling the least revulsion toward it.

Moreover, if the dharmadhātu is taken as the basis of adventitious defilements, then you need to clearly distinguish between the substratum wisdom (kun gzhi ye shes) and [substratum] consciousness ([kun gzhi] rnam shes). If you don't distinguish them, then it is inappropriate if you explain the substratum, which serves as the basis for adventitious defilements, as being wisdom and *sugatagarbha. Consequently, when anyone contends that it is necessary to accept [this] ālayavijñāna, which is the basis of adventitious defilements, it follows that it is inadmissible to then introduce within that ālaya a distinction between the pure and impure. This is because were it possible of that which is termed *sugatagarbha or dharmadhātu or substratum wisdom (kun gzhi'i ye shes) to function as the basis for the arising of adventitious defilements, then there would not be any role left (mgo bde ma byung ba) for the ālayavijñāna to be the basis of such [defilements].

Moreover, among you and the teachers in your lineage, there is not even one who has penetrated this matter deeply. Some assert that the clarity aspect in the context of the substratum consciousness is the substratum wisdom. Some assert that the clarity aspect that is the intrinsic essence of the substratum consciousness is not conducive to nirvāṇa since it does not transcend saṃsāra. Some claim that saṃsāra manifests in that clarity aspect which is the substratum wisdom or [buddha] nature. Therefore, you masters and disciples—is nirvāṇa the clarity aspect of the substratum consciousness or is the substratum consciousness the clarity aspect of the substratum wisdom? Masters and disciples, you must give up this ignoble talk!

You further declare that it is impossible for conventional and samsaric phenomena to ever manifest within a buddha's mirror-like wisdom, declaring this to be the intent of the tradition of Candrakīrti—the most profound Niḥsvabhāvavāda Mādhyamikas—and of Asaṅga and Dignāga—the great Yogācāra Mādhyamikas. But that must be inadmissible because, were it possible that latent tendencies of karma manifest in buddhagarbha, then these could also manifest in the mirror-like wisdom which is primordially present as the essence of the five wisdoms and which constitutes buddhagarbha.

Reply: They have arisen from ignorance itself, which consists in unreal imaginings, just as two moons occur as a result of impaired perception. Now, should you ask from what these unreal imaginings arise, they have not arisen from anything. For example, the two moons of the impaired sense faculties have not arisen from one moon as object. Nor have they arisen from the sense-object, the sense faculties, or the cognition. Yet they haven't arisen from anything other than these. However, due to the causes of this very deception stemming from a constellation of causes of error, there arises the distorted perception, which is deceptive and unreal.

Likewise, ignorance has not arisen from itself nor from dharmadhātu, but neither from anywhere apart from these. Even so, because it has not come from anywhere, it may nonetheless appear as if it has so arisen. It is therefore deceptive and unreal. For these reasons, it is known as “conventional truth” and saṃsāra. Since this is maintained by appeal to the power of facts regarding the dependently [arisen] mode of appearing (snang tshul rten 'brel), I am unable to describe anything besides that. Nonetheless, since the meaning that accords with this profound point has been validly verified through an experience that has not arisen in mind-streams of the others, we cannot make these other old folks have any conviction in it.

In reply to your questions, although there are contexts in which resultant buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) and the “embodiment of the true reality” (chos nyid kyi sku : dharmatākāya) are of the same nature, causal buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) is not dharmakāya. The dharmakāya is [the state in which] the two accumulations are accomplished and the clearing of the two obscurations has been completed. It is free from the obscurations of the five aggregates, twelve cognitive domains, and eighteen elements. The ensemble of the three embodiments (sku gsum) and five wisdoms (ye shes lnga) along with their spontaneous activities, which [together] constitute the fundamental transformation of the eightfold consciousness, is referred to by the term dharmakāya (chos kyi sku).

Now, resultant buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) is twofold: [1] the ultimate natural embodiment (svābhāvikakāya) and [2] the conventional form embodiments (rūpakāya). Here, [1] the first, the cause of the natural embodiment, being primordially pure by nature in the mind-streams of all sentient beings, is not present as the nature of obscuration. As for its names, it is called the “naturally present potential” (prakṛtisthagotra) and “buddha nature in the causal phase” (rgyu dus kyi bder gshegs snying po). And in Mantra[yāna] scriptures, it is called “first buddha” (dang po'i sangs rgyas) and “ground Hevajra” (gzhi kye rdo rje) and the like.”

[2] The second, the cause of the form embodiments, consists in the eleven virtues such as loving care and faith that exist within the mind-streams of all sentient beings. Due to exogenous conditions (gzhan rkyen) such as the appearing of buddhas in the world, one takes up the latent tendency of learning. Thus, the awakening of [such] latent tendencies of virtue is the “unfolded potential” (paripuṣṭagotra). Here, concerning *sugatagarbha in the causal phase (rgyu dus kyi bder gshegs), its several names include “distinct set of six cognitive domains” (ṣaḍāyatanaviśeṣaḥ) and “latent tendencies of learning” (śrutavāsanā).

Now, when mind having the nature of emptiness manifests as the variety of dependently arisen errors—the [state of] bondage of the two obscurations—it is saṃsāra. When mind having the nature of emptiness manifests as the variety of dependently arisen accumulations and purifications without error, the [state of] freedom from the two obscurations, it is nonabiding nirvāṇa. It follows, then, that nirvāṇa is true, whereas saṃsāra is untrue. Therefore, since saṃsāra is delusive and false, it does not belong to the mode of being of objects. Since nirvāṇa is nondeceptive and nondelusive, it is posited as “ultimate truth.” In this regard, however, the positing of saṃsāra as “false” and the ultimate truth as “true” is [applicable only] in the context of asserting the representational ultimate, but not in the context of [asserting] the nonrepresentational ultimate.

In Śrī Candrakīrti's own system, the case for positing the conventional as “truth” is impossible both provisionally and absolutely. Provisionally, only the ultimate is posited as “truth” and, in that instance, concerning its illustrative instance (mtshan gzhi), it was declared [by Nāgārjuna] that “nirvāṇa alone is true.” That said, even the final nirvāṇa is not the definitive ultimate because it is not beyond the conditioned. Thus, in the final [analysis], the “one truth” is also not discovered.

The nondual bliss and emptiness which Mantra scriptures explain as the mahāmudrā of ultimate bliss and emptiness is the meaning of the inseparability known as the unity of bliss and emptiness, the one-flavoredness of the bliss of conventional bodhicitta—i.e., nonreferential love [in] the mind-streams of noble ones belonging to the Vajrayāna and upward—and the emptiness of ultimate bodhicitta that is free from discursive elaborations.

Concerning the [two] adamantine precepts: “The thirty-seven factors conducive to awakening are present [in] buddha nature (tathāgatagarbha)” [GC 1.27] and “These four immeasurables are buddha nature (tathāgatagarbha) and are the very essence of buddhahood” [GC 1.28], it seems [rather] unclear to render a single adamantine precept as two. Thus, if rendered clearly, it would be better to state “*sugatagarbha, the spiritual element, is endowed with the immeasurables such as compassion—which are causes for entering into dharmakāya, buddha wisdom and the great compassion of the Tathāgata—and the factors conducive to awakening such as meditative absorption and insight.”

In this regard, from the previously mentioned [text, RGV I.39], the element of the Tathāgata (tathāgatadhātu) is classified into ten topics: [1] the topic of essence, [2] the topic of cause, [3] the topic of result, [4] the topic of function,
[5] the topic of union, [6] the topic of manifestation, [7] the topic of classification of states, [8] the topic of all-pervasiveness, [9] the topic of immutability, and the topic of inseparability. Among [these], [5] the topic of union is twofold: [5a] the topic of union in the context of cause and [5b] the topic of union in the context of result.

Of [these], the first [5a: union in the context of cause] is as follows. In order for the bodhisattva who is endowed with (ldan pa : yoga) this element (dhātu), i.e., *sugatagarbha, to bring about the fundamental transformation wherein that element—the defiled *sugatagarbha, which is the basis of purification (sbyang gzhi)—becomes undefiled dharmakāya, wisdom (jñāna), and great compassion that are the result of purification (sbyangs 'bras), the purification process (sbyong byed) [itself] involves being endowed with [A] devotion to the Mahāyāna teachings, [B] the avenues of extraordinary samādhis and discerning insight (prajñā), and [C] the proper cultivation of compassion, the practice of perfect conduct.

As for the second [5b: union in the context of result], concerning the result,
dharmakāya, it is taught that the complete and perfect buddha endowed with
*sugatagarbha is endowed with limitless super-knowledges, wisdoms, and qualities in which defilements have been exhausted. In short, however difficult it is to fathom the [buddha-]qualities such as the factors conducive to awakening and the immeasurables in the resultant phase of No More Learning, it is just as difficult to fathom the qualities such as the factors conducive to awakening and the immeasurables that are actualized [by the aspirant]. Hence, it is said that 'endowment' [applies] also to the mind-stream of one on the Path of Learning.

In this regard, from the standpoint that *sugatagarbha is in its nature free from discursive elaboration, it has been considered unchanging and beyond the conditioned. Although it is [at times] characterized as permanent, stable, and so forth, it is nonetheless described as the “*sugatagarbha element” (khams bde gshegs snying po) because it is appropriate [to consider] it a “cause” and a “potential” only in view of dependent arising. This potential is also described as “resultant *sugatagarbha” where it is the result of purification. When *sugatagarbha is considered as cause and result, there are a great many classifications of buddha nature within the framework of specifying its qualities in terms of “essence, cause, result, function, union, manifestation,” and the rest. But, specifically, what has been termed “*sugatagarbha as potential or element” is, in its essential meaning, precisely the cause of perfect buddhahood. This, the highest cause or potential of buddhahood, is the “naturally present” [potential], and what makes it flourish is the “fully acquired” (yang dag par blang ba : samādāna) [potential]. Although [these] are the aspects of the two accumulations of means and insight, the essence of the two accumulations of means and insight is both ultimate and conventional bodhicitta.

It is thought [by the awakened] that one whose mind-stream possesses both is a son of the victor and that the twofold bodhicitta, present as the essence of the twofold accumulation which exists in that person's mind-stream, is realized, this being the very assimilation of buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) as result. Thus, according to the precious Bka' brgyud teaching, by virtue of insight which realizes emptiness, one directly realizes the unity of means and insight. This in turn gives rise to great compassion for all sentient beings oppressed by the suffering that appears, yet has no nature. This has also been given the name “buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) that is present as the cause of buddhahood.” So it has been expounded, yet the illustrious Sa skya Paṇ chen has nonetheless stated [in Sdom gsum rab dbye I.72],

Some claim that the term “*sugatagarbha”
Refers to emptiness with compassion as its essence.
That, however, is what purifies the *sugatagarbha element;
So it is not the actual element itself.

Although that is stated, the Pramāṇavārttikakārikā [PV] says the following:

Compassion is the proof [of buddha being a valid source of knowledge].
That [compassion unfolds] from repeated practice.

Also, the Śikṣāsamuccaya [ŚS] states the following:

One becomes pure in virtue by cultivating
Emptiness having compassion as its essence. [I.73]
Statements like these are proclaimed
In all the sūtras and tantras. [I.74]

As stated [above], it is proclaimed in the sūtras and tantras that the great compassion that realizes emptiness, or great compassion without object reference, is the cause for attaining buddhahood. Thus, what's wrong with [saying] this [compassion] is none other than the element or cause or potential of buddhahood?

Reply: Who asserts that this nonreferential great compassion is not free from discursive elaborations (niṣprapañca)? There is no proof at all that if [such compassion] is the cause, potential, and element of buddhahood that is the cause of the purification process, then it cannot be the cause, potential, and element that is the ground of purification. This is because what is established is just that the very element that is purified and [its] corresponding purification process—i.e., the truth of the path connected with the special two accumulations—are the cause that makes one attain the truth of cessation free from adventitious defilements through this very purification. If [you] think this is not established, then if the truths of the Paths of Seeing and Cultivation linked with the special two accumulations are not the cause of buddhahood, it is incumbent upon you to show what else there is that could be posited as its cause!

In accordance with the doctrine of this precious Bka' brgyud, Rje Red mda' pa states in his Uttaratantra [RGV] commentary that the potential termed “buddhagarbha existing in the mind-streams of sentient beings” is metaphorically designated as the “cause of buddhahood” and is the nature (garbha) present as the cause of bodhisattvas. However, the potential termed “the buddha nature (gshegs snying) of those dwelling on the bodhisattva levels” is also metaphorically designated as the “cause of bodhisattvas” and is the “actual nature” (snying po mtshan nyid) present as the cause of buddhahood. Therefore, the essential meaning of such an explanation is that the buddha element and potential, being the ultimate twofold accumulation as the substantial cause (upādānahetu) of the dharmakāya—i.e., the result that arises as the essence of the two kinds of bodhicitta [conventional and ultimate]—is clearly considered to be the cause of buddhahood itself.

Moreover, in the case of the great Sa paṇ, it would appear he was unable to interpret that [term] *sugatagarbha as anything other than a name for “nonelaboration” (niṣprapañca) and thus took liberties with its meaning. Thus, it appears [he] wrote this statement [in the Sdom gsum rab dbye I.32]:

Hence, because tathāgatagarbha
Is freedom from elaboration,
[It is possible for both buddhahood and saṃsāra
To occur on the part of sentient beings.]

In this case, according to the great translator Rngog [in his] Great Vehicle of Doctrine (Bstan pa'i theg chen), the term *sugatagarbha is a designation which has been variously defined in terms of suchness and cause, path and result, and has [thus] been rendered in myriad ways according to specific contexts of discourse. In light of such renderings, who would reject definitions like those [attested] in all the sūtras and tantras that, since antiquity, have been as renowned as the sun and moon?

In particular, a mind that realizes emptiness and great compassion is proclaimed to be adorned with the excellent potential for buddhahood. In that case, the excellence of the potential that is qualified by virtues such as the great compassion of the Mahāyāna is described as the cause of perfect buddhahood. And, since [the potential] repeatedly takes up the accumulation of such virtue, it has been classified as a [working] basis (rten).

Reply: The meaning of “potential” (gotra) is “to liberate qualities” (guṇa). This [potential] also exists as that emptiness having compassion as its essence which makes buddha-qualities flourish. Thus, it is established as the very cause of buddhahood because that extraordinary cause of buddhahood is nothing other than what is designated by the name “*sugatagarbha as cause”. As is stated [in and MSABh],

It is characterized as the supreme potential
Because of the following reasons:
Superiority, comprehensiveness,
Great significance, and inexhaustibility of virtue.

Here, the potential is shown to be “supreme” on the grounds of four reasons. The reasons are that this potential has roots of virtue which are [1] superior, [2] comprehensive, [3] of great significance, and [4] inexhaustible. [In the case of the śrāvaka potential,] the śrāvaka's roots of virtue [1] are not refined in that way. [2] They are also not comprehensive because of the absence of the powers, fearlessnesses, and so forth. [3] They are also not of great significance because there is no benefit for others. [4] They are also not inexhaustible because they culminate in a nirvāṇa without the remainder of psychophysical aggregates [necessary to work for others]. As for the stanza that distinguishes the characteristics [MSA and MSABh]:

Natural, unfolded,
The founding and founded,
Existent and nonexistent,
It is to be understood in the sense of “liberating the qualities.”

With this [verse Maitreya] shows the spiritual potential to be fourfold: [1] naturally present, [2] acquired, [3] having the nature of a founding basis, and [4] having the nature of the founded, in this sequence. It exists as cause. It does not exist as effect. The potential is to be understood in the sense of liberating spiritual qualities because qualities come out—that is, arise—from it.

In particular, the way in which that *sugatagarbha element posited as the cause of buddhahood is most supreme is summarized [in RGV I.30cd as follows]:

It has its origin in appreciation for the dharma, superior insight, Meditative absorption, and compassion.

To succinctly summarize what has been explained at length, depending on both mother-like insight which realizes emptiness and nanny-like compassion, the seed of appreciation is brought forth from the womb of meditative absorption. Such an individual is said in the Uttaratantra root text [RGV] and commentary [RGVV] to be a son of the Victor [Buddha]. Sa paṇ, not seeing that, criticizes (zhal zer) the sublime Bka' brgyud. Consequently, those who are thus endowed with these four causes for realizing the four purities will become sons of the King of Dharma in the family (rigs) of the tathāgatas. How so? As stated [in RGV I.34],

Those whose seed is appreciation for the supreme vehicle,
Whose mother is insight giving birth to the buddha-qualities,
Whose abiding is the womb of bliss in meditative absorption,
Whose nanny is called compassion,
It is they who are the sons born as heirs of the Śākya.

Moreover, were it unwarranted to ascribe the terms “buddha potential” and “buddha nature” (*sugatagarbha) to compassion and the insight that realizes emptiness, it would likewise be meaningless to explain the gathering of virtue for realizing emptiness in terms of the attainment-acquiring potential (thob pa sgrub pa'i rigs). [One would be] unable to maintain [this] because, as noble Asaṅga stated:

In this case, the acquired potential (samudānītagotra) is that obtained by former familiarization with the root of virtue.”

And specifically, for the noble [Asaṅga], the insight that truly gains realization in line with emptiness is the buddha potential (buddhagotra), but [he] does not indicate that there is any problem at all with designating this as *sugatagarbha. As it is said,

Query: What are the characteristics of the basis for practice? Subhūti, great bodhisattvas should train themselves in the state without attachment to all phenomena through nonconceptuality and nonconceptualization, and in the state that does not take [phenomena] to be existent.

Here, conceptuality (rtog pa : kalpa[na]) and conceptualization (rnam par rtog pa : vikalpa[na]) refer to the habituation to entities and their properties [respectively]. Because these do not exist, one should understand this to be precisely “the state without attachment.” “The state which does not take [phenomena] to be existent” is the suchness of all phenomena. Thus, in this sense, because that very dharmadhātu is the cause of the qualities of the eminent ones, it is shown to be “the basis for accomplishing the naturally present potential.” That is not all: [that potential] has been well-known since antiquity as the “potential that is emptiness having compassion as its essence”. According to the Nyi snang [Abhisamayālaṃkāravṛtti (AAV)],

Some say “'buddha potential (gotra)' refers to those things based on truth, renunciation, insight, and peace.”

And it states the following:

Others say “'buddha potential (gotra)' refers both to samādhi and great compassion, which are directly attuned to all the buddhas existing at the present time.

And Dignāga states [in his Prajñāpāramitāsaṃgraha]:

Therefore, the natural potential (gotra) [of] consciousness Is the nature of caring and insight.

Since [this] has been explained extensively, please think carefully about it!

If this vajra precept is restated very clearly, it says this: “Through the instructions of one who has perceived that buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) of the three continua (rgyud gsum), which is the final intent of the sūtras and tantras [and] which has been termed 'substratum' (ālaya), one is able to actualize it in a short time via the key points. If one is able to do this, then by directly recognizing the subtlest root of saṃsāra [i.e., the ālaya], which is to be abandoned via the Mantrayāna, one engages in relinquishing it. And when one engages in that, one cannot help but attain the buddha[hood] of the Sūtra and Mantra traditions.”

Now, from among the canonical scriptures of Sūtra and Mantra [vehicles] that teach [buddha] nature, it is said that
“all sentient beings have buddha nature (buddhagarbha).”
Commenting on the intended meaning of this, the venerable Maitreya said the following [RGV I.28]:

Because they have the potential, 
All sentient beings are always endowed with buddha nature.

In the [stanza] preceding that [RGV I.27], [he offers this] comment:
Because buddha wisdom is present in all [kinds of] sentient beings,
Because the natural nondefilement [of buddhas and sentient beings] is nondual, and
Because the result has been metaphorically ascribed to the buddha potential,
It is said that all beings are endowed with buddha nature.

Here, it is explained that “the body of the perfect Buddha is [all-]pervading” means that, at the time of the result, the buddha-activities of dharmakāya endowed with twofold purity impartially pervade the three gates [body, speech, and mind] of all sentient beings beyond limits or categories. As for the meaning of “buddha,” when discussing the line [RGV I.27a] “because buddha wisdom is present in all [kinds of] sentient beings,” the great translator [Rngog] Blo ldan shes rab and others explain that buddha is actual, whereas the garbha is nominal.

However, according to my own teacher Lord Ras pa chen po [Bkra shis dpal 'byor]:

Tathāgata means “gone (gata) to the reality (tathā) of all phenomena.” When so explained, tathā means beyond one or many. In this regard, the tathāgata of sentient beings and buddhas does not exist as two different things. Therefore, the primordially undefiled wisdom, with its powers and so on, has since time immemorial “pervaded” or been innately present in each of their mind-streams. For this reason, it makes sense to explain the meaning of “having purification and affliction” in terms of this suchness. Hence, it is not a contradiction to say this causal and resultant dharmakāya of buddha[hood], which is endowed with twofold purity, is both upwardly pervasive (yar khyab) and downwardly pervasive (mar khyab) because such dharmakāya of buddha[hood] accompanies all buddhas and sentient beings as both cause and result, like space. According to the Sūtrālaṃkāra [MSA IX.15]:

Just as space is considered always omnipresent,
So the [buddhahood] is considered always omnipresent.
Just as space is omnipresent in the multitude of physical things,
So [buddhahood] is omnipresent in the multitude of beings.

So it was proclaimed.

With this very reasoning in mind, in my composition the Nerve Tonic for the Elderly, I remarked that this buddha nature (buddhagarbha), being the obscured basis that is obscured [in] the “grizzled old dog” of a sentient being—the very epitome of obscuration—remains undifferentiated as the bearer of all buddha-qualities, such as the powers, throughout beginning, middle, and end. Hence, it was declared that there is no contradiction in saying the “result” emerges throughout beginningless time as the unbroken continuity of a homologous kind (rigs 'dra). Although [this] was explained eloquently, it should be kept extremely secret from those who are afraid of the profound.

As for the statement that “the natural nondefilement of suchness is present in both buddhas and sentient beings without differentiation”: it is “without differentiation” inasmuch as [buddha] nature is inherently uncontaminated. It is on account of this element (khams) being purified or not purified of defilements that the person [concerned] is designated by the three names “sentient being,” “bodhisattva” and “buddha”. As is stated [RGV I.48b],

The element is indicated by three names In accordance with its three phases.

And [RGV I.47] states:

[Depending on whether the buddha-element is]
Impure, [partly] impure and [partly] pure, or perfectly pure, It is called a sentient being, a bodhisattva,
Or a tathāgata [thus-gone one] respectively.

Reply: Sentient beings, buddhas, etc. are designated from the perspective of the individual. At the time [buddha] nature possesses defilements, the names of the respective individuals are applied [corresponding to the degree of defilement]. Thus, in the case of *sugatagarbha as well, it is simply designated in accordance with the individual. Hence, there is no contradiction. The *sugatagarbha that is the obscured basis (sgrib gzhi) is not a state such that it experiences karma and its results, as [is the case] with transient individuals such as the six kinds of beings who obscure [it] (sgrib byed). So long as impure defilements that obscure [that buddha nature] are not relinquished, it is not a contradiction [to say] these factors of impure suffering always accompany it—like a kernel and its chaff. Hence, it is not a contradiction to designate the garbha in terms of individuals. The Śrīmālā[devīsiṃhanādanirdeśasūtra (ŚDS)] states:

Bhagavān, whatever be these six consciousnesses this [other] consciousness—these seven factors are unstable, disconnected, momentary, and do not experience suffering… The tathāgatagarbha, being inseparably connected and not momentary, does experience suffering.

[1] Of these, the first is overcome once the state of arhatship [is attained by] śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.

Thus, if one claims that the succession of births in saṃsāra is terminated by merely having relinquished afflictions without knowing how the substratum (ālaya) serves as a basis for coarse and subtle afflictions, the latent tendencies and the like, this would be like the [view of the] nihilist heretics. For this reason, the substratum theory is superior to [the doctrines of] heretics.

In particular, to attain great awakening, it is necessary to identify that obscuration which is the “ground (sa) of latent tendencies of ignorance”—[i.e.,] the substratum (ālaya)—which is an impediment to such [attainment]. But to identify that [obscuration], it is necessary to engage in the vast spectrum of renunciation and realization pertaining to the level of buddhahood. Hence, with the exception of buddhas and bodhisattvas, this doctrinal approach to the substratum (ālaya) is not known by commoners and ordinary yogins. As the Laṅkāvatāra [LAS II, re: v. 98] states:

Were the endogenous form [of consciousness] to cease, then the ālayavijñāna would also cease. [However,] Mahāmati, if the ālayavijñāna ceased, then this doctrine would be no different from the nihilistic doctrine of the extremists (tīrthika).

And it states [LAS II, re: v. 98 cont.]:

In this way, Mahāmati, since the movements and workings of the ālayavijñāna are very subtle, with the exception of tathāgatas and [those] bodhisattvas residing on the spiritual levels, it is not fathomed by others such as śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas and yogins of heretical disciplines. It is not easy to discern even through the power of meditative absorption and insight.

Thus, it is certain that buddha nature (buddhagarbha) is not something that is reversed later. As is stated [in RGV I.51cd]:

As it was earlier, so it is later –
It is of an unchangeable nature.

Therefore, when we posit buddha nature (buddhagarbha) as a sentient being, that [buddha nature] is [in fact] not a person or self because apart from being taken as the thing designated as a self (bdag gi gdags gzhi), there is nothing at all that establishes [buddha nature] as a self.

Reply: Absolutely it exists. [As is stated in the Ghanavyūha,]

The substratum of the various levels,
That is also the goodness that is buddha nature (*sugatagarbha).
The tathāgatas have indicated this nature (garbha)
By means of the term “substratum” (ālaya).
Although the garbha has been declared to be the ālaya, It is not known by those of inferior intellect.

Accordingly, the term “substratum of various levels” is described as a substratum with reference to all seeds and causes of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. But here, when the cause of nirvāṇa is referred to as a “substratum” (ālaya), it is not possible that this could be [anything] other than buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) because the ālaya[vijñāna] is the debilitating malaise of defilement, whereas this [buddha nature] is precisely the natural luminosity, which is not the malaise of defilement. [According to the RGV I.63]

This nature of mind is luminous.
Like space, it never undergoes change.
However, it bears all defilements in the form of the defilements of desire and the rest,
Which are adventitious and born of false imagining.

Such a [buddha nature] has been present since beginningless time as the essence of supreme bliss. From the [Hevajra] tantra [HT II.iv.73b–74]:

[There is no being that is not a buddha, because of the [primordial]
awakening of everybody's own [nature].]
The denizens of hell, pretas, animals, gods, demigods and men, (73)
And even the worms in feces always possess bliss naturally,
Wherefore they do not experience the [inferior] bliss of gods and demigods. (74)
Buddhahood is not found anywhere other than the worldly realms.
Mind itself is the perfect buddha, and no buddha is shown elsewhere. 

Having in mind this permanence in the sense of continuity without beginning or end, the uninterrupted continuity of bliss throughout the three continua, Indrabhūti declared,

Supreme bliss is not impermanent because Supreme bliss is ever-lasting.

Thus, although it is not strictly forbidden [to employ methods] such as the karmamudrā [female tantric consort] in order to elicit the presence of this “supreme bliss” in one's mind-stream, the sensation of bliss [arising] from the sexual organs is just the pervasive suffering of conditioned existence and is therefore said [by Indrabhūti] to not the great bliss of nirvāṇa. According to Indrabhūti,

The assertion that this bliss generated by the two sex organs
Is that [supreme bliss] is the talk of inferior people.
The assertion that this is supreme bliss

Likewise, bliss does not manifest when supreme bliss is blocked by obscurations in the minds of sentient beings, but it is not the case that bliss does not exist during that time. As Nāropā also explains in [his] commentary on that [Sekoddeśa, i.e., SUṬ],

Although that “receding,” i.e., elimination, [of] the obscurations of the so-called “afflictions and so on”—i.e., the obscurations of afflictions, knowable objects, and absorptions, together with their latent tendencies—was indicated using the expression “full,” it is not the case that wisdom “wanes”; nor is it the case that it “waxes”. As this is explained in scripture,
[Bliss] is ever-manifesting in buddhas,
But not in those with minds corrupted by ignorance.
Also, in the words of Sarahapāda,
Victorious is the king who is bliss—unique, beyond causation, [yet] ever manifesting in the world.
But when it comes to speaking precisely of Him, even the omniscient one is at a loss for words.

The potential (gotra) of buddha nature (buddhagarbha), which is in essence the completely perfect embodiment of supreme bliss itself, appears as if thoroughly mixed with the constituents of the six cognitive domains and [hence] is not clearly manifest. However, the awakening of the potential, which has remained unmixed with the constituents of the six cognitive domains of sentient beings—though being a certain constitutive element amongst these—is the possibility for the six uncorrupted cognitive domains to become clearly manifest. This is because it is possible for the constituent of great medicine to be clearly manifest within the constituent of poison due to [the former being] an ineluctable [part of the latter]. For example, it is possible for the constituent of the elixir of immortality to be manifest within mercury which is a strong poison. Having this meaning in mind, the Karma pa Rang byung rdo rje stated:

The spiritual potential (rigs) is such that the triad of body, speech, and mind of sentient beings body, speech, and mind (lus ngag yid) are aspects similar ('dra ba'i cha) to the body, speech, and mind (sku gsung thugs) of the Tathāgata. That is stated in the glorious Hevajra[tantra II.ii.45]:
[The (visualized) deity's form]
Is present only as something born,
Being an arrangement of arms, face, and colors. However, [the visualization has a point] because of the ordinary latent tendencies.
And according to the Hevajra[tantra II.iv.64d],

Sentient beings are already the Lord [Īśvara] of the ten
levels.785 
These and other passages are discussed in detail.

This spiritual potential has persisted as a continuity since time immemorial within the contaminated six cognitive domains of all sentient beings, and obtains as the nature of things (dharmatā). [Thus] it is called the “naturally present spiritual potential.” Since the faith and so on that awaken this [potential] are what make the spiritual element unfold, this [potential] is [also] called the “unfolded potential.” There are two [types of] unfolded potential—[that] possessing the assemblage of the six contaminated cognitive domains and [that] comprising the constituents of the six uncontaminated cognitive domains. Of these, the first is not the actual spiritual element, whereas the latter is the actual spiritual element. Having this latter one in mind, my teacher Karma phrin las used to emphasize that “the venerable Rang byung [rdo rje] maintained that 'the naturally present potential is itself the unfolded potential'.”

Thus, if one understands the way of establishing [buddha] nature along these lines, three [types of] certainty will arise: [1] As the buddha's dharmakāya pervades the entire animate and inanimate world, one knows that [one] is never separated from one's teacher. [2] Having seen that the tathāgatagarbha in buddhas and sentient beings is unchanging from beginning to end, one sees that those having a wrong view of a self are similar to oneself in being subject to selfgrasping; thus great loving kindness and compassion arises toward them. And thus, since these beings as sufferers are ultimately not established, there arises great courage in [one's] capacity to dispel this suffering. [3] Knowing that the three phases and so forth all pertain to [buddha nature] itself, then the insight and samādhi concerning this nature give rise to great diligence on the path, which enables one to cut away the husk [covering] it. In the Synopsis of Maitreya's Dharmas of Btsan kha'o che it is said: “When these certainties have arisen, then even though one has not yet actually received the prophecy of noreturning, that individual does not return”.

When it comes to internalizing (nyams su len pa) in a short time this [buddha] nature through the key points of the instructions on seeing it, the invincible victor [Maitreya] stated [in RGV I.34] the following:

Those whose seed is dedication to the supreme vehicle, Whose mother is insight giving birth to the buddha-qualities, Whose abiding is the womb of bliss in meditative absorption, Whose nanny is called compassion,
It is they who are the sons born as heirs of the Śākya.

First comes the dedication for the sake of actualizing [buddha] nature. One then studies and otherwise [attends to] the canonical texts that teach [buddha] nature, taking [these] as the object for discerning insight. Next, having cultivated bodhicitta nurtured through compassion for those beings who are endowed with this nature but do not realize it, one trains in that discipline [of bodhicitta]. Next, since actualizing [buddha] nature depends on nonconceptual meditative states, one should train in the uncontrived meditative concentration of mental nonengagement.

The method of practicing such concentration pertains to the following: [1] a dimension comprising conceptual notions of the mind, which sever imputations regarding the characteristics of [buddha] nature, and a dimension comprising the nonconceptual yogas resulting from meditation, which sever imputations regarding the thing characterized [buddha nature itself].

Of these two, the former involves bringing to completion the engagement in studying and thinking in contexts of dedication and insight. The latter involves engaging in meditation in order to enter the state of natural spontaneity. Among all the sūtras and tantras, this way of meditation is the most profound for discovering [buddha] nature. The Bhagavān bestowed this method upon the invincible victor [Maitreya] and Mañjughoṣa, whence it continued in an unbroken line of instructions through Mañjughoṣa to Nāgārjuna, through Nāgārjuna to Śāvari, through Śāvari to Maitrīpa and [also] through Maitreya to Maitrīpa, through Maitrīpa to Mar pa, Mi la, Dwags po [Sgam po pa], Dus [gsum] mkhyen [pa], up to my own spiritual father, the venerable master [Sangs rgyas mnyan pa I Bkra shis dpal 'byor].

Moreover, upon this [buddha] nature, the phenomena of adventitious defilements of the eightfold consciousness [are present] since beginningless saṃsāra, like patina on gold or turbidity in water. Due to conceptual modifications and distortions by discursive elaborations involving [1] sense faculties as the dominant condition, [2] sense objects as the objective condition, and [3] the immediately antecedent condition as substantial cause, one is distracted by [mentally imputed] signs, resulting in the occurrence of these mistaken elaborations, which constitute the three realms. According to the [Laṅkāvatāra] sūtra [LAS II.99–100],

Like the waves of the ocean, set in motion under windy conditions, Arising like a dance—and there is no interruption—
The stream of the ground [consciousness] is in a similar manner set constantly in motion by the wind of [cognitive] objects,
And the varied waves of consciousness arise as in a dance. And [LAS II.110] states the following:
Body, property and habitat appear as such To the consciousness of humans.
Therefore, they appear as its transformations, Similar to waves.

Thus, the real antidote to fabrications and the rest is to leave them in their own natural state—unfabricated, effortless, undisturbed, and nonconceptual. Thereby these mistaken discursive elaborations regarding sense objects, sense faculties, and mental engagements subside of their own accord and natural awareness—[buddha] nature—becomes manifest. For example, when turbid water is left unagitated, the turbidity subsides, and the water becomes clear. In this case, just as the water's clarity is not newly emergent, so too when the defiled phenomena of consciousness are left uncontrived so that they subside on their own and [buddha] nature thereby becomes manifest, it is not the case that [this] nature is newly emergent. Thus, among canonical scriptures of definitive meaning it is said [in Dharmadhātustava (DDhS) 38ab],

Depending on eye and form,
[There are] immaculate manifestations.

This so-called immaculate manifestation is precisely natural awareness (tha mal shes pa), [buddha] nature.

Thus, [regarding] the adventitious mistaken elaborations themselves, when one settles in equipoise—leaving [things as they are], unmodified by anything to be added or removed, [so] nothing is established as either of the [two] truths— then [one] is devoid of mistaken elaborations, which are precisely [mentally imputed] signs relating either to existence or nonexistence. When [one] no longer finds fault [with what appears], then one will be liberated by seeing the real as it really is, for the following is stated [in RGV I.154]:

There is nothing to be removed from it and nothing to be added.
The real should be seen as real, and seeing reality, one is liberated.

Thus, when the adventitious defilements— deceptive phenomena that are falsely construed as having their own reality—[naturally] unwind in [their] innate uncontrived condition, then the nature of things (dharmatā), [i.e.,] the abiding mode of all phenomena, and, along with it, emptiness itself, become manifest. And most importantly, *sugatagarbha, which is totally purified of phenomena, is revealed. According to Mitrayogi,

Whatever arises is that [nature]
[But] that doesn't arise as anything.

And he says the following:

Whatever arises is the essence of the innate.
Thus, when one is mindful of what arises, not forgetting it,
Then what arises is emptiness,

This process of seeing and cultivating the equality all these phenomena of the two truths—with nothing going or coming, nothing to add or remove—is the unsurpassed accumulation of wisdom which does not conceptualize the triple sphere. With regard to the triple sphere, engagements in the triple sphere which consist in mentally engaging in [1] the three [aspects of] object, subject and act and [2] the three times [past, present and future] are explained by Mañjuśrikīrti in [his] commentary on the Samādhirājasūtra [SRS]. In this regard, the triple sphere of the threefold object, subject, and act is but a partial apprehension of signs, but not the apprehension of signs which engages in the entire range of knowable objects. Since mental engagement in the three times encompasses the apprehension of signs of the entire range of knowable objects, that wisdom which does not conceptualize the three spheres—[i.e.,] does not mentally engage in the three times—is the antidote to cognitive obscurations, as explained in the Jñānālokālaṃkāra [JĀA].

Hence, by first stopping conceptual signs (spros mtshan) related to phenomena of the three times, one primarily relinquishes cognitive obscurations. Along with these, afflictive obscurations will also be relinquished. In this vein, Lord Mi la [ras pa] commented that even though the noble Bka' gdams pas say that first afflictive obscurations are abandoned, and then cognitive obscurations, my Bka' brgyud [pas] first abandon cognitive obscurations and then the afflictive obscurations are abandoned along with [them].

Query: Can the cognitive obscurations be abandoned even by an ordinary beginner?
Reply: It is definitely possible because the ordinary beginner engages in study, thinking, and meditation for the sake of clearing away the defilement of ignorance concerning the knowable. Thus, once the cognitive obscurations that stem from mentally engaging in conceptual signs relating to the three times are abandoned, then the manner by which the wisdom that knows all knowable things is obscured (sgrib tshul) is gleaned from the extensive teachings of the s and tantras. In this regard, as Tsong kha pa, father and sons, have said

To indulge in stopping mental engagements in the three times is the Means to realize an animal [state]—a reflection of meditation.

[This] remark may indeed have been uttered with reference to Tibetan meditators as the target, but what it strikes [instead] are the buddhas and bodhisattvas. What is the use of this statement, which ends up disparaging [these beings]? For, such reprehensible evil [only] burdens the mind.

Thus, by letting the continuous fabrications of the mind of adventitious defilements naturally unwind so they settle into the uncontrived [state], the continuity of delusion of the seeming progression from earlier to later moments of the cognition involving mind and mental factors subsides. Then, in this very moment, the nature [of time-bound mind] thoroughly subsides so that all phenomena are beyond arising and ceasing and the luminous mind, [buddha] nature, is thereby actualized. Because of this, it is said [in the Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra (MSA) XIII.19],

A natural luminosity [consisting] of another [dependent] mind, different from the mind as true nature (dharmatā), is not taught.”

Therefore, on account of precisely this key point in the instructions, lord Sgam po pa said “this doctrine of mine is the meaning of the Samādhirājasūtra” [SRS] and Phag mo gru pa said “this doctrine of mine is the meaning of the Uttaratantra” [RGV] and 'Jig rten mgon po likewise said that “the spiritual element as ascertained in the Uttaratantra is our Mahāmudrā.”

In this regard, [buddha] nature is the following: [1] “pure” because [it] does not serve as a basis for latent tendencies; [2] “true selfhood” because in [its] selflessness, even the conceptual elaborations regarding “no self” have completely subsided; [3] “bliss” because it is free from body-mind produced by the subtle movement of ignorance; and [4] “permanent” because the undefiled spiritual element of this kind is the uninterrupted continuity of buddha-activities. So it has been proclaimed [in RGV I.35ab]:

The perfection of the qualities of purity, selfhood,
bliss, and permanence,
Are their [i.e., the four causes'] fruition.

Therefore, when one actualizes this [buddha] nature, [one] is able to understand the chaff that obscures it—saṃsāra—and [to understand] not only its coarse root, but also its subtle and subtlest roots.

The root of saṃsāra for śrāvaka Vaibhāṣikas and Sautrāntikas consists in the personalistic metaphysical views (satkāyadṛṣṭi), while for pratyekabuddhas, it is the belief in the reality of objects. Commonly among Mādhyamikas, it consists in elaborations based on reifications of signs. And in the final wheel, it is taken to be the indeterminate ālayavijñāna, construed as the repository of latent tendencies, which is called the “defiled purity of mind”. Although [this conception of a] buddhahood in which all these roots of saṃsāra have been relinquished is discovered on the sūtric path, the roots of saṃsāra explained in the Mantra[yāna] concern the latent tendencies for transference.

Another name for this [ālayavijñāna] is “the luminous mind as the first principle” (gtso bo : pradhāna, i.e., prakṛti) because it is said that the twenty-three transformations (pariṇāma) of saṃsāra evolve by virtue of this first principle. But in the case of this first principle, without depending on the twenty-fifth [principle]—the immaculate essence termed “Man” (puruṣa), which lies concealed in the [natural world]—saṃsāra does not arise.

This kind of root of saṃsāra is also designated by the term ālayavijñāna. In this regard, this [tantric] ālayavijñāna is subtler than the ālaya[vijñāna] explained in the context of the sūtras.

As is stated in the Kālacakra [i.e., Vimalaprabhāṭīkā (VPṬ)],

[Here in saṃsāra,] in the very moment of transference, the birth of
a sentient being takes place…

And it states,

The ālayavijñāna in the womb has the nature of fully uniting with uterine blood and semen.

And it states,

Without the time-cycle (kālacakra) [of the uterine blood-sun and semen-moon], there is no ālayavijñāna and hence [birth] does not take place.

Moreover, the nomenclature for this [ālayavijñāna includes] “mind in the fourth (bzhi pa : turīya) state,” “luminosity of deep sleep,” and “the moment mind takes rebirth”. When these [mind states] manifest, although the mind of [buddha] nature remains unclear, it may become slightly clearer even to those who have not yet embarked upon the subtlest path. In that regard, however, the activities of maturation and liberation (smin grol) are not effective for them— a mere glimpse does not become the vajra yoga. Because of this subtle and profound point, my [teacher] the venerable Ras pa chen po said these words:

Nowadays, there are some who say, “since we have already integrated with the luminosity of deep sleep, there is no doubt we will awaken [to buddhahood] in the luminosity of death.” Many [of them] harbor [such] confidence [in their] minds. But let us not confuse mind which is the root of saṃsāra with luminosity!

This comment is extremely important. Also, the [Guhya]samāja instructions from the tradition of the noble father and sons [i.e., the Svādhiṣṭhānakramaprabheda attributed to the tantric Āryadeva] gives the following explanation:

One should understand that the eight factors—
The four elements such as earth and the rest
And likewise the four emptinesses—
Are causes of birth and destruction.

It is declared that all the three elements [uterine blood, semen and the vital life force (prāṇa) or wind (vāyu) of ālayavijñāna] have evolved from the antecedent eight entities [i.e., the four elements and their four emptinesses], but that among these, even the seven others have arisen from the empty luminosity (stong pa 'od gsal). According to the Pañcakrama [PK],

Nobody at all is born here,
Nor is there any death.
One should understand that saṃsāra itself
Is based on the nature of mind.

And it states,

The whole world lacks independence,
[And] does not arise independently.
The cause is its luminous [nature],
A luminous [nature] empty of everything.

Therefore, since this luminous mind, which exists as a single constellation of very subtle elements comprising semen, uterine blood, and vital life force, cannot be destroyed by anything apart from the wisdom of the Mantra path, it is termed “the invincible one” and “the indestructible seminal potency” (mi shigs pa'i thig le). In this regard, from semen [arises] the body, from uterine blood [arises] speech. While the vital life force constitutes the fundamental element of mind, since [its] red and white [currents] sustain the phenomenon of bliss and the phenomena of the movements of the vital life forces, it engenders conceptual thought and transient bliss. When these three are in equilibrium, there is the luminosity of all-pervading emptiness. Among these [three], when there is a preponderance of the vital life force, there is “imminence.” When there is a preponderance of uterine blood, there is “spreading of light.” When there is a preponderance of semen, there is “illumination.” When the first one [luminosity] dawns, the other three cease. These four pertain to nonconceptual cognition. But when conceptual mental cognition emerges from it, then from light evolves the waking state, from spreading of light the dream state, from imminence the state of deep sleep, and from all-pervasive emptiness the state of transference.

Thus, the circle of delusion of the four states [of consciousness] of embodied beings expands.

Because this kind of luminous mind is separable ('bral rung), it is described as “adventitious defilement”. Further, since this substratum luminous mind, which is the root of saṃsāra, appropriates the entire eightfold consciousness, it is called the “appropriating cognition” (ādānavijñāna). In that regard, when fierce anger arises in the midst of the present cognition, there at the same time erupts in that luminous mind the capacity to generate the result of [the hell with a] “ground of molten iron.” The flash of anger then ceases, but since the cause of the action having the capacity to produce the result is retained by the foundational mind (rtsa ba'i sems) as long as that result has not been elicited, when the result has matured, it becomes solidified in the form of the molten iron hell. Having this meaning in mind, 'Jig rten mgon po said that:

The vajra precept “residual impurities (snyigs ma) are the selfformulation (rang gzugs) of thought” is a profound teaching. Thus, there are many vajra precepts within this vajra precept. A vajra precept such as this should be kept well hidden from unfortunate ones.

Reply: Here, some people face the following quandary: since [samsaric luminous mind] is separable, [the two] are not the same. However, since [the two minds] are fundamentally inseparable, they are also not different. This is not [a quandary] for the following reason. Although [they] are not found to be either the same or different when critically investigated, they are different from the standpoint of unexamined common knowledge because if they were not [considered] different then the samsaric luminous mind would not be an adventitious defilement [to remove] and [its] counterpart would not be the innate coemergent wisdom [to realize].

Reply: It is cleared away by that supreme bliss, the luminous mind as [buddha] nature, which is the relinquisher. In that regard, when the energy channels (nāḍī) of the four emptinesses in the six energy centers (cakra) are constricted by the three illuminations and the fourth, [i.e.,] luminosity, that are the root of saṃsāra, then the samsaric central channel is not able to unwind. When that is the case, once the energy current of coemergent wisdom, which is engaged with the karmic energy current, has been intensified with the blessings within the vajra recitations involving the three embodiments (kāya), one is capable of guiding the movements of a portion of the wisdom energy current through the central energy channel of nirvāṇa. When the samsaric central channel is thereby slightly loosened by the flowing movement of that [wisdom current], then regarding the three illuminations and luminosity in the channels of the four emptinesses as well, one does not find any knots in the central channel, which is the root of saṃsāra along with its energy currents.

Thus, when that indestructible complex is on the verge of destruction, by kindling the fierce heat (gtum mo : cāṇḍālī) that engenders the wisdom of the wisdom energy current, the radiant light of the fire's heat clears away the darkness of the three illuminations and luminosity. And with the melting of the bodhicitta seminal potency (byang thig) of nirvāṇa, the luminous mind of [buddha] nature together with the four illuminations are actualized in the mind-stream of the yogin. At that time, all the sufferings of debilitating malaise—[its] seeds [being] the eighty misconceptions [based on] the three illuminations as the root of saṃsāra which, multiplied by the two blisses of the male and female sexual sensations, [make] one hundred and sixty natures [in total]—are turned into something that never [again] arises in his mind-stream. Hence, when imperishable supreme bliss without transformation or transmigration has arisen in [one's] mind-stream, if it has not reached its peak, then one has not yet severed the bonds of the three illuminations and luminosity as the root of saṃsāra. But when this has reached its peak, this complex is destroyed. Thus, it is said in the Kālacakramūlatantra,

Until there is immutability,
There is the connection between founding and founded.
Once immutability of mind is attained,
There is no connection between founding and founded.

Therefore, when it comes to the awakening to [buddhahood] according to the Mantra tradition, the luminous mind together with three illuminations, which [together] constitute the root of saṃsāra, need to be purified away because, as is said in Nāgabuddhi's Karmāntavibhaṅga [KV],

If one does not completely purify appearances
By giving one's head and wealth and all the rest,
Then one will not attain the goal of awakening.

If one purifies the mind which possesses the three illuminations and luminosity, which are samsaric, then one will attain the buddhahood of the Mantra tradition even if one doesn't want to, for it is declared in the Pañcakrama [PK]:

If someone fell from the peak of Mount Meru,
He would fall even if he didn't want to fall.
If someone received transmission thanks to the guru's kindness,
He would be liberated even if he didn't want to be liberated.

Reply: Here, as was noted by my venerable master [Bkra shis dpal 'byor (1457–1525)], in the withdrawal [phase] of the Completion Stages, one individually relinquishes (so sor spong ba) the object and subject associated with deluded consciousness (rnam shes). And after relinquishing them, one individually consolidates (so sor bsdud pa) the object and subject of nondeluded wisdom (ye shes). When the body of both the former and latter practices of withdrawal are perfected, one lets mind settle into the uncontrived state according to the precious Bka' brgyud [tradition] and thus the [two methods] converge on a single point. However, this will not come about by merely blocking consciousness along with its objects, for Saraha after establishing the rival position

“For some, [reality] is conceptualized as the sphere of space [Dohākoṣagīti 12b],”

proceeds to explain that conceptualizing such [blankness] does not become the Mahāmudrā view and meditation.

Reply: This is not the case because this [withdrawal] meditative concentration is a special meditative concentration that provides a basis for the mind to attain the exalted mantric path of Vajrayāna. Although it may arise in the mind-stream of ordinary persons, it is not [among] the concentrations summarized by the [six] levels pertaining to the three realms. [In fact,] this kind of concentration is explained extensively among the three Bodhisattva Commentaries as a concentration on supreme bliss, buddha nature (buddhagarbha), the mode of abiding. Not understanding this key point, some Tibetans take great pains to explain that the withdrawal [phase] for realizing meditative concentration of the Six Yogas of the Completion Stages may be treated as equivalents or substitutes for the preparatory concentrations explained in sūtras such as the Mother [Prajñāpāramitā] and Abhi[dharma]. This is just plain wrong!

[Concluding] Remarks:
In this context, the substratum (ālaya) means that through the four truths, one beholds the truth of the nature of reality (chos nyid) as supreme bliss. Hence, that [substratum] is what is referred to in the statement: “That through the kindness of which supreme bliss arises in an instant…” [Here, ālaya] does not mean the ālayavijñāna which is other than that, for, if it did, [this would] contradict the primary sense [of the term]. ['Jig rten gsum mgon] did not teach a theory like that of the Cittamātra proponents who postulate the ālayavijñāna as a basis for karma and [its] fruition. Rather, the substratum consciousness (ālayavijñāna) was posited in a provisional sense in order to avert the danger of a view of nihilism, though it does not exist, even in the context of correct conventional reality (tha snyad bden pa). If it did exist, then one would have to experience it independently of the cognitions of the six senses. But it is precisely because it is not so established that Candra[kīrti] noted that anyone who says that the ālaya[vijñāna] exists is not fit to be taught emptiness [and] explained it as being “incorrect” (yang dag min). It is understood [that] when interpreted in this system, it [serves as] a lion-throne pedestal to support the feet of the 'Bri khung pa, father and sons. But when interpreted in a contrary [way], it is [like] binding [their feet] with a black rope and pulling [them down]. When described [as above], the core of the meaning will be deeply understood.

The [view of] dependent arising extolled by the masters Nāgārjuna, Āryadeva, and Candrakīrti negates all types of conceptually postulated extremes.

Some Mādhyamikas describe an emptiness that consists in entities being empty of reality. Such emptiness, when it [entails] the nonexistence of entities, is claimed to be like a sky flower. Yet, [for them,] the entities that merely appear do have reality in that they nondeceptively perform functions [and are thus] said to not be nonexistent like sky flowers.

In fact, the very unity that consists in the noncontradiction of arising and nonarising—i.e., an entity as such does not exist as an entity and yet that which does not exist as an entity appears as an entity—is what is to be realized. Nāgārjuna says: 

There is no emptiness apart from entities.
In its absence, entities too do not exist.
Therefore, you clearly taught that entities,
Which have arisen due to conditions, are empty.

The conventional is explained as emptiness [and]
Emptiness is simply the conventional because
It is certain that they do not arise without [each other],
As in the cases of the produced and impermanent.
And:

It is declared that this arises by virtue of
The connection with the nonarisen.
It is said:

Although all phenomena are unborn, they appear to arise like the perception of strands of hair by someone with vitreous floaters. In the absence of vitreous floaters they do not exist at all. Thus, what remains are just names of entities that merely appear.

In this statement, the strands of hair are untenable [as real entities], being a mode of emptiness qua dependent arising, like something produced that is impermanent [and thus] not established by nature. Hence, though a person in the absence of vitreous floaters does not perceive strands of hair, for a person having vitreous floaters, it is possible for the bits of hair strands to [appear to] fall endlessly, even while [these] bits of hair strands do not exist in the slightest way.

Therefore, even the statements by the master Candrakīrti that on the seventh level and the level of buddhahood the conventional and the mind cease is not a comprehensive negation. Given the impossibility of their occurrence on these [levels in the first place] these things do not cease. Yet, that which had obscured these [levels] vanishes, [i.e.] the deceptive and delusive conventional where the nonarisen appears to arise.

Thus, if in unsurpassed complete and perfect buddhahood, the ultimate as well as the conventional became perpetually nonexistent—like the nonarising of impermanence in the absence of production—one would fall into an eternality that is only the great extreme of annihilation. Consequently, one would not become free from eternalism and nihilism. Also, on the level of buddhahood, it is not incongruous that phenomena, which are the inseparable unity of the two truths, arise. As is stated,

Although the Bhagavān fathomed inherent nonexistence, he did not deny seeing reflections. Rather, they are naturally present.

Therefore, since, on the level of buddhahood, it is not incongruous that the conventional arises and since [the conventional] does not depart from the ultimate truth, the dharmakāya, the unity of the two embodiments (kāya) is established. As it is said in the Ratnakūṭa,

Emptiness does not make phenomena empty.
Phenomena as such are empty.

The conventional is not established as the conventional, yet it is also not something different from the conventional itself. Therefore, the conventional is not even an object of refutation (dgag bya) for the Mādhyamika according to his own system. This is because although the conventional is not established as the conventional, it does not abide as something other than the nature of the conventional. By something that is not established, another thing that is not established cannot be negated. That has been termed “nonabiding unity”.

Reply: Unity is possible. From the standpoint of the method—viz., the accumulations and purifications etc.—the enlightened activity of the two embodiments (kāya) exists uninterruptedly so long as worldliness exists. From the standpoint of insight, enlightened activity is never established in the sense of existent entities. If there were enlightened activities in the sense of existent entities, there would be sentient beings as existent entities. If they existed, sentient beings as existent entities would be limitless, so it would be impossible to establish all sentient beings in buddhahood.

Thus, having something like this in mind, that which is the very nature of entities and nonentities, which is free from existing or nonexisting as entities, was at times shown to be an entity though it is not established as an entity, and was at times shown to be a nonentity though it is not established as a nonentity.

Thus, on the basis of mere concepts such as “entities” and “nonentities,” samsaric states have arisen due to actions [motivated by] attachment and aversion.

Now, awakening and suchness are both presented in terms of cause and effect and so forth. Actually, however, even though it is possible to indicate a cause-effect [relationship] regarding the possibility of awakening on account of the purity of the expanse of phenomena, or a cause-effect [relationship] of actualizing the suchness of the expanse of phenomena, when one investigates the nature of this awakening, it turns out that, in reality, all phenomena are not differentiated in terms of causes and effects because in suchness there is undivided sameness. As is stated:

Q: What is the nature of all phenomena? A: It is that they do not have any nature. These [two], nature and no-nature, are nondual and cannot be construed as a duality.

Thus, when there arises the wisdom of deep understanding, which is free from taking any objectively established phenomena of the two truths as one's view, meditation, and realization, then by this very wisdom which sustains that [understanding], one is liberated from all sense-cognitions comprising the primary mind and [associated] mental factors, conceptions, and mental engagements and the like. [One is] also [liberated from] the subject-object dichotomy of all the movements of all conscious experiences and conceptual cognitions belonging to the modes of self-awareness and other-awareness. Thereupon, the meaning of mahāmudrā as mental nonengagement is taken as [one's] view and meditation. At that time, although it is said that one settles into a state of mental nonengagement and nonconceptual wisdom, it is not possible to settle [therein]. As is said in the Madhyamaka of Unity (zung du 'jug pa'i dbu ma):

Even where the yoga of nonconceptual mind is concerned, One does not conceptualize it, even as no-thought.

The meaning of the statements is that from the time of the ground [onward], the phenomena of the two truths have been pure by nature. Therefore, even when corrupted by mental engagements such as viewing [them as] entities, the nature of [these] two truths has not arisen as the essence of delusion vis-à-vis corrupted phenomena, because, had it [so] arisen, delusion could not be relinquished.
During the time of the path, the phenomena of the two truths do not arise as the essence of delusion because the unity of conventional and absolute bodhicitta, of means and wisdom, make delusion vanish.

And at the time of fruition, the inseparability of the two truths is freedom from delusion because the ignorance which superimposes or deprecates phenomena as consisting in subjects and predicates has dissipated (sangs) and the mind which unmistakenly realizes their mode of abiding is unfolded (rgyas pa).

Concerning such explanations, the Easterner Tsong kha pa avers that because conventional [phenomena] are established by valid sources of knowledge [grounded] in customary transactions, they are not individually empty of intrinsic essence. On the other hand, the emptiness wherein the enduring mode of objects which is not conceptually imputed is empty of truly established intrinsic essence—[i.e., of an] independently existent conventional—is the ultimate truth.
However, [this view] lies outside the excellent Madhyamaka tradition properly discerned by all those who claim that the ultimate reality and the conventional are of the same nature, such as those who appeared in former generations like the glorious lord Saraha, the noble Nāgārjuna, venerable Śavaripa, the teacher Buddhapālita, Candrakīrti, and the master Maitrīpa.

[1] Corresponding to the first example, worldly heretics who accept virtue and reject vice and the proponents of the Śrāvaka philosophy cling to these phenomena of the two truths in terms of four [kinds of] existence: ultimately existent, conventionally existent, and both of these as also substantially existent.

[2] Corresponding to the second example, for Mādhyamikas, the two truths as mere appearances are not substantially existent but are like illusions. However, just as an illusory venomous snake has the capacity to poison, so too if the illusory afflictions are not handled skillfully, they create suffering. Therefore, they eliminate them through skillful means. In that context, even though they negate ultimate existence, they view [phenomena] in terms of three kinds of existence: conventional, substantial, and nominal.

[3] Corresponding to the third example, for practitioners of the Kriyā and Caryā [tantras], the illusion-like phenomena of the two truths as mere appearances are flawless since they are without any substantial existence at all. However, just as due to the power of the fear of venomous snakes, one does not dare to touch [them], so too they do not dare to comfortably integrate the sufferings due to desires and so forth into their practice. Instead, just as one dares to request the help of an external [divine] hero, although they themselves are unable to put the path of Mahāyoga into practice, they do have the capacity to request that of another. Thus, in this way, they negate ultimate existence and substantial existence but view [phenomena] as conventionally existent and nominally existent.

[5] Corresponding to the fifth example, the practitioners of Atiyoga, the Great Perfection, realize that all avoiding, fearing, touching, or pulverizing of anything amidst the joys and sorrows of the illusion-like phenomena of the two truths, persist because of a reifying view (dngos lta) of the merely illusory conventional. Having thereby abandoned all such fears and heroic feats, they proceed spontaneously without doing [anything], not achieving, not accomplishing, and not rejecting anything at all. Regarding illusion-like phenomena, since illusory entities and the belief in the illusion are purified away, they awaken to complete and perfect buddhahood and are thereby free directly in the Samantabhadra ground.
Hence, they do not view the phenomena of the two truths as existent, nominally or conventionally.

Therefore, so long as representations of objects appear in an individual's mind, the two truths having characteristics of truth and falsity are intellectually posited as established bases. When these objects are thereby conceptualized, the notion of truth as two separate truths will never be abandoned. This is because Mahāyānists may verbally explain: “because all phenomena are like an illusion, they are neither true nor false,” yet, in the back of their minds they have not forsaken the idea “neither true nor false.” Here, since all phenomena that appear are established as the conventional which is mere illusion, they are perceived as causally efficacious entities. Consequently, since they claim that accumulation or purification of such [efficacious entities] are the activities for becoming free from bondage, conventional truth is nothing but a cause of truth. Therefore, intellectually they have not let go of conventional truth. And since they claim that freedom from bondage of the illusion-like [conventional] is actually present as nothing beyond or other than the emptiness of [phenomena] not being truly established as permanent and lasting, ultimate truth is nothing beyond this cause of truth. Therefore, intellectually, they have not let go of ultimate truth.
Therefore, so long as the mind has not let go of [reifying the two truths], and there is conceptual reasoning that clings to and believes in [them], it will never settle in the lofty state of the equality of the two truths, the inseparability of the two truths, the one-flavoredness of the two truths, and the unity of the two truths.

Reply: I do not establish it with anything. However, when it comes to others' wrong notions based on superimpositions and deprecations: such wrong notions involving superimpositions and deprecations are mistaken. For this reason, [I] simply demonstrate how they contradict ultimate reality. But, as to the grounds for contradiction: since the object of contradiction itself is not established, it is deemed to be a mere illusion having the capacity to contradict what only appears as as contradiction. This is what the Tibetan visionaries have unanimously proclaimed.

Among phenomena subsumed under the two truths the so-called buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) is declared to be an ultimate phenomenon. Yet it is also that which, in conventional terms, embodies the process of wisdom. [Thus, buddha nature] is precisely the inseparability of the two truths, which is held in the highest esteem as the object of ascertainment of worthy persons. Sūtras on [buddha] nature declare that

“sentient beings are endowed with tathāgatagarbha.”

The reasons why sentient beings are [said to be] endowed with such a nature was also noted by the Venerable One [RGV I.28]:

Because the body of the perfect Buddha is [all-]pervading,
Because suchness is undifferentiated, and
Because they have the potential,
All sentient beings always have buddha nature.
In the [stanza] preceding that [RGV I.27], [he] comments,

Because buddha wisdom is present in all [kinds of] sentient beings,
Because the natural nondefilement [of buddhas and sentient beings] is nondual, and 
Because the result has been metaphorically ascribed to the buddha potential,
It is said that all beings are endowed with buddha nature.

[1] The meaning of the two lines [at the start of each passage] pertains to the first of the [three] reasons [why sentient beings are endowed with buddha nature]: Because the dharmakāya, endowed with the twofold purity of perfect buddhahood, is [all-]pervading, down to the subtlest particles, wherever space extends, all sentient beings are endowed with tathāgatagarbha. Nonetheless, it has been said in this regard that tathāgata is actual whereas garbha is nominal. Now, in terms of the dharmakāya pervading in this way the entire animate and inanimate world, the Abhisamayālaṃkāra (AA) [VIII.11] explains,

Because buddha-activity is vast,
The Buddha is defined (nirūcyate) as “pervasive.”
Being inexhaustible,
He is described as “permanent.”

If it pervades in this way, then it is just like space, the sphere of phenomena, which pervades in a manner of simply making room for all physical entities. Here too it is said to be pervasive. Accordingly, the [Mahāyāna]sūtrālaṃkāra [IX.15] states:

Just as space is considered to be always omnipresent,
So this [buddhahood] is considered to be always omnipresent. Just as space is omnipresent in the multitude of physical things,
So this [buddhahood] is omnipresent in the multitude of beings.

[2] Having shown with “the body of the perfect Buddha is [all-]pervading” [RGV I.28a] the way *sugatagarbha is present in terms of the resultant *sugatagarbha being pervasively present via buddha activity as the causal *sugatagarbha of all sentient beings, the principle “suchness is undifferentiated” [RGV I.28b] is [also] the way *sugatagarbha is present in sentient beings. [This is] because the natural luminosity of the minds of everyone, from buddhas to animals, abides without differentiation as the nature of mind of sentient beings, as that essence which is free from all defilements, and without transition and transformation, like space.

Furthermore, “all sentient beings have tathāgatagarbha,” but from their perspective, the garbha is actual whereas tathāgata 'comes about' insofar as it is the basis of the three phases: [1] the phase of impure sentient beings as long as they possess karma and afflictions that fetter them to saṃsāra, [2] the phase of partly pure and partly impure bodhisattvas as long as they are purified of karma and afflictions, but not free from the ground of latent tendencies of ignorance and [3] the phase of pure buddhas who are thoroughly purified of both of these. As is stated [in RGV I.47]:

[Depending on whether the buddha-element is]
Impure, [partly] impure and [partly] pure, or perfectly pure,
It is called a sentient being, a bodhisattva
Or tathāgata [Thus-gone] respectively.

Reply: It was posited in this way on account of the need to establish buddhas of the primal phase or sentient beings deriving from the primal phase in terms of that naturally luminous buddha nature which was designated by the term 'substratum.' This is because, on the one hand, it is by virtue of [beings] having this cause, i.e., buddha nature (buddhagarbha), that its result is actualized. On the other hand, it is by virtue of the influence of all the adventitious defilements which obscure or obstruct [buddha nature] that all phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa occur by way of dependent arising. Thus, if this [buddha] nature did not exist, then saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, bondage and liberation, and so on would not exist on the level of discursive conventions. But since this [buddha nature] does exist, such is not the case. As is stated in the Uttaratantra [RGV I.40cd],


If there were no buddha potential, there would also be no dissatisfaction with suffering,
Nor would there be any longing, searching or wishing for
nirvāṇa.

In the Śrīmālā[devīsiṃhanādanirdeśasūtra] (ŚDS) it is said,

Bhagavān, these six assemblages of consciousness and the consciousness are like that; these seven factors are unstable, disconnected, momentary, and do not experience suffering. Tathāgatagarbha is inseparably connected and not momentary and therefore experiences suffering.

Even the substratum is not perpetually continuous (rgyun brtan pa) since it comes to an end once the karmic seeds aspect [ceases on] the eighth level and the karmic maturation aspect [ceases on] the ninth level. But, regarding *sugatagarbha, the following was said:

As it was earlier, so it is later –
It is of an unchangeable nature.

In this regard, this [buddha nature] is perpetually continuous since it neither waxes nor wanes from sentient beings up to buddhas. Thus, it was posited as the ground of all phenomena comprising bondage and freedom, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, the innate and adventitious, and the two truths. It was said to be non-momentary by virtue of its not being newly produced by causes from beginningless time to the future, but this does not mean that conventionally there is no momentariness [in the sense of phenomena being] produced by causes and conditions.

Still, even if the ground of all phenomena prevails all-pervasively and impartially in buddhas and sentient beings, there is no need to [make it] a basis established [by valid sources of knowledge] because if there were something established in this way, the fallacy would absurdly follow that this factor and all persons individually endowed with it are selves and truly established.

Reply: Since that [buddha nature] is the root of all phenomena comprising pure and impure substratums etc., it is not inconsistent to explain it in that way. As is stated [in the Ghanavyūha],

The substratum of the various levels,
That is also the goodness that is buddha nature (*sugatagarbha).
The tathāgatas have indicated this nature (garbha)
By means of the term “substratum” (ālaya).
Although the garbha has been declared to be the ālaya,
It is not known by those of inferior intellect.

[3] As for the manner in which *sugatagarbha exists in sentient beings, [as in the line] “because they have the potential” [RGV I.28c], because that clarity aspect or manifestation aspect of *sugatagarbha, which is something that is of a similar type with (ris 'dra ba) the uncontaminated six cognitive domains of a perfect buddha, is—like milk in water—already present indivisibly (ris med par) within the six cognitive domains of all sentient beings since beginningless times, all sentient beings are endowed with *sugatagarbha. This is described as the “naturally present potential,” the “potential which obtains as the nature of things (dharmatā)” and the “distinct set of six cognitive domains”. But in the sūtras, from this [account] alone, [buddha nature] is not clear[ly revealed]. However, in the Mantrayāna, there are many more interpretations concerning this [buddha nature] such as the “potential which is a distinctive feature of the ten levels”— as in the statement [in Hevajratantra (HT) II.iv.64cd] “The levels (bhūmi) are the ten months [in the womb], so all beings are already the Lord of the ten levels”1194—and the “potential which is a distinctive feature of the three vajras”.

As for the unfolded potential: through nourishing that naturally present potential by way of the conditions of learning and so forth, when the category of the distinct set of six cognitive domains has become distinguished insofar as it is similar to the category of the uncorrupted, i.e., the Tathāgata, it is then called the “unfolded potential.” This being so, the insight and confidence of learning and so on make the naturally present potential awaken and blossom, though these [virtuous activities] are not the actual naturally present and the unfolded element and potential, as has been explained in the Dharmadhātustava.

Thus, just as the uncontaminated distinct set of the six cognitive domains of a tathāgata exists in all sentient beings, so there also exists the uncontaminated distinct set of six cognitive domains of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. Hence, there is no one at all who is not encompassed by the presentation of the six natural and unfolded potentials of the three vehicles. Further, the qualities of confidence and so forth which awaken the potential, do not [really] make an actual potential (rigs dngos) awaken. Rather, through the conditions of awakening the potential such as learning which are based on the eightfold consciousness, the roots of virtue of accumulating [merit and wisdom] and purifying [the mind from veils] which awaken the eleven virtuous [factors] such as confidence—the essence of the levels and paths—lead one to accomplish only the buddhahood of the Sūtra [system]. But at the time [the roots of virtue] are present, [they are] said to be present as something like a partial potential (rigs nyi tshe ba) which, by the power of the condition of means and wisdom, is able to fundamentally transform the contaminated virtues such as confidence into uncontaminated virtue. This is what my master Sangs rgyas mnyan pa ras chen has said. It is an additional remark that is not the [main] point [in this] context.

[1] Thus, by [the line] “Because the perfect body of the Buddha is [all-]pervading” [RGV I.28a], when one understands that the dharmakāya of buddhahood pervades the entire animate and inanimate world, one sees that there are no realms without buddhas and thus recognizes that one is never separated from the teacher, the buddha. By way of recollecting the buddha in this way, it will become unsurpassed.

[2] By [the line] “Because suchness is undifferentiated” [RGV I.28b], one beholds that the nature of mind from sentient beings up to buddhas is unchanging—“as it is before, so it is later”—and thus recognizes that “just like myself so too are all sentient beings like that.” From that arises great loving kindness which sees the similarity of oneself and sentient beings. Induced by that, there arises great compassion for sentient beings who suffer because they don't understand things in that way. Seeing that even this suffering does not belong to the mode of abiding, there arises the supreme intrepid intention by way of inner strength which is able to clear away suffering.

[3] By [the line] “Because they have the potential” [RGV I.28c], one realizes that the aspect of appearance (snang cha) in all its variety from buddhas to sentient beings of the three phases and so forth is a perceptual experience ('char sgo) of nothing other than the luminosity of mind. Thereby, as a remedy to overcome each and every obscuration from one's own mind, this very luminosity of one's own mind arises as supreme insight. Thence, there arise three types of certainty of being able to actualize suchness. To be deeply rooted in the certainty of these three means that one has plumbed the depths of all the teachings of the Buddha (buddhadharma).

Thus, among the expressions for the term “quintessence” (snying po) such as sāra, hṛdaya, garbha and maṇḍa, the first [sāra (“vital core”), is used] because many [qualities] spread out from a single quintessence. The second [hṛdaya (“heart”)] means something held to be vitally important like the heart of a living being. The third [garbha (“womb,” “quintessence”)] is like the kernel (snying po) within a husk. The fourth [maṇḍa (“cream,” “uppermost part”)] means extracting the essence [i.e., making the most] of an opportunity. The classification of the ways of positing [buddha nature] as a quintessence (snying po) are to be explained based on [how they have been] understood by scholars in line with [differing] contexts and capacities [of individuals].

Now, such a quintessence [buddha nature] is designated as conventional from the perspective of still having reifications and exertions (mtshan rtsol) involving the triad of object, agent, and act, but is designated as ultimate from the perspective wherein such reifications and exertions are no longer established. Although those who desire liberation on the basis of the two truths [as understood] in this way engage in acceptance and rejection, there is no reason to do anything at all in terms of accepting or rejecting the two truths as inherently existent [phenomena]. Consequently, it is said the entire range of view, meditation, conduct, and fruition, are spontaneously present, being devoid of acceptance and rejection, uncontrived, and effortless. [Thus] all mental engagements are ascertained as being [already] abandoned. This is an excellent presentation.

Although this statement describes [buddha nature] as a mere definiendum (mtshon bya), i.e., some uncontaminated factor, the cause of buddhahood that is the basis obscured (sgrib gzhi) by the eightfold consciousness, the defining conditions [definiens] (mtshan nyid) for such a cause of buddhahood are not fully, but only partially, revealed. And in particular, regarding such a definiendum, [the passage] does not clearly articulate the phenomenon designated (gdags bya'i chos), namely, the particular instance (mtshan gzhi) of the designation. And thus [this factor] is extremely secret and kept hidden. In light of this key point, because buddhahood that is realized on the basis of the actual phenomenon of *sugatagarbha—i.e., the basis for such designation—does not come to light in the buddhahood of the Sūtra tradition, the resultant Vajrayāna has been deemed superior to the causal Pāramitāyāna. Thus, as the supplement to the Guhyasamājatantra [GST] states,

Tantra [i.e., continuum] is the term for continuity.
Tantra has three aspects,
Classified as ground, nature, and inalienableness.
The aspect of the nature is the cause,
The ground is known as the means,
And not to be alienated [is] the fruition.
[Such] is the summary of the three [aspects] of tantra.

Of these, the causal continuum is the continuum of the nature. The path continuum is the continuum of the ground or the means. The resultant continuum is inalienableness. Therefore, it is the continuum of nonregression, of No More Learning. The first continuum is the substantial cause. The second is the co-operating cause. When these two causes unequivocally combine, the third continuum infallibly occurs as the result of this combination.

Reply: Amongst sūtras of the final wheel, [buddha nature] is described as a distinctive factor of cognition called the “substratum cognition” (kun gzhi'i shes pa). In this regard, the master Candrakīrti and others declared that there is no substratum cognition consensually verifiable as an empirical experience, even conventionally. Hence, it turns out that *sugatagarbha according to the Sūtra system does not exist, even conventionally. If it is thereby assumed that *sugatagarbha as explained in the Sūtra system is not established as a phenomenon that is able to fulfill the requirement of being a cause and a result in the quest for the goal of liberation, there is no such problem. [Why?] Because although a substratum cognition is not established even conventionally as something distinct from the sixfold consciousness, it is not untenable to posit a substratum consciousness conventionally. The sixfold consciousness is three-fold: [1] a coarse consciousness belonging to the sphere of the nine levels of the three realms and so forth, [2] a subtle consciousness belonging to the sphere of the eight levels and so forth of the inferior śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, and [3] a very subtle consciousness belonging to the sphere of the ten levels and so forth of the Mahāyāna. As there is therefore not only the coarse sphere of the sixfold consciousness, the very subtle sixfold consciousness is posited as the so-called “substratum cognition”. [As is stated in the Ghanavyūha] sūtra,

The substratum of the various levels,
That is also the goodness that is buddha nature (*sugatagarbha).
The tathāgatas have indicated this nature (garbha) By means of the term “substratum” (ālaya).

In such sūtras it is said that this extremely subtle consciousness of the various levels of Learning and No More Learning, i.e., completely perfect buddhahood, is not the domain of consciousness of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas and the like, but is the domain of buddhas and bodhisattvas of the Sūtra system and above. Immediately after that sūtra citation it is stated,

Although the essence has been declared to be a substratum, It is not known by those of inferior intellect.

And in the Laṅkāvatārasūtra [on II.98] it is said,

In this way, Mahāmati, since the movements and workings of the ālayavijñāna are very subtle, with the exception of tathāgatas and those bodhisattvas residing on the spiritual levels, it is not fathomed by others such as śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and yogins of heretical disciplines. It is not easy to discern even through the power of meditative absorptions and insight.

Reply: [The tantric buddha nature] is definitely not the sphere of the sixfold or eightfold consciousnesses belonging to the continua of defiled sentient beings. It is the sphere of the innate, natural, and spontaneously present wisdom, which is summed up by all the cognitions of the continua of undefiled buddhas. This dimension of the continuum which is the nature of the cause is—when purified through the path which accords exactly with this causal continuum and the continuum of the fruition—present in the classifications of the eleventh and twelfth levels of the Vajrayāna Path of Learning and the thirteenth and fourteenth additional levels of No More Learning and so forth.

Reply: No. Since this [tantric buddha nature] is present as the “impartial allpervading sovereign,” the “first buddha” (ādibuddha) and “first protector” (ādinātha) which is the engendering cause of the re-awakening of all buddhas via the path and fruition, it is correctly established as the “Buddha Jewel” in the causal phase. The fact that the buddha-continuum, which later arises unmistakably from the pure buddha potential in the causal phase as the unsurpassed fruition of complete and perfect buddhahood of path and fruition is attested in the meaning of the vajra statement “[buddhahood] emerges as the continuity (rgyun chags) of the three [aspects] of ground, path, and fruition”.

Therefore, even among the Kriyā and Caryā tantras, there are classifications of tantra (continuum) in terms of the three potentials and so on. And these types of potential are, from the very first, the nature of buddhahood.

Amongst the Yogatantras this is called “beginningless bodhicitta,” “allpositive (Samantabhadra) Mind,” “glorious supreme Primal Being,” and “Mind”. Considering that all of the three continua of the Vajrayāna are the pure buddhahood free from obscurations, the noble glorious Karma pa Rang byung rdo rje said the following in his Profound Inner Meaning: 

The cause is beginningless mind itself.
Even though it is unbiased and uncurtailed in scope, It is empty in essence, clear by nature and,
Being unimpeded, arises as anything whatsoever.

This aforementioned buddhahood or mind as such, which is the beginningless causal continuum, is free from restrictions and bias due to the fact that buddhas and sentient beings, the innate and the adventitious, or ground, path, and result are in every respect free from identity and difference. Thus, since that buddhahood of the causal continuum, which is the nature of such wisdom, does not ultimately exist as a real entity [as maintained] in the Cittamātra [tradition], it is “empty in essence.” And since this wisdom, which is of the character of emptiness, is not without the appearances of knower and known, it is “lucent by nature.” How does it clearly appear? In the phase of possessing impure obscurations, it occurs together with the appearances of karma and emotional afflictions. In the phase of being both pure and impure, [it occurs together with] the appearances of samādhi experiences. And in the completely pure phase, [it occurs together with] the appearances of the inexhaustible ornamental wheel of the enlightened body, speech, and mind.

Reply: The reason for it being a “resultant continuum” is that the impure appearances of the causal continuum do not appear at the time of the resultant continuum. [Why not?] Because precisely these [impure] appearances are the appearances that had obscured the causal continuum and that have been cleared away. However, it is not the case that the stream of appearances of the means [i.e., path] continuum of that [causal] stream would [also] no longer manifest because this stream of appearances of the resultant continuum is precisely the appearances of the means continuum which have become increasingly clear and excellent (je gsal je bzang). Even so, at the time of the resultant continuum, the entire range of appearances of the three continua of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa other than oneself manifest clearly.

In the impure phase of that causal continuum, the conceptualizations of [1] the fifty-one mental factors of the sixfold obscurational adventitious consciousness, [2] the mind with its three illuminations, and [3] the mind and mental factors possessing one hundred and sixty natures manifest unceasingly. On the other hand, in the phases of the path and fruition continua, the creative expressions of mind and mental factors—[i.e.,] the principal and retinue, such as the innate and unobscured three embodiments (sku gsum) and four wisdoms or five embodiments and six wisdoms—manifest unceasingly.

Now, concerning the “aspect of the nature” in the citation “The aspect of the nature is the cause,” being innate (gnyug ma) or primordial (gdod ma), [namely,] uncontrived and not dependent on something else that is new, it is naturalness (tha mal pa nyid), present since beginningless time.

To explicate the implicit meaning (don can) of such a citation, the term “natural” (rang bzhin : prakṛtyā) was [used] accordingly. The great editors of former times also translated this [Sanskrit] term prakṛtyā, in other contexts, by the term tha mal [“natural” or “ordinary”]. Such a translation is an even better semantic equivalent because, when a yogin experiences in himself the first dawning (nam gsal) of the primordially natural causal continuum (gdod ma'i tha mal gyi rgyu rgyud), this must be considered the starting point (dang po) of the path continuum. And because when that natural awareness is first directly encountered through the auspicious coincidence of the process of empowerment and [this] ground is thus recognized, it is deemed essential that the meaning of the empowerment conferred, the foundation of Mantra[yāna], is directly encountered and arises [in one's mind]. According to the noble Mahāsiddha Koṭali,

Natural awareness awakens in the middle of the heart.

And the Dharmarāja Sgam po pa stated that

“the best students, having the opportunity for Mantra[yāna], are freshly introduced to natural awareness.”

This is thoroughly established as the most arcane among [all that is] arcane.

Since this empowerment of the ground [i.e., in natural awareness] is connected with the two stages of the path [i.e., the Creation and Completion Stages], which [in turn] are seamlessly (rgyun chags su) connected with the many methods of [tantric] vows (sdom : saṃvara) and commitments (dam tshig : samaya), it is considered to be the continuum of path and means. This path and means continuum is again twofold, consisting of both a main and general one. The general one comprises the paths from the path of the causal vehicle (hetuyāna) up to the Yoginī tantras. The main one is held to be the path of the Great Yoga [Mahāyoga].

[I.] According to the great Tsong kha pa, by reasoning that the aggregates and so forth are free from one or many, the emptiness of the object of analysis, which is characterized as a nonaffirming negation, is [considered to be] the nature (dharmatā) of phenomena (dharma). It is also ultimate truth, as well as buddha nature (*sugatagarbha), as well as the causal continuum as it is explained in the Great Yoga. Not only is this said to be the theory propounded in the tantras, the [tantric] bodhisattva commentaries, and by the noble father and son [Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva], but it is also the theory [maintained by those] up to and including Abhayā[karagupta] and Śāntipa [i.e., Ratnākaraśānti].

Not only does this [account] fail to correctly identify *sugatagarbha, which is the causal continuum (rgyu rgyud) of Mantrayāna, but it also fails to correctly identify the ultimate truth and emptiness as explained by the noble father [Nāgārjuna] and son [Āryadeva]. Regarding emptiness and ultimate truth as he [Tsong kha pa] explains it, the emptiness from the perspective of the analysis of an object of valid sources of knowledge is nothing more than a [conceptual] universal qua nonaffirming negation. And this universal property is nothing but a mere mental aspect [representation], an apprehended object that is the mode of apprehension of this cognition. For this reason, it is not the case that an object of knowledge and cognition—i.e., the experiencing of consciousness together with its objects—could turn out to be emptiness and ultimate truth. For, in the Mūla[madhyamakakārikā XVIII.9] the following is stated:

Not dependent on another, quiescent, Not elaborated by discursive thoughts,
Without concepts, without differentiation:
These are the characteristics of reality.

Thus, were it the case that some property (chos) that is the object of cognition and knowledge is the property “emptiness,” then how would a nonempty property be any different from that? If this kind of emptiness exists as the apprehended object of cognition together with its apprehending [subject], then how could that be ultimate truth which is devoid of all discursive elaboration, for what is conventional truth other than the truth [or reality] of subject and object of a cognition involving the apprehended and apprehender? Therefore, given that the way in which ultimate truth—profound emptiness—is made an object of the wisdom of complete and perfect buddhahood is inconceivable, how is it reasonable that it takes the form of a negation or affirmation as an object imputed as valid [by the] direct perception or inference of ordinary people, hearers, noble ones, and others?

Because of this point, the victorious Ajita [Maitreya in RGV II.31–33] likewise states,

Buddhahood is the object of omniscient wisdom,

Thus, it is to be known as inconceivable
[Even] for those people of intellect.

Being subtle, it is not an object of study.
Being the ultimate, it is not [an object] of thought.
Being the profound nature of reality,
It is not an object of worldly meditation and the like.

This is because it was never seen before by the immature,

Reply: No, this is not the case. That emptiness, ultimate truth, of the noble ones such as a perfect buddha does not belong to the sphere of subject and objects, thinker and thoughts, and the like. In that regard, the terms “object of understanding” or “object of realization” were coined in order to help those of feeble intellect to relinquish their fears. As is stated in the Mūla[Madhyamakakārikā],

[The ultimate] is without characteristics and characterized;
And it is beyond expression in words.
It stands to reason that what are presented as
Characteristics and characterized [objects] are imputations.

Otherwise, if emptiness, ultimate truth, could be established as subject and object [and thus] existed as a basis which is of the nature of a definable property (mtshon bya'i chos), it would have to be an object for the conceptual mind.

Thus, the emptiness and ultimate truth in that system [of Tsong kha pa] is not attested in the exegesis of the noble father [Nāgārjuna] and son [Āryadeva].

[B] In the second case [i.e., equating buddha nature only with the analyzer], when the resultant continuum of that analyzer is attained, then the resultant continuum of all sentient beings would be attained because that causal continuum of the analyzer exists as the general continuum of the causal continua of all sentient beings. It does not end there: that the mere emptiness of true existence [could be] the cause of any phenomena is not even accepted in the world and is [certainly] not accepted in any of the Buddhist philosophies. Also, if it is impossible for the aspect of mere negation of such emptiness of true existence to have any relationship of identity or causality with any phenomena, how is it possible for it to be a substantive cause?

Reply: It cannot be established that such emptiness—i.e., the emptiness of a nonaffirming negation—is not concomitant with any predicate of a subject other than mind because all predicates of subjects, and the nature (chos nyid : dharmatā) of [their being] identical in essence, are emptiness. Moreover, if that predicate [i.e., emptiness] is not concomitant with subjects other than mind, then such emptiness—mere empti[ness] of true existence—could not be a nonaffirming negation because mind alone was taken as the predicate to be proven (sgrub chos) as empty.

Reply: But that nonaffirming negation emptiness which is the focus of analysis could not be that emptiness qua nonaffirming negation of all phenomena because of precisely that claim [that emptiness applies only to mind]. In that case, since that type of the causal continuum could not be that emptiness which is the true nature of all phenomena, one would conclude that it is only an emptiness from the standpoint of assumption (rlom tshod), being the focus of analysis. Therefore, how could such an emptiness be regarded as the ultimate truth of emptiness?

[III.] According to the great Red mda' ba, the causal continuum is the ground of purification of the continuum of skillful means (thabs rgyud). Therefore, it has two aspects, conventional phenomena and the ultimate nature of phenomena. Of these, the first comprises both the impure world and its inhabitants because these are the ground of purification of the Creation Stages. The second is the ultimate Tenfold Powerful One, which is the pervasive adamantine body (kāyavajra) and the suchness of mind possessing defilements that is itself luminous. Being concordant with states that are virtuous, nonvirtuous, indeterminate and so on, its intrinsic nature is the mere clear and aware [mode of] experiencing. Like an illusion and a dream, it is free from the extremes of permanence and annihilation such as existence, nonexistence, and so on. Since it is impossible [for something] to be permanent yet changing, [the causal continuum] is impermanent [in the sense that it] momentarily arises and ceases.

Reply: This too is untenable. The impure world and its inhabitants are not the causal continuum because the actual causal continuum must be something that functions as the substantial cause (nyer len gyi rgyu : upādānakāraṇa) of the resultant continuum, whereas the impure world and its inhabitants are adventitious defilements to be removed when attaining the resultant continuum. It is also not tenable that these [i.e., world and inhabitants] are the ground of purification because they are the adventitious defilements to be cleared away. Further, the ultimate Tenfold Powerful One of the pervasive adamantine body is not clearly manifest in the phase of the causal continuum, yet the appearance of the Tenfold Powerful One in the phase of the causal continuum is posited as the appearance of a mind possessing defilements. The consequence is that this is nothing more than a deluded appearance. And although the factor of a mere clear, empty awareness which is of the nature of the eightfold consciousness, viz., the mind possessing defilements, is labelled with the term luminosity, it does not make sense to posit it as the causal continuum because it is not the authentic natural awareness that is uncontrived by nature, but is the factor of knowing that is a superimposition, an adventitious defilement. When its basis, the aspect of the subject (chos can) [which is ordinary mind], is cleared away, then the luminosity of mere clear, empty awareness that is labelled as its nature will also be eliminated.

Reply: This is untenable. Even in the Pāramitāyāna, it is explained that if the nature of the minds that are the subjects (chos can) possessing defilements are not fundamentally transformed, then complete buddhahood is not attained. If so, then how could it be that in Mantrayāna, the mind that is the subject possessing defilements is the cause of the most sublime buddhahood? And in particular, how could the minds of persons possessing the six elements of the seventh continent, which are endowed with whatsoever latent tendencies of the two accumulations, not only exist as the causal continuum of Mantra[yāna] but also as buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) in the ground phase of the Sūtra[yāna]? And, in particular, the causal continuum of the Secret Mantra is a natural, spontaneous causal continuum that has been present since beginningless time as the essence of myriad elements, but it is not present as a phenomenon having latent tendencies that [in turn] implant new latent tendencies.

[V.] In the words of the great scholar ['Gos Lo tsā ba] Yid bzang rtse pa: “Regarding the so-called 'self' which is of two kinds, the coarse self and subtle self, it is necessary to posit the extraordinary causal continuum of the Mantra[yāna] on the basis of the subtle self as explained in the Mañjuśrī root tantra and the Sngags la 'jug pa drug bcu pa, which comments on its meaning. The coarse self is construed as nominally existent, an imputation of a self or person, the object of the mind that posits a self or person once it has objectified the collocation that comprises the psychophysical aggregates and the rest. The subtle self is construed as the ālayavijñāna, the mind characterized as continually immersed in all states of saṃsāra. This is precisely the subtle self (phra ba'i bdag nyid) that is called “the true reality” (de kho na nyid) or “the person who is a Great Man (skye bu chen po'i gang zag). Also, the Mahāsiddha Luipa has described the causal continuum, which is very difficult to discover, as a Person who is a Spiritual Practitioner (sgrub pa po'i gang zag). He identifies such a person as

'a leader in pure ethics and learning.'

Being endowed with qualities such as these, he belongs to the definitive lineage of Great Yoga.

For the Mahāpaṇḍita Nāropa as well, the 'Jewel-like Person' is explained in terms of this subtle self. In this regard, even though the causal continuum is in this case posited on the basis of the subtle self, it is not like the self of the non-Buddhist Sāṃkhyas, which is explained as having five constituents [of subtle matter]. Rather, in this Kālacakra [KCT], that self is ascertained as emptiness. Hence, when such emptiness is directly realized, the voidness of [impure] mind and apprehension [of selflessness] become manifest. Therefore, not only does this not become a metaphysical view of the self (ātmadṛṣṭi), it is even the supreme antidote to it.”

Response: This is untenable. In general, is the self that you posit as having two aspects, coarse and subtle, taken in the sense of a person or in the sense of phenomena? The latter case is not asserted by you, [leaving you] no option but the first. But, in that case, this doctrine that there is a personal self (pudgalātman) is not [found] anywhere from the Kashmiri Vaibhāṣikas up to those who proclaim the authentic Dharma of the Bhagavān Kālacakra.

Objection: But, isn't it the case that within the eighteen subsects of the Śrāvakas, there are some schools, such as the Vātsīputrīya, who propound an indescribable self which is neither identical with nor different from the self?
Reply: Indeed, such schools do theorize in that way. However, in regard to these proponents, the glorious Candrakīrti said in his commentary on the [Madhyamaka]avatāra that

for those who assert personal selfhood, there is no liberation and that it would therefore be difficult to consider this doctrine correct.

[Candrakīrti here] brings out the sense implicit in the Buddhist teaching.

Reply: According to [Vasubandhu's] Abhidharmakośabhāṣya [AKBh], even that self or person which is posited as a nominally existent person is—in the doctrinal system specific to the Buddhist substance ontologists—described only as a 'self' in the sense of a nominally existent phenomena. However, even though the Mādhyamikas simply repeat what others say about this nominally existent self as a mere linguistic convention, they never ever posit an established personal self as a nominally existent real entity within the tenets of their own system! In a sūtra it is said:

The so-called “self” is a demonic thought;
You are one who has become this view. The aggregate of formations is empty; In these, there is no sentient being.
In the same way that a “chariot” is denoted On the basis of an assemblage of parts, Likewise the convention “sentient being” is Applied on the basis of the aggregates.

Hence, the posited phenomenon that is presented as a nominally imputed self and sentient being—a conventional linguistic designation acknowledged by others—is never ever established as an existent self in our tradition. For, as the glorious Candrakīrti has stated [in MA VI.81],

Is not accepted, even conventionally, by me.
But, as a means to an end, I have said nonexistent things exist
In compliance with the whims and wishes of the world.

If even a mere[ly imputed] self (bdag tsam) is not posited in one's tradition, then how is it acceptable to posit in one's tradition many degrees of selves, differentiated in profundity from coarse to subtle, either generally in the doctrinal system of Buddhists or specifically in the doctrinal system of the Madhyamaka of the causal and resultant vehicles? Furthermore, you take great pains to proclaim that “on the side of imputation, the imputed phenomenon of a person or a self is established by valid sources of knowledge,” and you thereby define the Madhyamaka doctrinal system along these lines. But apart from copying these quotations extracted from the Eloquent Explanation of Tsong kha pa, the great leader in the later wave of those so-called “Mādhyamikas” who describe things in this way, how would it be acceptable in the context of the pure doctrinal system of the earlier wave of Madhyamaka?

You accept a nominally existent coarse self and posit, conventionally, a subtle self as the substantially existent ālayavijñāna that is mind. In this case, you become an advocate of substantially existent persons [i.e., a pudgalavādin]. But this is precisely what is refuted (dgag bya) in the extensive canonical scriptures of the complete and perfect Buddha! That is not all: if you proclaim that mind is a person qua creator (byed pa po), then because the creator of all phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is none other than mind only and the activities of mind only, the self and person who is the creator of all of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa would also exist.

In particular, if one posits the cause that is one's own mind [both] as what is to be accomplished to [realize] buddhahood and as the person who is the accomplisher, then act and agent become one. And [more] specifically, if the identification of a 'person' consists in correlating [it] with special qualities of the mind such as pure ethics and the like, then the identification of a person endowed with afflictive emotions requires positing such afflictive emotions as desire and the rest as the person.

Also, when the “Jewel-like Person” is taken as only a subtle self, then a Jewellike Person who is just a commonplace person (gang zag tsam po ba) possessing the coarse continuities of the aggregates and so forth would not be a Jewel-like Person.

Therefore, not satisfied with the mere conventionally and nominally imputed self, you further claim there is a continuous subtle, ultimate self.

[This] is a great insuperable lie that contradicts your own words. [How so?] Because even the Sāṃkhya and others who were [similarly] not satisfied with a merely conventionally-posited, putative personal self did not accept even the slightest personal self besides their theory of the ultimate being a self possessing the five causally-efficacious constituents and the rest.

Moreover, if that causal continuum which [you identify with the] ālayavijñāna mind is a subtle self and person, then [1] is it posited as [what really is] a self and person or [2] is it [just] posted that way even though it is not [a self or person]? [1] If it is, then the self would be emptiness given that in Kālacakratantra [KCT] etc., when one ascertains that [the self] is bliss and emptiness, the voidness of [impure] mind and apprehension [of selflessness] become manifest.

If one thinks that is not entailed, this is not the case because a selflessness and emptiness in which [the self] at first exists and later becomes nonexistent cannot be established as the selflessness and emptiness as they are explained in the great sūtras and tantras.

The counterpart of existence is nonexistence,

That is not all: if the self at first exists and is later nonexistent, then how could a phenomenon that is [both] eternalistic and nihilistic be the selflessness and emptiness that are free from eternalism and nihilism? As is said [in MMK XV.11],

In general, calling the complete and perfect Buddha a “person who is a Great Man” (skye bu chen po'i gang zag : mahāpuruṣa pudgala) is widely attested not only in the Secret Mantra [scriptures] but also in the sūtras. In that context, if one wonders what the so-called “person who is a Great Man” denotes, it is only a conventional designation for the qualities of the referent of the designation (gdags gzhi) “buddha” endowed with [all] the major and minor marks and so on. If it was impossible for anyone to say there is a person who is a Great Man apart from each of these qualities such as the major and minor marks, then what is more illogical than postulating a self as the creator of the designated qualities (gdags chos) of all who are the referents of designation (gdags gzhi), i.e., the persons who are great men in the Mantra [scriptures]. [You] people of intellectual integrity, please think properly!

Reply: This is not the case. Those wisdoms discussed in the causal vehicle comprise [1] the naturally present potential of great awakening that exists in the sphere of the eightfold consciousness, and [2] the eleven virtues such as confidence and the rest which constitute the unfolded potential. When [the latter] have been practiced on the [Paths of] Accumulation and Preparation as the [thirtyseven] factors conducive to awakening comprising the [four] foundations of mindfulness, the [four] perfect renunciations, the [four] bases of miraculous powers, and the five strengths and powers, then to the extent that [the practitioner] has become a noble [bodhisattva] there will occur the wisdom of [the Path of] Seeing and Cultivation. Then [follows the accomplishment of] the qualities of the [seven] elements for awakening and the [eightfold] noble path. In the sūtras, it is due to this wisdom or thirty-seven factors that [together] make [one] attain great awakening that everything subsumed under mind and mental factors within the sphere of the eightfold consciousness—i.e., the three obscurations along with the obscuring aspect of the debilitating malaise that is [connected] with them—are abandoned. At the end, on the Path of No More Learning, there arises the omniscience that marks the complete perfection of the thirty-seven factors conducive to awakening.

In this regard, however, this causal *sugatagarbha—[described by concepts] such as the “distinct set of six cognitive domains,” “the immaculate consciousness,” both “the latent tendency of learning” (śrutavāsanā), and the “substratum” (ālaya), and the “omniscient wisdom,” which is extracted [from ignorance] unmixed like [the milk extracted from a mixture of] water and milk [by the mythical goose]—is not the actual full-fledged body of *sugatagarbha, the causal continuum, as it is explicated in the tantras of the profound and vast Vajrayāna. [Why not?] Because if it were, then [the causal continuum] would not exist as a [genuine] birth-place [of spiritual realization] since it would not exist independently of the sphere of the adventitiously defiled eightfold consciousness. Nevertheless, the immaculate consciousness as explained in the sūtras is a partial aspect of the causal continuum, *sugatagarbha, as elucidated in the Mantrayāna because, were it not, it would be impossible for it to clear away the obscurations of the contaminated [aspects] of the eightfold consciousness once these have been fundamentally transformed into uncontaminated wisdom.

Reply: When the power of wisdom having the capacity of compassion and insight of the enlightened body, speech, and mind of that [all-]pervading sovereign, the impartial first perfect buddha—which is the causal continuum explained in the tantras—has infused with blessings the aspects of confidence and the other [virtuous factors] belonging to the eightfold consciousness, the spiritual potential (gotra) is awakened [and] once the potential is purified, the buddhahood of the sūtric system will be attained.

But if, at the time of awakening to buddhahood of the sūtric system, one is not suffused with enlightened compassion by that buddha of the causal continuum of the tantric system in this way, then [even] a buddha of the sūtric system would be unable to bring one to buddhahood by a sūtric path [alone]. This was said in the oral teachings of the great siddha, the perfect Sangs rgyas mnyan pa, to be the doctrine of the great victor, the Karma pa Rang byung [rdo rje]. This very point appears to have also been described as a “hidden meaning” in the causal vehicle itself. The glorious Ajita clearly cites [in RGV I.28a] the proof that there exists a potential, a cause for the awakening of sentient beings: 

Because the perfect body of the Buddha is [all-]pervading…

Many commentators on this citation have said as a proof that sentient beings have the potential of buddhahood that the compassionate light of the buddhas who already attained buddhahood previously radiates downward to the potential that is the cause of awakening and thereby awakens the potential. Others say that if one attains buddhahood in the future on account of having the potential of buddhahood at present, it is “because the perfect body of the Buddha is [all-]pervading”. Such is the proof that *sugatagarbha presently exists in the mindstream of a sentient being. Although there are various unrelated explanations, they are [all] the result of not getting to the bottom of this key-point.

Now, the elements, aggregates, etc. of wisdom explained in the Mantrayāna are not just the wisdom of the causal vehicle wherein the adventitious defilements, i.e., the eightfold consciousness of sentient beings, have given way to luminosity. Rather, [they] are precisely the wisdom that is the awakened mind continuum (thugs rgyud) of the sixth family, the Great Vajradhara, the all-pervading sovereign, the original protector during the causal phase. It is due to that wisdom that the six factors such as the aggregates of fruition wisdom which has arisen from the substantial causal continuum are posited. That said, it is not the case that the wisdom as explained in the causal vehicle would not be included as a facet of that wisdom [explained] in the Mantra vehicle.

[1] [General explanation:] The causal continuum free from defilements and the adventitious defilements with obscurations based on it are in both cases present as the two truths. Thus, regarding the purity of the ultimate, both the unobscured and obscured, the pure and impure are [equally] devoid of being established by intrinsic essences. Conversely, the [A] cognitive obscurations, what is apprehended as the variety of discursive signs and elaborations, and [B] the entire range of afflictive obscurations based on that, which are the subject-object [duality] with its multitude of karma and afflictions, are nothing but the clinging to appearances as they are conceptualized in delusion. Thus, since these phenomena are essentially devoid of subsisting as an essence of both the unobscured and obscured they are established as precisely the nirvāṇa, which is pure by nature. That much is also shown in the causal vehicle.

</d>
<d e="2">
From taking such a mode of viewing purity as our basis, here in the Mantrayāna, the obscurationless *sugatagarbha as causal continuum itself is in a state of being afflicted by painful factors, the obscurational adventitious defilements. Yet, however much [this has occurred], *sugatagarbha as causal continuum itself remains primordially pure in being the very nature of genuine bliss (bde ba dam pa). Thus, it is impossible for any adulteration by suffering and afflictions to make it impure. This is because the inseparable e vaṃ of the causal continuum is not accompanied by the essence of any obscurational factor, as it is unable to be separated [i.e., fragmented] by any obscuring defilements.

That is the purity of great bliss while its opposite, those phenomena that manifest in the forms of suffering, are not truly established in themselves as suffering.

Even these [forms of] suffering are self-liberated in natural great bliss, becoming completely pure.

When the very ground of anything that appears as suffering is recognized as the suchness of suffering, then [one] does not see any thing (dngos po) that is different from the suchness of bliss. Thus, subject and object resolve into purity as the same flavor of great bliss. As for the purity of the conventional of both what is unobscured and obscured, the unobscured (sgrib bral) refers to the maṇḍala inhabitant, the founding (rten) and founded (brten) [aspects] of the sublime other (gzhan mchog). The obscured (sgrib bcas) is the body and mind with the inner six elements which are to be purified. Within the obscured inner vajra body, the whole spectrum of maṇḍala inhabitants of the other vajra is present as the naturally pure principle. And the inner obscured vajra body together with the outer worldly realm are all blessed as the essence of awakened qualities (byang chos) which are of the nature of the six [buddha] families, the maṇḍala inhabitants of the founding and founded [aspects] of the unobscured sublime other. Thus, all the outer and inner worlds are liberated as the essence of the pure deity. And all this liberation is due to the power of the indestructible self-awareness of the causal continuum. As is said [Hevajra I.ix, 3a–b]:

One's own purity is to be experienced by oneself.
One is not liberated by [any] other purity.

Being of such an essence, the mode of purity of the two truths is also not a purity distinct from the causal continuum, because there is nothing to establish apart from the mere aspect of appearance-emptiness of self-awareness as such. As is said [in Hevajra I.ix.1]:

Certainly, the purity of all things is known to be suchness.
Following this, we consider each of the different deities [to be pure].

[2] [According to the way it is elucidated in this oral tradition of Vajradhara:] As to the way to transcend suffering [or attain nirvāṇa], the aspect of the truth of suffering, which comprises samsaric phenomena—according to the traditions of exoteric [Buddhist] teachings—the origin [of suffering, comprising] both karma and afflictions [and] both collective and individual experiences of suffering, are taken as what should be relinquished. After having relinquished all suffering through the truth of the path which is [seen to be] something different from those [things to relinquish], the absence of those [things] is the truth of cessation, which is [again] posited as something different.

<d e="2">
By contrast, in the Mantra way of transcending suffering [or attaining nirvāṇa] here, this saṃsāra with all [its] suffering is not relinquished [but] is itself taken as nirvāṇa of the path and cessation. Because [nirvāṇa] is [thus] accomplished through the great power of dependent arising [or auspicious connection] of the Secret Mantra [tradition], the very nature of the origin [of suffering] is the truth of the path. And since it exists as the truth of the path, the nature of the truth of suffering is present as the nature of the truth of cessation. By manifesting in this [way], the intrinsic nature of [this] diverse manifold is precisely what is posited as having “nothing to remove or add.” Yet whatever experiences of saṃsāra may arise, they manifest as nirvāṇa, which is naturally pure. Therefore, it was with this point in mind that the expression “making the goal the path” was also used. As is stated [in Hevajra II.iv, 32]:

Such indeed is saṃsāra, and such is nirvāṇa.
It is said, “there is no nirvāṇa other than saṃsāra.”

Thus, it is precisely the truth of suffering that manifests spontaneously as the great truth of cessation, without [anything] being given up. In this regard, for followers of the Bka' brgyud Dwags po lha rje, “whatever arises is the practice of dharmakāya, phenomenal existence is the shifting display of dharmatā.” [This is] taken as the unsurpassable secret discourse of those of supreme fortune.

The deity of the causal continuum and buddhahood itself are present in the primordially present great Completion Stages. In this regard, when a fortunate disciple of highest capacity and a qualified teacher come together in auspicious circumstances, then by the teacher simply making a connection (mtshams sbyar ba) using mere symbolic indications or words, the wisdom of self-arisen mahāmudrā or the face of the primordially present buddha is encountered directly. Among the Bka' brgyud pas this is known as “the emergence of mahāmudrā realization.” Therefore, the buddha of the causal continuum or the perfect deity itself are present as primordial buddha[hood] even during the obscured phase of impure sentient beings. I already explained this system eloquently in my treatise Nerve Tonic for the Elderly.

Yet some, not fully comprehending [this view], think [it means that] even the buddha nature (*sugatagarbha) in the mental continuum of a grizzled old dog would also become a buddha. And, were this the case, then even while the grizzled old dog itself is a sentient being, its continuum would at the same time be a buddha because [a being] does not have two [different] continua. In terms of this profound [Bka' brgyud] doctrinal system, this is nothing more than idle talk which does not produce even the slightest accumulation [of merit or wisdom].

Thus, as Karma pa Rang byung rdo rje reports in his auto-commentary on the
Profound Inner Meaning,
It is said that the undefiled, the adamantine body (rdo rje'i lus) [comprising] the exceedingly profound formal embodiments (rūpakāya) endowed with all major and minor marks, which are the natural outflow (rgyu mthun pa : niṣyanda) manifesting from buddha nature (buddhagarbha), abides in the body possessing defilements.
It is said that this mind possessing defilements, which is ensconced in many sheaths of afflictions, is buddha nature (buddhagarbha)— present replete with the buddha-qualities of the [ten] powers, such as knowing what is possible and impossible, the [four kinds of] fearlessness, and the [eighteen] qualities specific [to a buddha].

With this statement, he openly divulges the inner meanings which were thoroughly hidden. Wishing to show the adamantine topics in this [treatise], he says,

[This] explains the inner principles of body and mind.

With [this] passage he explains that the undefiled [adamantine body replete with] the major and minor marks are present within the defiled body and that buddhahood, endowed with qualities such as the powers, is present within the defiled mind. [For] deluded sentient beings who live in this way, the great primordial perfect buddhahood (sangs rgyas ye rdzogs chen po) of the causal continuum is obscured by [their] mistaken imputations. In this regard, the Śrīmālā[devīsiṃhanādanirdeśasūtra (ŚDS)] says,

Bhagavān, if tathāgatagarbha exists, then saṃsāra is merely a nominal imputation.

And the Pañcakrama says,

The whole animate world lacks independence,
[And] does not arise independently.
Its cause is its luminous [nature],
A luminous [nature] empty of everything.

Even at the time of being obscured by mistaken imputations, buddhahood which is present as buddhahood free from the obscurations of mistaken imputations is considered to be the [as yet] unrefined, unpurified buddha and deity and as the Completion Stages of complete purity. As is stated in the Treatise Revealing Buddha Nature by the great victor Rang byung [rdo rje],

In that [dharmakāya], the two form embodiments by nature
Comprise the thirty-two signs and marks. 
The qualities obtained are one's own body.
This body is not produced by a Self, Fate (phya), Lord (īśvara),
Brahmā, real external particles, or something hidden.
When these impure manifestations
Of subject and object of the five [sense] gates have been purified,
Then the term “attainment” is applied.
Therefore, when the energy channels, currents, and potencies
Are purified, they are the pure form embodiments.
Unpurified they are the impure form embodiments.

In this citation, each of the triad of the defiled semen (khu), uterine blood (rdul) and the energy current (rlung) are present replete with the major and minor marks of the immaculate [buddha] body, the sixty [qualities of a buddha's] speech, and the two [aspects of] knowledge of a [buddha's] mind. The semen and uterine blood exist as ever-present buddhahood endowed with the host of unobscured virtues to be attained: The thirty two major marks of the thirty twofold means and wisdom [aspects] of the sixteen joys relating to the sixteen vowels (āli), and the eighty minor marks of the means and wisdom [aspects] of the forty kinds of bliss relating to the forty consonants (kāli).

The lord and master with the thirty-two major marks, And the eighty minor marks,

Thus, the primordially perfect deity itself has always, from the very beginning, been immaculate buddhahood. It has not turned 'bad' due to obscurations of impure sentient beings and has not turned 'good' due to freedom from obscurations. As is stated in the [Treatise Revealing] Buddha Nature by the great victor Rang byung [rdo rje],

It is precisely this natural awareness, which is
Called the dharmadhātu, the nature of the victors (jinagarbha).
It is not turned good by the noble ones,
It has not turned bad by sentient beings. Although it is described by many terms,
Its meaning is not understood through description.

Sixty-four [buddha] qualities

Though the buddha or the deity of the primordial Completion Stages are present without defilements even in the causal continuum, [when] connected with adventitious defilements, it is labelled as sentient being; when [partly] cleansed from defilements, it is labelled as bodhisattva; and when purified from defilements it is labelled as buddha. But [such] labels are mere postulates for relational factors (ltos chos). By contrast, when [buddha nature] was imputed as “ever-present” (ye bzhugs), [this means] the buddha and the deity of the thoroughly pure Completion Stages, being free from conceptualization and nonconceptualization, are not newly arisen and are not newly attained. That is why the glorious supreme victor Rang byung says in [his treatise on] Buddha Nature,

According to the stages of impure, impure and pure,
And utterly pure, the three phases of
Sentient beings, bodhisattvas, and tathāgatas are described.
However, buddhahood is nothing newly arisen.
As it was earlier, so it is later.
Such is the unchanging buddha nature (buddhagarbha).
Change is described as the freedom from defilements.
Those who follow wrong views
Think that buddha-qualities are either without cause
Or are produced by external causes and conditions
That are not in ourselves. 
How does this differ from the [views of] eternalism
And nihilism of the non-Buddhists?

Thus, although the completely perfect buddha who is without obscurations exists in the body-mind, which possesses obscurations, so long as the obscurational factors (sgrib bcas kyi cha) have not been dispelled, the deeds of its [buddha-]qualities will not be performed; such is the unfathomable way of conventional dependent arising.

Query: Still, some Tibetans say that if buddhahood is indeed available during the time of the cause, then it would absurdly stand to reason that the buddha during the cause phase would have to perform deeds just like the buddha at the time of fruition, yet he does not do so.

Reply: If such a criticism is rationally coherent, then it would likewise be rationally coherent [to criticize the] Bhagavān Buddha and the great victor Rang byung [rdo rje] who has attained mastery in that [Buddha's] intent. As is said [in the Hevajratantra (HT) II.iv.69],

Sentient beings are actually buddhas,
Though these are obscured by adventitious defilements. Once these [defilements] are removed, they are buddhas.

And [Rang byung rdo rje's] auto-commentary on the Profound Inner Meaning says,

As for explaining the unfathomable way: although buddha nature (buddhagarbha) is immaculate, so long as all the defilements bound up with afflictions and what is knowable have not been relinquished, one will not become a buddha. [This] is the meaning of “element” (khams : dhātu). Although these very obscurations have been connected [with the mind] since beginningless time, they are adventitious. Therefore, these obscurations do not truly exist substantially. [This] is the meaning of “awakening” (byang chub : bodhi). And, even though at present the sixty-four qualities of buddhahood fully exist in all obscured sentient beings, they do not appear as the qualities of the fruition phase, like a jewel that is encased in stone. Therefore, the meaning of “qualities” (yon tan : guṇā) is that when [they are] not brought forth through the positive qualities that are the natural outflow of the exceedingly undefiled dharmadhātu, their capacity cannot become manifest.

Therefore, [your] criticism would also have to apply to these statements. In case one thinks that there is nothing wrong with voicing such [criticism], then what could be more wrong than finding fault with the victorious one and his sons along with their disciples who are all faultless? In this regard, it is said that although [buddha] qualities already exist as the ever-perfect Completion Stages or primordially attained innate buddhahood, they need to be re-awakened (slar sangs rgyas dgos).

As explained by our [spiritual] master, the omniscient great Ras pa [Sangs rgyas] mnyan pa,

The so-called “Creation” and “Completion” describe sequentially (rim bzhin) being born, and, having been born, being accomplished. Thus, what has been born is precisely what is therein accomplished. The Stages of Creation always imply Completion and the Stages of Completion always imply Creation. By engaging [in them in this way], the two Stages of Creation and Completion are, in their own nature, not two different things.

As it is stated in the Hevajra [HT I.viii],

Dwelling equally in both stages,
The Stages of Creation and
The Stages of Completion,
The Vajra-holder teaches the dharma.

Hence, it is established that dwelling in the Creation Stages itself means dwelling in the Completion Stages, and dwelling in the Completion Stages itself means dwelling in the Creation Stages. Therefore, as the Saṃvarodayapadminīnāmapañjikā [SMP] states,

The stages of so-called creation, taking birth, and arising [on the one hand], and completion, maturation, accomplishment, and unity [on the other hand] have the same meaning.

Reply: It is precisely that maṇḍala of *sugatagarbha in [its] causal phase, which comes forth or is created as the maṇḍala of *sugatagarbha in [its] path phase, and is thoroughly complete [as the] ultimate [maṇḍala]. That being the case, because there are two [sets of activities]—initially, the activities of creation and, subsequently, the activities of completion—they are described in terms of [these] two stages of ritual. However, these two liturgical stages are [taught] for the sake of gathering the two stores [of merit and wisdom] and purifying the two obscurations. They are not incompatible styles of meditation, given the compatibility in [their] methods of [1] taking the cause and fruition of saṃsāra as the path by means of the four [aspects of] approach and accomplishment of the deity of the Creation Stages and similarly [2] taking the cause and fruition of saṃsāra as the path by means of the four [aspects of] approach and accomplishment of the deity of the Completion Stages.

Now, the maṇḍala inhabitant during the causal phase first cultivates the aspect of the adventitiously defiled consciousness as the deity. Regarding the result of that cause, the deity which thus appears, or manifests, is described as the deity of the Creation Stages. The deity thus attained as a vivid perception (gsal snang) and the host of deities of inseparable commitment and wisdom beings that are one with the maṇḍala inhabitants, equal to space [in extent], are the culmination of the highest accumulation and purification.

Moreover, concerning the meaning of the [Sanskrit] term utpattikrama, utpatti is rendered as creating (bskyed pa) and making (bzo ba), fabricating (bcos pa), and so forth. Krama has the sense of “sequential arising” because the actual deity of innate wisdom, i.e., the causal continuum free from obscurations is [inot created as the deity from that wisdom. Rather, consciousness that has similar aspects to that [wisdom] fabricates or creates a pure deity that is very similar to that [wisdom deity]. Then, through the pure accumulation and purification, i.e., the vajra-[like] virtuous conduct of this utterly pure deity, all samsaric delusions, which are just defiled aspects of impure consciousness, are dispelled.

When [an adept] thoroughly comprehends this system, the Stages of Creation become both the Stages of Creation and Completion, and the Stages of Completion become both the Stages of Creation and Completion.

Reply: This is not the case. In the Mantra system, [even] a beginner who is endowed with the fortune of wisdom is able to give rise to the wisdom of the Completion Stages because this is the greatness of the auspicious dependent arising of the Mantra [system] of this fruition vehicle. When someone who embarks on the Mantra path first enters into the maṇḍala, the central figure of the maṇḍala is inseparable from [one's] teacher. In the context of the preparatory phase (sta gon) in which one receives teachings on what to adopt and what to relinquish according to the Secret Mantra[yāna], one generates the mind of ultimate wisdom and [it] manifests. In particular, once the wisdom of the maṇḍala deity is taken to be inseparable from the wisdom of the disciple's mental continuum and then generated, then how could it be that having entered the maṇḍala and received the empowerment, the activities of creation and completion wisdom would not be performed?
Consequently, the wisdom that is created and completed at the time of the empowerment is again created and completed at the time of the path as the nature of the deity and the maṇḍala inhabitant [practitioner]. But if, when doing so, the transformative capacity (mthu nus) of the yogin is weak, he [or she] relates [to the deity] through [mundane] consciousness. Thus, when visualizing it as the consciously recollected deity and the wisdom [deity], one primarily emphasizes the Creation Stages. However, when the transformative capacity of the yogin is strong, he [or she] relates to it through wisdom. Consequently, when clear[ly present] as the consciously recollected deity and as the wisdom [deity], one primarily emphasizes the Completion Stages.

That the Completion Stages are said to be “unfabricated” does not mean they are not activated by causes and conditions, but rather that the presence of what is already there from the start as the causes and conditions of the nature of the deity (lha nyid) is generated in an unfabricated way. Then the expression “creation through the state of unfabricated completion” is used. Thus, provided one is a person who has been introduced to the wisdom of the empowerment in general and to the wisdom of the higher empowerments in particular, it is not the case that one does not cultivate the wisdom of the Completion Stages from the very beginning. When one intensifies the power of accumulation and purification— i.e., confidence, compassion, insight and so forth that are aspects of consciousness in one's own continuum—then, under the influence of this [power], the confidence, insight and so forth that are aspects of wisdom manifest in one's continuum. Although they manifest, without any relapse into pursuing delusive external objects—the outwardly oriented aspect of consciousness—one strives assiduously in the Creation Stages themselves, or [, in other words, in] the undeluded fabrication of the inwardly oriented [aspect] which looks at consciousness itself. As a result of the merits and so on of that [practice], the wisdom of the Completion Stages will arise in one's continuum.

In general, with regard to the term “buddha” (sangs rgyas), someone who has awakened from the all-engulfing sleep of ignorance and [gained] knowledge of the complete sphere of all objects of knowledge is posited as a buddha. As is explained, 

Because of having awakened (sangs) from the sleep of ignorance and
Because the wisdom regarding objects of knowledge has blossomed (rgyas),
Buddha[hood] blossoms like the petals of a lotus.
Hence, the term [“buddha”] awakened and blossomed (sangs rgyas) is used.

As for the term bhagavān, the Vyākhyāyukti says,

Karma and afflictions and corresponding birth,
And likewise the afflictive and cognitive obscurations, Any such discordant tendencies are vanquished (bcom). That is here explained as bhagavān (bcom ldan 'das).

When it comes to postulating the embodiments and wisdoms of such a buddha, the Jo nang pas [have said the following]:

As is stated in the [Mahāyānasūtr]ālaṃkāra [MSA IX.22],
Even though not different before or after, [suchness] Is free from the defilements of all obscurations.
Suchness is claimed to be buddhahood.
It [suchness] is neither pure nor impure.
And in the [Dharmadhātu]stava [DDhS 48–49] it is said, Everything, knowing and even not knowing,
Is in this body.
Through our own concepts we are fettered,
Through our own deep knowledge we become free. 
Awakening is neither far nor near.
Neither does it come nor go.
It is either seen or not seen,
Right in the midst of afflictive emotions. 

Endlessly quoting these and other passages from sūtras and śāstras, [the Jo
nang pas] state the following:

The terms buddha and bhagavān refer to ultimate truth which, being primordially free from all obscurations, permanent, enduring, immutable, and having all qualities spontaneously present from the very beginning, is nothing that could be newly realized. However, the mistaken appearances of saṃsāra—i.e., of phenomena that are adventitious defilements—appear to exist conventionally but are primordially nonexistent. Therefore, in reality, it is not the case that one is a pure buddha once obscurations are cleared away, and is a sentient being while impure. Rather, [one] is posited as a “buddha” when one recognizes that these defilements are adventitious and as a “sentient being” when one does not recognize [this].

This kind of explanation is not felicitous. These citations did teach that buddhas and sentient beings are posited according to whether or not adventitious defilements are recognized as obscuration and delusion. [They also indicate] that conventionally the cause of buddhahood exists primordially as uncontaminated cognition and not as contaminated cognition. However, if, contrary to this, it is said that an eternal buddhahood—i.e., unchanging from earlier to later—is permanent, enduring, and changeless and without newly acquirable qualities, then there would be major internal contradictions with the [above] statement “[one] is posited as a 'buddha' when one recognizes that these defilements are adventitious and as a 'sentient being' when one does not recognize [that]” [based on the following considerations]: Is that which recognizes such adventitious defilements as adventitious the wisdom of permanent, enduring, changeless buddhahood or is it precisely the cognition which is an aspect of the adventitious defilements?

[1] If one says it is the first, then if that which has the unchanging, permanent wisdom of buddhahood which, to know that adventitious defilements are adventitious, [must] possess mental functioning (blo'i 'jug pa) involving a knower and object of knowledge, how would that which is impermanent become permanent?
[Also,] because buddha wisdom is [considered] permanent, enduring and so on [and because] the qualities of a buddha, which remain unchanging from earlier to later, do not need to be newly acquired, it would be unnecessary for such buddha wisdom to awaken to buddhahood by knowing that defilements are adventitious.

[2] If one says it is the second, then if it is the cognition of adventitious defilements that recognizes that the adventitious defilements are adventitious, does that aspect of adventitious defilements of the cognizer [thereby] become a buddha or not? If it does, this means that an impermanent sentient being possessing conventional obscuring defilements turns into a buddha and this would in no way depend on whether ultimate, permanent, enduring buddhahood exists or not. This contradicts the premise that real buddhahood is the only ultimate, permanent, and enduring buddhahood. If [the cognition of adventitious defilements] does not turn into a buddha, this contradicts [your] conviction that “[one] is posited as a 'buddha' when one recognizes that these defilements are adventitious, and as a 'sentient being' when one does not recognize [that].” Thus, how is it possible that such deluded talk could count as the eloquent explanation of people like the great Jo nang pa who is the miraculous incarnation (avatār) of the Kalki Dharma King?

Moreover, most of those who purport to be scholars and siddhas in India and Tibet as well as many exceedingly foolish people propound [the following]: Among the two [aspects of] a buddha's embodiments (kāya) and wisdoms—[1] the self-beneficial ultimate embodiment and wisdom and [2] the other-beneficial conventional embodiments and wisdoms—the former is emptiness, the dharmakāya, the naturally pure dharmadhātu, which is empty of all limitations of discursive elaborations, whereas the latter is the form embodiments which manifest as the variety of the conventional endowed with discursive elaborations. This is proclaimed on the basis of the following statement [RGV III.1]:

Self-benefit and other-benefit are the ultimate embodiment And the state of conventional embodiments depending on it. Because of its state of emancipation and maturation
The fruit is divided into sixty-four qualities.

But this is not at all acceptable, because, to posit self-benefit as the ultimate and other-benefit as the conventional and to thereby explain the two embodiments, the two truths, and two benefits as separate from each other turns out to be a wrong explanation. The reason is that it suggests that the self-beneficial, ultimate truth, the dharmakāya, would not function for the benefit of others but [only for] one's own benefit and that such an ultimate truth would be different from the conventional. Also, such a dharmakāya [would thus] be postulated as truly established in its own right, being a substance different from the form embodiments. [Conversely,] the other-beneficial, conventional truth and the form embodiments would not function for one's own benefit and the like, being the opposite of the above. If one wonders what is wrong with this claim, [the answer is] what could be a greater blunder than that?

The reason [for this allegation is that] when it comes to the two truths, whereby all phenomena are described in terms of two truths, if they are not [even] conventionally established as being the same or different, let alone ultimately, then what could be more mistaken than to proclaim that we must posit the two truths as different on the level of buddhahood? That is not all, as for your pet idea of emptiness—namely, something like a nonaffirming negation that negates [all] conceptually-constructed extremes—it is not possible that such an emptiness could function for one's own benefit and exist as the dharmakāya. [This is] because functioning for one's own benefit requires the existence of a beneficiary and a benefactor, and existing as dharmakāya requires that it exists as an ensemble that has the nature of embodiment (lus kyi bdag nyid can). But such is not possible for your nonaffirming emptiness, which is the mere purity [i.e., the sheer absence] aspect of natural purity.

Further, some unwise people maintain that the aspect of emptiness consisting in the natural purity of all phenomena at the time of the ground when it is free from all obscurations at the time of fruition, is posited as the natural embodiment (svabhāvikakāya). Likewise, natural emptiness which is the true nature (dharmatā) of phenomena at the time of the ground is, from the perspective of the aspect of freedom from all obscurations, posited as the dharmakāya. Therefore, ultimate truth alone is posited as the dharmakāya. If one wonders what is wrong with [this view, the answer is] what could be more noxious than saying this! The svabhāvikakāya is explained as the support for the entire range of uncontaminated qualities of buddhahood and as the embodiment that makes the attainment of all uncontaminated qualities possible. But, conversely, the single sheer emptiness as a nonaffirming negation was not claimed to be svabhāvikakāya by the victor and his sons. Therefore, what would be more inappropriate than to make up theories of the spiritual embodiments (kāya) and wisdoms (jñāna) that were never accepted by the victor and his sons?
In fact, the svabhāvikakāya was not posited based on emptiness as sheer negation. It was rather posited from the perspective that the expanse and wisdom are an assembly that cannot be split apart. As it is taught by the victor Ajita [in ASĀ VIII.1],

The svābhāvikakāya of the sage
Has as its defining characteristic
The nature of the undefiled qualities
That are obtained in utter purity.

Thus, in the classification of four embodiments, where the svabhāvikakāya is differentiated from the dharmakāya, the svabhāvikakāya is posited from the perspective of luminosity which is free from the host of obscurations in which the expanse and wisdom are not separate things. However, according to the classification of three embodiments, the dharmakāya and the svabhāvikakāya are posited as the dharmakāya where phenomena (dharmin) and the nature of phenomena (dharmatā) are not split apart. As the victor Ajita says [RGV II.30],

The benefit for oneself and others is
Taught to be the vimuktikāya and the dharmakāya. This basis of benefit for oneself and others
Is endowed with qualities such as being unconceivable. And from Jñānagarbha's Satyadvaya ,
It is the dharmakāya of the protectors, Being the embodiment of all dharmas,
Being the support of all inconceivable qualities, and Being that it is consistent with reason.

Thus, the meaning of the 'self-beneficial ultimate kāya' is not posited from the perspective of that dharmakāya being emptiness as sheer negation, i.e., the ultimate truth within a dichotomy between two opposing truths.
As for dharmakāya, the embodiment of reality (dharmakāya) is primarily attained through the accumulated virtue of the store of wisdom regarding ultimate truth, objects of knowledge as they really are. On the other hand, the form embodiments (rūpakāya) are attained mainly through the accumulation of the store of merit regarding conventional truth, objects of knowledge in all their complexity. Nevertheless, it is not the case that the dharmakāya is attained only through the store of wisdom and the form embodiements only through the store of merit.

Rather, by gathering the inseparability of the two accumulations the inseparability of the two embodiments (kāya) is attained.

As is also said,

Through this merit, may all beings
Gather stores of merit and wisdom,
And thus attain the two sublime [embodiments (kaya)]
That arise from merit and wisdom.

Thus, the self-beneficial embodiment, comprising the actual phenomenon of being free from obscurations such as the [buddha] powers, was in such a way explained exclusively from the perspective of the conventional. But positing the ultimate from the perspective of a mere negation was never ever the intent of the Noble One. As the noble [Maitreya] says [in RGV III.3],

The first embodiment is endowed with
The qualities of freedom such as the powers.
The second is endowed with
The qualities of maturation, the signs of a great being.

Therefore, some scholars proclaim that the meaning of discussing the two embodiments as if the two truths were separate is that the form embodiments are only presented as such from the perspective of what is amenable to the conditioning of the domain of sentient beings, whereas the dharmakāya is [presented] from the perspective that it does not become a domain amenable to being conditioned by the minds of sentient beings. However, both the embodiments [for the benefit] of self and others are each considered conventional from the standpoint of the phenomenal (dharmin) and ultimate from the standpoint of the nature of phenomena (dharmatā). Wise people have said that this is an eloquent explanation that is unmistaken only in terms of what is acknowledged by others.

I pay homage to the unwavering mahāmudrā,
The naturally pure perfect buddha-mind—
Unadulterated by the host of adventitious stains—
That has been ever-present in all for all time.

Its nature being difficult to clearly understand,
It is beyond the range of words and thoughts.
Yet, there arises the urge to partially describe it,
Much as when one points to the sky with one's finger.

Though [mahāmudrā] commonly abides in buddhas, sentient beings,
In worldly existence and nirvāṇa,
In the Mantra and Pāramitā [systems] and
In all philosophical tenets,
It is exceedingly difficult to understand it.

Hence, [I] shall concisely elucidate precisely this Luminous nature of mind which,
Having been given the name mahāmudrā, 
Is widely renowned in [this] Land of Snow.

In general, that which is explained among the Yogatantra texts and which many teachings among the Unsurpassed [Yoga] Tantras explain, and which is the definitive meaning of the Pāramitā[yāna]—i.e., the natural luminosity of mind which is all-pervading—is in this instance described as mahāmudrā. It is therefore without one-sidedness. When this key point is understood, then regardless which of the distinct paths of means for realization of the definitive meaning as taught in the Pāramitā[yāna] and the Mantra[yāna] are entered, it will be the very best. And even if one has not pursued each of the traditions of exegesis, the very Path of Seeing the personally realized wisdom will be obtained by this alone. Having presented the gathering of merits as an extraneous method, this view alone unites the supplementary aspects of realization and does not require any other preliminaries. Should one ask why, it is because this view is beyond verbal description. It is not comprehended by a mind given to study, thinking and worldly meditations.

[Query:] Then by what means is it to be realized? [Reply:] [By] unmediated direct [perception] that stems from [1] karmic connection from previous [lives] which is the dominant condition, [2] devotion to the bla ma which is the objective condition, and [3] prior reception of knowledge and awareness. It is for this reason that in this [tradition] we do not make the distinction between “studying and thinking on the path of accumulation and seeing a mere conceptual abstraction on the path of application”. As for the noble path of direct seeing, having in mind that there are no subdivisions, it was stated that there are no divisions into levels and paths. However, this does not deprecate the methods.

When Zla 'od gzhon nu elucidated the view of what he had realized to the assembly, it is not cited that he first taught the way of severing discursive elaboration according to the texts of Nāgārjuna, nor that [he deemed it] necessary to teach the method of ending dualistic thoughts according to the texts of Asaṅga. [Moreover, he said that] if one does not arrive at a genuine experience of self-luminous self-awareness, which is of definitive meaning, and realizes mahāmudrā based on the Mantra[yāna], there is the danger of falling into deviations.

Thus, when mahāmudrā, which is the pervasive factor that runs through everything, is realized as [explained] previously, one should examine whether the realization of it is stable or unstable. When it is unstable, it is not incongruous to familiarize oneself with the methods of ending dualistic [thoughts and] discursive elaborations as taught by the two charioteers [Nāgārjuna and Asaṅga]. However, those with diligence who have the inclination to leave behind these very [methods] which [they already] understood previously may correctly familiarize themselves [with mind's true nature in meditation] and familiarize themselves with the state of not grasping by means of concepts the appearances of manifold dependent arising in post-meditation. That is said to be the main point of this teaching.

As for the ways of identifying Zla 'od gzhon nu's Mahāmudrā, which was said to be similar to the white self-sufficient remedy, some have said that it may be distinguished into [1] a mode of abiding and [2] its actualization through the path of skillful means. This is to take the unbearable criticisms alleged by others as melodious utterance. Why? Because it is said that the mahāmudrā of this tradition is not touched by the “three Great Ones” of Buddhists and is therefore superior to them. In that regard, some say that what is thought to be untouched by the “three Great Ones” would make it ipso facto inferior. This qualm requires [careful] consideration. [1] [Great Madhyamaka:] Taking a space-like nonaffirming emptiness analytically deduced as an object by means of reasoning does not qualify [as mahāmudrā] because it is not beyond words and concepts. [2] [Great Seal:] Because the realization of mahāmudrā elucidated in this [Dwags po tradition] does not necessarily depend upon the path of Mantra[yāna], it is not explained here as the wisdom of the Mantra[yāna]. [3] [Great Perfection:] The wisdom of the Great Perfection is also not taught here because its actualization is accomplished by means of many preparations and ritual arrangements.

But when actualized through the respective means, it has been given a variety of different names.

In that regard Sgam po pa says “the hallmark of my Mahāmudrā is self-awareness and its scriptural source is the Uttaratantra [RGV] treatise”. If we analyze the intent of this statement, what identifies the tradition that hails back to the master, the Buddha-son Maitrīpa, is clearly evident in the text of the Uttaratantra. And it is said that the stages of the path that unfold due to familiarizing oneself with it are to be understood from the scripture Dharmadharmatāvibhāga. Considering this, should one ask what is explained in the Uttaratantra, the answer is that it explains the element of *sugatagarbha, the nature of mind, luminosity, which is unchanging like space, showing [by means of] analogies [its] obscuration by nine types of stains. This, at the time of the ground is in an impure [state], while on the path it is in a partially pure [state], and at the time of fruition it is in an entirely pure [state]. Thus there does not exist any phenomenon that would not be encompassed by these three. Even though the nature of the three [states] is undifferentiated, the subdivision into three phases is made from the perspective of how things appear to the impure worldly mind co-existing [with ignorance and] its latent tendencies for mistaken perception.

The element of *sugatagarbha is that which has been given the name mahāmudrā. In this which is the ground for the clearing (sbyang gzhi) of stains, the *sugatagarbha that is the cleanser (sbyong byed) of the nine kinds of stains that are the objects to be cleared (sbyang bya) clears them by means of the wisdom of awareness, whereby the fruition of the clearing process emerges, i.e., the transcendent qualities of purity, selfhood, bliss, etc. 
The phase that is concordant with these qualities is present [as] the Path of Seeing because when one sees the selfhood wherein the elaborations of self and no self are pacified, one sees tathāgatagarbha, [and] it is said that one thereby sees mahāmudrā. As explained in the tantras, the realization is twofold: [one where] regression is possible and one with no more regression. There is no contradiction with the explanation of two aspects that are likewise [made] with regard to the Path of Seeing.

In the post-meditation phase of such realization, the stages of the path which are classified according to the pure stages of familiarizing oneself with the manifold methods of accessing the pure nature of phenomena (dharmadhātu) have been explained in the Dharmadharmatāvibhāga. After directly seeing the nature of phenomena, the stages of terminating the grasping for [and believing in] characteristics [consist in] familiarization with many factors. If one thinks [the Mahāmudrā post-meditation procedures] contradict explanations from the Pāramitāyāna, the reply is that there are a great many explanations like that in the Guhyamantra[yāna]. Thus, when it comes to the wisdom that arises from empowerments, in order to undermine the conceptualization of a self, [there were] statements such as “the ancient man, and the lord (īśvara)”. The noble Avalokiteśvara stated the reason: the wisdom that immediately follows the [practice of] perfections in the ocean[-like] Yogācāra texts does not ultimately exist. Upon knowing that all phenomena have the mode of each being empty of their own essences, the [aspirants] see buddha nature (tathāgatagarbha), so it is not necessary to learn the many methods of reasoning in post-meditation. The method of engaging in a copious number of positions regarding practice is the style of the disputatious Vehicle of Characteristics (lakṣaṇayāna).

The adage that “the identifications by Sgam po pa are the same as citations from authoritative scripture” should be understood by way of the [following] explanation. When the meaning of the statement in [Aṣṭasāhasrikā]prajñāpāramitā [5b.1‒2] “that mind is no mind; mind's nature is luminous.” and the statement in the Abhidharmasūtra “the beginningless element is the basis of all phenomena” etc. are commented upon, it is said [in the Ratnagotravibhāga and Ratnagotravibhāgavyākhyā] that unfounded mental engagements (ayoniśomanasikāra) due to the skandhas, āyatanas, dhātus, and indriyas etc., “depend upon the purity of mind”. Hence, because all saṃsāric phenomena have arisen from tathāgatagarbha, there is no difference between the element of sentient beings and the element of a buddha.

In this context, the scriptural source for explaining [the element] as mahāmudrā was uttered by Saraha [Dohākoṣa, DK 41ab] “Mind alone is the seed of everything”. This was proven by [saying] that it gives rise to all the good things of worldly existence and nirvāṇa and that it is therefore “like the wish fulfilling jewel”. The rationale behind this [passage] is explained in this way: The wisdom of mahāmudrā is [both] the consciousness that is seized by delusion and the wisdom of realization that is without delusion. Delusion moreover consists in the building up of karma through attachments and aversions and the building up of bright karma through virtues devoid of these. From these [karmas] there arise the suffering of bad destinies and the joys of higher realms. Although mahāmudrā amidst the accumulation of happiness and suffering has been drawn into saṃsāric states, it is impossible for it to mix inseparably with saṃsāric phenomena. Therefore, because it is present as the very possibility to one day be separated [from these states], mahāmudrā is the element of sentient beings (sattvadhātu) too. As for the delusion-free wisdom pertaining to this element, since it is mixed inseparably with mind as such which is cultivated through familiarization with it, the element of buddhas (buddhadhātu) is mahāmudrā as well.

In this way it is understood both through scriptural authority and reasoning that all sentient beings are sealed by mahāmudrā. However, by these alone it is not realized. As is stated [in the Ratnagotravibhāga]: “The absolute truth of the self-arisen [i.e., the Buddhas,] is to be realized through faith”. The expression “That mind” (tac cittam) in the [Aṣṭasāhasrikā]prajñāpāramitā refers precisely to wisdom in the ground phase, while the “is no mind” (acittam) refers to the eightfold ensemble of consciousness, the entire range of mental factors and the illusory habitual tendencies of dualistic appearances, whereby [luminous mind] is not attained. Even an understanding that clings to the side of the purifications (vyavadāna) is something that obscures luminosity as well. When the respective essences of these obscuring factors have given way to self-luminous self-awareness, then there is no more dichotomy between the obscured and the obscurer. As long as there are notions that cling to the dualism between obscured and obscurer, because the essence of the obscuration is not recognized and one clings to a partial luminosity, there is no realization of mahāmudrā.

All that is described in the tantras as the teacher and listener, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, existence and nonexistence, buddhas and sentient beings, is what is experienced by self-luminous self-awareness—dharmadhātu wisdom as the three continua of ground, path, and fruition—and by personally realized wisdom that constitutes the element of the whole of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, and of buddhas and sentient beings. There is nothing anywhere that is not sealed with the seal of this [wisdom]. Consequently, in designating this with the name “Great Seal”, the proper name (dngos ming) has both an explanation and application. There is no contradiction in it being [both] a metonymic term [based on its association with a seal] and a proper name [based on the actual nature of reality denoted].

This meaning [as emphasized] in the texts of the master Maitreya is that there exists no other phenomenon (dharma) apart from the expanse of phenomena (dharmadhātu). And since this dharmadhātu is experienced by the personally realized wisdom of the noble ones, it is the nature of mind. And this nature, to whatever extent it is analyzed on the basis of the reasoning corpus, is simply the ultimate and hence irrefutable. Hence is it said that deliverance from all attachments and the like is [also] attachments and the like. Therefore, because the scriptural sources of this mahāmudrā are the works of Maitreya along with associated [texts], the nonaffirming negation based on analysis according to the texts of the reasoning corpus are not taught in that context.

However, when one experiences that definitive meaning which constitutes the remainder left behind in the wake of such analysis according to that [reasoning corpus], then that is also designated as such [i.e., as the definitive meaning]. To illustrate with an example, [the Buddha]—after explaining in the middle dharmacakra that all phenomena are simply empty of own-nature—taught in the third dharmacakra that the unchanging perfect nature which is empty of that [self-emptiness] is the definitive meaning. Likewise, one doesn't find any core of a banana plant when one searches for it, yet in the middle of the unfolded leaves [bananas] nonetheless ripen as sweet fruits.

As for the way of familiarizing oneself with practice, there are the ways of calm abiding when settling in meditative equipoise and of irreversibly sustaining deep insight in both equipoise and post-meditation. First, what is to be seen is luminosity. So long as this remains an object of thought, mahāmudrā is not seen. Seeing a mere abstraction is not advocated here. Consequently, in seeing it directly, one remains settled in it in one-pointed equipoise [and maintains] its continuity without distraction. Then there is the unity of calm abiding and deep insight because, when the eight preparations for abandoning [obstacles] come to the fore, the flaws of calm abiding and deep insight are eliminated. However, this is not the essence of meditation, because for the most part it does not go beyond the very conceptualizing that clings to [and believes in] language and objects. It is possible that it too will become a deviation.

As for the way to cultivate deep insight, there is meditative equipoise and postmeditation. In meditative equipoise, when any concepts of existence and quiescence that spring up are looked at by another conceptual analysis (rtog dpyod), the former dissolve in the expanse. When that conceptual analysis, the looker, is seen by the third insight, then seer and seen both mingle into the very essence of deep insight. On that occasion, one speaks of “the realization of deep insight that is clear and nonconceptual”. At that time, all unreal conceptualizations cease, not to mention the concepts on the side of the antidotes, which must also cease because they are precisely the grasping for [and believing in] characteristic signs.

[Reply:] That is possible without employing that [reasoning]. For example, when deep insight is realized in the state of cessation (nirodhasamāpatti), there is no opportunity for the eightfold [consciousness to operate]. [Yet] when one reemerges from that in post-meditation, so long as one has not realized buddhahood, unreal conceptualizing arises automatically and cannot be stopped. Consequently, leave all appearances that arise as they are without manipulating them. Don't let conceptualizing that grasps words and objects mingle with any [judgments of] good or bad but just naturally let it be in the fresh and uncon-trived state throughout the [phases of] meditation and post-meditation. When there is a relapse into conceptual thought that deliberates about the past and future, without manipulating the moment of awareness in the present by base thoughts or correct thoughts, just leave whatever arises as it is. This is called “being natural”. To identify what it is “to be natural,” nothing else is required. On the other hand, by all sorts of efforts to stop thoughts, thoughts [only] multiply. Thus by letting thoughts be without making an effort to stop them, realization arises naturally. This is the meaning of [Saraha's statement] “when the mind bound by entanglements loosens, there is freedom” and so forth. This also pertains to the phase of cognition [in] postmeditation in the wake of the preceding meditative equipoise.

[Yet] the victor [Chos grags rgya mtsho] has said that expertise in the means for realizing the ultimate without prior recourse to methods of logical reasoning that analyzes the ultimate are attested in the Guhyamantra[yāna] and the direct instructions (upadeśas). For example, the view is realized through binding bodily functions, yantra methods of embracing, reversing, and pervading, and the invitation of the wisdom beings (jñānasattva) and so forth. Accordingly, when these experiences through personal realization are subjected to analysis through logical reasoning, all the ultimate [aspects] of the Mantra tradition such as bliss and luminosity and the like will be forsaken. If analysis through reasoning does not stop, then at that time analysis will be pointless [because] when the entire spectrum of reifying thinking has ceased, the analysis of objects is fruitless.

In that regard Abhidharma adherents say that it is not acceptable to practice calm abiding after accomplishing deep insight. Such a statement should be examined. Even among such Abhidharma adherents, a great many explain, to give an example, that the actual concentration is to be practiced after one has rid oneself of the attachment to the desire [realm]. [Similarly,] in the six limbs of yoga, concentration (dhyāna) is taught after having accomplished withdrawal (pratyāhara), [i.e., a method of understanding that appearances are empty].

Some followers of this [Mahāmudrā] system speak of “Mahāmudrā of the mode of abiding” and of “Mahāmudrā of bliss and emptiness”, [relating] the former to Madhyamaka upadeśas [and] the latter to the ultimate [level] of the Mantra[yāna].

If you are asking about [my view]: The existence of a mahāmudrā greater than familiarizing oneself with ultimate bodhicitta is not advocated in this lineage. The venerable Nāgārjuna explained that to take the recognition of ultimate bodhicitta as the adamantine mind (sems rdo rje : cittavajra) is the system of the Guhyasamāja.
Again, other traditions argue [as follows]: The liberation of beginners with mere devotion who are not taught the esoteric precepts (upadeśa) by a bla ma is called “a system for fools”. This is because any expression expressible by speech is nothing more than a [conceptual] abstraction (arthasāmānya, 'object-universal') or delimitation (anyāpoha, 'otherexclusion') and is therefore not the ultimate. Therefore, [the ultimate] is ineffable by speech.

“Devotion” means having confidence in the qualities of realization. When this has arisen, self-luminous self-awareness one has had since beginningless time becomes manifest.

Also in this regard, concerning the explanation that at the time of the main practice (dngos gzhi), mental engagement (manasikāra) is abandoned, it has been objected that sleep, and stupor and the like would also involve this [absence of mental engagement].

Were one to retort that the scholar Kamalaśīla explained that [i.e., amanasikāra] as a mistake in such [meditation], the reply is that one is in that case disputing against the exegetical tradition of Nāgārjuna. If self-luminous self-awareness is not realized without prior engagement in studies and thinking, why then do beginners first cultivate the collection of stores of wisdom?
Although [Sa skya Paṇḍita] said that the “descent from above” (yas babs) view resembles the meditation of Heshang, in most Mantra traditions it is explained that one begins with the view and then engages in the path.

The expression “Self-sufficient White Remedy” (dkar po gcig thub) refers exclusively to the 'view' but is not a term that denigrates the accumulation of merits. Rather, its precise meaning is that one does not need to strive for different antidotes to each of the emotional afflictions and discursive thoughts as mahāmudrā alone is sufficient [as a remedy].

[As for the] statement “The Great Seal meditation of the ignorant, it is taught, usually becomes a cause of lower realms” etc.: Any actions accumulated due to the disorientation of not clearly understanding the selflessness of persons and phenomena are nothing more than paths of saṃsāra. Moreover, the distinctions between good and bad according to different kinds of motivations at the time of the cause are impossible in the absence of conceptual grasping. Even in the case of inferior mahāmudrā, such concepts are impossible. Besides, statements noting that references such as [Mahāmudrā's] resemblance to Prajñāpāramitā, the meditation of the Alīkākāra Cittamātra, and the third introduction in Mahāmudrā etc. are [all] mistaken. On the consideration that they are not the mahāmudrā of the Guhyamantra[yāna]. However, when it is considered that there are no phenomena at all that are not sealed by the luminously empty mind as such devoid of grasping, there are a great many specific characterizations of that which is designated by the name mahāmudrā. Considered only in terms of the individual, the self-luminosity without subject-object duality is [its] “resemblance to prajñāpāramitā”. Taken in terms of all aspects of phenomena, wisdom free from subject-object duality is the ultimate definitive meaning of the Maitreya works that was described as “Mind only” by Candra[kīrti]. Through direct introduction wherein whatever appears is mind, the concepts of the apprehended [object] cease. Through direct introduction wherein the appearance of mind is like space, the distraction of apprehending [subject] ceases. The freedom from both [appearances and the apprehending mind] is spontaneously present wisdom. All of these are called mahāmudrā.

Again, the statement that all followers of this tradition who identify the direct introduction to mind, when they do not find mind anywhere by searching for it, as what is called mahāmudrā needs to be investigated. As a result of this mahāmudrā which is precisely the wisdom experienced [in] Mantra[yāna] during the phase of post-meditation after reemerging from meditative equipoise, the grasping of discursive signs [i.e., reification] is to be put to an end. Hence, when the searching mind does not find anything by searching, the cessation of this grasping of characteristics on account of habituation is excellent and it does not count as a flaw. [However] if you claim that mahāmudrā is a nonaffirming negation [deduced by] not finding anything by searching, this contradicts the Uttaratantra [RGV] scripture as well as the works of Saraha. When the searching consciousness has not found anything by means of reasoning, the wisdom that is left behind as the remainder is identified as mahāmudrā. Having understood this properly, it should be realized. Therefore, in being directly introduced to mind, this very “mind alone is the seed of everything”, the supreme wish fulfilling gem.

In this way, this identification of mahāmudrā, which commonly encompasses all [types of] mahāmudrā taught in all the sūtras and mantras, has been eloquently explained based on the condition of awakening of latent tendencies from the past, seeing many scriptures, hearing spiritual friends, and forging the connection with those who requested it. Through the virtue of this, may I and all who are equally fortunate attain perfect buddhahood and liberate all mothers from the ocean of worldly existence.

[I] have seen [among] ways of practicing Mahāmudrā, which is famous in the snowy country [Tibet], that some people scrutinize and repudiate one another in order to dispel each other's criticisms.
[1] Some claim that meditation on emptiness through analysis by way of Madhyamaka reasoning is the main practice of this teaching.
[2] Others say that the unity of bliss and emptiness while filling all the cakras with the successsion of blessing from within (svādiṣṭhāna) is the main practice of this teaching.
[3] Others yet maintain that seeing one's own naked (rjen pa) mind free from all thoughtmovements through calm abiding is the main practice of this teaching.
[4] Some claim that the meditation in which the seeing mind is not found by searching anywhere—such as inside, outside, as blue or yellow—is the main practice of this teaching.
[5] Still others claim to meditate [on mahāmudrā] by ascertaining that “the creator of all is the 'all ground consciousness'”.

[1] Regarding the first, some who had taken to heart a Madhyamaka that became wellknown at a later [stage] in the Snowy Country commenced by equating one with the other [i.e. Mahāmudrā with their own Madhyamaka]. [Yet] that [Mahāmudrā] is not that [Madhyamaka]. Why? Because the Madhyamaka of the reasoning corpus is [taken as] a nonaffirming negation, whereas the emptiness of mahāmudrā is the primordial wisdom free from extremes. As for the nature of phenomena (dharmatā) in these two traditions: [The first] is distinguished as an object of words and thoughts because it is simply an other-exclusion (gzhan sel). [The second] is distinguished as an object of direct [perception] because it is the particular of wisdom. That is not all. There is also the distinction between [the first being] inscrutable and the [second] being evident, [the first being] mentally contrived and [the second being] naturally uncontrived. Moreover, regarding the respective means of realizing them, the emptiness known in the Madhyamaka is comprehended through reasoning that validates one's own scriptures and castigates those of others. The emptiness of mahāmudrā is attained through devotion to the bla ma, blessings, karmic connection and the accumulation of merit. And regarding the [respective] ways of familiarization: the expressions 'analytical' and 'settling' meditation are the terms used by scholars of former times.

[4] The fourth [way to] identify [Mahāmudrā] is the Pacification Teaching (zhi byed). The preparation and main [practice] is similar to the practice known as Mahāmudrā. [Query:] Isn't the [Zhi byed] way of directly introducing the experience of wisdom as emptiness in the phase of post-meditation taken over [from Mahāmudrā]? Though it is taken over, there is no fault in this. Still, preserving each exegetical tradition without adulteration is said to be the way of the wise. The phase of the main practice in the second identification [i.e., the tantric tradition of Saraha] is no different from this way of seeing. However, if one clings [to the belief] “we have seen mahāmudrā,” it is poisonous. One-pointedness may count as calm abiding, but if freedom from fabrication is also taken as the main practice of this teaching, how do [you] identify it? If it is explained according to the Niḥsvabhāvavāda texts, it is poisonous. If [on the other hand] it is declared that it is nothing but nakedly seeing awareness, then how does this differ from the Consciousness-Spirit of the Samkhya school? If one thinks that it is distinguished from the Samkhya tradition by the direct introduction to the selflessness of persons in the post-meditation phase, the reply is that it doesn't make sense that a postmeditation understanding that has not familiarized [itself] with the antidotes to self-grasping during the main practice phase would constitute a meditation based on thinking that severs superimpositions.

[5] The fifth identification: when mixed with the religious language of Rdzogs chen, if one knows how to [thereby] clearly identify [mind's nature], there is no problem. However, the question is how does one clearly identify the all-ground (kun gzhi) taught in Sems sde? In the great classical texts, the all-ground consciousness (kun gzhi'i rnam shes : ālayavijñāna) is explained in terms of unreal conceptualizing. Hence, when it is framed as an identification of mahāmudrā, it becomes the laughing-stock of scholars. If the all-ground is explained as the causal continuum (rgyu rgyud), it becomes mixed with the Lam 'bras [system]. Although this is no problem per se, if this “all-ground” is identified as wisdom itself, when explained according to one's own scriptural traditions, then one has to question what antidotes should be cultivated [to counteract] the clinging to the ideas of an “All-creative King (kun byed rgyal po), “supreme self”, and “buddha nature”? If one answers that these teach the absence of grasping anything in the main practice phase, the reply is that this refers to the ineffable mahāmudrā transcending the domain of concepts that is recognized by post-meditation cognition.

[Query:] If [its] identification could be shown by concepts, hasn't the main practice once again become poisoned? If that clinging mind has to be overcome yet again, isn't it similar to an elephant [repeatedly] bathing? [Reply:] In reply to the objections of others concerning the Self-sufficient [Remedy] of the first [question], the cultivation of Mahāmudrā known as the Fivefold is not unwarranted. However, in the Mahāmudrā emphasized by the Physician [Sgam po pa], are these five points indispensable or not? When we examine what these excellent members express, if the first [i.e., their indispensability] holds true, then the basic thesis [of self-sufficiency] is refuted. If the latter [i.e., their not being indispensable] holds true, then it is mixed with the Lam 'bras and thus does not constitute an independent tradition.

<d e="2">
Thus, being abundant in meanings yet succinct in words, [Mahāmudrā] is easy to practice for those with a karmic connection. If one realizes what is easy to realize, the two [types of] belief in a self along with their seeds are easily destroyed. This coemergence that is experienced by personal knowledge and not taken as an object of words and concepts does not require recourse to scripture and reasoning. It also does not depend on honoring the teacher with set observances. However, being the Mahāyāna, encompassing everyone and comprising the definitive actuality of everything, it is without contradiction during the phase of the main practice. Although in the phase of preparation for its realization, there is no need for sundry methods of accomplishment, during the main practice phase, the aim to be accomplished is seen to be in accord with all sūtras and tantras.

What is to be seen (mthong bya) is primordially present wisdom which is not newly established. Being similar to a wish fulfilling gem, if for the time being one can settle evenly in [this state] that is free from drowsiness and agitation, this is termed “one-pointedness”. When there is freedom from grasping either phenomena or persons, it is termed “freedom from elaborations”. As for the enhancement in the post-meditation of that unity of calm abiding and deep insight of the main practice, when there is no [more] grasping whatever personal and phenomenal appearances arise as “this” or “that”, then even if, on the side of consciousness, the dualism of subject and object have not ceased, on the side of wisdom, both “selves” [personal and phenomenal] are naturally taken over [by] wisdom that is free from grasping anything at all. At that time, the entire phenomenal world becomes “one taste” with mahāmudrā. Once this manifests effortlessly, one senses that it is what has been given the name “no-meditation”.

In this regard, latter-day people object: How is this not grasping or engaging the mind in anything at all during the main practice phase any different from the tradition of Heshang? And how is the deep insight that is not accomplished in conjunction with teachings from the sūtras and tantras any different from the traditions of the heretics (tīrthika)? [They also] declare that “the Great Seal meditation of the ignorant, it is taught, usually becomes a cause of animal birth” and that “even if that meditation may be excellent, because it does not go beyond Madhyamaka meditation, it does not make sense to combine it with the Secret Mantra”. How should one provide answers to settle such disputes?

[Reply:] When there is no comprehensive knowledge of the sūtras, tantras and esoteric instructions, the meaning is difficult [to understand]. Consequently, [these matters] shall be explicated here in detail. The Chinese abbot did not make the distinction between conventional and ultimate and likewise did not distinguish, within their respective contexts, between the view and its application; wisdom and consciousness; studying, thinking and meditation; and provisional and definitive meaning. He said that simply not engaging the mind in anything at all is the essence.

[Query:] The main practice of mahāmudrā [comprises] the ultimate and the view, meditation and wisdom, and the mind that has eradicated the seeds of ignorance which is the root of all obscurations. Although this [mahāmudrā] is in this way distinguished into two [aspects]—viz., illustration and [its] object—because it is conceptless and nondeluded, are both [the illustration and object] also [mere] concepts about directly perceiving the innate?

[Reply:] Not exclusively. Because [mahāmudrā] is free from all unreal conceptualizing, it is comparable to the transworldly direct perception. For example, during the state of cessation (nirodhasamāpatti), since the seven groupings of consciousness along with their associated factors cease, there is mental nonengagement and freedom from all grasping of characteristics. The meditation of Heshang is not like that. In this regard, some proclaim that the state of cessation in the Cittamātra tradition is wisdom in the Madhyamaka. [The response is as follows:] the state of cessation of the Niḥsvabhāva is a nonaffirming negation, [whereas] because there is wisdom in the state of cessation of the Alīkākāravāda Madhyamaka, this is called the “state of cessation of concomitant [mental factors]”. This is taken as something rotten by the latter-day people.

[Query:] Whence does one seek wisdom (jñāna) apart from the mentation consciousness (manovijñāna)? [Reply:] Because the six sense consciousnesses and the afflictive mentation (kliṣṭamanas) do not exist in the meditative equipoise of the Paths of Seeing and meditation and the rest, the mental faculty (mano-indriya) is negligible. Primordial wisdom (gdod ma'i ye shes) does not arise from the mental faculty as a dominant condition. In the classical texts of the Niḥsvabhāvavāda, it is asserted that all phenomena are empty of an ownessence and that settling one-pointedly in this emptiness is wisdom. I would say this is like calling a mother a 'barren woman'.

[Query:] It is said that at the time of meditative equipoise, discriminating wisdom (pratyavekṣanajñāna) must be accepted. [Reply:] This contradicts the example taught in the Bhāvanākrāma scripture that although the arising of fire depends on kindling, the [latter] is nonetheless burned away by the [former]. Were there no means at all for directly seeing the ultimate wisdom without [first] training in tantric empowerments, blessings, and Madhyamaka reasoning, then [consider that] seeing that [ultimate wisdom] through bodily activities, waves of enjoyment, examples such as illusions and the rest—all known from instructions, scripture and reasoning—has been explained as inducing certainty in oneself by way of the inwardlooking self-luminous self-awareness. If one is not alienated from the prerequisites for familiarizing oneself with that [wisdom], then doesn't that luminous clarity become the highest culmination?

[Query:] Without relying on reasoning that establishes emptiness, the mind that understands it does not constitute a valid cognition. Rather, the mind that does not depend on it constitutes an invalid cognition.
[Reply:] Such statements, which emerged in earlier and later [times], were praised by those [Niḥsvabhāvavādins] and disheartened all who adhered to the upadeśas (man ngag pa). Being dejected, people give up their efforts. So how is it possible for them to remain firm in their own tradition? The statement [by Sa paṇ] that “the mahāmudrā of the foolish becomes a cause for rebirth as an animal” was given with the intention to consider that in the main practice phase of these instructions no remedy for self-grasping was taught. However, the absence of any grasping to the two kinds of self [or individuating principle] is [precisely] the realization of that [mahāmudrā]. Isn't this nomenclature [what] all the Pāramitā[yāna] practitioners make [use of]? Saying that it is necessary to entertain the thought of 'selflessness' is a lie.

[Query:] On what basis does one understand self-luminosity of the subjective aspect to be ultimate truth? [Reply:] It is understood on the basis of explaining that which is empty of duality as that [ultimate truth]. As for identifying that emptiness which is realized through wisdom that eliminates what obscures that, Saraha taught nothing else but this, and likewise Virūpa. For realizing this, the reasonings of the Prāsaṇgika and Svātantrika are pointless; it is established only [by] the reasoning [advocated by] the author of the [Pramāṇa]vārttika. The ways of practicing calm abiding that is the access to that [realization] are evident from other treatises.

[Query:] Because self-luminosity does not withstand logical analysis, it is called 'conventional truth'. [Reply:] Because nothing other than that [self-luminosity] appears for a buddha, it is ultimate truth, plain and simple. Although it was said that the meditation of the Alīkākāra Cittamātra is like that, it is also possible that this be taken as the freedom from all extremes of existence and nonexistence through the proof of dependent arising in the postmeditation phase. While it may be replied that the way of settling in a fresh, uncontrived and natural way exists in the main meditation practice of the heretics as well, because they are fettered by the belief in a self, theirs is not a path to liberation.

It might be said that the identification of emptiness that eliminates obscurations does not exist in another way than in the [the two strains of Madhyamaka: Those who] Establish Illusoriness Through Reasoning (sgyu ma rigs sgrub) and [Those for Whom All Phenomena] are Nonfoundational (rab tu mi gnas pa). However, emptiness that is internalized via the Guhyamantra[yāna] Secret Mantra is subsumed under neither of these; it is nothing other than great bliss.

Concerning the culmination of Madhyamaka meditation, it is not certain that it requires enduring hardships for three countless eons because that [same] Madhyamaka wisdom explained in the Maitreya teachings is [also] the ground of accomplishment and most supreme means among the two stages of the path of the supreme vehicle. Having in mind emptiness of a nonaffirming negation, the following song was sung: “When emptiness is a means [to an end], then buddhahood will not occur because the fruit is not different from the cause” and further on: “Therefore, the means called 'the maṇḍala's wheel' is the binding of bliss. By the yoga of buddha-pride, buddhahood won't take long.” Learn this statement wisely!

Thus, through the virtue that accrues from having composed this [text, may] the Mahāmudrā tradition propagated by way of the discernment of Zla 'od gzhon nu blossom in this Land of Snow. Some among those who claim to be its adherents [but who] do not firmly maintain their own textual tradition boast that Mahāmudrā of the supreme vehicle was taught by Saraha. Some others confuse [Mahāmudrā] with explanations of mental nonengagement in [buddha] nature texts. With their prattle about devoting themselves assiduously to the mere emptiness as a nonaffirming negation, they disparage the wisdom of those having realization. Some who are mistaken regarding [Sgam po pa's] comments about “uniting the two streams of Bka' [gdams pa] and [Mahā]mudrā”, devote themselves assiduously to the Madhyamakopadeśa by Atiśa [though] the Madhyamaka of that [work] is [a matter of] conceptual [knowledge] and not a domain of nonconceptual knowledge.

Those yogins who familiarize themselves with the path of Mahāmudrā as explained here—whether or not they have at present already entered the great Secret Mantra [vehicle] —will have no difficulties in [first] receiving empowerments and blessings, then [realizing] the luminosity of the Five Stages (Pañcakrama) and Six Dharmas ([Nā ro] chos drug), and [finally] manifesting in embodiments of unity (yuganaddhakāya). 
Thus, through the threefold sequence of methods of [1] refuting the claims of other exegetes of this system, [2] validating one's own system, and [3] answering objections with detailed explanations, the wish fulfilling gem of Mahāmudrā has been cleansed of all impurities, coarse and subtle, and it has been set atop the victory banner of the multitude of great authentic classical texts. Now the time has come to pray for anyone anywhere who wishes for happiness. May [all that they] need and desire pour down like a monsoon rain.

With deepest devotion [I] pay homage
To those who teach and uphold
The sublime [Mahāmudrā] teaching that dispels all
Obscurations of afflictions and regarding the knowable.

In former times, in this Land of Snow,
The sun of definitive meaning blazed brightly,
Free from the dense clouds of obscuration.
However, when some scholars scrutinized and analyzed [it],

The sun of emptiness went to sleep in the bed of darkness.
Henceforth, it has been close to a hundred years now since
Emptiness and empty prattle have been mixed together.
There previously appeared elaborate discourses on whether

Zla 'od gzhon nu's [teaching] of definitive meaning,
Which was given the name “Mahāmudrā”,
Is either legitimate or illegitimate.
At that time, when all who had preserved distinct traditions
Each abandoned their own tradition,
Didn't they all in later times embark upon
The 'great paths' of their own devising (rang bzo)?

Having offered above an expression of homage and the thesis of the composition, the time has come to introduce the elaborate discourses [concerning Mahāmudrā]. It was said that

And 'ascent from below' to 'simultaneist' and 'gradualist'.

And

The Great Seal meditation of the ignorant,
It is taught, usually becomes a cause of animal birth.
If not that, then they are born in the formless realm,
Or else they fall into the śrāvakas' cessation.
Even if that meditation may be excellent,
It is no more than a Madhyamaka meditation.
The latter meditation, while very good it itself,
Is nevertheless extremely difficult to accomplish.

Were there no difference between the 'descent from above' (yas 'bab) view of Mahāmudrā and the 'simultaneist' (cig car ba) path of Heshang, it would follow that Mahāmudrā followers would not accept loving kindness, compassion, the [first] five perfections and the cultivation of the mind of a bodhisattva and so on as the path.

In this manner, both the subject and object are called Great Seal (mahāmudrā), because one does not perceive anything knowable at all that is not marked and sealed by this mudrā. Although there exist no phenomena that are not sealed by this mahāmudrā, there are nonetheless two methods that serve as preliminaries to it: [1] the tradition of the outer Vehicle of Characteristics (lakṣaṇayāna) and [2] the tradition of the inner yogins.

[1] The first, [i.e., the outer Vehicle of Characteristics] consists in ascertainment by reasoning involving studying and thinking. On the basis of such ascertainment, there are also two different methods of recognizing this mahāmudrā which is the mode of abiding that one experiences through knowledge based on meditation: [A] The Niḥsvabhāvavāda-Madhyamaka which maintains it is a space-like nonaffirming negation and the [B] Yogācāra-Madhyamaka which claims that it is coemergent wisdom. Regarding these two assertions, there are also two different methods of ascertainment through reasoning based on studying and thinking: [the former] by means of self-emptiness (rang stong) and [the latter] by means of other-emptiness (gzhan stong). Although that which is experienced based on the first system [i.e., self-emptiness] is not in accord with the root texts of Mahāmudrā, it is nonetheless acceptable to ascribe the “ascertainment of freedom from extremes leading to assimilation as unity” explained in that [system] to this Bka' brgyud Mahāmudrā tradition.

</d>
<d e="2">
[2] Secondly, the skillful means employed in the tradition of the inner yogins are threefold: [mahāmudrā] is made manifest by [A] relying on the skillful means of the teacher's blessing, [B] the means of causing the wisdom beings to descend, and [C] the means of empowerment. The Mahāmudrā view which has been made manifest by these three means does not need to be preceded by analysis of discriminating insight because the systems of Pāramitā and Mantra are distinct.
</d>
</f>
<f>
<d e="1">

</d>
<d e="2">
Of these two systems, the latter is superior because it discovers in an instant the nonpoisonous view [resulting from] the three means [i.e., blessing, wisdom beings, and empowerment] and because the former tradition's discovery through discriminating insight is bound up with conceptualization.
</d>
</f>
<f>
<d e="1">

</d>
<d e="2">
Not only is there a difference in terms of the view of the experiencer but the latter [system] is also superior in terms of the definitive meaning of the experienced object because the emptiness as a nonaffirming negation of the former tradition, [i.e., the NiḥsvabhāvavādaMādhyamikas of the Lakṣaṇayāna] is explained as conventional truth since it is nothing other than nonexistence and abstraction. Hence it does not qualify as being of definitive meaning and does not go beyond the conceptualizing mind of the subject (yul can). On the other hand, when the mode of abiding of coemergent wisdom is explained as mahāmudrā as object—as it is claimed in the works of Maitreya such as the Uttaratantra [RGV]—this is no different from the Mantra system.
</d>
</f>
<f>
<d e="1">

</d>
<d e="2">
Hence, there is a qualitative gradation in the subject's wisdom of self-awareness owing to the qualitative gradation in the means of actualizing it. However, all these [types of] wisdom of self-awareness, which are actualized by these outer and inner skillful means, are alike in being the wisdom of mahāmudrā because they consist in the wisdom of the union of bliss and emptiness. In that instance, “bliss” signifies “innate coemergent wisdom” which is that which is inseparably present in essence within all [beings] from buddhas up to sentient beings “Empti[ness]” means being empty of concepts of clinging to the duality of grasped and grasping, existence and nonexistence and so forth.
</d>
</f>
<f>
<d e="1">

</d>
<d e="2">
Now with regard to mahāmudrā as object: it abides as the essence of innate wisdom. [Its] mode of empti[ness] is [its being] empty of conceptualizing that clings to the extremes of discursive elaborations. [Its] mode of realization is realization through personally experienced wisdom. There does not exist anything that is separately postulated as saṃsāra as long as this is not realized, and as nirvāṇa once it is realized. This being so, from the perspective of the three modes of abiding, [emptiness and realization], there is no differentiation in mahāmudrā between the two aspects of manifesting as great bliss in meditative equipoise and manifesting as illusion-like [appearances] in post-meditation.
</d>
</f>
<f>
<d e="1">

</d>
<d e="2">
In short, [mahāmudrā] is ascertained simply as the modes of abiding (gnas lugs), emptiness (stong lugs) and realization (rtogs lugs) that are of definitive meaning as these are found in the tantra corpus, the Maitreya works, and the Dohā Trilogy.
It was in this sense that previous teachers of the Mudrā [tradition] used the designation mahāmudrā. For this the designation “emptiness endowed with the excellence of all aspects” is also attested in both the Mantra[yāna] and the Pāramitā[yāna]. The understanding of it is such that when one has arrived at the supramundane path, then the entire spectrum of qualities conducive to purification such as the [thirty-seven factors] of awakening, loving kindness, compassion and the rest, which are termed “great bliss,” are of one taste with the essence of the dharmadhātu wisdom. In that instance, this was definitely asserted in the statement that [Mahāmudrā] is similar to a Self-sufficient White Remedy.

[1] As for the first, all great meditators who are known as [Mahā]mudrā practitioners have said the following. This mahāmudrā is not realized through studying, thinking, and explaining. It [can]not be shown by the bla ma, it [can]not be meditated upon by the disciple. Having relied upon the bla ma's blessing and the disciple's devotion during the preparatory phase, one settles naturally into the uncontrived innate mind during the main practice phase. Settling in that way, mind dawns in meditative equipoise as the union of luminosity and emptiness, objects dawn in post-meditation as appearance and emptiness devoid of grasping. From within that state, anything and everything is enjoyed without grasping. By contrast, one does not awaken [to buddhahood] through activities by the three gates [of body, speech, and mind] involving willful effort.
</d>
</f>
<f>
<d e="1">

</d>
<d e="2">
[2] Secondly [the specific explanation]: In the words of some Mahāmudrā proponents, in general, among the two [kinds of] meditation, the analytical meditation of a paṇḍita and the settling meditation of a kusāli, ours is the latter tradition. Not a single other preliminary practice is to be taught, not a single other main practice is to be cultivated. To settle naturally in the uncontrived mind in all three [phases]—preparation, main practice and postmeditation—is called mahāmudrā.
</d>
</f>

</d>
<d e="2">
In the words of some [others], it is said that there are two [types of practitioners], the gradualists (rim gyis pa) and the simultaneists (cig char ba). To the first, this Mahāmudrā is taught [once they have] adequately been made a suitable vessel for the Secret Mantra by taking refuge, developing bodhicitta, empowerment, blessing, and so on. To the simultaneists who, having thoroughly ripened their mind-streams during many previous lifetimes, do not need to rely on the ruse of preliminary practices and so on in this life, the main practice is shown right from the start. In that regard, it is said that even though it is not possible to [directly] show them “this is mahāmudrā”, it will nonetheless transpire by simply instructing them to “rest naturally in uncontrived mind” once they are acquainted with the meaning of the words.
</d>
</f>
<f>

</d>
<d e="2">
In the words of others yet, it is said that the practice of the simultaneists is what is called “descent from above view” and that the view of the gradualists is the “ascent from below conduct”. [But] when the view is realized, the conduct is spontaneously present, even without striving for it.
In the words of others, it is said that despite the many classifications of spiritual paths and levels according to the outer [vehicle of] characteristics, our kusāli tradition needs nothing more than [the four yogas of] one-pointedness, freedom from elaboration, one flavour, and no-meditation, in other [words], what is subsumed under the triad of “experience (nyams), intellectual understanding (go ba), and realization (rtogs)”. All the spiritual levels, paths and buddhas are subsumed under what is called the essence of mind, coemergent wisdom.
In the words of others yet, citing the statement “deluded are the fools who count the spiritual levels and paths within the self-sufficient Mahāmudrā”, they state that by settling in meditative equipoise in the single wisdom of mahāmudrā, there will be awakening in a matter of years or months.
</d>
</f>
<f>
<d e="1">

</d>
<d e="2">
In short, it is said that Saraha's tradition is embraced as the tradition for simultaneist disciples, showing them the 'all-at-once' path. Regardless of how dull the acumen of simultaneists may be, they do not require any steps beyond the four [yogas] such as onepointedness and the rest. When they are of sharp [acumen], realization [may] dawn in them by devotion alone even if the teacher has not taught them a single word. When this realization is taken as the path, awakening does not require progression through the steps of spiritual levels and paths and the hardships of countless eons and so forth as is prescribed in the Pāramitā[yāna].

Is this Mahāmudrā view of yours a Mahāmudrā of the Pāramitā tradition or a Mahāmudrā of the Mantra tradition?
In the first case, [argues Sa skya Paṇḍita,] it is not justified for three [reasons]: [1] it is not justified because it is not preceded by the insight of studying and thinking; [2] it is not justified because it does not advocate the classification of the five paths and the ten levels and [3] it is not justified because it does not accept need for hardship of three endless [eons].

</d>
<d e="2">
In the second case, it is also not justified for three [reasons]: [1] it is not justified as a Mahāmudrā of the Yoga tantras; [2] it is not justified as a Mahāmudrā of the Unsurpassed [Yoga] tantras and [3] as it is not justified since it is not included in the [series] of the three: karma-, jñāna-, and mahāmudrā.
[Rebuttal:] [Our view] does qualify as Mantra because it is a view that is realized through the power of a bla ma's blessing. [Sa paṇ's Response:] This is not so because you [Mahāmudrā proponents] assert that self-occuring wisdom is produced in someone through the power of devotion. Although this may be the case if you receive a nonerroneous bestowal of empowerment from such a bla ma—as in the saying “[By] whose kindness one attains, in an instant, the state of great bliss”—someone who does not bestow empowerment does not count as a bla ma. This is shown in the following statements: “One who does not bestow empowerments is no bla ma”, and “even if one has devotion in the bla ma, such a bla ma is no bla ma”.

[Rebuttal:] Our view does qualify as the Pāramitā tradition because in the works of the master from Dwags po it is said: “My Mahāmudrā and the view of the Mahāyānottaratantra [RGV] are the same in meaning” and because in [his] detailed explanation of the method ascertaining the perfection of insight in [his] treatise entitled Ornament of Liberation, he explained precisely the goal (don nyid) that is ascertained through studying and thinking as the object of meditation. [Response:] In this case since [your teaching] has been assimilated to the Pāramitāyāna tradition, the designation mahāmudrā is not justified. [For in that case the claim that] there is no need to endure hardships for three incalculable eons would be unjustified. The claim that without having to ascertain the view during the phase prior to the pith instructions it is sufficient to let body, speech and mind naturally settle would [also] not be justified. As is said with respect to [these] statements:

If one wishes to practice in this way,
There is no blessing of Vajravārāhi.
One does not cultivate the coemergent and so on in this [system].
It is without the path of means such as inner heat (gtum mo) and so forth.
There is no designation mahāmudrā.
This [tradition] does not maintain that there is awakening in this life,
In the intermediate phase, or in the next [life].
[However, it does accord with what is attested from the Mahāyāna scriptural collections.]

Moreover, the practice of the view of the Uttaratantra requires the preliminaries of studying and thinking, as it is stated in the [Mahāyāna]sūtrālaṃkāra:

The teachings would be pointless.

Further, in [your] system of ascertainment: to settle into equipoise in wisdom that is free from the subject-object duality during the main practice phase after having initially determined that appearances are mind, next that the apprehended is unreal, and [finally] that the apprehender is nonexistent, is not the intent of the Maitreya works. Rather, in that case, to reach the goal of such meditation, it is necessary to accumulate merit for three countless eons. As explained [in Sdom gsum rab dbye III.163]:

As long as the accumulations are not perfected,
For that long the meditation does not reach its goal.
To complete the two accumulations,
Endless eons are required.
And [in Sdom gsum rab dbye III.162]:
The Madhyamaka meditation even though it is excellent,
Is still very difficult to accomplish.

[Rebuttal:] Where is the contradiction given that the process of realizing the view of the Uttaratantra is [that of] the Secret Mantra.

When one does not cultivate the empowerments and the two stages,
It is not a Vajrayāna teaching.

Moreover, does your “descent from above” view require training in the conduct of the six perfections or not? If it is not required, then [this view] would be [equivalent to] the religious tradition of the Chinese abbot. If it is required, then does one train gradually or simultaneously? In the first case, how would there be any difference from the “conduct that ascends from below”? And if it simultaneous, would there be a distinction between the practices of view and conduct or would conduct be included within the view? In the first case, this view would contradict it being a Self-sufficient White Remedy. In the second case, is this tradition of inseparability of view and conduct practiced according to the Mantra tradition or according to the Pāramitā tradition? In the first case, it is in contradiction with [the Mantra system] in not taking empowerments and the two stages as being of crucial importance. In the second case, it is not admissible to have a teaching that [allows] beginners to awaken within a single lifetime. This is demonstrated [in Sdom gsum rab dbye III. 175cd‒176]:

This present-day Mahāmudrā
Is largely a Chinese religious system.
The Mahāmudrā of Nāro and Maitrīpa
Is held to consist precisely in what was taught
In the tantras of the Secret Mantra.

[Rebuttal:] There are those who in this life did not previously go through the two stages, but who have faith in this teaching and have had the blessing of the teacher enter their mindstreams.

Having already given initial replies to questions by these [critics at the beginning of this text], the second [series of replies is to follow]. The reply that [we] consider that it is the height of absurdity to say that Mahāmudrā becomes the cause for taking rebirth in animal [rebirths] and the formless realm must be explained as follows. With regard to the steps of this method of guidance in this [Mahāmudrā] view by those who are renowned as Mahāmudrā proponents, not only are there no explanations that [these] require the preliminary analysis by means of discerning insight, but more [significantly] there are many explicit statements that if there is such analysis, mahāmudrā becomes intellectually fabricated. They do not explain the necessity of the preliminary conferral of empowerments to introduce one to the ground of the clearing process and the clearing process [itself]. Not only is that explanation not given, but they also do not consider [Mahāmudrā] to be the sort of view that derives from empowerment. Rather, during the main practice phase, at the moment when there appears nothing other than simply resting in the state of nongrasping called “not thinking of or pondering on anything”, such an individual who is generally [considered to be] of dull capacity—one who has neither gone through the purification of studying and thinking about the view of the Pāramitāyāna nor experienced even the preparations for embarking on the path of the Vajrayāna—is then shown this Mahāmudrā view by the teacher. When this has indubitably arisen, then to such a student whom it is not appropriate to categorize as “stupid”, the teacher without imparting any of the sequence of trainings [according to different] capacities shows [him], in the preliminary phase of preparation, [how] to let the triad of body, speech, and mind rest naturally in their uncontrived state. However, if by that alone one has become immersed in a state of nongrasping such that it appears to be something called “the real Mahāmudrā,” then that which has the character of a mental factor in a phase of “not pondering and not thinking anything” belonging to the mind stream of a stupid person is [just plain] ignorance because it is a mental factor that is diametrically opposed to the wisdom of awareness.

To substantiate that, if one asks what is the wisdom of awareness [and] what is fundamentally opposite to it? Wisdom arises in two ways: through the methods of the Pāramitā[yāna] and the methods of the Mantra [system]. The first is the wisdom of not finding anything at all when investigating the [putative] essence of persons and phenomena by means of logical reasoning based on studying and thinking. The second is the wisdom of great bliss that arises from empowerments and so on. By contrast, the [state of] not thinking or pondering anything at all by an ignorant person in these phases is subsumed under the ignorance in the ground phase. Among the two types of ignorance—afflictive (nyon mongs pa can) and nonafflictive—it is the latter and [characterized as] a disorientation regarding suchness. Whereas these are subsumed under the latter of the two, actions motivated by the [afflicted ignorance] were said to usually establish an animal [rebirth] because it is explained that individual actions associated with each of the three poisons are actions that establish the three lower destinies. [This is what Sa skya Paṇḍita] had in mind.

[Reply:] Certainly, however it is necessary to distinguish kinds of application given the difference between [1] a [type of] settling ('jog pa po) in nongrasping which is insight that realizes the abiding mode and [2] [a type] which is ignorance. To continue, it was said [Sdom gsum rab dbye III.161c]:

… if not that, they are born in the formless realm 

In the preliminary phase, having laid a foundation that is not embraced by the skillful means of the Secret Mantrayāna, one proceeds, without relying on the insight that distinguishes the two truths, to take as the preliminary the view that “phenomena in all there variety are like space”, that “apprehended objects are nothing whatsoever”, and that coarse conceptions are flaws. Then during the main practice phase as well, once a clear perception (gsal snang) of that has arisen, then the settling [in equipoise] is [just] the formless meditation which is in common with the non-Buddhists. Since even this [meditation] of yours is not other than a meditative settling into nongrasping both in states of preparation and main practice, [Sa skya Paṇḍita] had this thought in mind.

To continue, it was said [in Sdom gsum rab dbye III.161d]:

… or else they fall into the disciples' cessation

This refers not to the state of cessation (nirodhasamāpatti) and the nirvāṇa without remainder (nirupadhiśeṣanirvāṇa), but to a nirvāṇa of annihilation or to the state of nonideation (asaṃjñāsamāpatti). The proof of that is that the view which is not linked with the two stages of the Mantra [system] has to be the Madhyamaka view. But if [this view] is not linked with the accumulation of merit for incalculable eons, then it is termed “śrāvakas' cessation” which entails passing into a nirvāṇa of annihilation. This is because whatever drawbacks there are in actualizing the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi), without having engaged in the triad of perfecting, maturing, and purifying, are present in that [nirvāṇa of annihilation]. It is also because it is explained that even [bodhisattvas] when they have for a long time dwelled in the equipoise of emptiness on the eighth level, not to mention beginners, need to be aroused from that [state] by the victors. This is demonstrated [in Sdom gsum rab dbye III.162ab]:

Even if that meditation may be excellent,
It is no more than a Madhyamaka meditation.

Alternatively, if fools who have not previously gone into even a single teaching of any higher or lower vehicle are taught right from the start according your method of guidance in Mahāmudrā , then as is stated in the Abhi[dharmakośa]:

Mind and mental factors cease in [the state of] neither ideation nor nonideation (naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñā).
As explained here, there is the drawback of an absurd consequence because in this context there is no ascertainment through reasoning, nor does there appear any explanation that accessing the dharma of the Mantra tradition definitely requires preliminaries. If one thinks that [this occurs] through the blessing of the bla ma, this is indisputable provided that bla ma is a Mantra[yāna] bla ma, as in the explanation “One who does not bestow empowerments is no bla ma.” [According to Sdom gsum rab dbye III.347d‒f]:

Even if the result arose from a single [cause],
It would be like the śrāvakas' cessation.

For these reasons, where emptiness is taught to foolish individuals and they also cultivate it without even understanding it, it is said to have the nature of temporarily [causing rebirth] in hell—not to mention animal [rebirth]—and of ultimately not passing into nirvāṇa. [According to Nāgārjuna's Mūlamadhyamakakārikā XIII.8]

[Emptiness is declared by the victors to be
The purgative of all [metaphysical] views.]
But those for whom emptiness is a view
Are declared to be incurable. And [Nāgārjuna also] said [in Ratnāvali II.20]
Fools who pride themselves in being learned,
Having a nature corrupted by rejecting [emptiness],
Plunge headlong into the Avīci hell.

And it is said that if emptiness is taught to such fools—as in the words [of Śāntideva] “when emptiness is imparted to sentient beings whose minds are not properly trained”—then the teacher commits a root downfall.

[Reply:] There are two types of learned persons: those who trained their mind-stream through the Perfection Vehicle and those who fully matured through the authentic bestowal of empowerments. Where this Dwags po Bka' brgyud Mahāmudrā is taught by a bla ma known as the “teacher” to either of these two, not only is there not the slightest fault [in it], but individuals who are worthy vessels are directly introduced to profound suchness. This is because, at the time of teaching the Madhyamaka view, when the time is ripe to show learned people who have previously trained in studying and thinking the view of the main practice, this is nothing other than settling spontaneously into the uncontrived state, not thinking anything (cir mi yang sems), not mentally engaging in anything (gang du yang yid la mi byed). It is also because, in this context, it has been explained that even discriminating insight itself must cease, as in the example of the flame that arises from rubbing two sticks together.

By the upadeśas transmitted through them,
The truth of dharmatā will be realized.

As for the recognition of these upadeśas, he composed the treatise entitled Madhyamakopadeśa wherein the main practice—the way of settling into meditative equipoise—was set forth exactly in the way it was presented in the written instructions on that [topic] by the Mahāmudrā proponents.

Be that as it may, while it is true that those learned in the perfections familiarize themselves with the view of emptiness, as long as they have not fully perfected all the accumulations of merits in the course of many countless eons, it will not be possible to actualize that view in post-meditation because they instead fall into the extreme of a nirvāṇa of annihilation. When understood in this way, the saying [by defenders of Bka' brgyud Mahāmudrā]: “Lam 'bras meditation by the ignorant usually becomes a cause of animal rebirth as well” is not comparable because the way of teaching Lam 'bras to the ignorant is [as follows]. In the beginning, the mind-stream is purified through the ordinary vehicle by way of the three appearances. In the middle phase, one generates the mind directed toward great awakening (mahābodhicitta). Thereafter, the mind-stream is matured through the vaseempowerment, and the view of the inseparability of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is divulged. This kind of teaching is no different from the main practice of the methods of guidance of Mahāmudrā because it is exactly what they are talking about when they say that appearances are mind, that this mind is empty of anything that could be established as a shape and so on, and that the indivisibility of its natural luminosity and being empty of concepts is called the view consisting in the inseparability of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.

Likewise, the Lam 'bras proponents teach that the view known as “self-occuring coemergent wisdom” that arises from the first three empowerments [and] is inseparable from the method of great bliss is the actual wisdom of mahāmudrā. However, the Sa skya pa do not maintain that it is necessary to first produce the view and then, in the middle phase of sustaining it, to analyze it by discriminating insight and to [finally] cultivate it with analysis and [more] analysis.

2.2.2.1. [Sa skya misrepresenations:] Those who do not correctly understand the point of [Sa paṇ's] refutation of the Self-sufficient White Remedy think that the whole collection of ways of conduct must be practiced by leaving the conventional, however things appear, be just as it is without negating it. Thus when everything is determined to be emptiness, they absurdly conclude that this is the Self-sufficient White Remedy. Having this in mind, they promote this version of the dharma. They do not differentiate between the categories of the two vehicles. In the case of the Pāramitāyāna, the following words [from Jñānagarbha's Satyadvayavibhaṅga 21ab] apply just as stated: “Because [the conventional] corresponds to appearances, don't subject it to analysis.” However, in the Mantra[yāna], all ways of conduct, whether one is in meditative equipoise or not, must be practiced from within the state of emptiness.

[Assertion:] It has been stated that while [phenomena] are empty of reality, the appearances of subject and object are not negated [or do not cease].

This is because the Sa skya pas, considering the meaning of the Mantra [vehicle], have statements [claiming] that the entire complex of skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas is empty in the sense of not being perceived, but do not have statements [claiming] that [it] is empty in the sense of not being perceived as real.

[Assertion:] Though all conduct of Secret Mantra is indeed established on the basis of wisdom, it is not a view.

Great bliss, the cornerstone of skill in means, is also the wisdom of emptiness. In this way, [the reason] is established. Were it not established, [your thesis, that tantric conduct cannot be a view] would be negated due to the fact of the inseparability of bliss and emptiness.

[Query:] Now when [Sa paṇ] attributed to his opponent the proposition that “Nāgārjuna was liberated through realizing the view” [and that various siddhas were liberated through various other means], then don't all the [ensuing] refutations such as “Hence, none of the siddhas was liberated through a unilateral technique” end up backfiring. [Reply:] This indeed refutes those existing scholars who say that the view of the Pāramitāyāna alone is sufficient and that the various kinds of interdependent means [of Mantrayāna] are not necessary. However, where is there any contradiction in characterizing the view as that wisdom in the context of practice wherein the full spectrum of the paths of skillful means of Secret Mantra having as their essence the unity of clarity and emptiness?

[Assertion:] Again, the modern-day Sa skya pa followers thinking unequivocally that the realization of the Secret Mantra view requires the preliminary analysis of insight as taught in the Madhyamaka, promote this version of the dharma. And they speak [this way] based on the assumption that if one accepts that emptiness is realized only with the blessing of the teacher, one becomes an opponent of this [Sa skya] tradition. [Response:] That is not the case because the assertion of the noble Sa skyas is that although the goal to be realized in both Mahāyāna traditions—the view of freedom from elaborations—is the same, it is due to the absence of the means of realization in the Pāramitāyāna that this view is held to be [a matter of] realization.

[Query:] What are these means? [Reply:] They are claimed to consist in [1] working with the vital points of the adamantine body (vajrakāya) through the stages of the invitation of the wisdom beings in the phase of preparations, blessing from within through the bestowal of the vase-empowerment and the secret empowerment during the phase of the main practice, and [2] actualizing the wisdom of the view by depending on the Prajñāmudrā [tantric consort] at the time of the higher empowerment.
Moreover, it is also not the case that it was not accepted that there could be the eliciting of the wisdom of emptiness merely through the blessings of the teacher and the devotion of the student without preliminary analysis by reasoning based on thinking because there are claims like this in the compositions Five Stages of Cakrasaṃvara, Profound Path of Guru Yoga and Stages of Instructions of Great Simplicity.

Others yet appear to be of the opinion that although the object of the view must be characterized as coemergent wisdom, as an adjunct to realizing this, it must be preceded by the analysis through the reasoning that at first there is no object, and subsequently that, since there is no object, there must also be no subject, and so forth.

[Responses:] It is not tenable to [construe] emptiness that is the object of the view presented in the Dohās as a nonaffirming negation because while the claim that this Madhyamaka view is self-aware wisdom was emphatically negated by the teachers Bhāviveka and Candra[kīrti], it was emphatically affirmed in these [dohās]. Neither do [the dohās] conform with Rang stong vis-à-vis the method of negating the object of negation because in this Rang stong system, even coemergent wisdom when analyzed by reasoning about one and many turns out to be nonexistent, along with [its] aspects of mere bliss and clarity, whereas in the [dohās], “mind as such alone” is left un-negated, and a statement [stanza 20ab] from [Saraha's] Dohā in Forty [Stanzas] outlined the grave drawbacks of ascertaining self-luminous selfawareness in terms of self-emptiness:

By analyzing mind in terms of one and many [and thus]
Abandoning luminosity, one strays into worldly existence.

Were it necessary that this view be preceded by logical reasoning, this would contradict the statement that “since the three Great Ones are views that are intellectually fabricated, we do not accept them in this [tradition].”
And although when it comes to coemergent wisdom, the belief in extremes such as existence and nonexistence is explained as what is to be relinquished, the explanation that this very wisdom is self-empty does not appear at all in the root [texts] of this tradition.

The second tradition [i.e., Other-emptiness] is also not the intent for the following reasons. The exegetical tradition of Other-emptiness Madhyamaka (gzhan stong dbu ma) reasoning ascertains first that appearances are mind, then that outer objects are not established, and then that the inner apprehender is not established. However, in these [dohās], leaving appearances just as they are, one proceeds to not adulterate them with conceptual grasping. Then in the post-meditation of this tradition, without subjecting the manifold display and the luminous nature of mind as such to the operations of conceptual analysis, to simply settle into the self-luminous non-grasping is the method of resting in meditative equipoise of this tradition. Consequently, in this tradition, there is nothing good about the view of meditative equipoise and nothing bad about post-meditation. Even still, their distinctive features are to let the nature of phenomena remain in a state of nongrasping [in meditation] and to let phenomena remain free from elaboration [in post-meditation].

As to the claim that even if conceptual grasping is switched off by leaving the mind spontaneously present in its uncontrived state, if one has not engaged in the conclusive determination through the Madhyamaka reasonings, it will be is impossible to have a pure view and to eliminate the seeds of what is to be relinquished.

Likewise the identification of emptiness during the phases described as “the object being appearance-emptiness”, “the subject being clarity-emptiness”, and “the body being bliss-emptiness” has to be explained in terms of these three—the object and the rest— being [respectively] empty of reality, of essence and of self-nature. But to explain it as being empty of concepts is not an adequate representation of emptiness. This too is the style of those harbouring aversion toward [Mahā]mudrā followers, but not the style of those having conviction because without conceptually fabricating and manipulating the whole spectrum of appearance and existence, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—whatever arises as objects of consciousness—the proponents of this tradition must accept this wisdom which has become self-liberated of its own accord where there is no grasping as the wisdom of the Mahāmudrā of unity. Also, as for comprehending [this] unity, it is said that “while [things] appear, they are nonetheless devoid of grasping, and while devoid of [grasping] they nonetheless appear”. Conversely, to explain that this manifold appearance is verified by valid epistemic instruments (tshad mas grub) and that it is empty of being real as so verified (grub bzhin du bden) is not the style of those dedicated to the [Mahā]mudrā adepts.

[Mahā]mudrā proponents ascertain the view by understanding that all that appears as objects of consciousness is a delusory appearance and that the entire range of delusory appearances are apparitions of the mind, but they do not depend on Madhyamaka reasoning. Among the teachings of spiritual guides (man ngag pa) of yore it is stated explicitly that “dialecticians (mtshan nyid pa) make outward observations, severing superimpositions outwardly. Yoga-practitioners make inward observations, severing superimpositions inwardly”.

Moreover, from among the two, the system of severing superimpositions and the system of experiencing, this tradition of the [Mahā]mudrā practitioner is the latter. Concerning the former, there are the two great traditions, the system of Self-emptiness and the system of Other-emptiness. However, the [Mahā]mudrā practitioner follows neither. The view of severing superimpositions by means of studying and thinking is taken [by him or her] to be an intellectually fabricated view and a poisonous view. As for the arising of the wisdom of mahāmudrā, it is not asserted that this must unequivocally depend on the bestowal of the higher empowerments, let alone on the logical reasoning of the Madhyamaka. Nevertheless, an unmistaken view grounded in first-hand experience that has arisen due to familiarizing oneself with the stream of studying and thinking, and the self-occuring coemergent wisdom that has come about due to the bestowal of the higher empowerments must definitely be accepted as the view of Mahāmudrā [as well]. Thus it is established.

Let it be stated here: In bygone times in this Land of the Snows, the two sects of Bka' [gdams pa] and [Mahā]mudrā dispelled the darkness of living beings by upholding their respective victory banners of exegesis (bshad pa) and praxis (sgrub pa), [thereby] illuminating and beautifying everything like the sun and the moon.

The Sa skya pa, preserving the integrity of their own traditions of both exegesis and praxis [in connection] with all sūtras and mantras purified the jewel of the doctrine of this land of snow, applying all manner of cleansing activities.

</d>
<d e="2">
Although there have been many eloquent expositions by the author himself [Sa paṇ] as well as his bright followers, they became saturated with the stains of exegetical fallacies imputed by many people with inferior intelligence in the following ways:
</d>
</f>
<f>
<d e="1">

</d>
<d e="2">
It is said that the object of the view of Mahāmudrā of unity is nothing but self-emptiness, a nonaffirming negation. [Yet] to claim that great bliss taken as an object of a nonaffirming negation is a concept is not the doctrine of [Sa paṇ].
</d>

</d>
<d e="2">
It is said that wisdom being unreal, empty of an essence, is the meaning of the unity of bliss and emptiness. [Rather] it is the three aspects of bliss, clarity and appearance being empty of grasping that is held to be the meaning of unity.
</d>

<d e="2">
It is said that the stages of a view superior to the freedom from elaboration of the Pāramitā[yāna] does not exist in the Mantra[yāna]. [Yet] he [Sa paṇ] claimed four distinctive features of the [Mantra] view in the context of the four empowerments such as the inseparability of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.

<d e="2">
As for reasoning that ascertains freedom from extremes, although he did not accept [anything] superior to the Madhyamaka, [he] did explain the superiority of [Mantra] objects of knowledge: the experiential view, natural coemergence, and coemergent melting bliss.

</d>
<d e="2">
It is said that the statement 'that which is saṃsāra is nirvāṇa' is explained as signifying the inseparability of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. [Yet] being empty of grasping phenomena comprising appearances and sounds is explained as the meaning of unity, the inseparability of the two truths.

It is said that the emptiness [deduced by] analysis by means of Madhyamaka reasoning is the definitive meaning of the Secret Mantra system. [Yet] he [Sgam po pa] declared that the view of emptiness understood by studying and thinking is a poisonous view.

It is said that the object of the profound view of the Bka' gdams system is what is to be realized by the valid instruments of direct [perception] and inferential [reasoning]. [Yet] the glorious Atiśa said that such explanations are the system of the ignorant who have a superficial perspective.

It is said that the main practice of the Bka' gdams view is conceptual cognition (zhen pa'i blo) because it is a mode of apprehension that opposes the view of self (ātmadṛṣti).

Dear questioner, please listen to this! [I am] addressing [you] after devoting a little consideration to the wording of the questions posed by you. I ask whether your questions are [the following:] Through attachment and aversion to the philosophical systems of ourselves and others, [is it possible] to become liberated or not? When one is not liberated from the cause of either saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, will one realize the profound intent of the tantras by giving up a mentality based on attachment and aversion? Or is your question: What is the difference between the philosophical systems of ourselves and of others?

Please listen! In case it is the first: Due to attachment, aversion, and ignorance [sentient beings] wander in cyclic existence. Moreover, all attachments and aversions [in the context of] clinging to philosophical systems are to be given up through the [path of] vision because the victor taught that they are obscurations of conceptual imputations. Therefore, who could find certainty in the profound tantras without having relinquished attachment, aversion, and ignorance?

This tradition [of ours] is renowned for the reputed “greatness of having realized that all the teachings are not contradictory”. Nowadays, upholders of the teachings say that the Dharma of their own tradition is supreme while that of others is inferior. These statements are made not out of aversion against others, but [in order to] praise the unmistaken Dharma, just as those who, when separating the barley [grain] from the chaff, don't do so out of aversion against barley. Thus, these [statements] have arisen from compassion and are therefore not produced by attachment and aversion, right! The victor is skillful and definitively liberated from falsehood; his teachings are free from any deception. Nonetheless, according to commentators, it appears as if [they] are categorized into diverse philosophical views and tenets that are said to belong to oneself and others. Nevertheless, the intent of the victor is always one. So do not place your trust in personally fabricated words. All [of the Buddha's teachings] are in harmony and should be taken in that way.

It is crucial to cultivate unbiased pure perception. Contrived ascertainment must simply be given up. Who puts his trust in words spoken by Māra? Therefore, analysis that discriminates between what is and is not the case, [like] the top and back of the head, is required, and is not just blind faith. Because the words of the victor are profound, they are difficult to understand. Given that even the analysis of those expert in their meaning, appears to be contradictory when considered separately, I hold the explanations of my teacher to be authoritative. If you ask why, [my response is] because all buddhas of the three times, having displayed embodiments in accordance with the fortunes of each individual are said to thereby function as guides on the right path, such is the emanation of [my] root teacher.

In the case of the second [question], i.e., the philosophical system of ourselves and others, generally there are many views in both Buddhist and non-Buddhist [philosophies].

Still, what is the point of identifying 'this' and 'that' way of falling into the extremes of eternalism and nihilism.

Nowadays, some who pride themselves in being Rang stong proponents speak of “emptiness that consists in these phenomena being empty of reality”. By merely refuting the 'real existence' added to these phenomena, they assert a nonaffirming negation as the ultimate truth. Clinging to such a view of nihilism, they declare their own account to be Madhyamaka. However, this is not the genuine Rang stong known among learned ones. By strongly adhering to emptiness as a mere nonaffirming negation, they meditate on nonexistence that is like a hare's horn, but they will not experience the mode of abiding [thereby]. The reason is that this nonexistence is not within the range of valid cognition. Hence, how could it become the personally realized self-awareness? By focusing on Rang stong as a nihilistic view, how will one see the correct emptiness? Because even the expression rang stong is just a mere name [for them], it is in this way diametrically opposed to the actuality of the mode of abiding.

As for the Rang stong as asserted by learned ones of the past, like an empty vase that is emptied of water, all phenomena are empty of an intrinsic essence, but [this is] not a nonaffir-ming negation. The vase that is empty of water is established. Despite the emptiness of the appearances of the apprehended and the apprehender, the wisdom without the duality of the apprehended and the apprehender exists; it is not an empty absolute nothingness. Consider how at the end of the word 'empty' the affirmative syllable 'ness' (nyid) was indicated. My omniscient lama has explained that “that emptiness which is empty of an ownnature is indeed the authentic Rang stong, but emptiness is not said to be a nonaffirming negation.”

My omniscient lama continued: “Nowadays, some who pride themselves as being Gzhan stong proponents wrongly proclaim that the ultimate—that which is permanent, stable, enduring, unchanging, and truly established—is profound Gzhan stong because it is empty of the adventitious [stains of] the apprehended and the apprehender.” Being fond of such a view of permanence, they describe the clinging to an extremist belief as profound emptiness. But these are false, deceptive words. It is not the pure Gzhan stong taught in the sūtras. Being confused about the teachings of the victorious Maitreya that “mind's nature is not empty of unsurpassable qualities,” they take gzhan stong [to mean] that the sixty-four qualities already present at the [time of] the ground are empty of adventitious stains. [Thus they] deprecate the victor because [the consequence would be that] a perfect buddha in whom all obscurations are exhausted and wisdom is fully unfolded experiences the suffering of the six types of migrators such as the hell-states etc. and therefore wanders in cyclic existence.

Mind's nature is uncurtailed and unbiased; natural luminosity, the great seminal potency as the inseparability of expanse and awareness, the natural awareness, the essence of which is without any change whatsoever. From the perspective of it being buddha when it has been purified of adventitious stains, it is known as gzhan stong. That the primordial ground is untainted by obscurations is the basic meaning of empty of other. This nature of mind not recognizing itself by itself is called adventitious obscuration, which means that the [nature of] mind can become free from them. Therefore, because mind's nature is empty of them, it is empty of other. The sixty-four qualities that are present in the basic nature are indeed never separated from the mind. However, let us call it obscured buddhahood at the time of the ground and immaculate buddhahood at the time of the fruition. The thirtytwo qualities of dissociation from all obscurations and the thirty-two of maturation that unfold as enlightened activity, are special qualities exclusive to perfect buddhahood. They are not asserted to be present at the time of the ground. The sixty-four qualities present in the ground are veiled by obscurations. When these stains are overcome, [one] becomes an immaculate victor. Thus the ground of emptiness that is empty of other (gzhan stong) is *sugatagarbha, mind's nature, this very natural luminosity. What it becomes empty of, what is to be relinquished, are the adventitious stains that are referred to as the concepts of the apprehended and the apprehender. Therefore, ultimate truth is nothing but the nature of mind that is free from the concepts of the apprehended and the apprehender. [This], i.e., natural luminosity, unity, coemergence, the inseparability of the expanse and awareness, natural awareness itself, is the profound view of Gzhan stong.

Thus, my teacher explained that “even the so-called Rang stong and Gzhan stong are not contradictory”. If you wish to achieve further certainty in this, seek the oral explanations of someone who can unravel the indications and words. The one who can answer all questions is the Buddha because he has the samādhi that knows the aspirations and situations [of others]. Regarding all your questions and sources of doubt, how [could I have] the self-confidence to answer them correctly? However, please say whatever you wish to ask. Those which I can answer, I have addressed without holding anything back. Regarding those [issues] that remain inscrutable, I request your patience.

[A] In general, this comprises [1] what is called the “ground” that remains when what [is to be cleared] has been cleared away, [2] the full enumeration of its stains that are cleared away, [3] the full range of antidotes that clear these [stains], and [4] the result of that clearing process which is not other than the ground of the clearing process itself.

However, from the perspective of consciousness, things apprehended separately, being of the nature of interdependence, are thus interconnected as homologous phenomena insofar as they are mutually dependent as factors to be relinquished and their antidotes—this is the profound vital point of the Unsurpassed Vajrayāna. So in the case of such similarities, having first discussed them in language [emphasizing] connections according to homologous instances, they are ultimately ascertained as being heterologous instances. By directly recognizing (ngo sprod pa) the factors to be relinquished and antidotes separately, one eliminates the factors to be relinquished and completes the activation of the antidotes. The purpose of the Vajra path is thereby fulfilled.

The category of impure psychophysical aggregates and elements and the rest are the body, speech and mind of sentient beings, but these are only numerically similar to the [adamantine] body, speech and mind of buddhas. Consequently, when you meditate on the imagined deities (kun btags kyi lha), there arise cognitions (rnam rig) of many things such as the four impure birth places, heads and limbs and so forth. Also, among the assembly of deities belonging to the clearing process, there may be similarities [with humans] in terms of numbers and aspects. As for their difference, however, the aspects to be relinquished are the ordinary latent tendencies while, conversely, what does not form a continuous chain of latent tendencies is the essence of supreme wisdom.

[2] As for explanations of correspondence in terms of purification: When the triad of body, speech and mind of sentient beings is purified, the [adamantine] body, speech and mind of buddhas that have been obscured by these [former], become apparent from the perspective of consciousness. Hence, insofar as impure aspects become pure ones, they are metaphorically designated as “similar to those”. For example, it is said that “the triad of body, speech and mind, once purified, is the three kāyas.” And [by way of commentary to Hevajra II.iv.64b]:
When what has adhered to the womb of a sentient being for ten months together with its negative hindrances has been purified, it becomes lord of the ten levels.

This is the main point (don po) of the Mantra scriptures of Vajrayāna. However, [you talk about] something “similar to buddha” and sometimes talk about sentient beings as if they were real and other times as if they were not—[such] ideas are not well-founded. Therefore, the meaning [of the tantric scriptures] is not that sentient beings possess a thing that is totally unreliable that [you] called “similar”.

In short, according to this teacher who propounds the rival position, “what is attained via the nature of things” (dharmatā)—viz., an aspect similar to a buddha within sentient beings—is the naturally present spiritual potential. That aspect which becomes increasingly similar to a buddha—being typologically similar (rigs 'dra ba) to it—by producing the roots of virtue such as study and so on, is the unfolded spiritual potential. So finally, when it becomes very similar to it, it turns into this very buddha. Also, the means of turning into [a buddha] are the qualities for cleansing the spiritual element (khams) such as faith.

In short, [you have] declared that “the quintessence that exists in sentient beings is not the quintessence of buddha (sangs rgyas kyi snying po) but rather a quintessence of sen-tient being (sems can snying po).” Regarding the untenability of this, [1] it is shown that it was a mistake to have not correctly identified the naturally present spiritual potential and the unfolded spiritual potential: they are not the actual [buddhahood], so however similar to it they may be, they do not [actually] become that. [2] Therefore, it is shown that in the system of this master and disciple, their claims have been adulterated by the views and tenets of Rje Tsong kha pa and his disciples—for some people, this does not count as being valid.

In that regard, the naturally present potential is that wherein all flaws are exhausted and [all] qualities fully actualized (yongs rdzogs). It is buddhahood since the beginning. It is the state of complete spiritual awakening. Even when, from the perspective of consciousness, the potential later becomes the buddha in which stains are purified away, it has not become better than before. Since this [potential] has always and already been inseparable from buddha nature that is free from stains, it is able to fully display all the activities (mdzad) of a buddha. However, there are some who say that suchness possessing stains is unable to display these buddha-activities because it is like a knife that cannot be taken from its scabbard and so forth. But this is just a system of those who speak incorrectly.

Having unerringly identified the naturally present potential, when it comes to the unfolded potential, it may seem from the perspective of ordinary consciousness as if certain aspects of buddha nature manifests due to adventitious stains having been purified away. Moreover, the naturally present potential is present as the abiding condition for those under the influence of wisdom itself, but when it comes to the unfolded potential, it seems from the perspective of conventional consciousness as if something not previously awakened had awakened. Therefore, this [unfolded potential] is of provisional meaning because something already awakened (gdod 'tshang) cannot [actually] blossom (rgya) [into awakening].

Moreover, in taking what is not the real thing as a basis for [understanding] that real thing, however absolutely similar to that it may become it will never be that because the nature [of a real thing] is undifferentiated.

Because it is similar, it is not the actual one.

Hence, it is determined that saṃsāric phenomena are mere appearances before consciousness and that nirvāṇic phenomena are the experienced objects of wisdom. Among these, the latter do not need to be analyzed at this stage. Among the two factors of consciousness—i.e., [1] the factor of dual appearances [of] looking outward through the sense-gates at substances or characteristics and [2] the factor of the clear and knowing [cognition] (gsal rig) looking inward, [1] the first is [defined as] conventional saṃsāra, the factor consisting in the stains that are posited as saṃsāra and the apprehended aspects of consciousness, the knowable objects. [2] The latter is defined as the ultimate saṃsāra, natural nirvāṇa, the apprehending aspect, and that which designated as 'wisdom'. Since the abiding nature of all conventional phenomena does not exist apart from just these, it is impossible for them not to be pervaded by buddha nature that is called continuum (tantra) and is the ultimate [Guhya]samāja maṇḍala (don dam pa'i 'dus dkyil) of all phenomena. As has been stated [Hevajratantra I.viii.41cd]: 

By me is this all pervaded.
Another nature of the world [of beings] is not seen.

And, as noted by the venerable Ghaṇṭapāda:

All these beings are the naturally accomplished maṇḍala
That is nondual.

This is how it is written, [but] as for its tenability, it is not tenable that the abiding condition of saṃsāra is buddha nature. Nor is it tenable that the factor of the [mundane] clear and knowing [cognition], which is the inward looking consciousness, is wisdom. Neither is it admissible that this clear and knowing consciousness is nirvāṇa. It is a mistake to identify “ultimate saṃsāra” with the saṃsāra appearing before conventional consciousness. Given that both the apprehended aspect—i.e., the outward orientation of consciousness—and the inward-looking self-awareness are adventitious stains, it is untenable to distinguish them in line with the two truths. It is also a mistake to explain that which is called the “subjective aspect” ('dzin rnam) as being the nondual wisdom that is accepted by the Mādhyamikas. When you link the meaning of the [above] scriptural citations with [ordinary] consciousness, you misrepresent the vital point of the Vajrayāna.

Let me add that to the extent that there is something already present as the abiding nature, it cannot be anything but the ultimate buddha nature. Be that as it may, the abiding mode of saṃsāra is not empty in the sense of nonexistence (med stong): this is your basic premise (rtsa sgrub) and we accept it as well. So, in that case, if buddha nature were emptiness qua nonexistence, then it would transcend neither the extreme of annihilation nor conceptual elaborations. So all the refutations you have made in your own scriptures to repudiate claims that buddha nature is emptiness qua nonexistence would end up undermining yourself, the “great one”. [Now,] you don't maintain, as some people do, that there is no abiding condition but [only] an imputed abiding condition. Consequently, if you accept in conventional terms the abiding mode of all conventional phenomena or the whole of saṃsāra, then this abiding mode does not transcend the [truths of] suffering and its source. It follows that the abiding mode of saṃsāra is not established as [buddha] nature.

The same holds for that which [you call] the inward-looking and outward-looking [factors] of consciousness. Since there is no difference between them insofar as they are the clear and knowing factor that is [just] a hallmark (ngo bo) of [mundane] consciousness, even these two streams of this clear and knowing factor stem from the element (khams) of mental formations (saṃskāra). And because it is [just] a hallmark of other-dependent cognition (gzhan dbang rnam rig = vijñapti), and because such knowing also consists in the knower (shes pa can) that arises from the all-ground consciousness (ālayavijñāna) like waves from water, it does not transcend the adventitious stains that are to be relinquished. So, how could that [clear and knowing cognition] possibly be wisdom?

Likewise, it could not possibly be nirvāṇa because being the inward-looking [factor] among the two basic factors stemming from the saṃsāric consciousness, it is [identified by you as] self-aware cognition. This self-aware direct perception (rang rig mngon sum : svasaṃ- vedanapratyakṣa) is not nirvāṇa because in the context of classifying types of mentation (blo ris 'du ba), this is said to exist in all ordinary individuals and is therefore sharply separated from yogic direct perception (rnal 'byor mngon sum : yogipratyakṣa). So it is not at all correct [to call it] nirvāṇa.

Having asserted more than once that “ultimate saṃsāra” is buddha nature, you nonetheless assert that this has no connection at all with [mundane] consciousness. So by claiming that the inward-looking consciousness is ultimate saṃsāra, you contradict your own words! 
That is not all: the inward-looking factor of a sentient being's cognition circles around in saṃsāra and all the aspects (ākāra : rnam pa) that constitute the three realms appear before it. But this would mean that buddha nature which is [your] so-called “ultimate saṃsāra” would circle in saṃsāra and would have the representational cognition that knows the appearances of all these aspects that constitute the three realms.

This same consciousness engenders two modes of seeing—seeing its own self-nature and [seeing] its external objects. But these two remain cognitions of subject and object—they do not last for a moment, are fictitious and deceptive. Since you have thereby introduced a dichotomy within conventional truth between the ultimate truth as the inward-looking and conventional truth as the outwardlooking, you declare what is [generally] recognized as conventional truth to be the ultimate truth. As a result, your philosophy is fundamentally mistaken.

Now if one thinks about a certain person's assertion that two minds exist separately and nonconvergently within every sentient being, this assertion is identical with the intent of all the buddhas of the three times. This was declared with the same voice by the 'Bri khung pa 'Jig rten gsum gyi mgon po, and it was also asserted by the Great Karma pa Rang byung rdo rje. According to [his] commentary on the root text of the Zab mo nang don, the pure is described as mind and the impure is [also] described as mind.

As for explaining the first of these two, [the Ratnagotravibhāga 1.47] states:

According to the phases of being impure,
Partly pure and partly impure, and completely pure,
One speaks of a sentient being, a bodhisattva
And a Tathāgata [Thus-gone].

As for explaining the second, [the Zab mo nang don 1.1] states:

As for the cause, it is the beginningless nature of mind,
Although uncurtailed in scope and not falling into bias,
From [the perspective of] its unimpeded play,
It is empty in essence, luminous in nature and
Unimpeded in aspects, manifesting as anything.
[Thus,] it does not recognize itself by itself. 

In terms of this explanation, the first mind is self-aware wisdom free from obscurations. The second is consciousness that is delusional ignorance possessing obscurations.

[Now,] from these being conventionally [taken as] different 'entities', the former is the substantially existing entity (rdzas yod kyi dngos po : dravyasat vastu) whereas the latter is a nominally existing entity (btags yod kyi dngos po : prajñaptisat vastu). This is because the former is buddha nature—innate, self-originated, and innately undeluded, whereas the latter is the chaff [i.e., superfluous] part—adventitious defilement, innately deluded, and saṃsāric.

Now, in terms of linguistic convention, when the sun of undeluded substantially existing wisdom dawns, the dark shroud of deluded nominally existing consciousness is dispelled. When those who want to awaken to unsurpassed, complete and perfect buddhahood engage in accepting and rejecting these two 'minds' [respectively] without mixing them up, it is by these trainings that they may be fully awakened. This is so because the result of complete purification is not attained by any path apart from that and because when one takes as a cause what is not a cause, despite one's exertions, there is only exhaustion that is fruitless [i.e., has no result].

Now, the mind that is buddha nature in the mind-streams of sentient beings is a limitless and immeasurable whole that is indivisible into categories of 'consciousness' and 'wisdom'. However, the adventitious mind may have been arbitrarily described using the terms “wisdom” or “consciousness”: if [described] extensively, it is the eightfold ensemble [of Yogācāra traditions]; if more concisely, it is the sixfold ensemble [of non-Yogācāra traditions], and if most succinctly, it is nothing more than a single constellation because it is a partial cognition that sees a partial object of knowledge.

[Query:] Well then, if the innate and adventitious minds exist separately and nonconvergent in the continuum of a single individual, doesn't this contradict [Sgam po pa's] precept that “thoughts themselves are dharmakāya”? [Reply:] There is no contradiction because the thoughts of adventitious mind do not exist as substantially other than the dharmakāya of innate mind, but that mind which exists only as conceptual imputations therefore has no independent existence, even conventionally, apart from dharmakāya. Thus “thoughts themselves are dharmakāya.”

[Query:] Well then, if the two minds exist separately and nonconvergently, isn't it a problem to explain saṃsāra and as being inseparable or equal?

But as for their inseparability, the very nature of the saṃsāric and nirvāṇic minds is ultimately present as a great openness and equality, inseparable in their freedom from discursive elaborations.

Here in the Snowy Country [of Tibet], I continually and devotedly take refuge in Sa skya uncles and nephews and the emanations of the Lord Karmapa—the Venerable Mañjughoṣa, and Venerable Lord of the World [Lokeśvara] who accepted birth in a human existence. This mirror of the mind of Śrī Candraprabhakumāra [Sgam po pa], the one in Tibet who was prophesied by the buddha himself—an authority on the teachings of the Buddha who purely upheld the exegetical traditions of the Indians—was clearly seen by all who have appeared in the unbroken lineage. In this [present] situation, however, among theories about the triad of ground, path and fruition pertaining to all the teachings, there are Tibetan meditators of other [traditions] who make a distinction between three grounds: [1] the ground of the [enlightened] intent of a buddha (sangs rgyas kyi dgongs gzhi) who has realization, [2] the ground of delusion of sentient beings who do not have realization, and [3] the common ground comprising both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. From the standpoint of definitive meaning, this is not at all felicitous because to superimpose this threefold subdivision onto the expanse of reality (yang dag pa'i dbyings) would be a case of illegitimate imputation. This terminology contradicts the claim that there are two common grounds of delusion and freedom, i.e., of sentient beings and buddhas, and also the precept that thoughts are dharmakāya.

[Now,] is the common ground of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa [something] indeterminate that is different from the dharmadhātu? This theory of three categories (phung po) is nowhere found among the authoritative traditions of India or Tibet. In general, moreover, everything that originally assembles as saṃsāra and nirvāṇa and eventually [undergoes] the natural dissolution of its formation is [thus] similar in manner, being of the same flavour. As the Noble Ācārya [Nāgārjuna] states [in MMK :

As for the method of ascertaining [this] for oneself: the expanse of reality is a state of equality (mnyam pa nyid) wherein the whole complex of entailing and entailed [factors] of saṃsāra, nirvāṇa and the path does not exist. Nonetheless, it appears that [some scholars] proclaim that this way of abiding (gnas tshul), the nature of reality (chos nyid : dharmatā), transcends the dharmadhātu and they take this as the profound vital point of their view. But this does not make sense because another nature of reality apart from the dharmadhātu is not observed.

As for the theory that when self-awareness [emerges] from dharmadhātu, there is wisdom and when [awareness] does not recognize itself for what it is, there is delusion, some claim that when this stirring of ignorance [non-recognition] is found to be without foundation or source (gzhi med rtsa bral), this ignorance is fundamentally transformed into wisdom. This is not attractive in the least because once the undercurrent of ignorance comes to an end, ignorance [itself] comes to an end within the expanse of unimpeded wisdom. Therefore, it is not 'transformed'. This point is explained at length by the Noble Ācārya [Nāgārjuna] in his Bodhicittavivarana.

[Reply:] Among those who are fixated on the intellectual stages of persons, the buddha level (rgyal ba'i sa) and the methods of the perfections are explained in detail in terms of the paths and levels. Hence, when that knowledge based on ignorance stops functioning, then innate wisdom which is not adulterated with that [ignorance]—precisely the personally realized wisdom (so so rang rig gi ye shes) that apprehends ultimate characteristics, free from concepts—arises out of that expanse. In that regard, the personally realized wisdom is at present characterized by other Tibetan meditators as “recognizing itself by itself” (rang ngo rang gis shes pa). [But] if analyzed authoritatively, this locution “self-recognition” (rang ngo shes) [means that] when subject and object are purified away [in] an ordinary individual for whom self-recognition and non-recognition are possible, then personally realized wisdom dawns. It is not otherwise. As for the locution “recognizing itself by itself” (rang ngo rang gis shes), which is the object of an idée fixe for [some] other Tibetan meditators, it appears that it has been explained as self-awareness in the sense of an introspective experience. But in that case, it would absurdly follow that personally realized wisdom is present in all ordinary individuals. Therefore, that [definition] is not tenable.

In this regard, some Indian Ācāryas stated that “a yogin who is established in a state without appearances sees the Mahāyāna.” The intended meaning was that all conventional phenomena and the represented ultimate was not seen, is not seen, and will never be seen by buddhas from the perspective of selflessness.

The actual meaning of such [statements] is that in the spheres of operation of buddhas whose discriminating wisdom (pratyavekṣanājñāna) of selflessness and whose wisdom that accomplishes tasks (kṛtyānuṣṭānajñāna) by the power of aspirations are uninterrupted, the expanse functions on its own in a self-sustaining way, while at the same time there is the clarity aspect of the self-luminosity of adamantine awareness that is indivisible [with the expanse]. With this in mind, some great Indian Ācāryas claimed that the sense of “no appearances” is untenable. This was also extolled by the illustrious Rang byung [rdo rje] who followed this later tradition.

[Now,] when the Bodhicittavivaraṇa and [Madhyamak]āvatāra and other texts explain that the ālayavijñāna is untenable, they proceed to explain that mere appearance (snang tsam) is [due to] latent tendencies alone. As for the exegesis of both the noble Ācārya [Nāgārjuna] and Candrakīrti, the reason they did not accept the ālayavijñāna is that all phenomena are entirely devoid of any factor that is self-sufficient in terms of function and essence. That being so, since [the ālayavijñāna] would have to be an independently existing consciousness capable of serving as an established basis of all phenomena, [and viewed as] an obscuration that shrouds the dharmadhātu [yet is itself] indeterminate, [this ālayavijñāna] was rightly rejected. Nonetheless, according to some other Ācāryas, the Victorious [Buddha] taught the classifications of skandhas, dhātus and āyatanas in order to invalidate non-Buddhists' beliefs in a self, a creator and a consumer. In particular, in the case of explanations placing special emphasis on the ālaya[vi]jñāna as discussed in [texts] such as the Laṅkāvatāra, it is evident that [these texts] explained very eloquently the criteria of cause and effect in the context of establishing appearance as mind. [This account] was also extolled by the illustrious Rang byung who followed this later tradition. But for me, in the context of deeply investigating the ultimate, the former tradition appears to be [more] intellectually refined.

In short, it is understood that whenever there emerges interdependent self-identification within the inexhaustible expanse of reality (dharmadhātu), there emerges the state of being sentient beings (sems can gyi khams). So having in mind that there is nothing to add to the expanse of reality, it was declared that “sentient beings have nothing to add but something to remove.” The point [here] is that whenever there occurs the stirring that serves as the dominant condition of grasping the expanse as “I”, it appears that sentient beings are individually established. Hence, consider that it also makes sense [to say] that for sentient beings there is something to add and remove.

Now, as for the way of [realizing the] appearance aspect of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa as being emptiness by means of the power of yoga, the stages of engaging [in this process] are as follows. In most of the Madhyamaka Stages of Meditation [instructions], it is explained that one first takes as one's object of ascertainment what is validly proven through logical reasoning based on object universals [i.e., abstractions] and proceeds to meditate on it. But some [Mahā]mudrā instructions maintain that meditation which is based on drawing logical conclusions by taking as a mental object [emptiness] as an object universal [arrived at through conceptual] exclusion is an impediment that obscures the abiding nature.

Moreover, in the case of analysis of the ultimate within our own Madhyamaka tradition, is not an analysis by means of engaging in linguistic-conceptual exclusion [i.e., an abstraction arrived at by process of elimination]. Rather, it is presented as the valid ascertainment arrived at through correct evidential reasoning by means of direct perception and rational inference. However, some Tibetan meditators state that [1] “even though it is the mistaken conventional, it is the mistaken conventional truth.” Additionally, these Tibetan meditators extensively explained that [2] if a definiens [property] is not in the actual definiendum [object], then assuming [it is] will not make it so, as in the example of falling through an open skylight by having walked above it. From that also follow [3] the stages of establishing appearance is mind. With these three [points], boasting that they have understood the definitive meaning, and proclaiming it in a way that does not accord with anyone else, it appears that they evaluate it as something truly fabulous.

Therefore, in general, for the Sugatas, everything in its modes of abiding and appearing [i.e., ultimate and conventional] is ascertained only via direct perception because [their] unobscured gates [of perception] go beyond limits, whereas the cognition of ordinary beings is [only] valid from the framework of what appears to them. Moreover, among the five aggregates, priority is given to the aggregate of form (rūpaskandha) because the entities of external reality do not exist as different substances that are truly established. But also the [ontological] categories, functions and qualities do not exist externally as distinct categories that subsume independently existing externals; [rather these all] come from mental arrangements [that impute] qualities of different substances. In that case, the external actual entities and [their] specific functions are not different because they are closely interconnected by way of causes and conditions. Yet they are also not the same because the mere appearances and the aspects of [their] functional capacities are obviously distinct.

In short, it is not the case that the coarse external objects exist to one side [viz., independently of mind], but neither, on the other hand, are they grasped as components (cha shas) of one's own mind. It is the clinging to characteristics that manifests as [so-called] real entities. Hence, the manifold functioning of objects was declared to be captivating only so long as one has not investigated it. In the Mother of the Victors [Prajñāpāramitā] there are some explanations that all phenomena are based on mere names. Then, when it comes to evaluating the conventional characteristics of all phenomena by a relentless intellect, one is lucidly led to the ultimate characteristic of all phenomena. Thus, the nature of all phenomena is primordial wisdom itself. That is free from all limits and elaborations. That which is the nature of the conventional is without nature. And that which is without nature is the quintessence which is the wisdom of the Tathāgatas. Therefore, it is said to be nondual, and [this nonduality] is what is explained extensively in the Mother of Victors.

In that regard, when this present knowing is bound up with apprehended [objects] and apprehending [subject], then it is conceptual (rnam par rtog pa) and imagined (kun tu brtags pa), and thus remains totally [enmeshed in] worldly existence. But [when the present knowing] does not give rise to aspects of subject and object, then having not followed the trails of objects and circumstances, [there is] the open unimpeded clarity of mere appearance and a knowledge of all the means [of dealing with] the distractions of the obscuring self-identifications. Even the buddha's omniscience is not perceived as [something more] profound than this. It is the unmistaken profound meaning.

Hence, when it comes to putting into practice such knowledge, the mind's knowing does not try to grasp phenomena, but neither does it suppress mere appearance. The extremes of acceptance and rejection are thereby annulled. Concept-free direct perception is the key point of practice. Nonconceptual mistaken knowledge is subject-object contrivance gone wild because even nonconceptual mistaken knowledge is not without its object. Hence, according to the key point that all knowing objects have not originated from any intrinsic essence, when what is unoriginated nonetheless appears as if it has originated, then apart from simply directly perceiving the mere originating, there is no multitude of levels [or layers] behind this [direct perception]. Deeply understanding the nature of one's own knowing so it is a matter of direct perception—[this] is the knowledge of the Āryas.

When you conceptualize and engage with the referential objects, [this] is the knowing of an ordinary person. In the moment of directly perceiving the object before [you], this undeceived knowing is the reality of mere appearance. When that occurs as self-awareness in the manner of remaining free from thoughts, there is the opportunity to enter the non-deceptive door to the way things are (gnas tshul). Since the entities of ordinary beings draw upon capacities for interdependent factors of objects and knowledge, they do not meet the requirements of being non-deceptive. However, when self-luminous knowing is subject to analysis, and it has become clear that it is not established as either an entity or non-entity, that knowing is non-deceptive.

In this way, in the case of those who straightforwardly put the key points of direct perception into practice, mental activities may be undertaken at will but they are nothing more than fruitful [and meaningful] doubts. But in the case of entertaining the thought that “this mere appearance is just illusion,” if it is not ascertained in direct perception, then the meditation on the appearance aspect that is not ascertained will be fruitless. In the case of direct knowledge (mngon sum gyi shes pa) manifesting momentarily, when you elaborate on the mental objects, retain them in memory, and meditate on them, this does not become direct knowledge. Rather by virtue of the key point that [all knowledge] is primordially unoriginated, [this mediated knowledge] comes and goes moment by moment.

Moreover, when two things to be ascertained are taken as determinate objects—the conventional which is [taken] as deceptive and as unreal, and the ultimate which is [taken as] real and as something non-deceptive that is unchanging—this belief in permanence will lay the foundation for doubts. The profound meaning of this matter is a subject of exceptional subtlety. According to the great master Kambala:

Thus, because self-awareness is so subtle,
It constitutes the most subtle vision of buddhas. So how can it be seen by the coarse minds
Of wretched beings like ourselves?

Here, concerning the resultant wisdom that is the nonerroneous realization of emptiness by a subtle intelligence, there have been many theories in India and Tibet about whether or not a buddha has wisdom. As for the statement that “wisdom does not exist on the level of buddhahood,” some great Ācāryas in India explained that there is no intrinsic difference in the wisdom specific to the equipoise meditations of those on the tenth spiritual level. Nevertheless, they explained that there are [differences] in the continuity of equipoise meditation, whether or not it is profound, or whether it is vast or narrow in scope. On that basis, [they maintained that] once [wisdom] definitively removes the obscurations of wayfarer's wisdom in the post-meditation, [the obscurations and wisdom both] assume the character of nonorigination. And as long as there is wisdom generated in the post-meditation and the wayfarer's wisdom that relinquishes objects to relinquish, [wisdom] is claimed to exist like a flame that lasts only as long as there is a wick and oil.

When they further explain that buddha[hood] (bde bar gshegs pa : *sugata) is a denomination of “emptiness,” they say that wisdom and the [buddha] powers are [only] of provisional meaning. But in clinging [to the view] that these depend solely on great compassion and former aspirations, they have lost the proficiency [needed] to understand the definitive meaning. For in that case, it would be impossible that emptiness is inseparable from skillful means and the capacities enabling skillful means [as traditionally maintained], and also that [these two] are therefore interdependent in nature. On the other hand, all the extraordinary special qualities of the Tathāgatas according to the Unsurpassed Mantra[yāna], [ranging] from one [buddha] family up to hundreds of [buddha] families, would have to be explained as being of provisional meaning.

Moreover, the claim that buddhajñāna manifests, and the manner in which it knows all aspects by knowing one aspect, constitutes the purport of the great ācāryas of India. However, regarding the wisdom that naturally knows and sees in the manner of non-appearance only the selflessness that is the pure peace [nirvāṇa], when [that is] revealed by the profound wisdom, then [with] great compassion for the world, [buddhas] know things correctly (yang dag par mkhyen) and know things by way of [wisdom] that discriminates [among all] it sees and accomplishes [all that] must be done. Thus they know and see all the subtlest of subtle topics of knowledge, like fresh āmalaka berries placed in the palm of one's hand.

<d e="2">
Therefore, when the wisdom of non-appearance is explained in this way, it seems quite elegant. Whereas, the expression “knowing all aspects through knowing one” has been explained as wisdom that encompasses the entire tableau (dkyil 'khor kun khyab) of objects of knowledge by virtue of knowing the single aspect of unorigination. If we think carefully about this, although within the expanse of phenomena, there exist no phenomena that are not of the nature of phenomena, when it comes to the variety of objects of consciousness, even the buddha's wisdom (buddhajñāna) has to make intelligible the various aspects when it works to train whoever [requires training]. Should one ask “doesn't this invalidate the feature of nonorigination?” the answer is that this nonorigination is revealed as the variety of what originates. Consequently, the question of whether or not qualities of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa exist autonomously (rang babs su mi 'dug) is eloquently answered [negatively] in this way.

Moreover, there have appeared many claims—[1] that a buddha's nonconceptual wisdom sees the nature of phenomena, [2] that, while remaining nonconceptual, he nonetheless sees the phenomena in all their complexity; [3] that [wisdom that] knows things in all their complexity does not [actually] see, even nonconceptually; and [4] that the aims of beings depend exclusively on former aspirations. Despite [such claims,] the buddha's knowledge is not as it has been imagined by the minds of ordinary beings in terms of any essences and aspects such as [being] conceptual or nonconceptual, or [knowing things] as they are or in all their complexity. This is because all phenomena have a single flavour.

Therefore, the buddha's wisdom that knows things in their complexity is not deluded in the same way that an illusionist is not deceived when illusions are conjured up by the illusionist himself. In this context, the Ācārya Śāntarakṣita, father and sons, said that when a buddha [has wisdom that] knows things in all their complexity for himself, what he sees is a configuration of pure wisdom. But he also sees according to the deluded ways ordinary beings [see them], but in seeing [this way], he is not adversely influenced by the delusions of ordinary beings. Others, however, argue that it does not make any sense at all that delusion is seen by a buddha because a buddha has dispelled (sangs pa) [all] habitual tendencies for delusion. You are right if this delusion of a buddha is grasped externally as delusion consisting in wisdom's engaging or disengaging in correspondence with error. But the profound wisdom of a buddha is like a mirror in which there arise myriad reflections of beings since there are no extraneous obscurations interposed between the two worlds of buddhas and sentient beings.

Moreover, since the Tathāgata is the [buddha's] body, speech and mind (sku gsung thugs) that is equal to the dharmadhātu, all sentient beings and that single wisdom prevail as the completely perfect wisdom, the dharmadhātu. As for the assertion by some people that [altruistic wisdom and deeds are] due solely to the power of compassion and [former] aspirations, that is not admissible at all. Because if even those [bodhisattvas] on the tenth level have ten powers, then buddhas would have attained limitless powers. So the [idea that such altruism] has to depend solely on former aspirations means that [a buddha's] skillful means would be of diminished scope.

Furthermore, “since that nature of buddhahood is empty of intrinsic essence, it is not established as one. And since it is not established as even one, it is unwarranted to establish it as many.” [This] is a vital point of the instructions of the [Mahā]mudrā followers. As for explaining the stages of meditation in the context of being free from the hopes and fears of being a buddha and sentient being, one should not cling to any one aspect but should train in the nonsectarian canonical scriptures of the Victorious [Buddha].

The hidden meaning of the sublime
Vehicle of the Perfections was
Directly taught in the Vajrayāna.
Since even the profound key points of Vajrayāna
Depend upon the key point of enthusiastic devotion
[We] supplicate those in the lineage.
So by the virtue of writing these trifling instructions, From the transmission of the blessings of the lineage, May all beings become Vajra holders.

[Query:] Isn't the meditation that involves stopping thinking, as [criticized in] the Jñānasiddhi by the King Indrabhūti and in other [texts], invariably explained as the path of Mahāmudrā? [Reply:] In this [tradition,] we do not engage at all in accepting or rejecting, projecting or withdrawing, thoughts, yet it is not the case that we try to block thoughts either. This is so because this [Mahāmudrā method of] relaxing in one's natural way of being without any clinging to thoughts and objects is not like the restrictive suppression of thoughts of the Chinese Heshang. It is also not the case that this way of settling [the mind] does not become the Mahāmudrā path because [Saraha's] People's Dohā [Dohākoṣa 57a] states:

Having relinquished thought and no thought,
One must let be in the manner of a small child.

In letting be in this way, the seeing, awareness, and mentation that focuses on all phenomena, and all [other] mental engagements come to a standstill. As Saraha states in his commentary on the Buddhakapāla [tantra]:

If you ask what is ultimately seen, one does not see any phenomena.

In that case, however, when one has not realized the ways of abiding and appearing of those objects, it is not the case that one does not see [at all] as if one's eyes were closed. Rather, there is the deception of the delusive imputed phenomena that are superimpositions of these things of the phenomenal existence. Since the vision of perceptible objects just as they are reverses [these superimpositions], one is free from mental engagements and therefore does not see anything and that is seeing the ultimate. When it comes to practicing Mahāmudrā calm abiding (zhi gnas) by way of dwelling one-pointedly on the imputed objects and letting the mind settle on them in an uncontrived state, this is the Dwags po bka' brgyud tradition's supreme means of practicing calm abiding. When practiced in this way, one does not find anything to see or touch in terms of object (yul) and subject (yul can) and is able to sustain this [realization] one-pointedly throughout the cycle of day and night. This has been described with the name “the yoga of one-pointedness in the Dwags po bka' brgyud tradition of the physician [Sgam po pa]”.

[Query:] As for the ultimate meaning (de kho na'i don) of this one-pointedness, if it is something like mental engagement that preserves innate natural way of being (gnyug ma'i rang babs), then isn't there a contradiction between the yogas of mental engagement and nonengagement given the mental nonengagement of the lineage stemming from the great siddhas Tilopa and Nāro, the Mahāmudrā Mental nonengagement doctrinal cycle in Śrī Saraha['s tradition] received by Mar pa, and, in particular, the teachings of the Mental nonengagement doctrinal cycle of Master Maitrīpa? [Reply:] As stated by the Fourth Crown Holder of the Zhwa dmar [Ye shes dpal bzang po (1453–1526)], “interpreting the term amanasikāra, it is the cessation of conditioned, transient mental engagements of saṃsāra and, at the same time, the one-pointed equipoise in unconditioned mental engagement of nirvāṇa wherein one does not remain [in either saṃsāra or nirvāṇa]. These two yogas are not incompatible.” According to the Nirvikalpapraveśadhāraṇi [NPDh]:

Son of a noble family, why has the nonconceptual sphere (nirvikalpadhātu) been described as amanasikāra? It is so called due to having properly transcended the discursive signs of all conceptual thinking. Thereby, the meditation that properly transcends all conceptual thinking is [denoted] by the term amanasikāra.

[Maitrīpa comments as follows in Amanasikārādhāra:]

Even [when amanasikāra is taken] in the sense of an affirming negation, there is no fault. When [someone] says “Bring a non-Brahmin,” the bringing of somebody similar to a Brahmin, a Kṣatriya or the like [is intended], but not a lowcaste person of base origin, such as a wagon-maker. Here, too, [where amanasikāra is taken as an affirming negation,] an awareness of the lack of inherent nature is maintained. Hence the tenet of Māyopamādvaya is established. From what, then, does the consequence of the view of nihilism follow?

And [that text] states:

[Amanasikāra] means the manasikāra for which the letter a is the main thing. It is a compound in which the middle word is dropped, as in the case of a śākaparthiva, a “king [for whom] vegetables [are the main thing].” Accordingly, whatever mental engagement (manasikāra) there is, all of it is “a” which means that it has the nature of nonorigination.

In accordance with this, Rje La yag pa [Byang chub dngos grub] in his commentary on the Four Dharmas of Sgam po pa states:

Mental nonengagement means familiarizing oneself with the true nature of things through relinquishing all mental engagements such as the apprehended [object] and apprehending [subject]. Alternatively, because the a is the foremost thing, it is said that everything abides in the state of nonorigination.

In other words, because of the a being primary, all phenomena abide in the state of nonorigination. According to the Sāgaramatiparipṛcchā (D 152):

That is without mindfulness and without mental engagement.

[Query:] Then, how do they practice it? [Reply:] When a Guru who has gained realization directly introduces by means of scriptures and esoteric precepts—the enduring heritage of the proper path—a fortunate disciple to the state of profound emptiness wherein all external and internal phenomena, however they may arise, are beyond all that is established in terms of modes of being and [thus] free from the entire [range] of existence and nonexistence, arising and ceasing, permanence and impermanence, substantiality and insubstantiality, and the conditioned and unconditioned, then for such a disciple all the bonds of wayward projections that are the great hidden flaw of delusion regarding all conventional phenomena, external and internal, are destroyed. [The disciple will also be] liberated from the great abyss of deprecation because there arises a special experiential understanding and realization (go rtogs myong ba) that all phenomena are already pure of all discursive elaborations of the threefold nexus [of act, object and subject] like dust in the sky, such that they are not existent, not nonexistent, and their being concomitantly both existent and nonexistent, or their being neither, are eliminated. On that occasion, in regard to that [disciple] who is nakedly immersed in the abiding nature, which is not amenable to any mental engagement at all, the illustrious Dwags po bka' brgyud have spoken of “seeing the abiding nature of mind” or “eliciting the perfection of wisdom nature” (rang bzhin sher phyin mngon du byas). Or they have paraphrased it as “attaining the direct introduction by directly encountering one's own face that is [one's] abiding nature, as never met or known before” and as “losing oneself in the vast expanse of uncontrived mahāmudrā.”

Nevertheless, when it comes to only that mahāmudrā as it is [described here], it is not identified with the mahāmudrā of the Completion Stage of Unsurpassed Mantra[yāna]. Regarding this [direct] method of view and meditation, the methods of spiritual praxis that accord with sūtras and tantras are [nonetheless] something unrivalled because those eloquent instructions by the Great Master Maitrīpa which emphasized mental nonengagement (yid la mi byed), nonorigination (skye med), and transcending the intellect (blo 'das) are present [in his] so-called “Amanasī[kāra] doctrinal cycle” (a ma na si'i chos skor).

To say a few words about the method of instructions in this tradition: all phenomena are only conceptually-imputed appearances and the aspects of appearances that are imputed in whatever fashion are not found as something other than the imputing cognition. And apart from just that phenomena cognition which is the imputer, there is nothing else besides its true nature (chos nyid), which is only profound emptiness. The [teaching] which primarily takes as its view and meditation the point where the nature of these two [cognition and emptiness] have resolved like water poured into water is called “sustaining natural awareness”. It evolved mainly in [1] the extensive traditions which preserve the instruction style (gdams srol) renowned among [Mahā]mudrā followers such as the Khro phu Bka brgyud tradition and [2] the Dwags po Bka' brgyud traditions in Tibet which stem from the dohā explanations in the tradition deriving from [Vajra]pāṇi in India, and [from] from Jo bo Mitrayogi.

If a profound emptiness other than that is taken as view and meditation, then some nonaffirming negation (med dgag) wherein phenomenal awareness and the like is never connected with its abiding nature is posited as a mental object. A view and meditation on emptiness that makes one inordinately attached to that [object] by means of the mode of apprehension is therefore not acknowledged by this [Mahāmudrā] approach as being totally pure. This is because it takes that state of profound emptiness to be a view and meditation that is not free from grasping for [and believing in] a nonexistence which is unreal, unsubstantial and unconditioned. This is entailed because the great vital points of all the Mahāyāna sūtras and tantras and the commentaries on their import are bound together in the teaching that grasping this profound emptiness as existent or nonexistent, or conditioned or unconditioned, is precisely to fall into the great abyss of absolutist belief (mthar 'dzin).

With regard to the Dwags po Bka' brgyud tradition that preserves the view and meditation of Amanasikāra and the sects of [Mahā]mudrā followers known as Amanasikāra [advocates] (a ma na si ba), many people such as Gro lung chen po who was beyond rival in the world of masters of knowledge, as well as Sa paṇ and Tsong [kha pa], Bo dong Phyogs rgya ba and others said that the methods of preserving view and meditation characteristic of this tradition do not go beyond the method of accessing the enduring reality (gnas lugs kyi don) by means of mental nonengagement [according to the system] of Heshang.

Now, according to the system of Heshang gleaned from the limited [range of] ancient documents and chronicles from times past, the method of practicing view and meditation is as follows. In the midst of all external and internal phenomena, that factor of apprehending the beginningless mind (thog med kyi blo) as coemergent self and reality is not the ascertainment of emptiness by way of scripture, reasoning and instructions. Rather, claiming that merely not grasping any external and internal phenomena by means of conceptual thought constitutes the view and meditation of profound emptiness of mental nonengagement (yid la mi byed pa), he advocated this as the path of liberation and specified it as [his] tradition. In this way, in the midst of all external and internal phenomena, the grasping of beginningless mind as coemergent self and reality and, in short, the discursively grasped entities and the factor of grasping, are ascertained as emptiness which is specified as skillful means and discerning insight in the scriptures, reasoning and instructions of sūtras and tantras.

Finally, by virtue of there not being left behind any remainder of discursive elaborations and signs from the perspective of the insight which recognizes that [profound emptiness], despite its mere designations as “selfless”, “unreal”, “empty”, and “free from elaborations”, the abiding nature of all phenomena is described as profound emptiness and the like. When the great fetters of mental engagements thus naturally release themselves, the seeds that engender any concepts in language and thought are decomposed at the root and the emergence of all the sprouts manifesting as signs and concepts ceases. In this state of ineffability and nonconceptuality, when the discriminating insight or mental engagements involved in analysis are stilled, there is the unity of calm abiding and deep insight like a butter lamp unshaken by the wind. Hence, concerning the abiding condition, aren't these two systems of practicing view and meditation [Chan and Mahāmudrā] alike?

Hence, all phenomena comprising saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are nothing other than the basic reality (de kho na nyid) of mind. And since that has always been pure and not fabricated by anyone, it is spontaneously present. And since it remains indivisible with everything, it is undifferentiated. It is unadulterated by all imputations and deprecations such as existence and nonexistence. It is free from all stains such as subject and object. It is not an object of all that is constructed by the intellect such as verifications and refutations. It is beyond all eternalist and nihilist [extremes] such as [those imputed by] thought and language. It remains the essence of all teachings, the purport of the Buddhas. Although it is called “coemergent wisdom” or “dharmakāya,” it is not even obscured by nice labels such as these. It is describeed as “innate awareness,” “primordial awareness,” “natural awareness,” and “primal awareness”. It is the meaning of the subject matter of all the texts that formerly explained what is known as “mahāmudrā”. Precisely that, unceasing[ly present] as mere appearing, is the ground of dependent [arising]. Not found as anything, it is the ground of emptiness. Not dwelling separately, it is the ground of unity. Free from partial aspects, it is the all-inclusive ground.

This explains the category [of the abiding mode] in terms of its described aspects (ldog cha).

[Jo nang position:] Ultimate truth is without origination and destruction and unconditioned because it is beyond dependent [arising]. Conventional truth having the nature of origination and destruction is conditioned insofar as it depends upon causes and conditions. Of the pair saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, saṃsāra consisting in the three realms is contaminated insofar as it is thoroughly afflicted and comprised by the three or eight kinds of suffering.
Great nirvāṇa is well and truly beyond all suffering together with its causes; it is the uninterrupted, uncontaminated bliss supreme.

Of the two aspects of consciousness (rnam shes) and wisdom (ye shes), consciousness is something to be discarded and is similar to darkness, blackness and poison; it is conventional and self-empty (kun rdzob rang stong).

The self-manifesting of consciousness, being conventional, does not transcend the moments and sufferings of the three realms because [its] projections due to karman and afflictive emotions are of the nature of suffering. The self-manifesting of self-occurring wisdom, being ultimate, does transcend the moments and sufferings of the three realms because it is not produced by any causes and conditions and is uninterrupted bliss supreme that is devoid of suffering.

Among the two, buddha nature and adventitious stains, buddha nature is luminous dharmakāya because it is genuine coemergent spontaneity, indomitable and imperishable supreme joy, encompassing like the sky.

In this regard, it is said that there is a very great difference between the two truths, and between the pairs 'saṃsāra and nirvāṇa' and 'consciousness and wisdom', together with their respective self-manifestations. And even emptiness is two-fold: [1] there is the conventional emptiness that does not go beyond dependent arising and [2] the ultimate emptiness that does go beyond dependent arising. In this regard, [1] the first is phenomenal, adventitious, coreless, fictitious and deceptive because it is empty of its own intrinsic nature (rang rang ngo bos stong) [and thus] conventional emptiness. [2] The second is the immutable nature of phenomena and therefore a true nature, real and non-deceptive because it is not self-empty (rang gis mi stong) but it is empty of the conventional which is other than itself [and thus] ultimate emptiness.

[1] The first of these is self-empty (rang stong), phenomenal and conventional because it is never established as a fundamental abiding nature and therefore does not withstand critical assessment.

In general, within the triad of ground, path and fruition, the ground is all-ground wisdom, buddha nature, the fundamentally transformed state of all phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa because it is the ground for the cleansing of all the flaw aspects and the ground for the manifesting of all the quality aspects. As for that ground of the path, when it consists in the skillful means for making all the flaw aspects vanish and making all quality aspects manifest, it possesses the retinue of the two accumulations. Through the accumulation of wisdom, it dispels the obscurations that have shrouded the ever-enduring, primordially and spontaneously present qualities of the embodiment of reality (dharmakāya). And through the accumulation of virtue, it develops step by step the unprecedented qualities of the form embodiments (rūpakāya). As for fruition, the fruition of emancipation (bral 'bras) is the embodiment of reality (dharmakāya), [i.e.,] the ultimate embodiment of thusness (don dam de kho na nyid kyi sku), [while] the fruition of development (bskyed 'bras) is the form embodiments (rūpakāya), [i.e.,] the conventional embodiment of symbolic ascription (kun rdzob brda'i sku) because they are present as the excellence of [fulfilling] the aims of oneself and others.

In this way, dharmakāya, the ground that is free from stains, is naturally present potential, the expanse of reality that is thoroughly devoid of having all aspects, like a preexistent great treasure. The form embodiments consist in the potential that develops the seeds of development; they are newly developed by the roots of virtue. It is like a tree bearing fine fruits that did not exist before [but] gradually developed. Even these [form embodiments] depend on the naturally present potential.

In particular, among the four [aspects of] ground of the clearing process, what is to be cleared away, the clearing process and the fruition of the clearing process: [1] The ground of the clearing process is the quintessence of the all-ground wisdom (kun gzhi ye shes kyi snying po), the suchness possessing stains, which is like the sky shrouded by masses of clouds and like a jewel covered in mud. [2] The stains to be cleared away consist in the all-ground consciousness that clings to the sheath [in which it is ensconced] together with its attendant [factors], which is like clouds and swampy mire. [3] The path as a clearing process consists in the supreme means, together with attendant factors, of instantaneously making transmigration cease, which is like a wind that disperses cloud masses and a stream of water that rinses away the swampy muck. [4] The fruition of the clearing process is the primordially and spontaneously eternally-present, self-occuring wisdom of bliss and emptiness without transmigration that is the ground in which transmigration has instantaneously ceased, which is like the pure sky after cloud formations have dispersed and the fulfilment of desires (dgo dgu 'tshang ba) when one has obtained a stainless jewel.

Hence, following the authentic scriptures, reasonings and instructions taught by the Omniscient one [Dol po pa, the Jo nang] do not maintain that the stains to be relinquished and the purification process [that discloses] the ground of the clearing process are indivisibly one [and the same]. Moreover, it is said that ultimate causes and effects other than the conventional consist in emptiness having an objective reference and great compassion lacking an objective reference. And even these are the ultimate emptiness endowed with the excellence of all aspects (sarvākāravopetāśūnyatā) and forms that transcend matter and moments. It is described as an omnipresent undivided whole, as great imperishable bliss pervading the expanse of space, as the bliss of the two potencies [male and female] and as wisdom that transcends moments. These two aspects [of wisdom and bliss] are described as discerning insight (shes rab) and skillful means (thabs). They are Prajñāpāramitā and Great Vajradhara, and the corresponding female and male Great Seals. They are the Vajra Sun and Vajra Moon. They are the twelve truths and sixteen realities. They are the eighteen kinds of ultimate emptiness and sixteen kinds of compassions. They are the sixteen deities dwelling in these. They are the ultimate letters E and Vaṃ. As for their form, they are the Other (gzhan) and the Otherholder ('dzin pa gzhan). They are the Other means and insight and the Other wisdom.

In this way, with regard to ultimate causes and effects, although there is actually no difference in essence, because the way they become evident to individuals who have embarked on the path differs in terms of [apparent temporal progression of] earlier and later, and because there exist other aspects that resemble causes and effects, [aspirants must] first depend on a causal vehicle of emptiness and thereafter on a resultant vehicle of compassion. [The first] is said to be the conventional, the basis of emptiness that is empty in the sense of being selfempty (rang stong) that is described by terminology [referring to] its manifold aspects among the precious sūtra corpus such as 'emptiness', 'signlessness' and 'wishlessness', as well as 'non-elaboration', 'mental nonengagement', 'perfection of insight', 'beyond acceptance and rejection,' 'nature of phenomena' (dharmatā), 'expanse of phenomena' (dharmadhātu), and 'true basis of phenomena', 'flawlessness of phenomena', 'unmistaken suchness', 'nonextraneous suchness', 'limit of the real', 'unborn', 'unceasing', 'primordial peace', 'naturally thoroughly extinguished' (prakṛtiparinirvṛta), 'embodiment of reality' (dharmakāya), 'embodiment of intrinsic essence' (svābhāvikakāya) and so forth.

Moreover, in the middle wheel of the Buddha's teachings, the phenomena to be negated were primarily declared to the self-empty (rang stong) conventional that does not transcend dependent arising. The basis of negation is the other-empty (gzhan stong) ultimate that does transcend dependent arising. It is not the case that the basis of negation was never taught in the middle wheel of the Buddha's teachings. The precious tantra corpus taught the great supreme and immutable bliss using terminology [referring to its] manifold aspects such as joy, supreme joy, distinctive joy, and coemergent joy, and vajra attachment, fond attachment, and great desire, great anger, great delusion, great pride, great envy, great avarice, great life-force (mahājīva), great sentient being, vajra, seminal potency (bindu), thatness (tattva), gathering, vow, coemergent wisdom, great seal, primal buddha, Vajrasattva, the letters E and Vaṃ, and so forth.

Consequently, it was maintained that when emptiness as cause is emphasized, [we speak of] a cause-oriented vehicle (hetuyāna), but when great bliss as goal is emphasized, [we] speak of a goal-oriented vehicle (phalayāna). When the intention was to express the meaning of these in terms of their inseparable unity, there were statements such as “one is also not deluded in regard to their single meaning” and so forth. But when the meaning of these [two] was apprehended in terms of difference, [the teachings] described “six root downfalls if one discounts their reciprocal relationship”. In that regard, whereas the final meaning [and aim] (mthar thug gi don) was elucidated in Mantra[yāna], it was not elucidated in the Pāramitāyāna. And [thus] the differences between goal-attainment taking a short or long [time] from the standpoint of whether the skillful means for making that [final meaning and aim] manifest are profound or not profound and so on, was clearly described.

Furthermore, in general, when it comes to forging the unity (yuganaddha) of appearance and emptiness, there are two aspects: [1] the ultimate unity of appearance and emptiness and [2] the conventional unity of appearance and emptiness. Accordingly, these have many aspects such as the unity of appearance and emptiness of buddha nature versus the unity of appearance and emptiness of adventitious stains, the unity of appearance and emptiness of imagined and relative [natures] versus the unity of appearance and emptiness of the perfect [nature], the unity of appearance and emptiness of the outer and inner versus the unity of appearance and emptiness of other-emptiness (gzhan stong). Accordingly, there is the unity of appearance and emptiness of ground, path and goal, and the unity of appearance and emptiness of the ground of the clearing process, objects to be cleared, the clearing process and goal of the clearing process. In this [Jo nang system], on the one hand, that which constitutes the unity of appearance and emptiness of ultimate buddha nature is the only appearance-emptiness dyad that is not an object to relinquish. [On the other hand,] that which constitutes the unity of appearance and emptiness consisting in adventitious stains such as the aggregates and elements that are appropriated is exclusively the appearance and emptiness dyad is an object to relinquish.

[1] It is not true that the emptiness aspect of the conventional is ultimate, nor is it true that the appearance aspect of the ultimate is conventional;

[3] That ultimate which transcends dependent arising and has assumed the form of the conventional is precisely the meaning of the inseparability of the two truths;

It follows that merely recognizing the emptiness of these [saṃsāric and nirvāṇic phenomena] is not wisdom, is not dharmakāya and is not mahāmudrā because, regarding these, the characteristics of this and that [thing] is not sufficient [to qualify as mahāmudrā etc.]. Now, let us suppose that when by beholding any afflictive emotions that arise one recognizes them to be without nature, the very objects to be relinquished have become [their own] antidote without having to seek anything on the side of antidotes. Should you think “this is the inseparability of objects to be cleared away and the clearing process,” this only remains captivating so long as one has not closely investigated the matter. If, however, one does investigate it properly, then the understanding that emotions have no nature is included on the side of the antidotes of the emotions, but it is not the case that it is not different from the emotions. The afflictive emotions that had arisen previously and the subsequent insight that understands them to be without nature are different from the standpoint of time, different from the standpoint of essence, and different from the standpoint of function.

[Padma dkar po's Refutation of the Jo nang view:]

[I have] herein distilled the essence of the [Jo nang] doctrinal system as it was presented in many treatises. If we critically assess this [system], the “emptiness endowed with the excellence of all aspects” (sarvākāravopetāśūnyatā) was [in tantric contexts] posited in terms of conventional truth. This is attested in both the Kālacakra and the Guhyasamāja. Because it can appear directly to ordinary people, it is merely conventional. This emptiness endowed with the excellence of all aspects also does not become a foundation of other-emptiness (gzhan stong) because it has been explained as being akin to the manifestations of the eight signs [in the six-limbed yoga practice]. This [emptiness endowed with the excellence of all aspects] is an analogy for the illusory [character of the manifestations]. Since our Buddha has described [this] illusion as an analogy for essenceless conditioned [phenomena] that are unreal, these scriptural citations and your Buddha are not in agreement.

Also, the so-called “ultimate which transcends moments” is inadmissible because it contradicts what was posited in the first [of those] authentic [sources, i.e., Kālacakra], namely, that “supreme and immutable bliss (paramācalasukha) is twenty-one thousand and six hundred moments.” That which “transcends dependent arising” which is described as “supreme and immutable” was [actually] addressed in the context of the twelve limbs [of dependent arising]. According to the commentary that is a Summary of Yoga [i.e., the Vimalaprabhā on the Kālacakra], because saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are posited as dependently existent, by establishing them as interdependent, what ultimate truth is there beyond nirvāṇa? Since it is explained in the great commentary to the synopsis (mdor bsdus) of the Summary of Yoga [Vimalaprabhā] that even a buddha's wisdom is without intrinsic essence, in what way can an ultimate other-emptiness (gzhan stong) be established?

This doctrinal position of yours has assumed a nihilist view vis-à-vis all that is [held to be] self-empty (rang stong) or conventional (kun rdzob) [but] an eternalist view in accepting all that is ultimate to be something real. Because it is thereby incompatible with the impartial explanations concerning the ultimate (don dam) found in both the Synopsis of Views of the chapter on Inner [Kālacakra] and the Summary of Yoga [i.e., Vimalaprabhā], it is not at all admissable.

Further, by deviating [in this way, you] have also not dispensed with the flaw of contradicting the source [texts] because one to whom there appear these aspects of saṃsāra may assume “these are saṃsara and are incompatible with nirvāṇa.” Hence, it is necessary to demonstrate, in the case of establishing that there is no flaw of contradiction, that those [two factors you regard as] incompatible from the standpoint of identity (gcig la ltos nas) are found to not be incompatible from the standpoint of identity. Like the statement from the tantra that “although aspects of smoke appear, it is not smoke”, inasmuch as [it occurs] in separation from the effects of natural fire, in this [position of yours], there is no [basis] to establish that there is no flaw of contradiction.

The explanation of the cause of the form embodiments as newly emergent is a major mistake because according to the illustrious root tantras and commentaries, in the case of settling [the mind] on [saṃ]bhoga[kāya] and nirmaṇa[kāya], since [a] is “the principal [seed] syllable, of great benefit” and various material and immaterial [phenomena] are established by [such] forms, it would be], it would be lovely [if] the Kālacakra explained such [causes of form embodiments] as newly emergent.

Moreover, those who talk about “recognizing the nature of emotions” explain that during the very appearing of emotions, one should recognize them to be without nature. Were that not so, then what would be the point of determining whether or not they are [recognized as they are] in and by self-awareness itself? Therefore, [this insight] will never feature in the opponents' position. [Rather,] thinking that “the Gzhan stong of this tradition is proclaimed within the [tantric] trilogy of [Bodhisattva] commentaries,” they make false accusations, not seeing that it is legitimate to criticize [their position] even by recourse to scriptures of the Vehicle of Characteristics (Lakṣaṇayāna).

[Query:] What, then, is the ground, the path and the goal in your own tradition? [Reply:] The actual abiding condition is subdivided into two: [1] the abiding mode of reality of the body and [2] the abiding mode of reality of the mind. Of these [1] since the abiding mode of reality of the body has been posited in the context of error, it possesses adventitious stains. [2] As for the abiding mode of reality of the mind, it is that purity itself, being primordially pure, which is, from this perspective, “natural purity” (rang bzhin gyis dag pa) as it is known in common parlance. Although not established, even as something adventitious, neither in essence nor manifestation, it [nonetheless] appears in essence and manifestation and is accordingly described in these terms. As examples, it is similar to what, in a thangka painting, appears to be in relief, with protruding [foreground] and receding [background], or like a [white] conch that appears to be yellow to one afflicted with bile disease [such as jaundice]. This yellowness is not established either in the essence of the conch shell or the manifestation of the conch shell, and yet there are causes for something to appear to one afflicted with bile disease and also reasons why the ailment clears [when] the methods to progressively alleviate it [are applied].

<d e="2">
[Query:] Then how could there be yellowness in the essence and manifestation of the conch? [Reply:] Since it does not exist in the visual cognition (mthong rigs pa) of one who does not have the disease, it is like that [because] it may appear as error if not understood [as it is]—as in [the example of] not seeing [the white conch]—and manifests as dharmakāya if it is understood. As to the definiendum [i.e., that which exemplifies a definition] (mtshan gzhir) of both of these, a conceptual construct is grasped as what that really is. It is like grasping the very conch that is imputed as yellow as the definiendum, both in seeing the conch as yellow and not seeing the conch as yellow. Moreover, at the time the sky has clouds, it has not changed from [when it was] unobscured because, if it was altered, then it would not be able to become cloudless [again]. In that way, just as it is demonstrated that the sky remains unchanging from its own side (rang ngos nas), though the ways of seeing it change, so also since there is no error within the adamantine [nature] of mind (sems kyi rdo rje) in its own right (rang ngos la), error does not exist in the ground. If error existed in the nature, one would not be able to clear [what obscures it], just as charcoal cannot be turned white, even when it is cleansed with streams of milk.

In this regard, one should understand that since it is nothing but an erroneous superimposition on an error-free ground [or basis], it is adventitious, and that saṃsāra [thus] appears while remaining nonexistent. Because this theory has been explained [elsewhere] in many answers [to quandaries], it will not be discussed beyond what is given in the present context. In terms of this [ground] itself, in the context of [it] being taken like [something] mutable, it is the abiding mode of reality of the body and posited as conventional truth. In the context of seeing is as immutable, it is the abiding mode of reality of the mind and posited as ultimate truth. At the time this ground [seems] to have undergone change, it has not [actually] turned bad. At the time it is understood as changeless, it has not become good. Since it therefore remains just as it is, there is no reason to distinguish between the two truths. This is presented as the “inseparability of the two truths”.

THREE GRAMMATICAL INTERPRETATIONS OF AMANASIKĀRA (excerpt)

gang kun nas 'dzin pa de gnas gzhi'o /

zhes 'byung /
</d>
<d e="2">
The meaning of the term yid la mi byed pa has been explained in three ways:
[1] First, the letter i of the si in amanasikāra signifies the seventh case [i.e., locative] particle, viz., the [Tibetan] la in the locution yid la [meaning “in the mind”]. This seventh [locative case] is designated with an inflection denoting a locus (gnas gzhi'i rkyen). As a grammatical sūtra [Kalāpasūtra] states:

That which is apprehended is called a “locus”.
</d>
</f>
<f>
<d e="1">
de ltar gnas gzhi can gyi don de thog ma'i a yig gis bkag pas / a ma na si kā ra zhes pa / gang du dmigs pa'i gnas sam rten gzhi med pa la bya dgos par shes te / sdom 'byung las

yid med yid ni byas nas su / /
cung zad tsam yang mi bsam mo / /

zhes gsungs so / /
</d>
<d e="2">
Therefore, that sense of “having a locus [or foundation]” is negated by the first letter a, and so the term amanasikāra must be known [here] to imply “the absence of any locus or founding basis for perceiving anything” (gang du dmigs pa'i gnas sam rten gzhi med pa). According to the Saṃvarodaya 33.4:

Relying on existents devoid of existence,
One deals with existents devoid of foundation.
Engaging the mind that is without mentation (yid med yid),
One does not think anything at all.
</d>
</f>
<f>
<d e="1">

de la 'jog par byed pa dang / yang dag par 'jog par byed pa la ni bsgrims te 'jug pa'i yid la byed pa yod do / zhes pa'o / /
</d>
<d e="2">
What is hereby negated is a mental fixation that is restrictive (sems 'dzin dam por byed) due to being tightly focused on an objective reference by means of a mode of apprehension ('dzin stangs) belonging to the mental factor of mental engagement (manasikāra), even though this may be necessary in the context of establishing an ordinary state of tranquility (thun mong gi zhi gnas). Moreover, Asaṅga stated [in the Śrāvakabhūmi] “here, fixation ('jog pa) and thorough fixation (yang dag par 'jog pa) are mental engagements involving forced application (bsgrim ste 'jug pa'i yid la byed pa : balavāhano manaskāraḥ)”.

zhes sems byung sems pa'i 'dzin pa'i 'dzin stangs la nan tan du byed pa de dgag pa'o / /
</d>
<d e="2">
[2] Second, when amanasikāra is rendered as a [genitive] tatpuruṣa compound such that the i of the seventh [locative case is omitted], then the term yid byed pa [manaskāra] renders the second explanation [i.e., genitive form of the tatpuruṣa] such that the particle i [la] is not presented [i.e., is deleted]. In that case, its meaning is glossed as “mental inaction” (yid mi byed pa : amanaskāra) where it is “activity of ego-mind” (yid kyi las) that is here claimed to be the object of negation. As the Abhi[dharmakośa] 4.1c states:

[What is the “mental activity”?] Intentionality is mental activity.

[Here], what is negated is the purposive application (nan tan du byed pa) pertaining to the mode of apprehension that is a grasping belonging to the mental factor of intentionality (sems pa : cetanā).

As for the mental factor of intentionality, it consists in “notional construction [or constitution] by the mind (sems mngon par 'du byed pa : cittābhisaṃskāra), i.e., mental activity” . According to that [account in the Abhidharmasamuccaya]:

It has the function of directing the mind toward wholesome, unwholesome or neutral activities.

[Here,] it is notional construction (abhisaṃskāra) of the object that is negated. While it may [help] establish tranquility, like in the case of the eight notional constructs (saṃskāra) that eliminate the five faults (doṣa), mahāmudrā is said to be free from such construction and thus karma does not accumulate. And [as Saraha states in Dohākoṣagīti]:

I don't accept or reject the coming and going [of thoughts].

And the Hevajra [I.8.44a] states:

[The whole world should indeed be contemplated]
Such that it is not contemplated by mentation.

Thus, it is said [in the Dohākoṣagīti]

Due to mentation, that [single nature] has an objective reference.

Having here posited that everything that functions as mental activity has an objective reference, it is definitively shown that all [such] intentional objects are to be completely pacified. This has been eloquently explained by the Teacher in the following quotation [from the Jñānālokālaṃkāra (JĀA)]:

Homage to you who is without imagined thoughts,
Whose mind has no foundation whatsoever,
Who is beyond mindfulness, and not mentally engaged, And who is without objective reference.

[3] Third, when the a in the term amanasikāra is a prefix, the vowel a [can be] taken in the sense of nonorigination (anutpāda = skye ba med pa) while manasikāra is [then] explained as mental engagement (yid la byed pa). In this case, the letter a signifies a “well-founded” (yoniśaḥ) mental engagement (tshul bzhin du yid la byed pa : yoniśomanaskāra) and may [thus] be glossed as a yid la byed pa, ['bringing to mind [the foundation (yoniḥ)] a', i.e., nonorigination]. Moreover, in that case, the intermediary mi ['non-'] is not presented, in the same way that the “king fond of greens” (lo ma la dga' ba'i rgyal po : śākapriyaḥ pārthivaḥ) is [truncated to] “king greens (lo ma'i rgyal po : śākapārthiva).” Here, the a refers to the perfection of insight (shes rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa : prajñāpāramitā). [The syllable a thus has] the capacity to show all the quasi-synonyms of nonduality such as nonorigination, noncessation and so forth by way of such expressions as anutpanna and anirodha. According to the [Mañjuśrī]nāmasaṃgīti [5.1cd]

A is foremost among all the letters (akāra).
It is of great significance, it is the supreme vowel (akṣara),
Of great creative power, yet unoriginated.

And so it continues.

As it says in the great commentary on the [Mañjuśrī]nāmasaṃgīti 4.1:

According to the Way of Mantras, there are two [factors]: discerning insight and skillful means. Their unity is 'nonduality' because the intrinsic essence of supreme bliss in which there is no duality between insight and means is claimed to be nondual. So it is [said].
According to the Way of Pāramitās, as long there are vacillations of mind [between] subject and object, I and mine, knower and known, there will be dualism in all these [cases]. The selflessness of all phenomena, free from all vacillations and devoid of discursive elaborations, is the essence of nonduality; it arises as spiritual embodiments (sku) having as their very being the nature of phenomena. It thereby arises as nonduality. Because its arising as a nonduality is distinguished in particular by the aspect of nonorigination, it is described as “having the quality of nonorigination.”

Let us analyze this: in our view, the ascertainment of things as they really are depends solely on realizing the mode of abiding through direct perception (mngon sum du rtogs pa) because it transcends the path of words of others and is never within dualistic mind's sphere of operations. Thus, when it comes to expressing what the content (don) of this realization through direct perception is like, even all the buddhas of the three times are at a loss for words. But when it comes to putting this in language while preserving its meaning, it is said to be “free from assertions”. [In other words,] because all explanations of doxographical viewpoints apart from that [direct realization] are established through intellectual imputation, none can withstand analysis by means of reasoning. If, to that extent, there is no difference from Heshang, then since [the following] was said by the Noble Ācārya [Nāgārjuna] father and sons concerning the occasion when all [metaphysical] views have been overcome, it would follow that they are not different from Heshang either. On the occasion of having overturned all views, the eminent teacher [Nāgārjuna] father and son stated [Mūlamadhyamakakārikā XIII.7‒8]:

If something non-empty existed,
Then something empty might also exist. But something non-empty does not exist, So how could emptiness exist?

Emptiness is declared by the victors to be The purgative of all [metaphysical] views. But those for whom emptiness is a view
Are declared to be incurable.
And as is stated in [Nāgārjuna's Vigrahavyāvartanī 29]: If I had some thesis,
That fault would apply to me.
But since I have no thesis,
There is indeed no fault for me.

In this regard, why was there a debate between the Ācārya Kamalaśīla who adhered to this line of thought and the Chinese Heshang? [This] is something you should think about. You may think “these [accounts] are not similar because the Ācārya [Nāgārjuna] father and sons said these things in the context of reasoning that analyzes the ultimate, whereas you do not have any analysis through reasoning.” But how could that be the case? The Ācāryas uttered these words in the context of reasoning that analyzes the ultimate. Since we as well utter these words in the context of ascertaining the ultimate, how are they not alike? Since that reasoning that analyzes the ultimate is precisely [our] method of ascertaining the ultimate as well, what is the difference between these two?

[Opponent:] Let us grant that you alone do not have faults since you maintain things in that way. But such was not the case with [your] predecessors. [Response:] How can that be correct? According to Rje btsun Mi la [ras pa]:

When it comes to ascertaining the view,
For a completely perfect buddha,
Not [to mention] an ignorant person like me,
It is like the joy of a mute woman or young girl. Apart from merely gesturing toward it,
How would [anyone] be able to show this?

And he stated that:

Those who take platitudes as the truth
I do not see as being in accord with the truth.

[Mi la] said [these things]—it is just that you yourself have not seen or heard them. While not understanding the tradition of others, you nonetheless found it necessary to bear the burden of criticizing [them]. Is it because you received an injunction by a Chinese emperor [to do so]?

Further, some people who have not considered the matter properly, even if they grant that the view is like that [outlined above], say there is no difference between the styles of meditation and conduct [vis-à-vis Mahāmudrā and Heshang teachings]. Heshang claimed that when one has abandoned all virtuous activities of body and speech, one recognizes the mind by simply not thinking at all and thereby becomes free. We, on the other hand, first abandon all preoccupations and distractions in order to attain stability in tranquility (zhi gnas), also known as one-pointed mind (cittekagrata) or nonconceptuality (nirvikalpa) or signlessness (animitta). But if one loses oneself in this state, it is regarded as a deviation (gol sa). Still, if one does not have even that [one-pointed tranquility], there will be no basis for accomplishing the accumulation of wisdom. Therefore, it is indispensable. One proceeds to cultivate all possible skillful means such as great compassion and so on and discerning insight by way of the unity (yuganaddha) of emptiness and compassion in which both [virtue and wisdom] are united. These arise and one directly recognizes the mind. It is explained that through such profound insight, the whole range of things to be relinquished are relinquished, [everything] up to and including omniscient wisdom is thereby realized. So how could there be no difference [between our approach and that ascribed to Heshang]? This cannot be the case, but if you still think there is no difference, then let us [simply] offer the prayer “May your wishes be fulfilled.”

It is not the case that this account is not explained in the sūtras. According to the
Samādhirāja:

Once the wise know the conditioned and unconditioned
So that all conceptions based on discursive signs are destroyed, They abide in signlessness and thereby
Fully understand that all phenomena are empty.

And the [Prajñāpāramitā]sañcaya[gāthā] states:

[One who] with insight fully understands the nature of phenomena
And completely transcends the three realms without exception,
Is a supreme leader of men who, setting the precious wheel in motion,
Teaches the dharma to living beings in order to end their suffering.

And the [Mahā]vairocanābhisaṃbodhi[tantra] states:

If one trains in acquiring skillful means and insight, One will discover the unsurpassed vehicle –

[Query:] You say that “at the time of nonconceptual realization one does not dwell on the past, does not speculate about the future, and does not dissect the present; one does not intentionally contemplate anything; one doesn't even think only of emptiness. Rather, one lets mind settle naturally on its own.” According to Heshang: [“our religious tradition consists in] awakening to buddhahood by simply recognizing the mind after having cultivated nonconceptuality because one does not awaken to buddhahood through a dharma that consists of performing deeds (bya byed kyi chos). It is called the “Self-sufficient White Remedy” (dkar po chig thub) because it is a religion of “descending from above” (yas babs), like a garuḍa (khyung nam mkha') descending from the sky onto a tree top.”
[Reply:] If you think there is no difference between these accounts: given that the validation of tranquility meditation on signlessness is that one has abandoned all activities, you are just quibbling over mere words. In this regard, according to the Madhyamakopadeśa of Jo bo rje [Atiśa]:

Awareness does not think anything, does not grasp anything, and has abandoned all mindfulness and mental engagement.

Since [Atiśa] stated [this], he must be no different from Heshang. Therefore, you also would be an adherent of Heshang's system because being a follower of Jo bo [Atiśa], you automatically accept [his teachings] without argument.

Moreover, [on your account,] all the stages of meditation of the profound yoga of signlessness in tantras such as the Kālacakra and all the stages of meditation in sūtras that teach the authentic path of tranquility would be no different from [the meditation] of Heshang.

[Query:] What, then, was the controversy really about? [Reply:] Whereas Heshang [sought] to perpetually abandon bodily and verbal activities, we cultivate tranquility, not for all times, but only until we have grown acclimatized to it once it has arisen. Moreover, [according to Bodhicaryāvatāra 8.4cd]:

One should first seek tranquility, and that is
Joyfully accomplished by one who is free from worldly ties. As is also stated in the Vimalaprabhā[ṭīkā]:
The thieves of indecision,
Guilt, torpor, sloth and agitation,
Have entered the dark [house] of the relatives, And plundered this precious, auspicious path.

That tranquility is the well-founded mental engagement (tshul bzhin yid la byed pa). [According to the Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra:]

Thus, when one attains great serviceability [of]
Body and mind though that [tranquility]
It is known as “having mental engagement”.

Therefore, how could this be a “neutral state” as you assume? In another instance it is stated that even if worldly people meditate on emptiness they are unable to thereby reverse the belief in entities. [As the Samādhirājasūtra explains:]

[Although worldly people cultivate samādhi,
They do not destroy the conception of self.]
Their afflictive emotions fully reassert themselves.
Udraka cultivated samādhi in this way.

If one does not understand selflessness, one will be unable to destroy the belief in entities. Therefore, it was stated [by Sa paṇ] that “meditation on emptiness is a cause of saṃsāra and lower destinies.” That said, according to the Ācārya Saraha [Dohākoṣagīti]:

By meditating on compassion alone, 
One stays here in saṃsāra and will not attain liberation.

If one does not understand both [kinds of] selflessness [of persons and phenomena], one is unable to destroy the belief in entities. Hence, one would also have to say that “meditation on compassion is a cause of saṃsāra and lower destinies” because in the same way that meditation on emptiness is mistaken if one does not understand the two [kinds of] selflessness, the same holds true for compassion. For, doesn't one cultivate compassion as well?

In that regard, people who do not understand selflessness—being separated from the skillful means of compassion and discerning insight of emptiness—remain separated from accumulating stores of merit and knowledge. Therefore, an occasion for them to realize the two kinds of selflessness is impossible. The [Prajñāpāramitā]sañcaya[gāthā] states:

So long as one has not completed the two accumulations,
One will not realize the true emptiness.

Also, as the Jñānasiddhi [of Indrabhūti] states, Whenever there is deluded meditation,
One attains delusion by means of delusion.

This was mentioned [in Sa paṇ's view] because “certain methods of settling the mind in an uncontrived state have been explained as 'deluded meditation'.” In that way, thinking that such persons had succumbed to [this] 'deluded meditation', [he] refuted them. But what is the use of applying this to [all] the others? [According to this logic,] since within the practice of ethics, certain violations ('chal pa) are mentioned, you would take all [cases of] ethical observance as violations. Moreover, those who are so paranoid about failings such as pitfalls and deviations (shor gol) take pride in criticizing us. Since even I maintain this is this case, you may as well rashly say whatever you please.

The claim that [the Bka' brgyud meditation] is not the Mantrayāna Mahāmudrā meditation since it is the Prajñāpāramitā meditation should likewise be rejected. Why? Because [our meditation] is precisely the yoga spanning day and night which belongs to the withdrawal (pratyāhāra) phase of Mahāmudrā meditation as described in the Kālacakra. As a Prajñāpāramitā sūtra states,

One who unites with space is one who unites with perfection of wisdom. One who unites with the unsurpassed is one who unites with the perfection of wisdom.

The great sages of India [such as Nāropa] claimed that [Mahāmudrā meditation] was taught in precisely this way [i.e., in line with Prajñāpāramitā]. Now, please tell me how settling the mind in equipoise can be an enemy, let alone the other [i.e., transcendent] path of Great Mantra? If single-pointed mind is not attained, the Generation Stage also goes awry and one cannot elicit its potential. Isn't it explained in the Aṣṭasāhasrikā [Prajñāpāramitā]?

<d e="2">
Moreover, given that our four yogas and [those of] the Alīkākāravādins are only nominally similar, how can they be [considered] the same? Since, according to above discussions, [Mahāmudrā meditation] was extensively explained as being nonamenable to invaliddation, or as unity (yuganaddha), or as coemergent wisdom (sahajajñāna), this also undermines the claim that it is exclusively a sūtric path. Since in the sūtras, the basic teachings are shown concisely, whereas in the tantras [their] hidden meanings are extensively explained, there is also no [fundamental] difference concerning [their respective] stages of the path.

Concerning [our] explanation of the term amanasikāra, [you have alleged] that it contradicts authoritative scripture like the statement in the Caryāmelāpakapradīpa: “Here, regarding explanations [given in] canonical texts, when one follows only the sense of terms based on the previous renderings of words and meanings according to grammatical analysis, [one does not thereby know how and why what is expressed by the syllable [a] actually applies.]” etc. [As for your allegation that] “taking it as an object of the mode of apprehending emptiness in equipoise, you correlate it with claims about meditation”. This commits neither of two faults of reasoning because [1] that [above] quotation refutes the clinging to the Sanskrit language [and thus losing sight of the deeper meaning], and [2] the meaning of the syllable [given] in the Four Explanations [on the History of Grammatical Writings] would otherwise not make sense.

In the latter case, it does not constitute [a fallacy of reasoning] because the meaning of that term [amanasikāra] as “not mentally engaging in the unfounded” means precisely “to mentally engage in the well-founded”. And, in that regard, not seeing any strands of hairs in the sky is precisely the correct seeing, whereas the strands of hair and so forth are said to be due to the influence of vitreous floaters. Unfounded mental engagement is ignorance (ma rig pa); well-founded mental engagement is personally realized self-awareness (so so rang rig). In this context, ignorance means conceptualizing. According to a Caryātantra [Virūpa's Suniṣprapañcatattvopadeśa]:

Divisive conceptualizing is great ignorance;
It makes one sink into the ocean of saṃsāra.

In this regard, meditation based on conceptualizing and the discriminating analysis of emptiness is that of the śrāvakas. [In the case of] the Mahāyāna path, the [Mahāyāna]sūtrālaṃkāra [19.52] states:

Wisdom that perceives suchness is
Meditation without differentiated aspects.
Direct perception of what exists and does not exist
Is called the mastery over conceptualization.

The commentary on this [Vasubandhu's Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkārabhāsya] states:

It is “meditation without differentiated aspects” because no differentiation is seen between signs and suchness. This shows well what distinguishes (viseṣaḥ) the signlessness of bodhisattvas from the signlessness of śrāvakas. For, those (te hi) [śrāvakas], seeing signs and signlessness as different do not mentally engage in all the signs but mentally engage in the sphere of signlessness, and thus become absorbed in signlessness. However, bodhisattvas see even signs as signless by virtue of not seeing signs apart from suchness. Consequently, their wisdom consists in the “meditation without differentiated aspects”.

And, if nothing exists as a basis of analysis on the side of concepts and signs, then where would that [suchness] arise as an object of analysis which is either existent or nonexistent? According to the [Bodhicaryāvatāra 9.140ab]:

Having not contacted any conceptualized entity,
One does not apprehend the nonexistence of that.

When one recognizes the nature of conceptual thought,

When body and mind relax deeply and all the movements of mind and mental factors have come to rest, it is precisely through mental nonengagement wherein one does not think about anything at all that one lets mind rest uncontrivedly in its own nature, just as it is. But in case this does not last, one should take hold of mind by way of various skillful means so that thoughts are unable to go out to their objects. Then, since they are unable to do so, the thoughts of the six sense faculties will subside. When, by this method, thoughts dissipate in their expanse so that one distinguishes mind's clarity from its dregs, then the very essence of mind being free from all identifiable objects remains as pure [or clear] as the sky [or space].

Since one has thereby fully transcended verbal expression, intellectual thematization, and the objects of worldly meditation, it is called “making manifest the buddha's intent”. According to Maitrīpa [quoting the Laṅkāvatāra]:

So long as the mind is engaged,
There will be no end to the vehicles.
When mind as such is fully realized,
There are no vehicles and no freedom [either].

There doesn't exist any so-called “liberation” apart from this. By ascertaining the single exalted state of liberation, the path one travels to reach it is also just this uncontrived path of mental nonengagement because other [paths] do no transcend conceptual meditation. Moreover according to venerable Nāgārjuna:

Because the dharmadhātu is indivisible,
The main vehicle is not divisible [either].
The three vehicles were taught by you
In order to mobilize sentient beings.

[In sum,] the three vehicles were taught extensively in order to make [others] realize the intended goal of pondering emptiness in its conceptual and nonconceptual [aspects]. As for what is termed “mental nonengagement,” some have viewed it as the stupefied meditation of an impaired mind. But apart from the cessation of mental engagements involving the apprehended [object] and apprehending [subject], how could it constitute the [complete] cessation of mind? Likewise, the expression “the king's mistress does not see the sun” does not [imply] a negation [of the existence] of the sun.

In common with lower tenets[14] the Buddhist Middle [Way School] accepts that “I” or “self,” etc., grasped entirely by the innate “I”-grasping[15] has never existed at all. Thus, it is free from the extreme of existence. Moreover, since no existent “self” was ever made nonexistent by the power of reasoning or another cause of destruction, it is free from the extreme of non-existence as well[16].

Why is “self” non-existent? Because “self” is not found through the five reasonings searching for it as being one with skandhas[17], different from them, etc.[18] The acceptance drawn from such reasoning is common for all Buddhists[19]. Nevertheless the Saṃmitya school explains [selflessness] by applying characteristics of permanence and impermanence[20].

Śrāvaka schools[21] accept to a small extent the way of eliminating the extremes [of the view of] “self of phenomena”[22] in following way. Since any kind of generally characterized phenomena[23] has never existed from the beginning it is free from the extreme of existence. Although existent for mistaken mind it nevertheless is not made nonexistent by pure reasoning or another cause. Thus it is also free from extreme of non-existence[24].

Mahāyāna has two schools: Cittamātra and [Madhyamaka, the latter being] the pinnacle of the four tenets. Using as the basis the way of eliminating the two extremes common with Śrāvakas, Cittamātra also eliminates the extreme of existence [by accepting that] with the exception of one's own mind (which is the creator of appearances), no external objects, from [the grossest compounds] to the finest particles, have ever existed. Since in this elimination of extremes nothing is ever made non-existent by such tools as reasoning, etc., Cittamātra also eliminates the extreme of nonexistence. Upon such elimination “the middle” is all paths characterized by these methods of eliminating the two extremes regarding objective phenomena and persons.

Both Proponents of Phenomenal Existence,[25] Cittamātra and Śrāvaka schools, eliminate the two extremes not only during cultivation of the view but also during the practices of the action. So, while accumulating the collection of merit through practices of the action[26], Cittamātra followers do not accept the existence of external objects. Whereas followers of Vaibhāṣika [with Sautrāntika accept that] everything existent is established as substance and do not accept imputedly existent phenomena.

Since the first accepts that neither objective nor subjective things have ever existed, as it is taught in Dharmas of Maitreya[28], the Yogācāra [viewpoint] refutes the extreme of existence. Also since the Yogācāra school accepts that phenomena are not made non-existent either by pure reasoning or by other causes and conditions, it eliminates the extreme of non-existence. Justification for the Yogācāra elimination of both extremes is given as such: accepting that a thing which was previously existent can become non-existent is abiding in the extreme of non-existence [as well as the extreme of existence. For example,] when previously existent wealth is later exhausted, worldly individuals accept that it is non-existent. Thus they abide in extremes of both eternalism and nihilism.

“The middle” in this tradition is that which is free from both extremes of objectivity and subjectivity or [in other words,] selfluminous self-awareness. Since this tradition does not accept any phenomena except dharmadhātu, it is greatly distinguished from Cittamātra[29].

Proponents of Entitylessness eliminate the extreme of existence on the grounds [of their understanding] that all ultimate and conventional objects of knowledge have never existed. They eliminate the extreme of non-existence on the basis that there can be nothing previously existent which was made non-existent either by reasoning or by the knowledge-seeing of āryas[30]. Since nothing has ever existed, they eliminate the extreme of both existence and non-existence. Since the basis of dependence, “being both,” cannot exist, dependent phenomenon, “not being both,” also cannot be accepted[31]. If phenomena, which are not dependently established, are accepted, they won't go beyond being truly existent.[32]
It is clear that all the above explained ways of eliminating the extreme of non-existence express the meaning of sūtra extensively quoted by Great Madhyamikas[33]: “Emptiness doesn't make phenomena empty. Phenomena themselves are empty,” etc.

Later Tibetans[34] say: “Since phenomena exist conventionally, the extreme of non-existence is eliminated. Since they don't exist truly, the extreme of existence is eliminated.” This view doesn't accord with authentic words[35] because it indicates an absence of understanding that, at the time of the cultivation of the view, conceptions grasping at existence have to be abandoned. This view overemphasizes conventions as well. Also, if the extreme of being both is not eliminated it will contradict the authentic words, and if it is eliminated it will mean a direct contradiction in the assertions [of these later Tibetan authors][36].

“But if extremes of existence and non-existence have to be eliminated [in the way used by the Proponents of Entitylessness, there will be no Path whatsoever because] there cannot exist a Path aside from those [extremes].” This is [the speculation of the Śrāvaka schools, the Cittamātra school and the Yogācāra Madhyamaka school. Each of these schools accepts the respective types of wisdom of meditative equipoise and subsequent attainment left as a remainder after the elimination of the respective types of the two extremes known to its tenets. This is [accepted as] the Middle Path because it is the [negation's]remainder, which doesn't abide in either of the two extremes and opens the opportunity for bringing an individual to the state of liberation.[37]
For the Proponents of Entitylessness, the Middle Path cannot be identified as “such and such” at the time of the identification of their own Madhyamaka view, because at that time there cannot exist any object of knowledge which wouldn't become an extreme. [Such “objects of knowledge” can be anything] accepted by worldly individuals and Proponents of Phenomenal Existence, as abiding in a mutually exclusive way, for example, existent and non-existent, being and not-being, long and short, etc.

So, at the time of engaging in thinking about the [ultimate] mode of abiding, non-affirming negative, which is free from abiding in anything at all, is [later]called “the middle,” and the non-abiding of any subjective mind in any object is [later] called “abiding in the ‘middle’.” As it is said: “The absence of abiding is abiding...” Also: “Sentient beings utter words such as, ‘I see the space.’ Analyse this meaning in the same way as ‘seeing the space’.”
This also has to be preceded by valid cognition produced from pure reasoning known to Prāsaṅgika or Svatāntrika schools[38]. Otherwise, as it is explained by scholar Kamalaśila, it would not be a tradition of Nāgārjuna.
In Madhyamaka of the pinnacle of all vehicles[39], the Middle Path left as remainder after the elimination of the two extremes is to be experienced only by the primordial mind of self-awareness and is beyond the reach of sounds and concepts. In this tradition the view which is accessed through the severing of superimpositions[40] by listening and thinking and the view experienced through meditation are identified separately, as it is taught in the Vajrapañjara [ - Vajra Tent] and the Kālacakra [- Wheel of Time] Tantras[41].

Some Madhyamikas say that the emptiness which is non-affirming negative is not Madhyamaka. As the source [for their view] they cite the scripture: “Emptiness in which skandhas are severed is essenceless like a plantain tree.” Some say that tire first ones are not Madhyamikas, quoting as the proof: “... since it does not withstand forces of analysis it is false.” Nevertheless both approaches[46] are taught in authentic scriptural sources, and for them to be the basis of limitless positive qualities, the first one is indispensable. Also, if the first type of emptiness[47] is accepted to be the false truth[48], it will follow that it is phenomenon polluted by ignorance[49]. On the other hand, if emptiness which is non-affirming negative is not established by reasons explained in the Collection of Reasoning[50], it will be difficult to abandon conceptual minds grasping at signs. As it is said:
“When suchness is not known, thoughts fancying saṃsāra and nirvāṇa arise. If suchness is seen, there are no thoughts fancying saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.”
Here, the first Madhyamaka approach removes the extreme of underestimation and the second approach removes the extreme of overestimation.
When this [viewpoint of Madhyamaka is understood, other divisions of Madhyamaka can also be presented in the following way: the Madhyamaka whose approach is based on the entitylessness of all phenomena, the Madhyamaka in whose approach thoroughly established phenomena[51] are proclaimed as entity, and Madhyamaka of the Supreme Secret Mantra. The first is the Collection of Reasoning (rigs tshogs lnga) with [the commentaries of] its followers. The second is the Dharmas of Maitreya with [the commentaries of] their followers. The last one is shown by names of “Union of Hevajra”[ - Pleased Vajra], “Cakrasathvara”[ - Wheel of Supreme Bliss][52], etc. It will be explained below.

As it was said: “Four hundred years after my nirvāṇa ...” etc.[53], it is generally accepted that initially the tradition of Madhyamaka treatises was pioneered by the Protector Nāgārjuna. Nevertheless, besides him, a short time before, the Great Brahmin, the Glorious Saraha[54], in a form of singing a song, composed a Madhyamaka treatise whose topic was the mind-vajra free from [conceptual] analysis. The account of his lineage holders and the pioneers [of his tradition] who came after him is clarified elsewhere, so I don't have to write it here.

Madhyamaka, as explained in that treatise, is identified in the following words: “Only mind itself is the seed of everything. I prostrate to the mind from which saṃsāra and nirvāṇa emanate, which is like a wish-fulfilling gem that grants the accomplishment of desires”[55] It has the same meaning as the following quotation [from Abhidharmasūtra] used by Ārya Asaṅga[56] as the proof of mere basis of all[57] and the element of Sugata essence: “The sphere from beginningless time - it is the place of all phenomena. Since it exists, all migrations and the attainment of nirvāṇa as well are possible.” Its meaning is that very beginningless mind which is luminous by nature. It is called “primordial mind of dharmadhātu at the time of the basis.” Its synonyms are given as: causal tantra, element, sphere, source, and element of both sentient beings and Buddhas.

The way of it[s being source etc.] is detailed in the following: That [state in which] saṃsāric potentials are accumulated and ripened on this luminous mind, and which is suitable for separation from this clear light[58] nature is called consciousness- the basis of all. Since it belongs to saṃsāra it is not appropriate for it to be Madhyamaka. Again, that state in which potentials of nirvāṇa are accumulated on this luminous [mind], and which is not suitable for separation from this clear light, is described by such names as primordial mind - the basis of all, natural dharmakaya[59], Buddha essence and “sentient beings are buddhas.”

As it is said: “ Having the very place of the origin of all faults been abandoned, listen to that reasoning by which existence is also abandoned ...” It is explained that “the Protector Nāgārjuna three times roared with a lion's roar on the earth.” It is well known that “first Nāgārjuna composed the treatises of the Collection of Discourses (gtam tshog) which primarily explain the side of the extensive deeds; next he composed the treatises of the Collection of Reasoning which primarily explain the dharma of the profound view as the emptiness related to severing superimpositions by listening and thinking; and finally he composed Bodhicitta Commentaries, Praise to the Mind Vajra[62], etc., which primarily expand emptiness which is experienced through meditation.”
Āryadeva, holding the traditions of [all] of these with equal emphasis[63], became his main holy son[64]. He composed many treatises: Four Hundred, etc.

It is known that the holder of his tradition, the Fearless Dharmapāla, composed treatises explaining the intents of the abovementioned father and son as the Mere Knowing [view][65]. He did this in accordance with the way of interpreting the intent of the Second Dharmacakra by the means of the Third Dharmacakra, as it appears in the Sūtras [of the Third Dharmacakra] themselves. It is known that the Proponents of Entitylessness, hinting [at what they saw as faults of such interpretation], explained: “If, in spite of having distinguished the two truths, great charioteers were deluded, there is no need even to mention others,” etc. The meaning of these words is as follows: “False truth has to be explained in accordance with worldly conventions. That is Madhyamaka tradition. But you, [Dharmapāla,] explained it as mere knowing. That which is temporarily explained as ultimate truth, finally also has to be explained as conventional truth, since it does not withstand analysis [using ultimate] reasoning. But you always explain [ultimate truth] as mere knowing. This is a mistake.”

The disciples of Nāgārjuna who came next are known as Buddhapālita and Bhāvaviveka. They agree in classifying the Collection of Reasoning explanatory style as that of the tradition of the Proponents of Entitylessness only. On that level, they agree in explaining that “all objects of knowledge are empty of their own nature.”
[There are two types of] nature. Pillar being empty of pillar means pillar being empty of false nature. Emptiness of that [false nature] is temporarily posited as ultimate nature. But if this [emptiness] is also analyzed by [ultimate] reasoning it [will be found to] be empty of itself. Thus pillar is empty of its ultimate nature as well. In such a way since both natures are not seen in pillar, it also does not exist. But then it is not accepted as non-existent either, because “existence,” basis of dependence [of “non-existent”], is not accepted.
Interpretation applying such a method to all objects of knowledge is the common tradition of [ all] Proponents of Entitylessness. As their source they use the following words: “If non-empty were a little existent, empty would also become a tittle existent”[66], and “One phenomenon is the nature of all phenomena.”

Those teachers, who composed [the Madhyamaka] commentaries, arrive at the same identification of the meaning of emptiness the object to be determined. But their way of determining [emptiness] is different. The difference is as follows.
First, when the master Buddhapālita was commenting on the meaning of “Neither from self nor from other ...”[67], he wrote: “It is said that phenomena which exist in their nature also don't need production: If something exists yet gets produced, it will be never produced,” etc. The master Bhāvaviveka wrote the following refutation of this [line of reasoning]: “It is not correct because [a] the reason and example are not stated [b] the fault of what others have said is not eliminated and [c] since [these] are the words of the consequence, by reversing the given meaning, the reversed meaning of a probandum and its predicate becomes clear, and thus phenomena wifi turn to be produced from other and contradiction with [your] tenets wifi arise.”

The meaning of it is following: “Is the reasoning, with which Buddhapālita was refuting the Saṁkhyas[68], used as autonomous reason or consequence? If it is the first then there is the fault of proof and example baing the same[69]. If it is the second, [it is also faulty:] Consequence which does not imply autonomous [reason] cannot produce inferential understanding. If it implies that [reason], then production [must be] accepted as reversed meaning [of the consequence][70]. Thus it will become production in the frame of [ultimate] reasoning. Then it will contradict [Madhyamaka] tenets.”[71]

Everybody who holds explanatory lineage of this master in that way is known as Autonomous [ - Svatāntrika] Madhyamika.

The main treatises composed by these teachers are: the root text and the auto-commentary of Engaging in Two Truths (Tib.: bden pa gnyis Ia 'jug pa) by Jñānagarbha[72], the root text and the autocommentary of Madhyamaka Ornament (Tib.: dbu ma rgyan) by the Bodhisattva Śāntarakṣita, and the treatise of Madhyamka Vision (Tib.: dbu ma snang ba) by his disciple Kamalaśīla. These texts are known as the Three Madhyamaka Treatises of Eastern Svatāntrikas (rang rgyud shar pa'i dbu ma'i bstan bcos rnam pa gsum). They were translated and [their meaning was] determined at the earlier time of the Dharma king Trison Deutsen (chos rgyal khri srong lde'u btsan - 742-796). The Great Translator Nok composed many commentaries of abbreviated meaning and word meaning on those treatises; the explanatory lineage of those [commentaries] survived unbroken up to the present time. It has yet to be determined whether the Great Translator received [teachings on these treatises] in India or from his unde[73].

One of the followers of Śāntarakṣita is the master Haribhadra. Everybody in the Land of Snows agrees that he interpreted the meaning of the Mother [Prajñāpāramita] according to the Yogācāra [Madhyamaka] tradition. Thus, in his method of refutation of grasping at signs he used the reasoning of the Proponents of Entitylessness, while he explained the object of meditative experience from the point of view of Yogācāra.
Similarly, the Great Translator commented that Śāntarakṣita and his son had taught that the intent of the author of the Commentary on Valid Cognition[74] is as follows: in order to sever superimpositions, use syllogism of separation from one and many, etc.[75], which proves “the emptiness of oneself”, while in order to explain the object of meditative experience, do so from the point of view of “the emptiness of other”[76]. The Great Translator himself also explained the intent of the Commentary on Valid Cognition in the same way.

Rather his approach was to determine [both the ultimate truth] and the object of meditative experience only as emptiness which is non-affirming negative.

It is known that the beginning of the explanatory tradition of what is commonly known as Prāsaṅgika is dated from the time when the Glorious Candrakīrti introduced a rebuttal to the faults ascribed to Buddhapālita by Bhāvaviveka. Buddhapālita's assertion lays in consequence, which Bhāvaviveka failed to grasp [properly]. Candra's explanation of the points which Bhavya didn't understand is as follows:
If a person is a Madhyamaka follower, he does not make a refutation with autonomous proofs for one's own statements, neither does he create consequences which imply a reversed meaning for an opponent's statements, because, while one engages in pondering the ultimate mode of abiding there is no acceptance of one's statements [whatsoever], and if there is such an acceptance one will fall into the extremes of conceptual elaborations. So, the reasonings refuting Buddhist and non-Buddhist extremists are: “inferential cognition known to others,” “consequence revealing contradictions,” “equalizing by similar reasons” and “non-establishment due to the similarity of the proof and thesis”[77]. With these reasonings it is enough just to refute in one's mind the assertions of an opponent's statements and thus one does not have to generate the inferential valid cognition ascertaining one's own statements.

Regarding these explanations, later Svatāntrika teachers taught that Bhāvya's approach cannot be undermined by [ascribing to it] the fault of illusion established through [ultimate] reasoning, because when the object of negation, a mass of conceptualization, is negated, its opposite, the absence of conceptualisation, is also negated.[78]
Thus, both Prāsaṅgika and Svatāntrika [arrive at] non-affirming negation of all mass of conceptualisation. No difference is accepted in that negation. Later Tibetans explain the difference between Prāsaṅgika and Svatāntrika in another way and thus deviate [from correct explanation][79].

Buddha said[80]: “Nine hundred years after my nirvāṇa [there will come] a fully ordained monk named Asaṅga. He will be adept in the meaning of the treatise[81] and will perfectly differentiate many aspects of the interpretive and definitive meanings of the Sūtras.” Thus, Asaṅga was prophesied [by Buddha] to correctly differentiate the interpretive and definitive meanings. He accomplished the samadhi of the Stream of Dharma[82] and went to Tuṣitā[83]. There he listened at length to Maitreya's Five Dharmas and Great Grounds of Yogic Activities (Yogacāryabhūmi), and having written them down as treatises, he brought them to the Land of Āryas.
His younger brother Vasubandhu learned them from Asaṅga and, once he had composed their commentaries known as Eight Divisions[84], illuminated the Madhyamaka of tine definitive meaning of the ocean-like Yogācāra scriptures. What is that [definitive meaning]? It is the one explained by Āryadeva in the following words: “primordial mind free from grasped and grasper exists as ultimate meaning. Those who crossed the ocean of Yogācāra scriptures have thus proclaimed.”

One may ask: “Is it definite that this very meaning is the intent of all Maitreya Dharmas?”
Concerning this question some of the later Tibetans say that all of the Five Dharmas are definitely Cittamātra [treatises]. Others say that all of them are definitely Madhyamaka [works]. In these resent times it is unanimously agreed that certainly the first and the last Dharmas are Madhyamaka [works] while the tree intermediate ones are those of Cittamātra[85]. Nevertheless I accept that [from looking at] the explanatory style of the scriptures themselves it is proved by direct cognition that [along with the middle three] both the first and last of Maitreya's scriptures make their main topic the Madhyamaka [which is taught in] the interpretation of intent of the Prajñāpāramita Sūtras by the Third Dharmacakra[86]:

The main topic of the Ornament of Clear Realizations is known as the hidden meaning of the eight clear realizations and the seventy topics which explain them[87]. The hidden meaning of the clear realizations is identified from the point of view of primordial mind free from grasped and grasper. When discordant factors—objects of yogic abandonment—are identified, they are explained as nothing but conceptions of grasped and grasper, definite in number. Their opposite is explained as primordial mind free from manifested [conceptions of] grasped and grasper: “...has and [thus] relies on the four conceptions.[88]” Its explanation is: “because of non-abiding in form, etc.,” ( [it is] free from grasped), and: “because of having ceased application related to that,” ([it is] free from grasper)[89].
The aspect of consciousness itself is taught to be an object of practical experience: “ The particulars of the knowledge of the bases are called ‘aspects.’ This is the definition”[90]. This [statement] has to refer to all [practices of the Path beginning with the Path of Preparation up to [and including] the primordial mind at the end of continuity, since it is said: “As a dream and its dreamer are not seen duallstically, likewise non-existence of duallsm of phenomena is reallzed by one moment [of wisdom]”[91].

The words of seventy topics, which explain [the eight clear realisations], definitely establish all phenomena as “the emptiness of oneself” in exact accordance with the explicit teachings of the Mother [Prajñāpāramita] Sūtras[92].
Similarly, when in the treatise of the Sublime Continuum identification of emptiness and essence is given, it is said: “The element is empty of adventitious [phenomena] but it is not empty of sublime phenomena,” and: “Perfect limit is completely empty of compounded phenomena.” Thus both the way of negating the objects of negation and the identification of the objects of practical experience are clearly explained from the point of view of “the emptiness of other.”
Not only that, but if the view of the three intermediate Dharmas of Maitreya belongs to Mind Only, then all presentations of the Five Paths, the Ten Grounds[93] and the Resultant Buddha Ground explained in those [three treatises automatically] will have to be underestimated as not conforming to reality.
Through this reasoning it is proved that all Mahāyāna scriptures composed by Asaṅga with his brother, and all texts composed by Dignāga and his [spiritual] son [Dharmakīrti] are the very Madhyamaka of definitive meaning, and they conform to the interpretation of the intent of the Prajñāpāramita Sūtras by the Sūtras of Perfect Differentiation[94].

The distinguished scholar Śāintipa promised to compose [the text] in his treatise called the Madhyamaka Ornament (Tib.: dbu ma'i rgyan) in the following way: “Herein I will explain the two truths proven in valid scriptural statements that were taught by Maitreya and Asaṅga and accepted by Nāgārjuna.” One might ask: “Are both traditions identical in explaining as the definitive meaning only that emptiness which is taught by the Collection of Madhyamaka Reasoning?”
No. However, Nāgārjuna explained the mind-vajra as the definitive meaning, which is where [both traditions] come to the same point.
Others say: “This view of Śāntipa is just his own wishful thinking. How is it possible to blend together the views of Madhyamaka and Cittamātra?”
But then one denigrates the view of Śāntarakṣita with his [spiritual] son [Kamalaśīla], Haribhadra and others known as Yogācāra Madhyamikas. And you actually do denigrate it because you describe everybody who accepts direct apperception as the Proponent of Phenomenal Existence[96].

Let me give just a partial illustration of those scriptures which clearly teach Tantric Madhyamaka as distinguished from the above explained approaches of Prajñāpāramita Madhyamaka[96].
In the Hevajra [Tantra] it is sad: “Madhyamaka is to be taught after Yogācāra. Having learned all the stages of Mantra one is to be taught Hevajra afterwards.” On this level of explaining the gradual engagement in the view, primordial mind free from the dualism of grasped and grasper is presented first, followed by the view of nonaffirming negation which is “the emptiness of a self-nature” of all phenomena, finally, the view of the union of non-observing compassion and emptiness [is stated][97].

Others say that the first is the Cittamātra view and the last is nothing other than the view of the Collection of Reasoning. If this is so, then the following question arises: “Does Asaṅga with his brother not identify ‘Madhyamaka’ as any of the four tenets or does he identify it as such?” If he does not identify it as such, then expressions like “There is no fourth buddhahood and fifth intent of Muni”[98]; and “The Distinction between the Middle and Extremes” from Maitreya's words would have to be rejected[99]. If you say that he accepts it as the view of Proponents of Entitylessness, this also would be wrong, because in [Asaṅga's] Compendium of Knowledge proponents of such a view are described as proponents of nihihsm (while Candra taught[100] that Vasubandhu etc. didn't understand the view of Adherents of Entityessness)[101]. Whether you describe [the view of] the Hevajra as not being the view of Mantrayāna [at all] or accept it as being such a view, but not being different from the view of Entityessness, it does not conform to the [Tantric] tradition: [On one hand] if means that you [Tsongkhapa] fail to identify the view of Completion Stage[102]. [On another hand] Adherents of Entitylessness [simply] don't have what you accept as “realization of objective emptiness by subjective great bliss”[103].

Limitless are treatises which clearly present Tantric Madhyamaka: the Three Cycles of the Bodhisattvas' Commentaries (Tib.: byang chub sems dpa'i 'grel ba skor gsum), Guhyāsamaja and Cakrasaṃvara's Five Stages (Tib.: rim pa lnga), etc.,Vajra Lines of Path and Result (Tib.: lam 'bras rdo rje'i tshig rkang), Drop of Liberation (Tib.: grol ba'i thig le), etc. I will give just a partial illustration [of their view]: The Bodhisattvas' Commentaries[104] explain the emptiness endowed with the most supreme of all aspects as the main object to be realized by direct yogic perception. If it is taken to have the same meaning as the emptiness of Adherents of Entitylessness, that will lead to extreme conclusions, such as: It will become an object realized by the mind of listening and thinking, it will be suitable for it to be an object of conceptualization and it will be possible to take it into practice without resorting to empowerment which brings about ripening [necessary for entering Tantric Path][105].
So, what is the need for verbosity? It is definite that “the ultimate name of the Ārya Mañjuśrī,” given in Perfect Expression of Names of Ārya Mañjuśrī [Mañjuśrīnāmasaṅgīti], being primordial mind free from all extremes of conceptualization is the Madhyamaka. As followers of Pāramitayāna[106] lack this [primordial mind], this is unique feature of Tantric Madhyamaka.

One may ask: «If one accepts that there is some Tantric Madhyamaka not known to the followers of Pāramitayāna, will it not contradict the words of the Indian master Jñānavajra: “In Mantrayāna there is no view which surpasses total non-abiding. If there were such a view, it would be conceptualized and its teacher would be deluded,” and Sakya [Pandita Kunga Gyaltsen]'s: “If there were a view superior to the Pāramita[yāna's view of] freedom from conceptual elaborations, that view would be conceptualized”? Not only that. [If such a difference in the views of Sūtras and Tantras exists,] it will follow that there must be obscuration which cannot be abandoned by primordial mind at the end of the continuum[107], explained in Pāramita[yāna], which directly realizes freedom from elaborations. If one accepts that, then the buddhahood attained by Pāramitayāna will not be sufficient.»
It is clear that [all] such explanations [of Jñānavajra, etc.,] are given from the perspective of the view which [merely] severs superimpositions. Otherwise, they will contradict the words of Sahajavajra's commentary on Maitrīpa's Ten Stanzas on Suchness (Tib.: de kho na nyid bcu pa): «Madhyamaka called “thorough non-abiding” [but] not ornamented with the guru's instructions is also just “mediocre.” Also Sakya Pandita [himself] said: “So, the view of listening understood through explanation is the same.”[408] [Thus, he] explained that [view as the one] established by listening and thinking, not as the object of practical experience. Similar to that when in the Torch of Three Modes (Tib.: tshul gsum sgron me) the view etc., realized by both Sūtras and Tantras, are explained as the same (: “Although the meaning is the same, there is no delusion ...”[109]), it also either accords with the previous way of explaining, otherwise the intention of [that scripture] is [to show that] the explanations given in Tantra and Maitreya's scriptures [refer to] the same object of the view, which is experienced through meditation [only].

Similarly, having temporarily left without consideration the question about whether there are obscurations which cannot be uprooted by the uninterrupted path at the end of the continuum[110], [I should say that] manifestation of buddhahood by an ordinarybeing in one life is not only an exclusive feature of Tantric skillful means, but also it depends on [the view of] the Tantric Madhyamaka. If the view of the Pāramitas were able to bring about the same [accomplishment], it would clearly [cause] the fault of manifesting perfect limit at the wrong time and [due to] that fault, one will also fall into nihilistic nirvana[111].

In brief, the definition of this Tantric Madhyamaka is what is called “E-Wam.” Also, this is the basis of the discussions in all Tantras, and the way to manifest that [state] is the four empowerments. In Hevajra it is said: “The aspect of E-Wam, the great bliss, is to be perfectly known from empowerment.” Also, it is not realized by the mind of listening and thinking only: “Inexpressible by others the simultaneously born one is not found anywhere. It [the simultaneously born one] is known at the time of the guru['s instructions], the presentation of the method, and due to one's own virtuous qualities.” Also: “In non-conceptualized nature, deities and mantras abide.” Thus only simultaneously born primordial mind is taught to be the basis of accomplishing the deities and mantras.
At the beginning of different “methods of accomplishment”[112], when the collection of wisdom is being accumulated, two ways of meditation on emptiness are taught: instantaneous recollection by such a mantra as “svabhava” and bringing about recognition [of phenomena] as empty through analysis by reasoning. The first one is the recollection of that emptiness which is the basis of accomplishing the deities mantras etc. The second is taught from the point of view of eliminating conceptualization.

Also, the way of eliminating the two extremes by the two Madhyamakas known in the Tantras and Pāramitas[113] is not the same. That which is called “E” eliminates the extreme of overestimation. It is emptiness. And what is this [emptiness]? It has a form similar to reflection, and it is not a non-affirming negative. That which is called “Wam” eliminates the extreme of non-existence. It is great bliss. These two are called “non-observing compassion,” because the subject, great bliss, doesn't observe the object, emptiness, as signs. They are called “oneness of knowledge and knowable” because of their being the union free from [existing] as two [different] substances.
In the Madhyamaka of the Pāramitas extremes of existence, nonexistence, etc., are refuted in the objects, and [thus] explanation [of reality] is given: “If things exist, conceptions arise...” In Tantra from the very beginning grasping at existence and non-existence, etc., is ceased and [that is] identified as freedom from conceptuality. Thus, [the view] is explained, from the perspective of objective freedom from conceptualization [in the Sūtras] and subjective freedom from conceptualization [in the Tantras].This also is the difference in the mode of explaining freedom from conceptuality In the two traditions.

It is clear that at the earlier time of the Dharma king [ Trison Deutsen], when the Three[Madhyamaka] treatises of the Eastern Svātantrikas were translated, just a brief explanatory [tradition of those texts] emerged. But [the person, who] extremely clearly determined [them] through listening and explaining, was [Nok Loden Sherap]: “Beyond the eastern sea, then at the edge of waste lands, [there will come] an Intelligent One [-Loden], different from Lohita. [In] his name, Wisdom [-Sherap] is at the end. In the North, the Snow Land likewise. .” That greatbeing, prophesied by [this] and other [Sūtras], greatly clarified [Svatāntrika] through many commentaries. Among many holders of his explanatory tradition, the main one was Khyun Rinchen Drak (khyung rinchen grags). Among his disciples, known as Gyamar Janchup Drakpa (rgya mar byang chub grags pa), Ganpa Sheu (gangs pa she'u), etc., Drolunpa Lodro Junne (gro lungs pa blo gros 'byung gnas) was the holder of the tradition of all the excellent words of that great individual. Chapa Choky Senge studied with both that [Drolunpa] and Gyamarpa. He composed many commentaries on the excellent words in general, and many on the Three [Treatises of] the Eastern Svatāntrikas in particular. The words of explanations of the Dharmas of Maitreya and Madhyamaka by that teacher came down to Tsek Wanchuk Senge (brtsegs dbang phyug seng ge). From rim, they were received by Sakya Pandita, by whom they were passed down to Uyukpa ('u yug pa) who passed them to Shan Dodepa (zhang mdo sde pa) and others. From him they were passed down to the Lord of Dharrna, Holy Lama (or Lama Dampa Sonam Gyaltsen - bla ma dam pa bsod nams rgyal mtshan - 1312-1375), and then -to Rinpoche Yakpa (rin po che gyag pa, or Yakde Penchen - gyag sde paṇchen - 1348-1414).

[Atīśa] said: “The disciple of Nāgārjuna['s lineage] is Candrakīrti. With instructions passed down from him, the truth of dharmata is realized.” Thus, although at the time when Jowo Atīśa (Tib.: jo bo a ti sha 982 - 1054) came to Tibet, the scriptures of Candrakīrti himself were not actually translated, [Atīśa] composed separate small treatises, such as the Thorough Distinction of the Two Truths ( Tib.: bden pa gnyis kyi rab tu byed pa), etc., explaining Candra's intent. Atīśa taught them to the spiritual friend[114], [Drom]tonpa ('brom ston pa - 1005-1064). Then, in the [text] on the Stages of Path of the Three Individuals [called Lamp on the Path to Enlightenment - bodhipathapradīpa], [he used] Candrakīrti's tradition as the basis [for the presentation] of the aspects of the profound view; [such approach] survived until today.

[The tradition of] the actual commentaries on Chandra's scriptures [begins with] Nyima Drak (nyi ma grags - born in 1055) in the Patsap (pha tshab) family in Phenyul Gyel ('phan yul rgyal). He studied in India and Kashmir for 23 years, and invited [to Tibet] three pandits - Kanakavarrnan and others. In Rasa Trulnan (ra sa 'khrul snang) and other places, he translated many of Candra's scriptures in general, and in particular translated and determined by explanation and study the Root Wisdom, Engaging in the Middle Way, Four Hundred, etc. It is said that he was active at the same time as the spiritual friend the great Sharawa [Yonten Drak](sha ra ba yon tan grags -1070 -1141) was engaged in explanation and study of Prajñāpāramita, and when the Lord Dusurn Khyenpa (rje dus gsum mkhyen pa - the First Karmapa -1110-1193) was practicing in Jazan Drak (ja bzang brag). The great Sharawa created many favourable conditions for [Translator] Patsap[115]'s scholarly activities and encouraged his [own] intelligent disciples to study Madhyamaka [with Patsap].

At that time there were four [disciples] known as the Four Sons of Patsap. Learned in both words and meaning was Mapcha Janchup Tsondru (rma bya byang chub brtson 'grus - passed away in 1185). They also say that he might be the same person as Chapa's disciple Mapcha Tsope Senge (rma bya rtsod pa'i seng ge). Learned in words was Sarbo (sar sbos) from Tsan (gtsang). They say that a small number of monks who followed his [style of] explanation - listening existed in the Nyan [nyang] region. Learned in meaning was Rinchen Drak (rin chen grags) from Daryul (dar yul). They say that although he taught extensively nobody capable of holding his lineage appeared. The one equally [learned in] both words and meaning was Shan Junne Yeshe (zhang 'byung gnas ye shes) He established the Dharma University in Tansak (thang sag). Relying on the Translator Patsap's interlinear commentaries and his outlines of the texts, he himself also composed various commentaries [whose explanatory lineage is] uninterrupted up to the present day. He also taught the Root Wisdom, Engaging and Four Hundred treatises, [and gave] guiding explanations of the view of the Madhyamaka of Prāsaṅgika tradition.

While Chapa was engaged in Svatāntrika Madhyamaka's explanation-learning, a holder of Candra's lineage, the pandit named Jayānanda who commented on Engaging in the Middle Way, came to Tibet. At that time Chapa directly [challenged him through] debate and indirectly [challenged Prāsaṅgikans by] composing a treatise with a great variety of refutations of both the words and meaning of Candra's text. Regardless of what these refutations became, he definitely grasped the opponent's point of view.

Although at the time of the Great Translator Nok, the Prāsaṅgika scriptures were not translated, by relying on their sayings (which he heard either in the Land of Āryas or in Tibet), in refuting Prāsaṅgika [the Translator Nok] wrote a refutation of acceptance of the existence of the realization of the Madhyamaka meaning without relying on three-moded syllogism[116]: «Without thought in their minds: “This compositional collection [i.e. skandhas] does not exist,” such people who proclaim apparent things or their perfect refusal, deviate from the path of valid cognition and definitely fall into the great empty desert of wrong views.» He also wrote a refutation of the followers of Yogācāra and Svatāntrika Madhyamaka: “Both those who accept some phenomenal existence by the power of reasoning and those who ascertain by valid cognition the suchness which is beyond the way of compounded phenomena, fall into the mouth of the great demon of unbearable grasping at things and are [thus] held fast by the sharp fans of [wrong views.” As for his own tradition, he explained that Nāgārjuna's [approach to] Madhyamaka has to be understood with the help of the reasoning of the author of Pramānavartika.

Madhyamaka is [to be understood] as it is explained by Shambhala's Dharma language[117]. Tins implies that the same thing has to be said about Svatāntrika Madhyamaka as well.

They say that at the earlier time of the Dharma kings when translations of [the root] texts [with] the commentaries of Prajñāpāramita Sūtras and the first [three] Dharmas of Maitreya were made partial explanation-listening [of these texts] existed. However, the tradition of determining [their meaning] through learning and teaching, and emergence of this tradition's hinders doubtlessly originated [with the works of Nok Loden Sherap]. He was prophesied by Buddha: “North of here on the snow border, there will appear an Intelligent One [Loden]. He will have unobstructable intelligence in letters Sanskrit and explanatory composition.” Tins great being extensively learned the Prajñāpāramita Sūtras with their commentaries from Pel Gomi Chime[118], lord Sthirapāla and others. He translated all five of Maitreya's Scriptures, and composed their extensive and abbreviated commentaries. In particular he translated, extensively commented upon and through learning-explanation perfectly determined the Ornament of Clear Realizations with Vimuktasena and Haribhadra's commentaries.

This Nyelshik attained siddhis and also learned extensively from Chapa's disciples. They say that eighteen of his disciples composed Prajñāpāramita and Pramāṇa commentaries. Among them, Gyaton Chinrupa (rgya ston phying ru pa) established monastic university in Nyetan Dewachen (snye thang bde ba can). Zanrin Drakpa Darma Tsultrim (zang rings grags pa dar ma tshul khrims) established a monastic university in Trophu (khro phu). In the lineage of his disciples, Sonam Gonpo (bsod nams mgon po), known as the Valid Being, was the one with whom the Omniscient Buton (bu ston thams cad mkhyen pa - 1290 -1364) studied. Rinpoche Yakpa studied with him [i.e., Buton] and his disciple Lun Manpo (lung mang po).

Also another disciple of Nyelshik was Jowo Namkhapel (jo bo nam mkha' dpal). He engaged in explanation-studying in Nyan To (nyang stod), where his disciple was the learned Ozer Gonpo ('od zer mgon po). For 32 years he was running a monastic establishment in Sanphulin Me (gsang phu gling smad) where Shakya Shonnu (shakya gzhon nu) and Janchup Shonnu (byang chub gzhon nu) became his disciples. Janchup Shonnu created a new [explanatory] style while Shakya Shonnu, holding to the old style of [his] teacher, founded a monastic establishment as well as the monastic university of Tsel Chokhorlin (tshal cho 'khor gling). His disciple is known as Lodro Tsunme (blo gros mtshung med). He was learned in all Mahāyāna teachings and was broadly educated. Lord Ranjun Dorje (rang byung rdo rje - the Third Karmapa - 1284 - 1339) received many teachings from him. He in his turn also received many teachings from Ranjun Dorje.

They say that although Tsannakpa Tsondru Senge (gtsang nag pa brtson 'grus seng ge) was learned in all the excellent words, his activities were not extensive. Parphuwa Lodro Senge (spar phu ba blo gros seng ge) was learned in all the excellent words and later, having studied with the great Phagmo Drupa (phag mo gru pa - 1110-1170), composed commentaries on the Three Doha Cycles (Tib.: do ha skor gsum) [of Saraha].

As for the Three Accomplished Ones, there are two opinions on whether Shan Tselpa (zhang tshal pa) was a direct disciple [of Chapa] or not.

As for his name, when he took monastic ordination from Choggi Lama (mchog gi bla ma), the direct disciple of the Great Translator, he was named Chokyi Lama (chos kyi bla ma)[126]- But in Hulen Annals[127], he appears under the name of Dorje Ozer (rdo rje 'od zer).

Also, teachers explain that the first three Dharmas of Maitreya were translated in the earlier time of the Dharma kings, but the Sublime Continuum and Distinguishing between Phenomena and Their Reality for a long time disappeared even in the Land of Āryas until later, when one pandit named Maitreyanātha took them from a brick stupa and spread [their teachings]. This happened just prior to the time of the Great Translator Nok.

Other lamas of the past say that the bearer of Maitreya's name who rediscovered those Dharmas, was [in fact] the Great Bodhisattva Maitrīpa, and that those scriptures are Mahāmudrā[128] treatises.
The relative of bramin Ratnavajra, whose name was Sadjana, studied [these scriptures] with Maitrīpa, and the Great Translator Nok learned them from Sadjana himself. He made translations [of these texts] together with their commentaries.

The opinion of the Translator is that the meaning taught in the [first] four Maitreya's Dharmas is interpretive and the meaning taught in the Sublime Continuum is definitive. This [definitive meaning] is the one which bears the name of Sugata Essence. Also, [Nok] identified this [meaning] as the aspect of natural purity of all phenomena which embraces ali knowables. It is a space-like nonaffirming negative[129]. It is the one taught by the words: “There is nothing to eliminate here, [nothing at all to posit].[130]”

[A scholar] known as Yarlunpa Tsen Khawoche (yar lung pa btsan kha bo che - born in 1021) received the Dharmas of Maitreya when he was 60 years old. According to his successors, the definitive meaning as understood by him, is naturaliy pure primordial mind luminous by nature, which pervades [everybody] from Buddha to sentient beings. They say he taught that primordial mind to be Sugata essence.

In earlier times this [difference in approaches] was called “the difference between the explanation of the Maitreya's Dharmas as dialectical tradition and meditative tradition.” But inboth cases, there is no contradiction because at the time of eliminating grasping at signs, the first approach is more profound, while to turn [the view] into the basis of virtuous qualities, the second approach is needed.

Similar to that, interpreters of Maitreya's Dharmas produced two identifications of the unchangeable thoroughly established [phenomena][131]. They were explained [by some] as non-affirming negative, which is non-observation of grasped and grasper, and [by others] as the primordially established non-dual primordial mind. Both of them are also non-contradictory, as it is explained in the Middle and Extremes: “Here, non-existence of things which are persons and phenomena is emptiness. Existence of the thing which is nonexistence of [these] two things is characteristic of the empty thing.” The intent of Lord Ranjun Dorje's commentaries on the three Inner Tantras[132] and Distinguishing between Phenomena and Reality was also the same.

<d e="2">
Later Tibetans' identification of the definitive meaning of the last Dharma of Maitreya as “nothing other than emptiness of grasped and grasper being substantially different,” greatly obscures [the correct] way of determining the definitive meaning of this Dharma [of Maitreya].

During the time [the Great] Master, the Emanation Body, Padmasambhava[133], stayed in Tibet, translations of Krīya, Chārya and Yoga Tantras in accordance with [their Indian] scriptures were completed. The intent of Anūttarayoga Tantras was divided into three: Mahāyoga, Anuyoga and Atiyoga, and taught orally. At that time there appeared many yogis who attained siddhis[134] by practicing mainly the third yoga. [This is] Atiyoga - the Great Perfection. It is taught that it came from the Instructions of the Rosary of the View (man ngag lta ba'i phreng ba), which were composed by Padmasambhava himself. For those who follow the presentation of the Nine Vehicles, this view of Atiyoga has to be explained as the view of the uncommon Madhyamaka of Anūttarayogatantra[135].

During the intermediate [period of] translations, a person who translated many Tantras which had never been translated was the Great Translator Rinchen Zanpo (rin chen bzang po - 958-1055). He clarified the intents of all the Tantras through the practice tradition and composed a treatise [called] Distinguishing between Dharma and non-Dharma (chos dang chos ma yin pa mam par dbye ba'i bstan bcos). His disciple Hla Lama Yeshe О (lha bla ma ye shes 'od - 965-1036] and the successor in his lineage, Phodran Shiwa О (pho brang zhi ba 'od), composed many texts refuting [the scriptures] previously accepted as Tantras of authentic Indian sources.

The definitive meaning which became [known] at that time from instructions of the Path and Result[136], the Five Stages[137] and the Six Dharmas[138], is the Great Madhyamaka of Anūttarayogatantra, a definitive meaning not known to Svatāntrika and Prāsaṅgika Madhyamikas.

In later times [both] Madhyamaka which is the peak of the views of the four proponents of tenets and [also] its scriptural tradition, became identified in the Snow Land as nothing other than what is known as Prāsaṅgika and Svatāntrika. [Adherents of this position] also explain that [the view of] this Madhyamaka is only non-affirming negative which is [here] the emptiness of true existence of all phenomena.
Saying this, one accumulates the karma of abandoning Dharma: Thus, the defamation of the word of the Third Dharmacakra with the treatises commenting on its intent comes about by labeling them as Proponents of Phenomenal Existence. This was prophesied by Lord Maitreya himself: “There is nobody in the world more knowlegable than the Victor...,” etc[139]. If Ārya Asaṅga didn't teach the Madhyamaka of definitive meaning in [his] commentaries on [Maitreya's] Dharmas, [etc.,] it would contradict Buddha's own prophesying him as [the one who will] distinguish the interpretive and definitive [meanings]. They [i.e. Gelukpas] say that in the commentary on the Sublime Continuum, he interpreted [it] as being a Prāsaṅgika [scripture]. Nevertheless, these are just words and nothing else since any discriminating person, having taken a look [at it], will directly establish that this commentary doesn't agree with Candrakīrti's way of commenting[140].

If Tantric Madhyamaka is explained as non-affirming negation, emptiness endowed with the most supreme of all aspects will not be identified. [Otherwise,] it will be identified as something different, and whatever [this “something” is], it will be undermined by scriptural authority. Similarly, the union of bliss and emptiness will not be identified. Beside that, how will the “body of oneness of mind and knowables,” etc., be explained? Explaining these as the false truth is a belittlement of the ultimate truth of the Tantric tradition. Not only that in Kālacakra, the view that the emptiness which is nonaffirming negative is [that very] emptiness which is united with great bliss, is clearly refuted. The examples used are impossibility of grapes being produced from a Nimba[141] tree, nectar being produced from poisonous leaves and a lotus being produced from a Brahma[142] tree.

They say that since the identification of the ultimate truth in the Third Dharmacakra with the commentaries on its intent, does not surpass emptiness of substantial difference of grasped and grasper[143], [this is the view of] the Proponents of Phenomenal Existence. Nevertheless [in reality] there is no such identification of [ultimate] emptiness in those scriptural traditions. What is it then? All entirely imputed “grasped” [phenomena], such as external things, etc., and also all entirely imputed “graspers” like consciousness appearing as those [external phenomena], etc., are identified as emptiness in [their] own nature, and only naturally pure primordial mind left in remainder of that [negation] is explained as ultimate truth.

—But since they accept this [ultimate truth] to be truly established, it is not appropriate [for them] to be Madhyamikas.
—Since you accept that the emptiness of true establishment is an ultimate, it is not appropriate for you either to be Madhyamika, because the feature of being established as ultimate truth but not being truly established does not appear in any scriptural tradition of the past, whether valid or non-valid.
—But although the definitive meaning derived from those scriptural traditions was explained by the noble Maitreya as Madhyamaka, [its] explanations by Bhāvaviveka and Candrakīrti as not Madhyamaka are more powerful.

—But Asaṅga also, having quoted the Sūtras, explained their [Candra and Bhāvya's] interpretations as a view of belittlement. Also, in Indian instructions' scriptures and in sūtras, the emptiness explained by the Proponents of Entitylessness was called “the emptiness of matter,” “nihilistic emptiness” and “overextended emptiness.”
Thus since in the qualified scriptures partial refutations of both types of identification of definitive meaning were made, it is not possible to engage in a mutual refutation of one [viewpoint] using another [viewpoint] without having analyzed their profound intents.

Later Tibetans say that this profound definitive meaning called “emptiness” is nothing else than [the one taught by] Candrakīrti's scriptures. As it is said: “Let scholars be certain that in the same way as this Dharma does not exist elsewhere, the tradition which originates here also does not exist elsewhere”[144]. They explain that this [emptiness] is a subject established by valid cognition, empty of the object of negation which is “the establishment by one's own characteristics.” Otherwise, [they continue,] if one meditates on, say, son of a barren woman being truthless, which seeds of obscurations will this person manage to abandon?[145] To support those [statements] they interpret the scriptures where Candra was refuting Mere Knowing school as a refutation of Bhāvya[145]. They explain that if at the time of determining emptiness, one does not separately identify the object of negation he will fall into the extreme of nihilism. They say that the tantric union of bliss and emptiness also has to be explained as such emptiness realized by subjective great bliss. They say it is like having to explain the direct realization of emptiness by kindness (great compassion), as “emptiness with the essence of compassion.”

All such words don't accord with any of the scriptures used by them as the source [to prove their views]: In Madhyamaka scriptures it is explained that [all] four extremes of conceptualization have to be eliminated.

In Madhyamaka scriptures it is taught that the elimination of the extreme of being neither comes down to refutation of the extreme of being both, whereas the refutation of the extreme of non-existence depends on the refutation of the extreme of existence etc. Thus it is taught that when an opposite in mutually eliminating [contradiction] is negated, another opposite is also negated. But as the mainstream [of your thought] you use [the view which says that] when one of the two [parts of] mutual contradiction has been refuted, another [part] is automatically established.

The contradiction between that [viewpoint] and the scriptures is [clear from the following]: In [Madhyamaka] scriptures, dependent existence is understood as establishment through dependence, which is in turn understood as non-establishment: “Victors taught that establishment dependant on mutually related phenomena is nonestablishment.” In this [Madhyamaka] tradition [of Proponents of Entitylessness] it is clear that if in remainder of negation of “being,” “non-being,” etc., is established, it will follow that in remainder of negation of the object of negation, other phenomenon is cast and not all extremes of conceptualization will be negated. As the object of negation by Madhyamaka reasons, you don't accept anything else other than what is “established by one's own characteristics.” Thus you cannot abandon the extreme of nihilism and the extreme of nonexistence, and so proclamation of emptiness of emptiness becomes unnecessary[147].

Also, since [you] are not able to accept that Mahāyāna āryas have more superior realization of emptiness than that of the Śrāvakas and Pratyekas, it is clear that [you accept] that Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas have a complete realization of selflessness of phenomena[148].
Since you accept “individual,” “mere self” and others of the “twelve creating individuals” as established by valid cognition, you are similar to the heretics[149].
If in the Abhidharmas of Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna[150] there were no correct identification of the self of person and selflessness of person, it would follow that there is no distinction made between outsiders and insiders[151] [on that level].
If [one accepts that] when [the mind] is engaged in true mode of abiding the proof, the probandum and the subject [of syllogism] are established by valid cognition, it is clear that [he] won't be able to refute the private [syllogism of Svatāntrikas][152].

If the real Madhyamaka meaning were not taught by Bhāvaviveka's writings, it clearly won't be correct for Candra to use the quote: “ ... that which was well explained by Bhāvaviveka ...”[153]
If at the time [of engaging in the true mode of abiding], there were direct or inferential perceptions realizing emptiness, it would contradict [the statement] of Engaging in Bodhisattva Deeds [that] “the ultimate is not the object of mind functioning - [mind is accepted to be false].” [Likewise it will contradict following statements:] the sūtra's statement that “ultimate truth transcends even objects of omniscience” quoted in Engaging in the Middle Way and other texts, Atīśa's “there is no need for direct and inferential [cognitions]” and [his] “master scholar Bhāvya taught that it is not cognized by conceptual and non-conceptual consciousnesses,” etc.
Not only that, but [such statements] are also undermined by reasoning since the isolate, elimination of other, being made direct object of perception by direct valid cognition, was refuted by the reasoning of the author of the Commentary on Valid Cognition[154].

This way of explaining emptiness [as] the negation of the object of negation not established by valid cognition on the basis of the subject established by valid cognition, contradicts explicit teachings of the Pmjñāpāmmita Sūtras. Not only that, in the treatise of Candra himself it is said[155]: “Since its nature is that, eye is empty of eye,” etc. He taught this, directly applying [the same reasoning] to all subjects [of emptiness].
Reasoning also [shows] that emptiness, where phenomenon established by valid cognition, like a pot, is empty of the object of negation which is not established by valid cognition, is the worst among even those emptinesses which appear in the scriptures of Proponents of Emptiness of Other. This is because it is identified as [the emptiness where] the subject, impure other-powered phenomenon, is empty of the object of negation, entirely imputed phenomenon lacking identity[156].

—With an explanation of all objects of knowledge as emptiness of oneself in this tradition of [Candra] it won't be possible to abandon objections given in, “If all of them were empty...,” etc[157]. [Will it]?
—This is not impossible: an answer to that is given by the words: “Explanation of Dharma by Buddhas is based on the two truths...,” etc[158]. How does this work? In general, when the two truths are separated, non-existence [of things] as true is emphasized [by Madhyamikas]. But since that debate of the Proponents of Phenomenal Existence is [an attempt to] refute false [truth] having used ultimate [truth] as the reason, the answer is: “[It is not correct] because [the phenomena still] exist falsely”[159]. As it is said: “Teachings on countless [eons], etc., don't withstand [the critique from the point of view] of the ultimate meaning. [But from the point of view] of the false [truth] Muni accepts those concordant causes of kindness.”

[The way] is acceptance [of things] as [they are] known in the world [or by worldly ones]. The term “worldly ones” is not applied only to ordinary individuals. Rather, [in this case] it means all innate minds grasping at signs due to ignorance until the predisposition for ignorance is eliminated. When an explanation is made emphasizing these very minds, which accept the first truth, it is done as follows:
There are two types of appearances [arising] in the mental field of worldly ones—wrong appearances and correct appearances. The first type is appearances of consciousness deceived by an immediate cause. They are such appearances of mistaken sense consciousness as [visions of] falling hair and two moons [in the case of eye disorders], and superimpositions of mistaken mental consciousnesses deceived by wrong tenets—superimpositions such as [the ideas of] “self” and production from the four extremes [of self, other, both and neither].

The second type is appearances of innate consciousness caused by ignorance[170] without being deceived by an immediate cause. These are the five types of external objects appearing to sense consciousnesses. This type also includes appearances of mental consciousness, such as the “mere I,” a sprout established by nature and production by nature, [which are] objects grasped through the mode of apprehension of the two types of innate self-grasping[171].
These wrong and correct [appearances] are respectively called “false truth from the point of view of the world” and “ultimate truth [from the point of view of the world].” The first of these two is not accepted as existent even by the world itself, because while not existing it [still] appears in a wrong way due to [the immediate causes of] mistake. The second type of appearances is accepted as existent according to common knowledge [of the world] because all instances of these appearances are the ultimate truth for that knowiedge]. That very approach was intended by the auto-commentary on Two Truths [by Jñānagarbha] when the following words of a sūtra were quoted: “That which is made ultimate by some [individuals] is accepted as false by others. That same person who is the mother of someone is viewed as the wife by another.”

From the standpoint of this explanation, the two types of “self” imputed by tenets are not posted as existent even in the world[iy mind], because worldly ones also accept them as a false truth. But the two types of “self” imputed by innate ignorance have to be accepted as existent from the point of view of the world itself] because they are accepted as ultimate truth by worldly ones.
What this explanation proves is as follows: That which posits the ultimate truth of worldly ones is innate ignorance. That which posts the ultimate truth of āryas is awareness of primordial mind[172]. Both ultimate truth of the world and that which is posted as truth by common knowledge [of the world][173] are called in āryas' conventions “false truth of the world,” because both are similar in being true within the framework of [worldly] minds and similar in not being true within the framework of awareness of primordial mind. Thus, there is no difference in existence and non-existence of these two conventionally.

In brief, the reasoning is as follows: If something is named 'correct false truth' in āryas' conventions and accepted as ultimate truth by worldly ones it has to exist in the world. For example, a chariot. The two types of self, which are objects grasped through the mode of apprehension of the two types of innate self-grasping, are also named 'correct false truth' in āryas' conventions and accepted as ultimate truth by worldly ones. [Thus they exist in the world.]
Then, who accepts the view that 'chariot exists but self doesn't exist'? It is approved by Buddhist Proponents of Phenomenal Existence. It is not approved by Madhyamaka's own tradition since in that tradition both of them are equally [viewed as] not being existent.

Those inhabitants of the Snow Land who don't know this approach in which the mode of presenting self, chariot and so forth by Buddhist tenets supercedes [the mode of doing it by] common knowledge of the world say, 'Whatever is accepted by the worldly ones is Madhyamaka tradition.' Presenting the conventional truth of the world, they say: 'Self exists, but [it] does not [exist in] a true [way].' They also say. 'Self, which is the basis of karma and its results, exists, but self of person does not exist.'[174] [All] these statements clearly show to the world that either [their author] didn't take even the slightest pains to look with an eye of intelligence at the garland of white light of Candra's perfect elucidations, or with a brush of crooked discrimination he took dark ink stirred by evil ideas and colored Candra's face black.

This has two steps. First, when conceptual elaborations that grasp at truth are being severed, one ceases partial conceptual elaborations and practices concordant ultimate truth. After that, when conceptual elaborations that grasp at truthlessness are being severed, one ceases all masses of conceptual elaborations and practices final definitive meaning[175].

On the level of first [reasoning], all the types of correct false truth explained above are posited as wrong false truth, because white nonexisting they appear due to ignorance. Why are they non-existent? They are non-existent because they are not found under investigation by the reasoning of āryas[176] and because they appear due to ignorance only. Since other types of correct false truth [beside those explained above] are not accepted on this level, they are posited as false truth. They are named 'false truth of the world'.
Ultimate truth [posited] on this level is a sprout empty of truth, [a vase] empty of nature, etc. These [types of ultimate truth] are accepted as existent according to the conventions of āryas, because they are established by valid cognition approved by āryas.

On the level of second reasoning, all the types of ultimate truth explained above have to be interpreted as false truth, because they serve as the objects of sounds and concepts[177]. Although this is so, nevertheless they are not accepted as wrong false [truth], because they are not posited by the power of ignorance. They are named 'false truth of the yogis' and 'correct false truth.' When Bhāvaviveka said, “it is not appropriate for the learned ones to scale the great building of the true [meaning] without the ladder of correct false truth,” and Candra said, “if one asks whether the ultimate also is conventional truth, [the answer will be] 'yes, it is',” they also intended that very meaning [which was just explained].

If false truth on this level is like that, what then is ultimate truth [here]? The term 'ultimate truth is beyond all expressions' is used.

On this level, one has safely entered that which is the great mansion of definitive meaning.

In the beginning there emerged two great [pioneering] traditions of the [Madhyamaka] chariot interpreting the definitive meaning derived from Madhyamaka treatises composed by the being of great nature, Ārya Nāgārjuna. [One tradition] interprets [Nāgārjuna's intent] according to Yogācāra treatises and [the other tradition] interprets [his intent] according to the Niḥsvabhāvavāda method[180]. [Advocates of] the first are the master Vasubandhu and the Glorious Dharmapāla, and Śāntipa and others who came later. [Advocates of] the second are the masters Buddhapālita, Bhāvaviveka and others.

The existence of these two methods of interpreting Nāgārjuna's intent is illustrated by the words of the Madhyamaka Ornament written by the master Śāntarakṣita: “Those who drive the chariot of the two methods with the reins of reasoning gain possession of the Great Vehicle thereby” Also, in Śāntipa's [text] known as the Madhyamaka Ornament, it is said, “Herein I will explain the two truths proven in valid scriptural statements that were taught by Maitreya and Asaṅga and accepted by Nāgārjuna.” Jowo Atīśa also said, “Ratnakaraśānti [,i.e. Śāntipa] says that the treatises of Nāgārjuna and Asaṅga are concordant.”

Son-of-the-Victor Śāntideva, the master Buddhapālita, Bhāvaviveka and Candrakīrti were the initiators of the tradition that first explained that the advocates of the first pioneering tradition hadn't realized the final intent of the master Nāgārjuna and then interpreted it in a Niḥsvabhāvavāda way.

First, when he was explaining the meaning of these words in the beginning of [Madhyamaka] Treatise[181]: “Neither from self nor from other, not from both, not without causes—any phenomenon in any circumstance is never produced,” Buddhapālita wrote: “The subject, 'any phenomenon in any circumstance,' is never produced from itself, because if there is production from self [it will follow that this] production is meaningless and limitless,” etc. Thus [Buddhapālita] refuted production from the four extremes, using four consequences[182]. But he didn't posit autonomous syllogisms establishing the non-existence of production from the four extremes.
After him, the master Bhāvaviveka wrote: “The subject, 'any phenomenon—eye, etc.—in any circumstance,' is never produced from itself, because it exists. It is like, for example, an existent consciousness. This subject, [any phenomenon, etc.,] is not truly produced from other, because it is different [from that other]. It is like, for example, a vase and woolen doth,” etc. Thus [Bhāvaviveka] posited four autonomous syllogisms[183]. He presented various reasonings refuting the master Buddhapālita['s approach, which] didn't use autonomous reasons and examples at the time of negating production from the four extremes.
After him, the master Candrakīrti took the side of the master Buddhapālita. He presented many refutations of Bhāvaviveka's standpoint and extensively explained how the faults ascribed by Bhāvaviveka to Buddhapālita didn't [really] undermine [the position of the latter].
These are the only reasons why Madhyamaka branched into Prāsaṅgika and Svatantrika[184]. As it is sad in Madhyamaka Clear Words (Prasannapadā): “The master Buddhapālita also taught that 'phenomena are not produced from themselves, because [otherwise] their production will turn to be meaningless and [other] extreme consequences [of this statement] will arise,' etc. The master Bhāvaviveka disapproved of this line of reasoning in the following way: 'It is not correct because [a] the reason and example are not stated, [b] the fault of what others have said is not eliminated, and [c] since [these] are the words of the consequence, by reversing the given meaning, the meaning of a thesis and its probandum become clear, and thus phenomena will turn to be produced from other, production will have results, production will become limited, and [consequently] contradictions with [your] tenets will arise'. But we see [the imputation of] all these faults as unreasonable.” And the quote continues, “If a person is a Madhyamaka follower, autonomous inferential cognition[185] is not appropriate, because there is no acceptance of other standpoints.” Also [Candra] said: “Reversed meaning of the consequence is related to opponents, not to us, because we don't have statements.”

According to Svatāntrika, there are five syllogisms establishing truthlessness and non-production by nature: [1] the syllogism of separation from one and many; [2] the syllogism of vajra fragments;

[4] the syllogism negating production in four ways; and [5] the syllogism of dependent existence[186].

According to Prāsaṅgika, these [five] are not autonomous syllogisms, because [1] the valid cognition that measures the three modes[187] and the subject is not established as common appearance for both proponent and opponent; [2] “existence as true” is negated on the basis of subject, eye, etc., but “non-existence as true” is not established; and [3] there is no [autonomous] thesis of one's own tradition at the time of analyzing the ultimate.
Why is the valid cognition measuring three modes and the subject not established as common appearance for both [proponent and opponent]? It doesn't exist [for both] because for [something] to be valid cognition in Madhyamaka's own tradition, it has to be a valid cognition measuring the ultimate[188]. However, the three modes and the subject of the syllogism of separation from one and many, etc., are conventional truth.

Having thus refuted [Svatāntrikas], in their own tradition [Prāsaṅgikans presented] four reasonings negating true establishment [of phenomena]: [1] an inferential cognition known to others[189]; [2] consequence revealing contradictions[190]; [3] equalizing by similar reasons[191]; and [4] non-establishment due to the similarity of the proof and thesis[192].

The first one is shown by such words as: “Since, in suchness, [phenomena are] not produced from self, other and both, and don't exist without dependence, phenomena don't have nature.” The second one is shown by such words as: “If one conceives that something that has already been produced, is produced again, then production of a sprout etc., won't be found here and the seed will be thoroughly produced till the end of existence.” The third one is shown by such words as: “If something different were to be produced in dependence on other [phenomenon], then thick darkness wll arise from the tongues of fire and everything will be produced from everything.” The fourth one is shown by such words as: “So, the eye in dreams also is accepted as the cause of perception by a false subject. Seeing that every answer given by this [opponent] is similar to the thesis [which he tries to prove by] that [answer, Madhyamikas] eliminate this polemic”[193].

According to Svatāntrika, there are two [types of] reasonings [used to] enter the ultimate truth: reasonings that sever conceptual elaborations grasping at truth and reasonings that sever conceptual elaborations [grasping at] truthlessness. On the level of the first type of reasonings there is autonomous thesis, probandum of correct syllogism[194] and inferential cognition which takes this [probandum] as its object. On this same level, non-affirming negatives, the objects [of the reasonings], are accepted as the real ultimate truth, while inferential cognitions, which take these [non-affirming negatives] as their objects, are accepted as real subjective ultimate [truth].

According to Prāsaṅgika, at the time of severing conceptual elaborations grasping at truth, existence-as-true is abandoned, but non-existence-as-true is not established: If in the [process of negating] one conceptual elaboration another conceptual elaboration is established as a 'remainder' [of that negation], it will be impossible to sever [all] conceptual elaborations and [the process of severing] will become limitless. Thus [Prāsaṅgikans] admit that at the time of analyzing the ultimate there is no any statement and acceptance at all.
In brief, [these two traditions] are to be known as “the tradition of Svatāntrika which severs superimpositions gradually and the tradition of Prāsaṅgika which severs superimpositions simultaneously.”

On the level of the two truths, Svatāntrika accepts two types of valid cognition - direct and inferential - as definite in number.

Svatāntrika temporarily accepts as efficient ultimate truth nonaffirming negatives in which only one set of the conceptual elaborations is negated, such as 'a vase empty of truth'. Prāsaṅgika considers that if all conceptual elaborations are not negated on the basis of, say, a vase, then [such] non-affirming negatives, in which only one set of conceptual elaborations is severed, can be only false truth. Thus [Prāsaṅgika] doesn't accept this even temporarily as efficient ultimate truth.

According to Svatāntrika, a clinging mind that dings to the truthlessness of a sprout based on the syllogism of separation from one and many is temporarily accepted as an efficient Madhyamaka view. [This school] accepts the continuity of that clinging mind as an object of practice by the yoga of union of calm abiding and special insight.
According to Prāsaṅgika, this clinging mind is not accepted as an efficient Madhyamaka view, because it is grasping at signs. The object of that mind is also not accepted as efficient ultimate truth, because it is the object of expressive sounds and concepts.

In the end, both Prāsaṅgika and Svatāntrika come to the same view. Although Svatāntrika temporarily accepts as ultimate truth nonaffirming negatives in which only one set of conceptual elaborations is negated, in the end it also comes to accept them [merely] as correct false [truth] and nominal ultimate [truth]. Also, although the mind that realizes such [ultimate truth] is temporarily accepted as the Madhyamaka view, in the end it is accepted [merely] as concordant ultimate [truth]. From the Two Truths: “Negation of production, etc., is also accepted [just] because it is concordant with the holy meaning. Thus, it is false...” From Madhyamaka Ornament: “Because of being concordant wth the holy meaning, it is called 'holy meaning'. In reality, that [real holy meaning] is free from all masses of conceptual elaborations.” From Madhyamaka Essence: “It is not appropriate for the learned ones to scale the great building of the true [meaning] without the ladder of correct false truth”[196].

Some Indians taught: “[There are two types of Madhyamaka:] Madhyamaka Which Accepts Illusion as Established by Reasoning and Madhyamaka of Thorough non-Abiding.[197] The second one is also of two types because it is divided into Thorough non-Abiding of Severed Continuity and Thorough non-Abiding of Union.” Translator Patsap taught: “The one which accepts valid cognition by the power of things is Svatāntrika. The one which does not accept it is Prāsaṅgika.” Sakya Pandita's assertion is expressed by [his] words: “The acceptance of non-deceiving [phenomena] even on the conventional level is tradition of Pramāṇa. Svatāntrika mostly agrees with that.” Translator Nok taught: “Also, the division into the two traditions of Thorough non-Abiding and Illusion-like One surprises [only] fools.” Later inhabitants of the Land of Snows taught: “With Madhyamaka taken for a basis [of division], that which accepts phenomena being established on the conventional level by their own characteristics is Svatāntrika, and that which doesn't accept such [phenomena] is Prāsaṅgika”[198].

This last tradition is inappropriate. What do you call 'own characteristics'? Do you accept them to be uncommon [features that] posit phenomena or 'own characteristics' that are the objects of negation by [Madhyamaka] reasons? If it is the former, then the master Candrakīrti also accepts it, because in Engaging in the Middle Way he accepts the characteristics of [all] phenomena from form till omniscience[199]: “Form has characteristic of ' that which is suitable to be penetrated',” etc. If it is the second, then [the foliowing question arises]: Does Svatāntrika accept the objects of negation by [Madhyamaka] reasons at the time of positing false truth or at the time of positing ultimate truth? If it is the latter, it will follow that the subject, Svatāntrika Madhyamaka, [admits that it] accepts true establishment, because it accepts phenomena established by their own characteristics on the ultimate level. The reason is acceped[200]. If it is the former, it will follow that the subject, master Candrakīrti, accepts the object of negation by Madhyamaka reasonings, because at the time of positing false truth he accepts phenomena established by their own characteristics. The pervasion is accepted. The reason is [also] established, because at the time of positing ultimate truth of the common knowledge of the world itself, the worldly ones accept phenomena established by their own characteristics, white Candrakīrti accepts false truth in accordance with the way known in the world[201].

If [you] wish to observe the suchness of the four continents of definitive meaning
Relying on the great gait of the sun and the moon of Prāsaṅgika and Svatāntrika,
Take the wheels of this chariot driven by
The charioteer of discrimination unknown to others.

This treatise on differentiation of the tenets of Svatāntrika and Prāsaṅgika Madhyamakas called “Great Ship of Discrimination Which Sails into the Ocean of Definitive Meaning” was composed by the Madhyamika from the Central province (yul dbus), Jampel Gawe Shenen in the middle of Yeru in Tsan by request of “seated-just-once”[202] Lodro Tenpa (blo gros brtan pa). Written down by [spiritual] friend Kunga Tashi (kun dga bkra shis).
Mangalam!
