You are the treasure of all excellent insights profound and vast,
the unacquainted friend of everyone in this world,
the eyes for beings of the three realms to see the excellent path.
Munīndra [the Buddha], the sun among preachers, sustain us at all times.
You are unrivaled among the myriad conquerors
in proclaiming everywhere the lion’s roar,
the perfect and excellent tale of the profound truth.
Guru Mañjuśrī, bless us throughout all times.
You were prophesized to expound as they are
the distilled essence of the mind of the sugatas of three times,
the middle way free of extremes, and the path of dependent origination.
Nāgārjuna, I bow to you from my heart; seize me with your hook of compassion.
Through Nāgārjuna’s instructions you have reached great heights,
you reveal to other beings what you have yourself seen,
you have gained mastery over the tale revealing the excellent path.
Glorious Āryadeva, I bow at your feet.
You have fulfilled the sacred words of the revered Mañjuśrī,
you have illuminated the ultimate intent of the noble Nāgārjuna,
you have traveled to the state of a perfected knowledge-holder.
Buddhapālita, I bow my head at your feet.
You have revealed in its perfect fullness
the path of the great sage subtle and difficult to fathom,
the way of Nāgārjuna’s with its singular traits.
Candrakīrti and Śāntideva, I bow at your feet.
Having properly seen with eyes of untainted intelligence
the well-established system of Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva
in its entirety, with all its unique and essential points
as elucidated by the three great charioteers,[49]
and so that I may remove the stains of erroneous explanations of many
who strove to expound this tradition here in this region,
and also because I have been urged to by others,
I will correctly and extensively present Entering the Middle Way.

In Sanskrit, one of the four great languages that existed in India, the title of this treatise is Madhyamakāvatāra. When translated into Tibetan, it is rendered as Dbu ma la ’jug pa (Entering the Middle Way). Here, the “middle way” that is being entered into is found in the statement “to enter the Middle Way treatise”[51] — namely, the Treatise on the Middle Way. This, in turn, should be taken to mean Fundamental Wisdom.[52] For instance, when Fundamental Wisdom is cited as an authority in the commentary on this text, Candrakīrti frequently writes “in the Middle Way.” Therefore the term should not be taken to refer to some other treatise on the middle way or some other meaning of the term middle way. Lamp of Wisdom too, drawing on the etymology of the roots of the term middle way, explains that both a treatise on the Middle Way as well as Middle Way philosophy can be referred to as “the Middle Way.”[53] So, although only “Middle Way” appears here in the title, it must be understood as referring to the Treatise on the Middle Way.
What, then, is the manner in which this treatise enters Fundamental Wisdom? Here some assert that in Nāgārjuna’s treatise the natures of the conventional and the ultimate truths have not been expounded extensively, whereas here [in this text] these have been presented extensively, so this text “enters into” that treatise.

With respect to the varieties of reasoning for establishing suchness, however, Fundamental Wisdom is far more extensive than Entering the Middle Way. So I do not see this as a good explanation. As for our own position, this work enters Fundamental Wisdom in two ways — it enters from the perspective of the profound aspect of the path and from the perspective of the vast aspect. In relation to the first, the Commentary states:
“This tradition is unique,” so must the learned ones ascertain.
And also:
Not realizing this, they abandon this profound teaching. Thus to present without error the truth of the treatise, I have composed this work Entering the Middle Way.[54]
Candrakīrti states that he composed his Entering the Middle Way to show that the meaning of the Treatise on the Middle Way as established by him is distinctive compared to other Middle Way proponents and to strengthen the conviction that the meaning of the treatise cannot be explained in conformity with the consciousness-only (vijñaptimātra) standpoint. In his Clear Words too, Candrakīrti says that, insofar as the nature of dependent designation is concerned, this should be understood from Entering the Middle Way.[55] {5} Furthermore, the refutation of the consciousness-only standpoint is not extensive in either Fundamental Wisdom or Clear Words, but it is entensive here. Therefore ascertaining excellently the meaning of Fundamental Wisdom and appreciating these two objectives [(1) providing a unique interpretation of Nāgārjuna’s Fundamental Wisdom compared to other commentators and (2) offering an extensive refutation of the consciousness-only standpoint] on the basis of that treatise, [these two together] constitute one way in which this text enters the Middle Way.

<d e="2">
Entering the Middle Way from the perspective of the vast aspect of the path is as follows. In accordance with the tradition of the noble Nāgārjuna, abiding in the two vehicles [of Hīnayāna and Mahayana] is not distinguished based on whether one possesses wisdom realizing the utterly profound truth of suchness. Furthermore, although no distinctive features of the vast path of Mahayana besides the dimension of the profound are presented in Fundamental Wisdom, that work was composed from the Mahayana standpoint within the division of Mahayana and Hīnayāna. This is because the extensive presentation of the selflessness of phenomena by a profuse variety of reasoning is done only in the Mahayana training, and this is how the presentation is made in Fundamental Wisdom. The Commentary makes this point very clearly:
That it presents Mahayana is indeed correct, for it does so to elucidate the selflessness of phenomena. And the intention [of Nāgārjuna] is to explain such selflessness in an extensive manner. In the Śrāvaka Vehicle, the selflessness of phenomena is confined only to brief illustrations.[56]
I will explore this point further in another section below.

</d>
<d e="2">
Thus the path presented in Nāgārjuna’s text should ideally be complemented with the other dimensions of the Mahayana path as found in other instructions of the noble Nāgārjuna. For this reason Candrakīrti presents these supplements in his work: (1) the three factors of the ground of ordinary beings, (2) the ten grounds of the ārya bodhisattvas on the learner’s stage, (3) the resultant ground, and (4) on the basis of explaining the sequence of the fifth and the sixth grounds, the cultivation of penetrative insight grounded in tranquil abiding, which is the essence of meditative absorption probing the suchness of the two selflessnesses. Therefore, when contemplating the meaning of Fundamental Wisdom, you must do so by bringing to mind these aforementioned points taught in Entering the Middle Way. Otherwise, the two aims of composing Entering the Middle Way will have been lost. The second manner of entering the Middle Way by way of this text, then, is entering the path of Fundamental Wisdom from the perspective of the vast aspect of the path.

The revered Candrakīrti, who for the purpose of entering the middle way wished to compose Entering the Middle Way, did not take as his object of salutation śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, who have been objects of salutation in other texts. And even in relation to the buddhas and bodhisattvas, it is great compassion — the first perfect cause of buddhahood, characterized by total rescuing of all sentient beings bereft of refuge and caught in the prison of cyclic existence, and the principal cause designated by the name of its effect, the Blessed Mother — that he wished to demonstrate is more worthy of praise.[59] To that end Candrakīrti wrote the two stanzas beginning with the line “Śrāvakas and middle-level buddhas . . .”[60]
This has two sections: (1) how compassion is the principal cause of bodhisattvas and (2) how compassion is also the root of the two other causes of bodhisattvas.

They listen to perfect instructions from others and, as the fruit of their meditation once they have attained śrāvaka enlightenment, they then enable others to hear that truth; hence they are known as śrāvakas [“hearers”]. The manner in which they enable others to hear is found repeatedly in such scriptural statements as “Thus I have completed my task. I will know no lives beyond this one.”[61] {7}
Although this etymology of the word śrāvaka does not apply to all śrāvakas, such as those in the formless realm, this is not a problem. For a term to be used as a noun in a practical context, it does not have to constitute the explanatory basis for the etymology of that term. For example, the term lake-born (saroruha) can refer to a lotus born on dry land. Alternatively, the etymology of the Sanskrit term śrāvaka can be taken to be “one who proclaims what was heard.” By this explanation, śrāvakas are so called because, having heard from the buddhas the path to travel to the highest fruit of buddhahood, they then proclaim it to those who are inclined toward the Mahayana and seek that path. The White Lotus of the Good Dharma states:
Savior, we heard and have become śrāvakas today!
We will proclaim perfectly the sublime awakening;
we will utter thoroughly too the word of awakening;
so we are like those formidable śrāvakas![62]

These two grounds for calling someone a śrāvaka (hearer) constitute for bodhisattvas the basis for their resemblance to śrāvakas, while śrāvakas themselves actually fit the name “one who proclaims what was heard.”
Some, because the word “sublime” is not mentioned explicitly in the third line of the above quote, say that the first “awakening” refers to that of the Mahayana while the second one refers to the awakening of the śrāvakas. The understanding of the Commentary, however, is to take the first “awakening” as referring to the awakening of the Great Vehicle and the second to the path leading to that awakening.
Some might wonder, “Bodhisattvas also hear the path to buddhahood from the buddhas and proclaim it to other trainees; do they also become śrāvaka disciples?” This is not a problem. Śrāvakas proclaim the [Mahayana] path but do not practice it themselves, not even a facsimile of it. This then is the meaning of this term śrāvaka.

With respect to the term buddha in “middle-level buddhas,” some explain this in accordance with the Commentary’s statement, “The suchness of a buddha applies to all three persons,”[63] whereby the term tattva buddha (“one who has realized suchness”) is explained as applicable to all three categories of persons. This is excellent. As it is stated “Tattva refers to ‘suchness,’ while buddha means ‘to realize within,’”[64] the realization of suchness is taken to be the meaning of the term buddha. In this interpretation, the term describes all three categories of persons. So although the intention here is to say that the term “one who has realized suchness” applies to pratyekabuddhas as well, the term has been rendered in Tibetan simply as “buddhas.” But whereas the term buddha can be translated as the Completely Enlightened One in general, to do so in the present context would be inappropriate. In any case, since the term buddha can also refer to the blossoming of lotus petals or to waking up from sleep, one need not always translate the term as the Completely Enlightened One.

The meaning of “middle-level” is this: Pratyekabuddhas, {8} because of their distinction in having cultivated merit and wisdom for a hundred eons, are superior to the śrāvakas. Since they lack the dual collections of merit and wisdom, the great compassion that extends to all beings at all times, and the complete knowledge of all aspects of phenomena, however, they are inferior to the buddhas. They are thus of the middle level.[65]
Some say that the nature of their superiority to śrāvakas in terms of gnosis is explained in the line “Because they have overcome objective conceptualization.”[66] This is incorrect. In this [Candrakīrti’s] tradition, both śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are understood to possess the realization that all phenomena lack intrinsic existence. Furthermore, the one who makes the assertion above appears to himself uphold this very tenet of Candrakīrti![67] Therefore the Commentary describes pratyekabuddhas as superior in their advancement in wisdom, “superior” meaning their ever-enhancing progression on the path. They immerse themselves in the accumulation of merit and wisdom for one hundred eons; śrāvakas, on the other hand, are incapable of sustaining such a prolonged cultivation of the path.

Although the term collection may apply to merit and wisdom in general, the primary referent of “collection” here is as stated in the following in the Clear Words commentary:
They uphold great awakening by cultivating the perfect truth, and thus the collection is constituted by great compassion and so on.[68]
Here, “collection” applies to those factors that uphold the fruit — unsurpassed awakening — through methods that accomplish it without distortion. Hence the term refers to merit and wisdom that embody this meaning; those not encompassed by this meaning are only ordinary collections. This connotation of the term comes from the etymology of sambhāra, which is the Sanskrit word for “collection.”
Now because the span of their merit and wisdom is far greater than that of the śrāvakas, even in the desire realm, pratyekabuddhas during their last existence can engender an arhat’s gnosis without hearing teachings from a teacher. And given too that it is for their own sake that they become enlightened — that they attain or are attaining the arhat’s state — they are called pratyekabuddhas (“self-enlightened ones”) and also “self-arisen ones.”

The term sage (muni) may generally apply to śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha arhats, but since they are not sovereign among the sages, only buddhas are referred to here by the expression “sovereign sages.” Buddhas have attained the highest mastery of truth, which cannot be excelled by śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, or even bodhisattvas, and it is the buddhas’ sacred words that enable the three persons to master the Dharma. The statement that from these sovereign sages the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are born means that they are produced by the buddhas. {9}
One might ask, “In what way do sovereign sages produce śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas?” When a buddha appears in the world, he teaches the profound truth of dependent origination without distortion. Śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas listen to this, reflect upon the meaning of what they have heard, and meditate on the meaning of what they have reflected upon. Through this process śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas realize their wishes in precise consonance with their aspirations. In that it’s from such sovereign sages the two are born, they are produced by the sovereign sages.

One might wonder, “Many from the śrāvaka lineage realize enlightenment in the very life in which they hear teachings from a buddha, whereas those of pratyekabuddha lineage do not actualize enlightenment in the same lifetime. It must be incorrect to say that they realize their wish based on study, reflection, and meditation on the basis of being taught by a buddha.”
This is not a problem. Some among the pratyekabuddha lineage, having gained expertise in the realization of the ultimate truth from listening to a buddha’s revelation of dependent origination, may not attain the pratyekabuddha nirvana in the same life in which they hear the teaching. Just as someone who has accrued a definite karma but does not experience its fruit in the very life in which it was accrued will definitely experience it in some later life, the seeker of the pratyekabuddha state to whom a buddha revealed dependent origination may not attain nirvana in that very life but will definitely attain it in a subsequent life. So the earlier statement that that they realize their wishes on the basis of study, reflection, and meditation was not intended to mean within a single lifetime exclusively. As Four Hundred Stanzas states:
He who knows suchness, even if
he does not attain nirvana in this life,
will definitely attain it without effort
in other lives, just as in the case of karma.[69]
The Treatise on the Middle Way too states:
When the fully awakened ones do not appear
and the śrāvakas are no more,
the gnosis of pratyekabuddhas
spontaneously arises independently.[70]

With regard to the meaning of “If, some say . . .” in the Commentary,[71] some assert that this is a response to the following contention: “Since there appear to be some who do not attain the states of śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha even when dependent origination has been revealed to them, the states of śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha would not come to be fully realized through the teaching of dependent origination.”[72] Others interpret this as a response to the objection “[If enlightenment is the fruit of a buddha’s teaching, then] this fruit should come about the moment one has put into practice the meaning of the unborn nature of dependent origination, but this is not the case; {10} in the future too, it will not produce such a fruit.”[73] These explanations stem from a failure to understand the context. The context here is how sovereign sages produce pratyekabuddhas, where there is the greater doubt, and it is this doubt that needs to be addressed with special emphasis. This these commentators have failed to do.

Now, if śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are born from sovereign sages from whom do these sovereign sages come about?
The fully awakened buddhas are born from bodhisattvas. One might object: “Are not bodhisattvas called ‘the Conqueror’s children’ because they too come into being on the basis of what a buddha revealed to them? Since they are the Conqueror’s children, how can it be that the buddhas are born from the bodhisattvas? The father of a son cannot be born to that same son!”

It is true, bodhisattvas are children of the conquerors. Nevertheless, bodhisattvas serve as a cause of buddhas on two grounds. First, bodhisattvas serve as a cause of buddhas through their states of being: tathāgatahood is the fruit of bodhisattvahood. In other words, all those who have attained the state of buddhahood have done so on the basis of having first attained the state of the bodhisattva while on the learner’s path. Thus it is through being an indirect substantial cause — that of sharing a continuum with a buddha — that a bodhisattva is shown here to be a cause of a buddha.

Second, bodhisattvas serve as a cause of buddhas through enabling them to uphold the perfect truth. For example, one reads in the sutras about how the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī enabled our Teacher and other buddhas to first uphold the awakening mind. This establishes how, through serving as the cooperative condition for the buddhas with whom they do not share the same continuum — the buddhas whose states are objects of attainment of other bodhisattvas — bodhisattvas give birth to the buddhas.
[Question:] When the opponent objects, “Since bodhisattvas are the Conqueror’s children, it would be correct to say that bodhisattvas are {11} born from conquerors, but to assert the opposite would be illogical,” the author himself indicates that he admits [the premise], writing, “It is true, bodhisattvas are children of the conquerors.” In that situation, one needs to give reasons why, despite accepting [the premise], there is no contradiction in saying buddhas are born from bodhisattvas. It is insufficient to simply provide reasons proving that buddhas are born from the bodhisattvas. For even if such proofs are presented, the doubt raised earlier would remain unresolved.[74]

[Answer:] Such a fault does not arise. The meaning of the root text’s statement that buddhas are born from bodhisattvas is this. In the first reason — that on the basis of undertaking the practice of the path, the bodhisattva on the learner’s stage attains the fruit of buddhahood — one understands that such a bodhisattva is not the child of the buddha he will become. So how can it be the case that the author is saying “Though this is true” to that. Furthermore, although the bodhisattva who is freshly born from our Teacher’s sacred words is a child of the Buddha, it is not the case that the Buddha came to be born from such a bodhisattva. The objection thus trades upon not distinguishing these two different contexts to which the Commentary has responded [through differentiation]. So why, if one possesses some intelligence, does one not understand this on the basis of Candrakīrti’s own Commentary? Be that as it may, it seems that numerous pointless explanations have emerged in response to this question.

Because bodhisattvas are a principal cause of buddhas, for this reason alone the buddhas eulogize the bodhisattvas. This is how one should read. There are four grounds for such eulogizing: (1) It is so because the perfect cause of buddhahood is most profound — it is extremely precious. (2) It is understood that, by offering salutation to the bodhisattva — the cause — one implicitly offers salutation to the resultant buddha as well. (3) Just as when one sees the young sprout, with its main stalk and so on, of a medicinal tree that could produce desired fruits, one nurtures the plant with special care during its sapling stage with its tender leaves, one must cherish with care and nurture with great effort a bodhisattva on the beginner’s stage, who represents the sprout that could bring forth the tree of the buddha as a wellspring of relief for all beings. (4) Finally, it is to help sustain those who happen to be in the vicinity when extolments of the bodhisattva are being uttered and have already been placed among the three vehicles to definitely connect them to the Great Vehicle alone. {12}

It says, for example, in the Heap of Jewels Sutra:
Kāśyapa, it is thus. For instance, one pays homage to the new moon but not to the full moon. Likewise, Kāśyapa, those who thoroughly revere me should pay homage to the bodhisattvas but not so to the tathāgatas. Why? It is from the bodhisattvas the tathāgatas emerge, and all the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas emerge from the tathāgatas.[75]
The above citation establishes by means of scriptural authority how the buddhas are born from the bodhisattvas, while the two reasons stated earlier establish it through reasoning.

Therefore, the reason no direct salutation is offered to śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, buddhas, and bodhisattvas — famed as objects of salutation elsewhere — is because a salutation is offered here to their root cause. And the reason these four categories of persons are shown, in their respective sequence, in the two lines “Śrāvakas and middle-level buddhas . . .” as causes and effects is to help identify what constitutes their final root cause.
In this light, although it is on the basis of what is taught by the buddhas that the bodhisattvas are born, it is not necessary to explain the line “buddhas are born” in exactly the same manner as the birth of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. The significance of demonstrating how these two are born from sovereign sages is to show how, when traced to their source, even the roots of these two are connected to compassion. How the root of the bodhisattva connects to compassion is explained separately.

Now, if śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are born from sovereign sages and the sages are born from bodhisattvas, what then are the causes of these bodhisattvas?
The compassionate mind, which will be explained below, the wisdom or cognition that realizes nondual truth or freedom from the dichotomy of extremes of thingness and no-thingness and so on, as well as the awakening mind: these three are the primary causes of bodhisattvas who are children of the conquerors.

The Commentary states that the awakening mind referred to here is as presented in a passage it cites from a sutra. The sutra reads:
Having realized the suchness of one’s own reality, {13} one generates the mind with the thought, “I will help sentient beings realize this ultimate nature of things,” and this is called awakening mind.[76]
This citation focuses on only one aspect of the objective of the awakening mind, and so what is presented here does not complete its definition. Also, one reads in the Commentary, “One should definitely generate the mind with the thought, ‘I will rescue the entire world from suffering and definitely connect them to buddhahood.’”[77] Here too, because it does not mention awakening itself — the object of attainment — it is only a partial definition. Therefore the Commentary clearly states, when showing how the awakening mind arises in dependence on compassion, that such a mind focuses on the object of attainment, awakening itself. It says:
[The awakening mind] aspires to perfectly attain this buddhahood alone, which is the cause from which emerges both the excellent taste of the ambrosia of sublime Dharma characterized by the cessation of all distorted conceptualizations and the one who embodies true friendship to all beings.[78]
In light of this, the following should be accepted as the full definition of the awakening mind: “It is the wish to attain unsurpassed enlightenment — the object of attainment — for the benefit of all sentient beings, its intended objective.” This is how this mind is defined in the Explanation of the Commentary[79] as well, which is excellent. There is thus no divergence [with respect to defining the awakening mind] between Candrakīrti’s tradition and the one presented in Ornament of Realizations.[80]

Understanding these three factors [compassion, nondual awareness, and awakening mind] as being the cause of the bodhisattvas is the tradition of Precious Garland, which states the following:
If one aspires for oneself and for the world
to attain the unexcelled enlightenment,
the roots of this are an awakening mind
as firm as Meru, king of mountains,
compassion extending in all directions,
and gnosis not rooted in duality.[81]

Although this citation presents these to be the roots of awakening and does not explicitly state these to be the roots of bodhisattvas, the word root has the connotation of being first, and furthermore since the context here is the presentation of the three principal causes of that first stage, from its context one can infer that these three are the principal causes of bodhisattvas. The demonstration of these three factors as being the cause of bodhisattvas [in Entering the Middle Way] takes place in the context of asking, if śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are born from the buddhas and the buddhas are born from the bodhisattvas, from where do bodhisattvas take birth? Given this, such causes cannot be understood in terms of the explanatory cause of the bodhisattva; rather, they must be understood as the bodhisattva’s producing cause.
[Question:] Is the bodhisattva for whom these three factors are taken to be the causes at very least a bodhisattva who is on the initial stage of having entered the path? If so, then it is not correct to say the Mahayana awakening mind is his cause, {14} for the moment such a mind is attained, the person is already by definition a bodhisattva. Similarly, positing the gnosis that does not tend toward any of the two extremes as a cause of bodhisattvas is also untenable, because bodhisattvas first generate conventional awakening mind and subsequently engage in the practices of the six perfections. It is only when the bodhisattva is training in the perfection of wisdom that he or she trains in the gnosis not tending toward the two extremes. Now, if you do not take the reference to be the initial-stage bodhisattva, this contradicts the statements describing him as a new moon–like bodhisattva or a bodhisattva that resembles the sprout of a medicinal tree.

[Reply:] Since the exact faults you have leveled above will ensue, we do not accept the second option but subscribe to the first. Nonetheless, the fault you have cited earlier will not arise for us because the generation of the awakening mind prior to the bodhisattva stage is understood in terms of the meditative cultivation of the awakening mind; it does not refer to the actual generated mind that has arisen on the basis of such cultivation. For example, just as there is the experience of tasting the bark of the sugarcane and the experience of tasting what is inside the bark, in the same manner, the mere thought “I will attain buddhahood for the benefit of all beings” is only a reflection that follows after the words. This is similar to the tasting of the bark of sugarcane. Although it is called “generating the awakening mind,” it is not the actual generated mind. In contrast, the extraordinary experience that has arisen on the basis of training in accordance with the instructions of cultivating awakening mind, an experience that can wonderfully bring about an effect in one’s mind, is analogous to tasting the actual sugarcane inside the bark. It is therefore the genuine generation of the awakening mind. With this in mind, the Invoking the Altruistic Resolve Sutra states:
Just like the bark, it is but speech.
The real mind is the taste.[82]

As to how, given that the bodhisattvas of higher mental acumen seek the view of suchness first and then generate the awakening mind, the second fault does not arise, this will be explained below.[83]
“Nondual awareness” does not refer here to awareness of the absence of subject-object duality. In the Commentary it is explained in terms of wisdom free from the two extremes,[84] which can arise prior to being a bodhisattva, so there is no inconsistency here. Those who interpret this wisdom in terms of the ultimate awakening mind are entirely missing its proper context;[85] the “nondual awareness” here [in the salutation verse] has to be a wisdom that is the cause of the bodhisattva who has entered the initial stage of the path. {15}

Since compassion is the root of the awakening mind and of nondual awareness as well, Candrakīrti wrote “As . . .” and so on with the intention of showing how compassion is primary among these three factors.
As compassion alone is crucially important in the beginning to help produce the perfect harvest of buddhahood, it is like the seed. To nourish [the plant] to ever higher states, in the middle, it is like the water; finally, as a source of enjoyment by the trainees for a long time, it is accepted as resembling the ripened fruit. Therefore I, Candrakīrti, will praise compassion, as opposed to śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, or the other two other causes, at the start of composing this treatise.

It is not that compassion is praised at some later point in the text; it is praised here itself by simply showing how it is important at the beginning as well as at the end and in the middle when it comes to producing the fruit of a conqueror. The exclusionary modifier “alone” indicates that, unlike in the analogy of an external crop — where what is crucial in the beginning, at the end, and in the middle are different — in the context here, compassion alone is crucial for the crop of a conqueror at the beginning and at the end, as well as in the middle.
Here is how, like the seed, compassion is crucial at the beginning. Those with great compassion feel pain at the suffering of other sentient beings, so to help protect all suffering-ridden sentient beings, they generate the mind directed toward their welfare and contemplate, “I will rescue all these sentient beings from suffering and definitely join them to the buddhahood.” Seeing that this is dependent on attaining buddhahood themselves, they generate the mind focused on awakening with the thought “I will, by all possible means, attain buddhahood for the sake of these beings.” Recognizing that such a pledge cannot be fulfilled if one forsakes the altruistic deeds, including nondual wisdom, perfection of generosity, and so on, they then definitely engage in the practice of all the deeds, including especially the cultivation of gnosis. Therefore great compassion is the seed of all the attributes of the buddha.

With this understanding, the Precious Garland states: {16}
In the scriptures of the Great Vehicle,
in which are taught all the practices,
stainless wisdom, and so on preceded by compassion,
what sane person would deride such teachings?[86]
The stanza above states how all the essential points of the Mahayana are encompassed within the three practices — (1) the awakening mind preceded by compassion, (2) the bodhisattva deeds in general, which are brought forth by the awakening mind, (3) and, in particular, the practice of wisdom free from the stain of objectification in terms of two extremes.
Here is how, like water, compassion is also crucial in the middle. Even if the seed of compassion produces the sprout of awakening mind at the beginning, if it is not repeatedly moistened with the water of compassion later on, one will fail to gather the vast twofold collections that are the cause for the fruit of buddhahood. One will definitely actualize the nirvana of either a śrāvaka or a pratyekabuddha instead. If, however, it is repeatedly moistened with the water of compassion, one will not end up in that situation.

Here is how, like the ripened fruit, compassion is also crucial at the end. Even if one attains the conqueror’s state, if one lacks the ripened fruit of compassion, one will not become a resource that sustains other sentient beings. The proliferation of the uninterrupted lineages of ārya śrāvakas, ārya pratyekabuddhas, and ārya bodhisattvas — one following another in a continuous lineage — will also not come about. If compassion is perpetually present on the resultant ground, only the contrary situation will come about.
Therefore, through explicating the meaning of these four lines [that begin] “As compassion alone is accepted to be,” we should gain a firm conviction that these lines demonstrate the following: “If I aspire to follow the Great Vehicle, I must first become moved by the power of compassion, and on that basis, I must then generate the awakening mind from the depth of my heart. Having generated such a mind, I must, without doubt, engage in the bodhisattva deeds in general and, in particular, penetrate the depth of the profound view of emptiness. In this way, I must train in these.”

{17} Since the identity view grasping at “I” gives rise to the identity view grasping at “mine,” first — that is, prior to the identity view manifestly clinging to “mine” — the identity view grasping at “I,” assuming a self that does not possess intrinsic existence as existing by virtue of an intrinsic nature, manifestly clings to the referent of the thought “I am” as real. Then, in relation to things other than the object of “I” grasping — body, eyes, and so on — with the thought “mine,” they become attached, grasping in terms of “this is mine.” Thus, like buckets on a waterwheel in motion or spinning in a circle, sentient beings turn in a cycle without control, and it is to the compassion that cares for such suffering beings that I bow here. This then is the meaning of paying homage to compassion that takes sentient beings as its object.
In what way do transmigrating beings resemble the perpetual motion of a waterwheel? Here the two things — sentient beings and the perpetually moving waterwheel — are the basis of comparison: namely, the analogy and what resembles it. Here are six aspects to the analogy — being tied by a rope and so on — that illustrate the features that are similar [to the waterwheel]:

2. This [world of sentient beings] is propelled by consciousness, which is analogous to the operator who sets the waterwheel in motion.
3. It rotates from the depths of the great river of cyclic existence, from the peak of existence down to the hell of Avīci, with no interval at all.
4. It travels downward to the lower realms, on its own with no need for exertion, while it requires great effort to draw it upward to the higher realms.
5. There are three afflicted classes [within the twelve links of dependent origination]: (1) the afflictions of ignorance, craving, and appropriation, (2) karma — namely, volition and becoming — and (3) afflicted birth — namely, the seven remaining links. Yet there is no fixed sequence to their origination.
6. And, on a daily basis, this world is assailed by the suffering of suffering, the suffering of change, and the suffering of pervasive conditioning. Therefore, this world of transmigrating beings is nothing but a condition akin to a perpetually moving waterwheel.

The comparison by means of these six characteristics is drawn not simply to engender an understanding of how sentient beings wander in cyclic existence. What is it for then? {18} Earlier it was shown that those who aspire to enter the Great Vehicle must first generate great compassion; however, it was not explained how compassion comes to be generated — that is, on the basis of what kind of meditative cultivation? So here it is shown that great compassion is generated through contemplating the way sentient beings wander without control in the cycle of existence.
“What factor makes us revolve in such perpetual cycle?” It is our utterly uncalm and undisciplined mind alone that does it. “In what domain and in what manner do we revolve?” In this domain, from the peak of existence down to the hell of Avīci, we revolve without any interval when we are not in motion. “Owing to what causes and conditions do we revolve?” It is through karma and the afflictions. Owing to demeritorious karma and its related afflictions we revolve in the lower realms, and due to meritorious and unwavering karma we revolve in the higher realms. We enter the first effortlessly, without needing to strive to take birth there. It is harder [to be born in] the latter, since their causes require cultivation with great effort. This is as mentioned in the Basis of Discipline, where the Buddha says that the number of those who migrate from the higher and lower realms on their way to the lower realms are like the number of particles of dust that exist on this great earth, while those migrating from these two realms on their way to the higher realms are like the number of dust particles collected between the tips of his fingers.[87]

Thus we should reflect on the following. During the period of [the activity of] any of the three afflictions [ignorance, craving, and appropriation] of a single cycle of dependent origination, the two other afflicted factors [karma and birth] pertaining to a different cycle of dependent origination can come to operate, and so the continuity never ceases. Furthermore, we are tormented by the three classes of suffering on a daily basis, not just once but constantly, like endless ripples of water.
Now, if someone experiences no effect whatsoever in his mind when he reflects initially on the way he himself wanders in the cycle of existence, there is no way that such a person would experience on the beginner’s stage an unbearable concern for others when contemplating their suffering. Therefore, just as explained in Commentary on the Four Hundred Stanzas, one must first contemplate suffering in relation to one’s own self.[88] Then one should contemplate in relation to other sentient beings.

We might ask, “Will merely having contemplated how other sentient beings are tormented by suffering and its origin in the cycle of existence induce great compassion? Or does it require some additional complementary factor?” The fact is, when we see an enemy suffering, far from any unbearable feeling, a sense of joy may even arise in its place. Similarly, when we encounter the suffering of someone who has neither benefited nor harmed us, most of the time, we are unmoved by their plight. This happens because we lack, on our part, a sense of holding them dear. In contrast, when we see the suffering of those we love, close kin, we find this unbearable. In fact, the more profoundly we hold someone dear, it seems, the more intense the feeling of unbearableness. Thus the essential point is how we need to generate a sense of endearment toward other sentient beings, a deep regard for them, cherishing them in our heart. {19}

Now, with respect to the method for generating this sense of endearment, there seem to be two approaches among the learned masters. The first is as explained by Candrakīrti in his Commentary on the Four Hundred Stanzas, where he speaks of how, once one has contemplated that all sentient beings have been one’s kin — having been one’s parents, for instance, since beginningless time — one will have the forbearance to plunge into cyclic existence to help free them.[89] This is also the method taught by the great being Candragomin as well as the learned Kamalaśīla.[90] The second approach is the tradition of glorious Śāntideva. This I have explained elsewhere, so please understand it from there.[91]
Thus those who strive in training in great compassion on the basis of two factors — deeply caring for sentient beings in one’s heart and contemplating the manner in which they are tormented within cyclic existence — have made Candrakīrti’s unique choice of compassion as the object of salutation serve its purpose. The explanation of one who fails to do this yet harbors the pretension of being versed in this text will resemble the recitation of a parrot. One should understand this point in other contexts of the text as well. As to how this [specific form of compassion] constitutes compassion that takes sentient beings as its object, that will be explained later.[92]

To elucidate compassion that takes phenomenal reality as its object and also compassion that takes no reference as its object by means of their distinct objects, the two lines beginning with the word “beings” are presented here. Reading these lines as “I will bow to the one who, seeing beings to be subject to moment-by-moment disintegration, as fleeting like reflections of the moon in rippling water stirred by wind, becomes compassionate toward them” is to pay homage to compassion that takes phenomenal reality as its object. Similarly, to read these lines as “I will bow down to the one who sees transmigrating beings, though appearing, as devoid of intrinsic nature, just like the reflection of moon in water, and becomes compassionate toward them” is to pay homage to compassion that takes no reference as its object.

In the Commentary, the word “transmigrating being” is dropped and reads, “I bow to that compassion which . . .” This is done because it is understood that “transmigrating beings” are implicit in the context of the two latter objects.[93]
Now, in an utterly clear pool shimmering with ripples caused by a breeze, reflections of the moon appear, and as one sees the rise and fall of these reflections together with its basis, the water, {20} as if seeing the moon itself in the water, the wise ones — that is, those who are versed in understanding this nature — will perceive, on a moment-by-moment basis, these reflections to be transient and devoid of the reality of being the moon that they appear to be. Just like this example, bodhisattvas under the power of compassion, when they see other sentient beings — beings who reside in the ocean of identity view, an ocean into which flow the vast blue lakes of ignorance replenishing it, an ocean that is being beaten up by the storms of false mental projections — when they see such beings before them, beings who appear like reflections of their own positive and negative karma and upon whom befalls the suffering of conditioned existence of moment-by-moment disintegration, and see these beings as devoid of intrinsic existence, great compassion for them arises [in the bodhisattvas]. As explained above, this also arises on the basis of a sense of endearment toward other sentient beings and from contemplating their plight of wandering in the cycle of existence. Although the identity view is a form of ignorance, ignorance is mentioned here separately [in the Commentary], and it refers to the ignorance of grasping at the self-existence of phenomena, which induces the identity view.[94]

The Commentary explains that the three types of compassion are to be distinguished not on the basis of their cognitive aspects but on the basis of their focal objects, for the aspect of all three is the wish for sentient beings to be free of suffering. As such the three are also similar in taking sentient beings as their object of focus. For instance, in the context of the first compassion, the Commentary states “having become compassionate for transmigrating beings,” while in the contexts of the two latter compassions, it states “fleeting transmigrating beings.” So they present the sentient beings to be their object of focus. Therefore compassion that takes phenomenal reality as its object does not merely take sentient beings as its object; it takes as its object sentient beings who are disintegrating on a moment-by-moment basis. Thus it focuses on sentient beings qualified by impermanence in the sense of their momentariness.

Within the awareness that ascertains sentient beings to be disintegrating moment by moment, the apprehension of sentient beings as permanent, unitary, and autonomous ceases. One is then able to ascertain the absence of sentient beings that possess a reality separate from their aggregates, to understand sentient beings to be designated upon the mere collection of aggregates, and to ascertain that sentient beings designated upon mere phenomenal reality like aggregates come to be the object of one’s compassion. Thus it is referred to as “taking phenomenal reality as its object.” The phrase “impermanent sentient beings” is only an illustration; taking “sentient beings devoid of self-sufficient substantial reality” as an object can also be referred to as “a compassion that takes the phenomenal reality as its object.” So when the phrase “taking the phenomenal reality as its object” is used for taking sentient beings merely designated upon their phenomenal reality, {21} the modifier “mere” is left implicit.

Compassion that takes no reference as its object also does not focus merely on sentient beings; it focuses specifically on sentient beings devoid of intrinsic existence. “No reference” means no object of apprehension is clung to through the mind grasping at signs; thus it refers to absence of true existence. In this way, taking sentient beings qualified by lack of true existence as its object is referred to as “compassion that takes no reference as its object” or as “nonreferential compassion,” with the modifier “mere” left implicit.

Many Tibetan commentators assert that the second compassion itself perceives sentient beings as disintegrating moment by moment and that the third compassion itself perceives beings as devoid of intrinsic existence. These pronouncements betray a lack of correct understanding of the focal object versus the cognitive aspect of these compassions. Both of these compassions must be accepted as having a cognitive aspect wishing sentient beings to be free of suffering. If, however, momentariness and absence of intrinsic existence were asserted to be objects of their cognitive aspects, a single instance of compassion would possess — insofar as its held objects are concerned — two dissimilar cognitive aspects. This said, it is the case that to take sentient beings qualified by these two characteristics as a focal object, the person who possesses these two types of compassion within his mental continuum must first ascertain sentient beings to be momentary and devoid of intrinsic existence and, on that basis, have the aspects of these two facts appear to his mind. It is not that the compassion itself needs to perceive the beings in those two terms.
In both the root text and the Commentary, the two latter compassions are described as being qualified by the two characteristics referred to above, while the first compassion is described as having sentient beings alone as its object, with no qualification by any of these characteristics. So the phrase “compassion that takes sentient beings as its object” too involves a truncation [of the word “alone”] for the sake of expressive concision.

In view of this, those who assert that the first compassion invariably takes as its object sentient beings characterized as permanent, unitary, and autonomous are saying something untenable. Even with respect to compassion that arises in the hearts of those who have not found the view of selflessness, on many occasions it can arise simply on the basis of merely taking sentient beings as its object [without qualifying it in any terms]. In the case of those who have found the common-level view of selflessness or suchness as well, one finds within their mindstreams many instances of compassion focused on sentient beings without qualifying them in either of the two ways mentioned above. For example, with respect to someone who has eliminated the object of clinging grasping at a vase as permanent and has thus realized it as impermanent, {22} there can still be many instances where he takes the vase as his focal object but does not qualify it as impermanent. And likewise, in the case of those who have not realized the vase to be impermanent, every time they take a vase as their focal object, they need not do so by qualifying it in terms of permanence. The same is true here as well.

These three types of compassion are all — regardless of which of the three focal objects they take — endowed with the cognitive aspect wishing to protect all sentient beings from all forms of suffering. In that sense, they are all very different from the compassion of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. When such a type of compassion is produced, one comes to generate the awakening mind aspiring, “I will, by all means, attain buddhahood for the sake of all sentient beings.”
As for the compassion that is the object of salutation here, although it is the initial-stage compassion that is primary, other instances of a bodhisattva’s compassion are included within it as well. There is thus no contradiction for the Commentary describing in some contexts, such as here, the person who is generating the compassion to be a bodhisattva.[95]

Suppose one asks, “Are all three types of compassion present with respect to the compassion that is the cause of the bodhisattva who has first entered the path?” There are two possibilities. There are those of the Mahayana lineage who follow by way of understanding reality. They first seek the understanding of perfect suchness and then, following their successful establishment of the ultimate truth, generate great compassion for other sentient beings to induce the awakening mind. Then they train in the bodhisattva deeds, which constitute the conduct of a sage. In contrast, there are those of the Mahayana lineage who follow by way of faith. They are not able to realize suchness first. In the wake of generating the awakening mind, they then train in the deeds that include seeking the understanding of perfect truth.

Ornament of the Middle Way, for instance, states:
First searching for perfect understanding
and ascertaining thoroughly the ultimate truth,
they then generate [great] compassion
for the world enveloped in destructive views
and become heroic in working for others.
These wise ones for whom the mind of awakening flourishes
engage perfectly in the conduct of the sages,
which is adorned with wisdom and compassion.
Those who follow by way of perfect faith,
first generating the mind for full awakening,
they embrace the conduct of the sages
and then seek perfect understanding.[96]
So, as stated above, one can identify cases where all three types of compassion are produced prior to entering the path. With someone who has found the view of suchness first too, not only is there no contradiction in his continuing to establish the truth of suchness and training in it even during the period of training in the bodhisattva deeds, that is in fact precisely how he must proceed. {23}

Having made salutation in the above manner, no explicit promise to compose the work follows [here in root text]; but this is not a flaw. It is not unlike Nāgārjuna’s Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way or his Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning. Similarly, in other types of texts, such as the Friendly Letter, the promise to compose the text is found but there is no explicit salutation verse. Since it is with the intention to compose Entering the Middle Way that the salutation is made, the promise to compose the text is implicitly present as well.
With regard to the means to help others engage with a text, such as the text’s purpose and connections,[97] the text’s subject matter is the twofold profound and vast aspects of the path, and the text’s distinctive purpose has already been explained.[98] As for its goal, the immediate ones include putting into practice what one has understood from the meaning of the treatise up to traversing the first four paths.[99] The ultimate goal of the text is the attainment of the resultant ground of buddhahood. The goal depends upon the purpose, the purpose depends, in turn, on the treatise, and this interrelationship is their connections.

“If, in this treatise, the profound and vast paths of the bodhisattva are established by following Nāgārjuna, the question arises as to what kind of stages of the path leading to buddhahood is upheld within the savior Nāgārjuna’s system?”
The purpose of establishing the system of the second Buddha Nāgārjuna and so on by means of study and critical reflection is to ensure that we find a deep conviction in the method of practicing the perfect path so that we cannot be led astray by deceptive false paths. Those engaged in study and reflection who — however much they engage in the study of the treatises of the systems of the great charioteers — never find ascertainment with respect to their own personal practice are clearly not approaching their study and reflection in an effective manner. As such, even were they to strive hard in the Great Vehicle, they would fail to extract its value. Therefore, we must strive to understand how to traverse the stages of path. {24}
Although Nāgārjuna explains partial aspects of the path in numerous texts, three treatises present the overall body of the path, both the profound and vast aspects. As for how the Precious Garland presents the path, lines such as “the roots of this are an awakening mind” and “all the practices . . . preceded by compassion” were already cited above.[100]

In the same work, it says:
Here, to present in brief the qualities
of the bodhisattva, they are:
generosity, morality, forbearance, diligence,
meditative absorption, wisdom, compassion, and so on.
Generosity is the utter giving up of self-interest;
morality refers to working for others’ welfare;
forbearance is to relinquish hostility;
increasing positive deeds is diligence;
meditative absorption is one-pointedness with no afflictions;
wisdom is to establish the meaning of truth;
compassion is an intelligence that cares
for all beings equally as if they’re all same.
Generosity brings resources, morality happiness,
forbearance luster, diligence majesty,
meditative absorption brings tranquility, and wisdom release,
and all aims are realized with a compassionate heart.
Through simultaneous perfection of
all seven of these, without exception,
one attains lordship of world itself,
the sphere of inconceivable gnosis.[101]
The text here identifies the six perfections and explains their benefits as well. It also outlines how to train in them with the complimentary factor of compassion. In this way, [Nāgārjuna] teaches us how the awakening mind — the basis of the bodhisattva deeds — comes first and how, through these deeds, we traverse the ten grounds of a bodhisattva.

In his Praise to the Ultimate Expanse too, Nāgārjuna speaks of generating the awakening mind on the basis of going for refuge, how the ten perfections enhance the natural sphere (dhātu), and he presents the ten bodhisattva grounds as well.[102] In elaborating on this rough summary of the body of the path, Nāgārjuna speaks in his Compendium of Sutras about how finding a life of leisure and opportunity as well as finding faith in the teaching are difficult, and how, compared to these, generating of the awakening mind is even more difficult to achieve.[103] He also provides extensive explanations of topics such as how attaining great compassion for sentient beings is difficult, and how, compared to all the things mentioned earlier, it is even more difficult to achieve the elimination of the karmic obscuration borne of injuring a bodhisattva, elimination of the thought disparaging them, elimination of the acts of Māra, and elimination of the deed of abandoning sublime Dharma.[104]

Compared to the first two texts by Nāgārjuna, this work [the Compendium of Sutras] is certainly more explicit. Nonetheless, for those stages of the path that remain difficult to comprehend, Śāntideva, the great upholder of master Nāgārjuna’s tradition, presents them in both his Compendium of Training and Guide to the Bodhisattva Way. In particular, Śāntideva presents these elements of the path clearly and most extensively in his Compendium of Training, which is effectively a meaning commentary on Nāgārjuna’s Compendium of Sutras. {25} The text explains, for example, that one first contemplates the benefits of making this human life meaningful on the basis of contemplating how this life of leisure and opportunity is of great value and most difficult to find. Next, by cultivating faith in general and a firm faith based on contemplating the qualities of the Mahayana in particular, one generates the aspirational awakening mind and then upholds the vows of the engaging awakening mind. Next, one gives away, protects, purifies, and enhances one’s body, material resources, and the roots of virtue. It is on the basis of such a presentation that Nāgārjuna’s Compendium of Sutras should be explained.[105]

Āryadeva’s Four Hundred Stanzas also presents the overall body of the profound and vast aspects of the path. Furthermore, the presentations on the overall structure of the path in condensed formats found in Bhāviveka’s Essence of the Middle Way, Śāntarakṣita’s Ornament of the Middle Way, and Kamalaśīla’s Stages of the Meditation on the middle way are all similar. Therefore, when it comes to the basic framework of the path, all the great upholders of the noble Nāgārjuna’s tradition converge. As for a method that would easily bring forth ascertainment of these points, an approach that is most accessible for those on the beginner’s stage, I have presented an approach to guiding others on the path that is extremely easy to understand in my Stages of the Path to Enlightenment,[106] representing the instruction of glorious Dīpaṃkara, most learned in the systems of the two great charioteers. Thus one can learn from there.

[Question:] If this treatise presents systematically both the profound and vast aspects of the bodhisattva path as well as their results — which constitute the object of attainment — then the stages of the path of the ordinary person, which are so important for the bodhisattvas, should have been presented immediately after the salutation. But this is not the case. Instead, the text begins directly with the presentation of the grounds of ārya beings. How could this be right?
[Reply:] The stages of the path of the ordinary person were actually presented already in the context of the salutation verse, so it is not explained at this point here. By presenting the three principal causes [compassion, awakening mind, and nondual awareness] on the basis of practicing which one becomes a bodhisattva, it was shown that those who wish to enter the Great Vehicle must first cultivate these three factors. Not only must these three be practiced at the outset, they must also be practiced even after one has become a bodhisattva. Furthermore, given that gnosis not tending to duality is the principal practice of a bodhisattva, we must understand that its inclusion illustrates the need to train in the other bodhisattva practices as well.

The following passage from Nāgārjuna’s Compendium of Sutras relates to this point:
O bodhisattva, do not apply yourself to the profound nature of things divorced from skillful means. {26} For joining method and wisdom into a union is the perfect practice of bodhisattvas.[107]
You should thus train in the union of method and wisdom. Don’t be content with a partial method or wisdom, nor place your confidence in a mere single-pointedness of mind that lacks any distinctive features of method and wisdom.

I notice that some people fail to demarcate what is to be negated using reasoning that probes the nature of suchness, and they end up negating everything. They conflate all forms of thought with grasping at true existence; they relegate the entire presentation of conventional reality to what exists only from another’s perspective; they assert that on the resultant stage there is only dharmakāya, by which they mean mere suchness devoid of gnosis; and they say that the buddha’s form body (rūpakāya) exists purely within the subjective experience of spiritual trainees.[108]
For those who make such assertions, all these facts — how, on the basis of scriptural authority and reasoning, śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are born from sovereign sages, buddhas are in turn born from bodhisattvas, and so on — will not constitute standpoints of Entering the Middle Way. Furthermore, the three factors to be cultivated would be posited merely from the standpoint of others and thus would not represent the Madhyamaka’s own perspective. In so doing they would be denigrating all the paths that they themselves need to practice. Moreover, all the statements about how sentient beings, who lack intrinsic existence, revolve in cyclic existence through six factors that parallel features of a waterwheel will become nothing but a series of contradictions. Recognize, therefore, that such proponents are peddling a distorted exposition of the meaning of the treatise, starting right from its salutation verses.
Understanding that even with respect to the training in generosity and so on presented in the context of the grounds of the āryas, there are many deeds that need to be practiced from the start, right from the level of the ordinary person, we should strive to engage in their practice from this very moment.

The explanation here of eleven grounds such as the Perfect Joy is based on the following passage in the Precious Garland, where a broad presentation of ten or eleven grounds is given:
Just as eight śrāvaka grounds
are taught in the Śrāvaka Vehicle,
ten bodhisattva grounds
are found in the Great Vehicle.[109] {27}
Candrakīrti also bases his presentation on the Ten Grounds Sutra. Here, the characterization of the ten grounds such as Perfect Joy as the “ten awakening minds” must be understood in terms of the ultimate awakening mind. The Commentary characterizes the nature of the ten grounds as the ultimate awakening mind in the following:
When the uncontaminated gnosis of bodhisattvas, which is sustained by compassion and so on, is divided in terms of its facets, it acquires the name ground, for it constitutes the locus of the qualities.[110]
In the above, the ground [i.e., uncontaminated gnosis] is explained through four factors — (1) its nature, (2) what sustains it thoroughly, (3) how it acquires the name ground, and (4) the etymology of its name.

Some explain the nature of uncontaminated gnosis using the definition found in the Treasury of Abhidharma in terms of “not suitable for enhancing contamination.”[111] This suggests a lack of understanding of the unique meaning of what it means to be uncontaminated according to this system [of Candrakīrti]. Our own position is this: “What is contaminated is tainted either by ignorance grasping at true existence or by the imprints of such ignorance. The gnosis free of such a taint is uncontaminated.” This is as stated in Candrakīrti’s Clear Words:
From the perspective of the nature that is the object of uncontaminated gnosis free of the obscuring cataract of ignorance, [things do not exist].[112]
Until the attainment of the buddha’s ground, the only mental state not tainted by imprints of ignorance is the nonconceptual gnosis of an ārya in meditative equipoise. Such gnosis comes about only intermittently, for when āryas rise from their meditative equipoise, their mental states are once again tainted by the imprints of ignorance. The taint of ignorance exists up until the seventh ground. The stain of ignorance itself disappears for those on the eighth ground and up as well as for the two types of arhats, since the pollutant ignorance has ceased, but they still possess taints in the form of residual imprints of ignorance. Again, when the Commentary refers to the first ground as “that which bears the name of nondual wisdom,”[113] it’s saying that the gnosis is free of dualistically perceiving subject and object as separate from each other. It is not referring merely to a gnosis free of the two extremes.[114]

This master, on numerous occasions in his writings, speaks of “wisdom and gnosis free of the cataract of ignorance.” Therefore, when those who take ignorance and its imprints to be universal properties of awareness assert that when these two [ignorance and its imprints] cease, gnosis too becomes no more, and maintain that such is the standpoint of this master, they are in fact committing serious denigration [of the master]. For this is similar to the view of the non-Buddhist Mīmāṃsakas, who maintain that when the pollutants are exhausted, the mind too comes to cease. The claim that there is no gnosis during an ārya’s meditative equipoise is also similar to that view. {28} In the Precious Garland too it states:
Therefore one becomes free by seeing thus.
“By what means does one see?”[115]
Conventionally, I say “by the mind.”[116]
Here, in response to the question “Through what kind of subjective act does one perceive suchness directly?” it is stated that the mind directly perceives suchness on the conventional level. Also the Praise to the Ultimate Expanse states:
It is just as body armor is cleansed by fire,
for when armor tainted by all kinds of stains
is placed in a blazing fire,
its stains are burned but not the armor.
Likewise with this luminous mind
ridden with stains born of desire —
the fire of gnosis burns the stains
but not the luminous mind itself.[117]
The above states that, just as when chain-mail armor is placed in a fire, the fire burns off the stains but not the armor itself, likewise, when the stains of the mind are burned off by the fire of wisdom, only the stains are burned; the luminous mind is not incinerated.

The gnosis of meditative equipoise of ārya bodhisattvas and the gnosis of meditative equipoise of ārya śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are equal when it comes to realizing the ultimate nature of things directly, without any taint from the imprints of ignorance. The reason one type of gnosis is defined as an ārya bodhisattva ground while the other is not is owing to whether one has come under the sway of great compassion and whether one is endowed with the power of the twelve hundred sets of qualities. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, there is a tremendous difference between them in terms of whether, during the paths of accumulation and path of preparation, one has enhanced one’s intelligence in relation to the truth of the two types of selflessness through employing limitless forms of reasoning.
The phrase [from the Commentary cited above] “when . . . divided in terms of its facets” means that it is one and the same uncontaminated gnosis — which is the whole — that is being differentiated in terms of stages, with earlier and latter parts becoming the individual facets. These are referred to as grounds because they serve as the locus, or basis, for the bodhisattva’s qualities. They resemble the ground in this sense, and hence the epithet “ground.” These statements indicate that all ten ultimate grounds are to be posited on the basis of nonconceptual gnosis alone.

Although they are all equal in being nonconceptual gnosis, the manner in which the grounds such as Perfect Joy are defined as distinct grounds is by means of the following four features:
1. The first distinctive feature arises on the basis of progressive increment in the number of qualities, such that there exists the set of twelve qualities in hundredfold on the first ground, the set of twelve in thousandfold on the second, and so on; these will be described below.
2. The second distinctive feature pertains to the ever-increasing enhancement of excellent power. Although some describe this in terms of the shaking of a hundred realms, a thousand realms, and so on, this ability is included in the increment of the number of qualities.[118] {29} It thus appears to pertain instead to the ever-increasing power of the individual grounds — their power to cleanse pollutants and traverse the path.
3. The third pertains to the feature of excellence with respect to the perfections — excellence in the perfection of generosity on the first ground, excellence in the perfection of morality on the second ground, and so on.
4. The fourth distinctive feature pertains to the ever-enhancing fruitional effects. This might mean, on the first ground, being born as a monarch that reigns over the earth; on the second ground, being born as a monarch that reigns over the four continents; and so on.

Thus, with respect to the nonconceptual gnosis of the individual grounds, given the great variety in their potency, such as in the number of qualities they possess, these grounds are defined as distinct. Nevertheless, since the qualities in the intervals between meditative equipoise of individual grounds must also be included as part of these respective grounds, these grounds should not be defined by their meditative equipoise alone. It is in this manner the individual grounds must be distinguished, even though these ultimate grounds do not differ whatsoever in their object or aspect of cognition. The Ten Grounds Sutra states:
Just as wise men cannot speak of or see
the traces of birds soaring across the sky,
the same is true of the grounds of the Conqueror’s children.
And if one cannot speak of them, how can one hear of them?[119]
Although birds soar through the empty skies, the wise people of the world cannot describe in words the traces of these birds; nor can they perceive such traces with their mind. Likewise, although the ultimate grounds, analogous to the birds, soar across the space-like ultimate nature of things, āryas themselves cannot express how these grounds are traversed exactly the way they experience it, and so those who are listening to it certainly cannot hear it exactly as seen. This is stated in the sutra passage above.

The bodhisattva on the first ground has seen beings to be devoid of intrinsic existence and has taken this absence of intrinsic existence to qualify his object of compassion in the manner described earlier, and his mind falls under great compassion’s sway, yearning to set free every transmigrating being. On the ground that bears the name Perfect Joy, he abides through intense dedication of all his virtues with the bodhisattva Samantabhadra’s prayers. This ultimate [awakening] mind of the bodhisattva who thoroughly abides in such nondual gnosis, which is illustrated by its fruits such as its number of qualities, is known as the first supramundane mind.
The countless hundreds of thousands of aspirational prayers made by the bodhisattva on the first ground, such as the ten great aspirational prayers mentioned in the Ten Grounds Sutra, are all encompassed in Samantabhadra’s prayers. To indicate all aspirational prayers, the root text mentions “Samantabhadra’s prayers,” which refers to the Vows of Good Conduct.[120] In particular, the Compendium of Training describes the two stanzas that begin with the words “Just as the heroic Mañjuśrī” in this prayer as the unexcelled dedication.[121]

In the Commentary, one finds the following statement:
Just as one does not assert that a śrāvaka on the path of preparation has entered the first fruit [of stream entry], similarly, even the greatest of the great stage that engages by means of imagination on the bodhisattva path [of preparation] — from where the first ground would imminently spring forth — this too is a ground where the bodhisattva’s awakening mind is not yet generated.[122]
What the above citation means is that this is a stage where the ultimate awakening mind has not yet been generated. Generally speaking, however, as I explained above, it is accepted in this [Madhyamaka] tradition that even from a stage lower than this [path of preparation], the mind for unexcelled awakening has already been generated and there are bodhisattvas below this level. Śāntideva’s Compendium of Training, too, establishes by means of numerous sutra citations the presence of the awakening mind in ordinary beings. So those who assert that such beings are not actual but only mere facsimiles of bodhisattvas are engaging in false explanations.

Here one might contend, “The Compendium of Abhidharma describes the stage of entry to the fruit of stream entry as the point when, on the śrāvaka path of preparation, a single sitting would lead to the attainment of the first fruition.[123] So the analogy you have cited above [about the śrāvaka path] does not hold.”
Vasubandhu’s Treasury of Abhidharma states that the stage of entry to stream entry is attained on the ārya level, whereas the Compendium of Abhidharma presents it differently, as cited above. {31} Of these two divergent positions, this master [Candrakīrti] accords with the Treasury of Abhidharma. He also accords with what is described in the Compendium of Sutras as follows. Compared to someone offering, on a daily basis, heavenly nourishment endowed with hundredfold flavor and heavenly garments to trainees following by way of faith as numerous as the atoms in the entire universe, a person offering a single meal for a single day to a trainee following by way of reality generates incalculable and far greater merit. Again, compared to someone making similar offerings to trainees following by way of reality as numerous as the followers of faith in the preceding example, another person who offers a single meal for a single day to a person on the eighth stage generates incalculable and far greater merit.[124] These two types of trainees are clearly on the path of accumulation and path of preparation [and not on the ārya level].

From that point on, the bodhisattva having entered this first ground has attained the ultimate [awakening] mind. At this time when he has transcended the stage of ordinary person, he is hailed by the name ultimate bodhisattva alone. He should no longer be referred to by characterizations not consonant with this title, for he is, by then, an ārya bodhisattva.
The Commentary cites the Cloud of Jewels Sutra where it states that someone on the great stage of supreme mundane dharma on the path of preparation has not attained the ultimate bodhisattva ground,[125] so from this we can understand that the title bodhisattva being designated here is in the sense of a specific meaning. The Perfection of Wisdom in Twenty-Five Thousand Lines states:
How does one understand this? Regarding things that have not yet come into being, those that have not perfectly come into being, and those that have ceased, {32} they relate to these not in a manner imputed by childish ordinary beings nor in a manner obtained by childish ordinary beings. Therefore they are called bodhisattvas.[126]
What the above conveys indirectly is that bodhisattvas find the suchness of these phenomena, just as in the manner found by the āryas. Here too the intended referent is ultimate bodhisattvas. This sutra passage is not suggesting there are no genuine bodhisattvas on the stages of ordinary beings.

Furthermore, this bodhisattva who abides on the first ground, because he has gone well beyond all the grounds of an ordinary person as well as those of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, and because the path that is certain to lead to the ground of buddhahood has arisen within his mental continuum, is born into the lineage of the tathāgatas as well. No longer embarking on other paths, his lineage is confirmed within his own path. Since on the first ground he directly perceives the selflessness of persons — that the person lacks existence by virtue of its own characteristic — he has utterly purged the three binding factors: (1) the identity view, (2) the tendency (anuśaya) to doubt, and (3) the grasping at false views as supreme and at inferior discipline and conduct as superior; that is, that they will no longer arise for him. This indicates that their seeds have been relinquished and that the identity view [referred to here] is the acquired kind, which is an object of elimination on the path of seeing, and not the innate one.
One might ask, “Given that he has rid himself of other negative tendencies as well, tendencies that are objects of elimination by the path of seeing, why are only these three mentioned?”
[Reply:] There appear to be two opinions on the interpretation of the intent of this statement from the sutra. Of these two, the better one is the one presented in the Treasury of Abhidharma where it says:
Not wanting to go, choosing a wrong path,
and harboring doubts about the path —
these obstruct the journey to liberation;
therefore these three are stated.[127]

For someone who wishes to travel to another place, for example, there are three main obstacles — not wanting to go, choosing the wrong road, and harboring doubts about one’s road. The journey to liberation, similarly, {33} has three principal obstacles. Due to the first [identity view], one comes to fear liberation and does not want to travel there. Due to the third [grasping at false views and false morality as superior], one relies on contrary paths and chooses the wrong path. Due to the second [afflicted doubt], one harbors doubt about one’s path. Therefore these three were listed.
This bodhisattva on the first ground, having entered a confirmed lineage as described above, obtains the qualities that result from this and becomes free from the faults that are eliminated by this ground. As such, a unique joy arises within him. And because he experiences abundance of perfect joy, such a bodhisattva upholds the state that constitutes supreme joy. Possessing extraordinary perfect joy, this ground is known also as Perfect Joy. [On this ground] he has the power to shake a hundred different worlds.

Rejoicing greatly in stepping on from the first ground to the second ground, the bodhisattva travels perfectly to the higher grounds. When the first ground is attained, at that point, for this bodhisattva, the paths to all the lower realms are blocked or have come to an end.
One might ask, “After attaining the peak stage of the path of preparation, isn’t it impossible for someone to fall to the lower realms due to karma? If so, why is the ending of the path to the lower realms contingent upon attaining this ground?”
[Reply:] The fact that it is impossible to go to the lower realms after attaining the peak stage is not because the seeds that lead to them have been destroyed by their antidotes. Rather, it is because no adequate conditions can converge any more. Here on this first ground, in contrast, this is because their seeds have been destroyed by their antidotes. The Compendium of Abhidharma too describes the aggregates and elements of the lower realms as objects to be eliminated by the path of seeing.[128] At the point when the bodhisattva attains the first ground, all the grounds or states of ordinary persons cease for him.

Let alone on the second and subsequent grounds of the mind for full awakening, even when abiding on the first ground, through the power of his merit of conventional awakening mind and compassion, he surpasses, that is to say outshines, śrāvakas who are born from the sage’s speech and the pratyekabuddhas. And his merit increases ever more, unlike those two. This then is another distinctive quality of the bodhisattva beyond the qualities mentioned above. In relation to this, the Liberating Story of Maitreya Sutra states:
Child of the lineage, it is like this. The son of a king born not long ago bears the name of royalty, and because of the greatness of his family lineage, he outshines the entire assembly of senior and chief ministers at court. Likewise, the bodhisattva on the beginner’s stage who has generated awakening mind not so long ago has been born into the lineage of the sovereigns of Dharma, the tathāgatas. Because of his awakening mind and compassion, he outshines the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas who have practiced pure conduct over a long time.[129] {35}
Child of the lineage, it is like this. The newborn offspring of a garuḍa, the king of birds, has qualities — strength of wings, total clarity of vision, and so on — that do not exist in mature birds of all other breeds. Likewise, a bodhisattva who has generated the first ground of the awakening mind and has thus perfectly penetrated the ongoing lineage of the great garuḍa-like tathāgatas has qualities — the powerful wings of his generation of awakening mind aspiring for the omniscient state, a power eclipsing others like the wings of a garuḍa offspring, and the clarity of his vision of utterly pure altruistic intention — that do not exist in śrāvakas or in all the pratyekabuddhas that have definitely shunned cyclic existence for hundreds or for a thousand eons.[130]

Although the Explanation of the Commentary interprets the meaning of these two citations in terms of verbally derived awakening mind,[131] the phrases “on the beginner’s stage” and “having generated the mind not long ago” are to be understood in terms of ultimate awakening mind. For instance, it was mentioned above that birth in the lineage of the tathāgatas is from the first ground. In these two sutra citations, apart from the two distinct metaphors, their reference is the same. Furthermore, the meaning of these three lines of the root text (1.8a–c) appears to summarize the content of that cited sutra. As for the “awakening mind of pure altruistic intention,” many sources, including the Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras,[132] describe this as the awakening mind of the first ground.[133]
“If this is so,” one might ask, “do you deny that the conventional awakening mind of a bodhisattva on the ordinary stage outshines śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas?”
This is indeed not the meaning. For in that very sutra, it says:
Child of the lineage, it is like this: Even a broken piece of diamond, the most precious stone, still outshines all the amazing ornaments of gold. It does not lose the title “the king of all precious stones,” and it can totally relieve poverty. Likewise, O child of the lineage, the diamond that is the mind generated for the omniscient state, though it may lack power, still outshines all the golden ornaments that are the qualities of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas; [he who possesses] this does not lose the title of bodhisattva, and such a mind overcomes all the indigence of cyclic existence.[134]
In the Compendium of Training the above sutra is cited to substantiate the point that one should not disparage an awakening that is divorced from the bodhisattva deeds,[135] and that it is impossible for someone who has attained the bodhisattva grounds {36} to have an awakening mind divorced from the deeds.

When this bodhisattva on the first ground arrives at the ground of Gone Afar, in addition to outshining śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas through his conventional awakening mind, he will also surpass them especially by the power of his intelligence. This is as stated in the Ten Grounds Sutra:
Children of the conquerors, it is like this: The son of a king born into the royal lineage and bearing the name of royalty, because of the king’s majesty, outshines the entire assembly of ministers the instant he is born. He does not achieve this through his critical acumen, by the power of his intelligence. However, at the point he reaches maturity, by exercising the power of his intelligence, he totally exceeds the activities of all the ministers. Likewise, O children of conquerors, the bodhisattva, because of the greater power of his altruistic intention, outshines all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas the instant he generates the awakening mind. This is not achieved through his critical acumen, by the power of his intelligence. However, the bodhisattva on the seventh ground, since he abides with the greatness of his knowledge of the relevant object, totally exceeds all the works of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.[136]

Given that the phrase “the instant he generates the awakening mind” is being used here in the context of the first ground, it refers to the awakening mind of pure altruistic intention. So it is only from the ground of Gone Afar that the bodhisattva outshines śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas through the power of his own intelligence as well. He does not outshine them through the power of his intelligence on the sixth ground and below. The phrase “exceeding all the activities of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas” means the bodhisattva outshines these two categories of beings through his intelligence. That this is so can be understood on the basis of the Commentary’s summary statement.

In the explanation of what is meant by the power of intelligence, there is the phrase “he abides with the greatness of his knowledge of the relevant object.” This is the greatness of the bodhisattva knowing his relevant object — cessation, {37} which is the perfect endpoint.[137] On this point, (1) some assert that although there is no difference between gnosis of those on the sixth ground and below and that of the seventh with respect to their natures, the former do not possess the capacity to eliminate the obscurations to knowledge, while gnosis of the seventh ground has that capacity. “This,” they assert, “makes the difference between outshining and not outshining through intelligence.” (2) Some maintain that this difference is because from the seventh ground the bodhisattva is able to enter into meditative concentration through a process of leaping over. (3) Still others claim that the bodhisattva outshines [śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas] through his intelligence because the gnosis of the seventh ground is manifestly directed toward the irreversible eighth ground.

Of these, the first position is incorrect. For in this tradition [of Candrakīrti] it is maintained that all instances of grasping at self-existence of persons are forms of afflicted ignorance, and to eliminate this ignorance so that it cannot resurface, its seeds must be exhausted as well. Furthermore, since such elimination [of afflictions] is common with the two arhats as well, eliminating the seed of grasping at true existence does not constitute eliminating the obscurations to knowledge. As for obscurations that are in the form of residual imprints — which are distinct from seeds — identified here as “obscurations to knowledge,” their elimination does not occur until the eighth ground. Therefore, Candrakīrti’s system does not accept the presentation of those schools of thought that maintain that grasping at true existence is an obscuration to knowledge and, on that basis, elaborate nine classes of obscuration to knowledge in terms of their strength (weak, medium, and great), which are eliminated on the path of meditation — on the second ground and up. I will explain more about this point below.[138]

The second position is also incorrect. In lexicons of archaic Tibetan terms, the word for “leaping over” (thod brgal) is written also as “jumbled sequence” (snrel zhi), which refers to a conflation of sequence. There is no explanatory basis as to why entering into meditative concentrations through such a [leaping-over] process would not be found on the sixth ground and below but would be present only from the seventh ground onward.

<d e="2">
The third position is incorrect as well, because the question of why bodhisattvas on the sixth ground and below do not outshine [śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas] through their realization and why they can do so on the seventh ground is still left unresolved. So this third explanation amounts to citing the subject of an argument as its proof of demonstration!

The Explanation of the Commentary states that there is exertion on the seventh ground because there stills exists the thought “I will enter the path.” Yet because the bodhisattva does not engage with signs, such as reading or listening to teachings such as the sutras, he has attained the path of signlessness. In contrast, those on the sixth ground and below as well as śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas lack such signlessness. Thus the bodhisattva outshines [śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas] through intelligence on the seventh ground.[139]
Be that as it may, I feel that this differentiation has to be associated with the realization of suchness. This too must be made in terms of entering into and rising out of suchness, the perfect endpoint. As will be explained below in the chapter on the seventh ground, it is on this ground and above that the bodhisattva is able to enter into and arise out of cessation, the perfect endpoint within each and every moment of cognition. {38} This is not possible on the lower grounds. This is what my precious teacher says, and it is an excellent explanation.[140] On the paths where one engages suchness by means of imagination, given that in such a meditative concentration on emptiness one’s mind and suchness have not fused into a single taste, it is not difficult to enter and rise out of such meditative states within short moments. But on the ārya stage, where one’s mind has fused with suchness like water poured into water, this mode of entering into and arising out of emptiness within a short moment is extremely difficult.

You might be wondering, “Why are we discussing how on the seventh ground śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are outshone through intelligence when the context here is a description of the qualities of the first ground?”
[Reply:] The fault of conflating contexts does not apply. The presentations in this text on the first ground and so on are based on the Ten Grounds Sutra, and that sutra clarifies that one abiding on the first ground outshines śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas through his conventional awakening mind and not through his ultimate awakening mind. Then, to help dispel the qualm “Well then, from what ground does the bodhisattva outshine the others through his realization?” it explains that he would outshine the others through his realization starting from the seventh ground. This statement from the sutra is presented here in [Candrakīrti’s] text as well, so you should know that the context is perfectly appropriate.

On the basis of this citation from the Ten Grounds Sutra, where it states that on the sixth ground and below the bodhisattva cannot outshine śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas through his realization, it can be clearly determined that śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas also possess the knowledge that phenomena lack intrinsic existence. Without such wisdom then, like the seers who become free of attachment toward all levels [cyclic existence] except the peak of existence through the mundane path [viewing the realms of existence in terms] of gradations of refinement, śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha arhats too would be outshone through his realization, even by the bodhisattva who has generated the first ground of the ultimate awakening mind. {39} This would be so because śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas would lack the knowledge that things lack intrinsic existence.
The [Commentary’s] statement that “Otherwise, like non-Buddhist seers, śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas would not have eliminated all the afflictions pertaining to the three realms along with their seeds”[141] indicates that if śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have not familiarized themselves with emptiness by perfectly realizing it, they will not have destroyed the seeds of afflictions, and their paths will resemble the mundane path that views the realms of existence in comparative terms of fine and coarse.

Furthermore, śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, by lacking the realization of suchness, would then objectify the aggregates of form and so on as real, and their minds would continue to be distorted. In that case, their realization of the selflessness of persons would be superficial and incomplete, for they would not have eradicated the mind that perceives the aggregates — the basis for conceiving self or personhood — as real. This suggests that if one has not eradicated the object of apprehension in relation to grasping at the aggregates — the designative bases — as real, one will also have not eradicated the object of apprehension in relation to grasping at the person — the designated attribute — as real. In that case, Candrakīrti’s text shows, since one would have not realized the person to be empty of true existence, one then would have also not realized genuine selflessness of persons in its entirety.

[Question:] “It is certainly the case that one can and does establish by means of a valid cognition the sixteen characteristics of the four noble truths, such as impermanence and selflessness — the latter here understood in terms of the absence of a substantially existing self-sufficient person that is neither identical with nor separate from the aggregates.[142] When this happens, it will also emerge that the principal trainees of such a path will come to cultivate great familiarity with such understanding of selflessness. And if this can happen, then a direct realization of the selflessness of persons can be established through the reasoning that proves how yogic direct perception is possible.[143] If so, it will then follow that such a path of seeing realizing such selflessness can eliminate the acquired afflictions. When this is established, then the path of meditation, wherein the selflessness of persons that has already been directly seen is made familiar, becomes established as well. This means then that such a path can eliminate even the innate afflictions, thus establishing the possibility of the cessation of all contaminant afflictions. In that case, it would follow that even without realizing emptiness, one can eliminate all the afflictions of the three realms together with their seeds. This would be so because the eliminations effected by means of the two paths — the path of seeing and the path of meditation — would have taken place in the manner of, as described above, eliminating [afflictions] through supramundane path. Therefore, even with the path contemplating the sixteen characteristics such as impermanence, {40} all the afflictions can be eliminated.”

[Reply:] Let me explain it like this. We do not say that, if one has not found the view of suchness, it would be impossible to establish the truth of sixteen characteristics such as impermanence by means of valid cognition, or that the principal trainees of these paths cannot meditate upon them with great effort and, on the basis of such meditation, directly perceive the coarse level of selflessness and achieve familiarity with what they have perceived.

[Reply:] We say the path described thus does not constitute a genuine comprehensive realization of the selflessness of persons. As such, this path is neither the supramundane path of seeing nor the supramundane path of meditation, and therefore it cannot eliminate the seeds of the objects of elimination by either the path of seeing or the path of meditation. Here the tradition [of Candrakīrti] would be to interpret such presentations — those statements about how such paths constitute the paths of seeing and meditation, how they eliminate the objects of relinquishment together with their seeds, how at the end of these two paths one attains the arhat’s state, and so on — as provisional teachings. This is analogous to the following example.
One might allow that Cittamātra’s negation of indivisible atoms and external objects composed through aggregation of such atoms, as well as its negation of a subject that possesses a substance different from its objects, can be established by means of valid cognition. Furthermore, one might allow that if a trainee tamed by such an approach were to cultivate familiarity with these truths he has perceived over a long period, he could come to have direct insight and that what was seen could be made familiar. However, the statements about how one can traverse the ten bodhisattva grounds as well as the three final stages of the path on that basis — these a Mādhyamika will interpret as provisional. The same is true of the example cited above.

Although one meditates on the sixteen characteristics such as impermanence, it is the realization of selflessness of persons as defined above that is asserted [by the other Buddhist schools] to be the actual path that frees one from the afflictions. The Compendium of Abhidharma, for example, explains how it is the focused mentation of selflessness that eliminates the afflictions, while the [fifteen] other characteristics are for helping to thoroughly purify the afflictions.[144] In line with this, the Exposition of Valid Cognition states:
One is freed through the view of emptiness;
the other contemplations support that.[145]

Misled by the phrase “the view of emptiness” here, even some Indian masters assert that this refers to the view realizing suchness.[146] This is decidedly not the meaning. Here it refers to the view realizing the person as empty of self-sufficient substantial reality. Such a path cannot eliminate the seeds of afflictions, but it can temporarily relieve manifest afflictions. For if we admit, as was stated above, that the path that compares realms of existence in terms of level of refinement — a path shared with non-Buddhists — can eliminate manifest afflictions below the peak of existence, then there is no question that the path referred to above can also temporarily relieve manifest afflictions. The afflictions here in the phrase “temporarily relieve manifest afflictions” {41} are the afflictions characterized by objects and aspects as defined in the two Abhidharma systems.[147] In regard to afflictions not mentioned in the Abhidharma systems — such as the grasping at true existence that, in Candrakīrti’s tradition, is said to be a form of afflicted ignorance, as well as other afflictions defined from this standpoint consisting both of cognitive and noncognitive forms — even their manifest levels cannot be eliminated [by the path described above]. That said, there is indeed this difference. Although manifest afflictions present on the peak of existence cannot be eliminated by the mundane path that compares realms in terms of their refinement, they can be eliminated through cultivating familiarity with the realization of the coarse selflessness of persons as defined above [in the Abhidharma system].
With these, I have explained clearly the Commentary’s statements on how paths divorced from the realization of suchness that are yet claimed to be antidotes against the afflictions are similar to mundane paths that trace the levels of refinement of the realms of existence and how, like those of non-Buddhists, these paths cannot eliminate all the afflictions.[148]

This standpoint is also maintained by the great bodhisattva Śāntideva. His Guide to the Bodhisattva Way poses the following question:
It’s through seeing the truths one is freed;
what need is there then to see emptiness?[149]
[The questioner is arguing:] “One becomes free from the afflictions through the path seeing the four noble truths and their sixteen characteristics such as impermanence. Therefore it is not necessary to see emptiness in order to eliminate the afflictions.” Responding to such an objection, Śāntideva writes:
For the scriptures state
that without this path there is no awakening.[150]
Śāntideva states here that, without this path of seeing the emptiness of intrinsic existence, there is no attaining any of the three types of enlightenment. How this is stated in the scriptures is explained by the great commentary on Guide to the Bodhisattva Way, which cites the mother [Perfection of Wisdom] sutras that speak of how there is no liberation for those who perceive real entities, and how from stream entry to pratyekabuddhahood past, present, and future, all of these states are attained through the perfection of wisdom alone.[151] So taking the word “awakening” in the second line in the above quote [as some do] to refer only to the unexcelled awakening [of a buddha] is not the meaning.

Then the four lines beginning “Since the true monk is the root of the Dharma”[152] also present how a path that involves a mind infected by objectification through grasping at true existence cannot lead to attainment of nirvana. Next, one reads:
If one is freed through elimination of the afflictions,
then it should happen immediately afterward.[153]
Here the line “If one is freed through elimination of the afflictions” presents the opponent’s position. The meaning of this line should be explained in the same sense as the line “It’s through seeing the truth one is freed” — in terms of the query “If one becomes free from the afflictions through the path seeing the four noble truths and their sixteen characteristics such as impermanence . . .” {42} This is because the context here is about whether freedom from the afflictions can be attained through the path of the sixteen characteristics such as impermanence alone. That this is so is clear also from the argument in the line “It’s through seeing the truths . . .”[154]

In view of the above, it is definitely incorrect to explain these lines as an approach whereby, while accepting that the afflictions can be eliminated through the path of sixteen characteristics such as impermanence alone, one still maintains that this path cannot bring freedom from all suffering. The correct meaning intended here is this: When those afflictions defined in common with the two śrāvaka schools [Vaibhāṣika and Sautrāntika] temporarily cease to manifest for some practitioners because they generated the path of four noble truths and sixteen characteristics described above, if this were to truly constitute freedom from the afflictions, then such persons should attain total cessation of all contaminations immediately after such a temporary elimination of manifest afflictions. [Such is not the case, however.] This is how the opponent’s position is refuted here. That such a consequence cannot be accepted is explained in the following:
Though they possess no afflictions,
one sees in them the potency of karma.[155]
Although such practitioners possess no manifest afflictions, because of their karma, a potency to propel future births can still be discerned.

Thus these lines [from Guide to the Bodhisattva Way] should be explained in the above way. Some Indian commentaries as well as some Tibetans interpret these lines as follows. Although Maudgalyāyana, the ārya Aṅgulimāla, and the like do not possess afflictions, one can see in them the results of karma accumulated by causing suffering when they were ordinary beings, and thus they do not attain freedom immediately. This interpretation is incorrect. Here, the potency to produce suffering within this lifetime is not the issue, it is the potency of karma to propel future births; there is no true freedom if this has not ceased. This is how the texts should be explained.

Again, one reads:
Like the meditative attainment of no-perception,
the mind divorced from emptiness,
though ceased, will arise again.[156]
If one is divorced from the realization of emptiness, the mind ridden with afflictions may have ceased for a while through practicing other paths, but as they have not been permanently turned away, the afflictions will resurface in a manifest manner. As such the circling in cyclic existence under the power of karma would persist. The statement that there is a temporary stoppage of the afflicted mind is to be understood as explained above — as a temporary elimination of manifest afflictions.

Now, to present the opponent’s response to the line, “One sees in them the potency of karma,” the text reads:
If one asserts, “It is certain that they’ve
no craving that leads to appropriation,”[157]
“Since, by that path, the craving that appropriates future births is brought to an end, it is certain that they do not take future births under the power of karma.” {43} In response to this, Śāntideva writes:
Though this craving may be unafflicted,
might it yet exist like ignorance?[158]
Śāntideva’s response here is this: “Just as the opponent accepts there to be two types of ignorance — one that is an affliction in the sense defined in the Abhidharma and another type that is not — cannot he also accept, with respect to craving, one type that is an affliction in the sense defined in the Abhidharma and another type that is not?” The suggestion here is that there is a form of craving that is not an affliction in the sense commonly assented to both by the two śrāvaka schools and by the Mahayana. This does not mean, however, that such a craving is not accepted to be an affliction in Śāntideva’s own tradition. Therefore, the meaning is this: Such beings may have temporarily eliminated the manifest craving brought about by grasping at a self of persons as a self-sufficient substantial reality, but they may still possess a craving brought about by the identity view grasping at the person as existing by way of its own essence. Thus, for those who have eliminated the manifest levels in the manner described above, when it comes to this latter identity view and craving, even their manifest levels persist.

Now, insofar as when the manifest afflictions are eliminated the roots of these afflictions persist, it is the same for both of these two traditions [Abhidharma and Candrakīrti’s]. If no difference were found [between the two systems] as to the presence or absence of the manifest levels, it would be pointless to distinguish different types of craving.
Next, the text reads:
Craving is conditioned by feeling,
and feeling is present in them too.[159]
These lines explain why craving will not come to end for one who has eliminated manifest afflictions on the basis of other paths. Without the view realizing suchness, he will not eliminate the ignorance grasping at the true existence of feelings, not even to a small degree. In that case, when a pleasurable feeling has arisen in him, why would craving in the form of longing not to be separated from it not arise in him? And when an unpleasant feeling has arisen, why would craving that longs to be separated from it not arise for him? For it is certain that effects will ensue from a cause when all the favorable conditions have gathered and there are no obstacles.

The way we explain how craving in relation to feeling is brought to an end is as presented in Guide to the Bodhisattva Way:
When there is no one who feels
nor any feelings either,
at that point, given this situation,
why would craving not come to an end?[160]
These lines explain how, when one habitually sees that nothing — neither the one who feels nor the feelings themselves — has intrinsic existence, craving will come to an end. These lines also indicate that, if one lacks such a path, there is no reason why all craving would come to an end. The same meaning is conveyed in the Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning:
In those whose mind possesses a locus,
why would the grave poison of afflictions not arise?[161]

The earlier statement about there being craving because of the presence of feeling was criticized by {44} Chapa and Tsek Wangchuk Sengé. They asserted that this is a not a sound reasoning, for it involves inferring an effect on the basis of the presence of a cause. In this way they refute Guide to the Bodhisattva Way.[162] They engaged in such refutation for the following reasons. Between the two schools of thought on whether or not śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas realize the selflessness of phenomena, the latter standpoint was more prevalent in Tibet, and as such people were more familiar with that tradition, and they have not engaged in a comprehensive study of the scriptural sources and the reasoning of the first school of thought. They have therefore failed to appreciate the finer points of the most profound style of philosophical reasoning [of Candrakīrti]. In this way, they naively attributed faults to those who are highly learned. This is a grave error. Similarly, some Tibetans apparently raised criticisms against Candrakīrti.[163] Here too, these are gratuitous objections leveled without a careful understanding of the opponent’s position; they only betray the person’s true nature, one that would be a source of deep embarrassment were it to be seen by the learned ones.

Understood thus, the Explanation of the Commentary’s assertion that the path of sixteen characteristics, such as impermanence, can eliminate the acquired afflictions but not the innate ones remains incorrect as well.[164] For insofar as temporary cessation of mere manifest afflictions acknowledged commonly by all three vehicles [of śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, and bodhisattva] is concerned, this is the same for both the acquired as well as the innate. And as for not eliminating their seeds is concerned, this is also the same for both acquired and innate afflictions. The author of the Explanation seems to have failed to understand here how to demonstrate that the intentions of Candrakīrti and Śāntideva remain the same.

Now, if one has not realized the aggregates’ lack of true existence, one will not realize the person’s lack of true existence, in which case one would then not have realized the selflessness of persons. Just as the emptiness of true existence of the aggregates and so on is defined as the selflessness of phenomena, the emptiness of true existence of persons must be defined as the selflessness of persons. The reason is identical in both contexts. Understood thus, grasping at a true existence of persons must be defined as grasping at the self-existence of persons. Until this is extinguished, afflictions cannot be completely extinguished. And moreover, the grasping at the true existence of persons and phenomena must be characterized as forms of affliction. This exact standpoint must be attributed to the tradition of Śāntideva as well.

The Discourse for Sthīrādhyāśa, as cited in the Clear Words, says:
“For example, when the musical spell of a magician is heard, some, seeing a woman conjured by the magician, {45} experience lustful thoughts. His mind driven by desire, he becomes self-conscious among his companions, and feeling embarrassed, he leaves his seat and walks away. Having thus gone away, if he now engages in contemplating that woman as unattractive, transient, dissatisfying, and empty and devoid of selfhood, O child of the lineage, what would you think of this? Is this person proceeding in the right manner, or is he proceeding in a distorted way?”
“Blessed One, when there is no such woman, the striving of that person who engages in contemplating her as unattractive, transient, dissatisfying, and empty and devoid of selfhood is a distortion.”
The Blessed One then responded: “Here too, O child of the lineage, you should view those monks and nuns as well as some male and female lay disciples who engage in contemplation of phenomena that are unborn and unoriginated as unattractive, as transient, as dissatisfying, and as empty and devoid of selfhood to be likewise. I do not say that these foolish people are practicing on the path, for they should be described as proceeding with distortion.”[165]

Here, a parallel is drawn between someone grasping at an illusory woman as an actual woman and contemplating her impermanence and so on, on the one hand, and someone grasping at the aggregates to be real and contemplating their being impermanent and so on, on the other. To draw an analogy between the two requires instances where one takes real aggregates as one’s object of focus and contemplates their impermanence and so on. Since this is a distorted state of mind, erroneous in relation to its apprehended object, its content is of course not established by valid cognition. However, within the mental continuum of a person who has not yet eradicated the apprehended object of grasping at true existence, there can still be numerous instances where he takes the aggregates as his object without qualifying them either as true or false and, on that basis, establishes their impermanence and so on by means of valid cognition, again without qualifying these as either true or false. When one meditates upon these facts as well, similarly, stages of the path [realizing impermanence, and so on] will arise in his mental continuum [unqualified] in a manner described above.

Again, the Concealing the Concentrations Sutra, as cited in the Clear Words, states:
Mañjuśrī, as they do not see the noble truths perfectly as they are, sentient beings whose minds have become erroneous through the four distortions will not transcend this imperfect cycle of existence.[166]
To this, Mañjuśrī responds with the appeal, “O Blessed One, pray reveal to us {46} what is it that if perceived prevents sentient beings from transcending cyclic existence.”
Thus, in response to the Buddha’s statement that it is through not understanding perfectly the four truths as they are that sentient beings fail to transcend cyclic existence, Mañjuśrī asks, “Do tell us what point and in what manner of perceiving it prevents sentient beings from transcending cyclic existence.” The Buddha replies that if one meditates on impermanence and so on with the thoughts “I will transcend cyclic existence” and “I will attain nirvana,” conceptualizing these in terms of clinging to them as real, then the thoughts “I have understood suffering,” “I have eliminated its origins,” “I have actualized the cessation,” and “I have cultivated the path” will arise, and he will come to think, “I have become an arhat.” So when he succeeds in temporarily eliminating manifest afflictions, as discussed earlier, the thought will arise in him that all contaminations have now ceased. However, at the time of his death, when he sees that he is going to take a rebirth after all, he will engender doubt toward the Buddha, and as a consequence of this damaging thought, the sutra states, he will be reborn in the great hells. This refers, of course, to only a few among those who are abiding on such a path; it does not apply to all of them.

Next, when Mañjuśrī inquires, “How does one realize the four noble truths?” he is following up on what was stated earlier — that one must realize the four truths perfectly as they are. In response, the sutra says:
O Mañjuśrī, he who sees all mental formations as unborn thoroughly recognizes suffering. He who sees all things as not coming into being has eliminated all its origins. He who sees all phenomena as permanently transcending sorrow has actualized cessation. He who sees all phenomena as utterly unborn has cultivated the path.[167]
In this way, the sutra explains how, through this path, free of appropriation, one transcends sorrow. This presents very clearly how it is seeing the four truths as devoid of intrinsic existence that frees one from cyclic existence, and how the path undivorced from grasping at true existence cannot help transcend cyclic existence. It therefore demonstrates how the path of the four truths and their sixteen characteristics such as impermanence alone cannot eliminate the seeds of afflictions and how, to eliminate these, one must meditate on the truth of “the way things really are” on the basis of realizing it.

Now if one fails to distinguish these points properly, one might hold that śrāvakas possess merely the path meditating upon sixteen characteristics such as impermanence and assert that ārya śrāvakas and śrāvaka arhats {47} are not genuine āryas and genuine arhats. In this way, one might accumulate the grave negative karma of denigrating the āryas. And if the one who is uttering such things happens to possess the bodhisattva vow, he will accrue a root infraction as well. The Compendium of Training, for example, describes this act as a root infraction:
“The vehicle of trainees does not
eliminate attachment and so on”: one holds
and causes others to hold the same.[168]

The statement “If one grasps at the one who has attained the stream enterer’s ground as well as the attained fruit as real and engenders the thought ‘I have attained stream entry,’ this would constitute grasping at his self-existence” suggests that the grasping at the true existence of the two — the person as well as the fruit — are forms of grasping at self-existence. Of these, the first is a grasping at self-existence of person while the second constitutes a grasping at self-existence of phenomena. The statement that the stream enterer does not apprehend with the thought “I have attained the fruit” on the basis of grasping at true existence is made from the point of view that it is not the case that he has not eradicated the object of apprehension of grasping at true existence. This does not suggest, however, that such a person has no innate grasping at all.[172] On the basis of explanation offered here, one should understand similar statements related to the subsequent [fruits: once-returner, nonreturner, and arhat].

Although some Svātantrika Madhyamaka masters interpret the meaning of this Diamond Cutter citation differently, Prajñākaramati quotes this to substantiate the point that in order to journey to śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha enlightenment, one must realize emptiness. This is excellent.[173]
These scriptural citations clearly demonstrate how, if one is divorced from the view of suchness, one will not become free from cyclic existence, and how such a view is essential for gaining freedom from cyclic existence. That śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha arhats are not free from the bondage of cyclic existence is something no learned person would assert, nor is such a viewpoint tenable. Therefore these sutra citations clearly demonstrate that śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas possess the realization that phenomena lack intrinsic existence. {48} There are many more scriptural sources, such as the great mother sutras and so on. However, fearing excessive length, I have not written about these here.

The Precious Garland states:
So long as there is grasping at the aggregates,
there is grasping at “I.”
When there is “I”-grasping, there is karma,
and from this in turn comes birth.
With three avenues, no beginning, end, and middle,
this round of cyclic existence resembles
a ring of fire; thus one causing the other,
beings revolve in this cycle of existence.
Since it is not to be found at all
in both self and others, even in the three times,
grasping at “I” will come to cease;
from this, action and birth [will cease] as well.[174]

The first two lines of this citation indicate how, so long as there is grasping at true existence of the aggregates, the identity view grasping “I am” will emerge from it. In so doing, these lines demonstrate how, for the identity view to cease entirely, grasping at true existence of the aggregates must cease. From this we can discern that even śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha arhats have completely eliminated the grasping at true existence of the aggregates. This being so, unless the object of apprehension of grasping at true existence is eradicated, the object of apprehension of the identity view will not be eradicated. Thus we come to recognize that the selflessness of persons that is accepted commonly by both Hīnayāna and other Mahayana schools negates only a coarse self-existence of persons and that such negation does not constitute the subtle selflessness of persons.
In view of the above, those who maintain that the master Candrakīrti’s position on how śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas realize the selflessness of persons is the same as other schools but assert that he differs from others on the question of whether śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas realize selflessness of phenomena, they have failed to properly comprehend this master’s position. For it is stated in the Commentary that there is no realization of selflessness of persons for someone who is divorced from the view of suchness.[175]

The next two lines [from Precious Garland] indicate how one accumulates karma because of the presence of the identity view, and how one takes birth in the cycle of existence owing to the force of karma. All of this is stated to address one who has yet to eradicate the object of apprehension of grasping at true existence in relation to the aggregates. The statement is not made from the more general perspective of the mere presence of the identity view in a person. For example, although the identity view persists up until the seventh ground, one no longer takes birth through the power of karma from the first ground onward.

Texts such as those cited above demonstrate how, if one is divorced from meditative cultivation of the view of suchness, one cannot bring about the cessation of the identity view. They thus show that if one possesses only the path of the sixteen characteristics such as impermanence, the afflictions cannot be eliminated. Therefore, to read Candrakīrti as presenting a unique understanding of the selflessness of persons {49} but then leave intact the presentations on the afflictions, including identifying what constitutes the identity view, based on the common-level view of the selflessness of persons, one would be committing a serious error. One would be failing to appreciate thoroughly the uniqueness of Candrakīrti’s philosophical system. Now on these points, how can this master, who is sovereign among the learned ones, ever be mistaken? Those who fail to comprehend that Candrakīrti, in fact, establishes the standpoint that śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas do possess the realization of the selflessness of phenomena, those for whom it does not even cross their mind to inquire whether there is a unique presentation on the afflictions — such supposed followers of Candrakīrti relate to this tradition with their devotion alone. What I have indicated here is only illustrative; there are numerous other points [of uniqueness to the system] that need careful investigation.

“The three avenues” here are the three thoroughly afflicted factors of (1) afflictions, (2) karma, and (3) birth. That there is no beginning, no end, and no middle to these three is because from the afflictions arise karma, from this arise the sufferings, and from the sufferings arise its own subsequent stages as well as further afflictions. Since each produces the other, there is no fixed sequence; in other words, they mutually serve as each other’s cause and effect. This dependent origination does not come into being from self, other, or both, and moreover it does not obtain its arising through intrinsic nature in any of the three times, nor is such arising seen in any manner. And owing to this reason [of seeing emptiness of intrinsic arising], the identity view ceases, and in this way one’s wandering in the cycle of existence comes to be overturned.
Having established that the aggregates, elements, and so on lack any intrinsic existence, the text explains in its conclusion how it is through having seen the truth of suchness that one transcends sorrow:
Thus, with this perfect truth,
knowing that beings lack essence,
like a fire starved of its fuel,
with no basis, nothing to appropriate, one transcends sorrow.[176]

If one contends that this seeing spoken of here describes the view of bodhisattvas alone, this is incorrect. That this is being stated in connection with śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas is evident from the fact that, immediately following the phrase “one transcends sorrow,” the text says:
The bodhisattva too will see thus
and definitely aspire for his awakening.
However, because of his compassion,
he will take births until his awakening.[177]

The texts of the Precious Garland cited in Candrakīrti’s Commentary appear to be from an early translation that is not very good.
Also, in a sutra taught to śrāvakas to help eliminate their afflictive obscurations, {50} conditioned things are analyzed as lacking intrinsic existence by means of five similes:
Form is like a mass of foam,
feelings are like water bubbles,
perceptions are like mirages,
mental formations are like plantain trees,
and consciousness is like an illusion.

Commentary on the Awakening Mind draws a distinction, stating that the Buddha taught śrāvakas the five aggregates while he taught bodhisattvas how forms and so on resemble the five similes such as a mass of foam.[179] The reference there is to those śrāvakas who, for the time being, remain unable to realize suchness. It is not meant to include all śrāvakas. For in this same text, it reads:
Those who do not understand emptiness
are not receptive vehicles for liberation;
such ignorant beings will revolve
in the prison of existence of the six classes of beings.[180]
When presenting how the absence of intrinsic existence of phenomena is taught in the Hīnayāna scriptures, the Precious Garland says:
In the Great Vehicle nonorigination is taught,
and in the other “exhaustion” — namely, emptiness.
Since cessation and nonarising are the same,
concede [that Mahayana scripture is authentic].[181]
Here, Nāgārjuna states that in the Mahayana sutras, “nonorigination through intrinsic nature” is taught to be emptiness, while when the other — Hīnayāna — sutras teach emptiness, they teach the exhaustion of conditioned things. Since the referents of these two presentations of emptiness are the same, Nāgārjuna is saying, one need not be intolerant of the teaching of emptiness in the Mahayana sutras.

On the matter of how the referents of these two presentations are identical, some explain this as follows. If the followers of the śrāvaka schools were to accept exhaustion with respect to conditioned things, given that exhaustion is not possible if things possess intrinsic existence, then one who accepts exhaustion must also accept, right from the start, the absence of intrinsic existence. Therefore these two are in actual fact identical.[182] This interpretation is totally incorrect. For one could apply the same argument to the Madhyamaka: since intrinsic existence is impossible if it exists, whatever phenomena such as sprouts and so on that Madhyamaka accepts will have to be accepted, right from the start, as empty of intrinsic existence. This could bring the absurd consequence that all phenomena such as sprouts would be identical to emptiness! Similarly, the statement in the Precious Garland commentary that “There is no actual difference whatsoever between nonorigination and momentariness”[183] also betrays a misunderstanding of the text’s meaning.

In a Hīnayāna sutra cited in the Commentary on the Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning, one reads:
That which is the total elimination of this suffering, a definite elimination, a purification, an exhaustion, freedom from attachment, a cessation, well pacified, a dissolution, where no additional suffering is led to, this nonorigination, and nonarising, is peace; this is excellence. It is thus. For this is the definite elimination of all the aggregates, it is the extinction of existence, {51} it is freedom from attachment, it is cessation, and it is the transcendence of sorrow.[184]
In explaining the meaning of this citation, Candrakīrti says, given the usage of the demonstrative “this,” the statement from “total elimination” up to “dissolution” is made from the point of view of our present suffering or aggregates alone, while from “no additional suffering is led to” up to “transcendence of sorrow” is made from the perspective of our future suffering.
The thought might occur to some that “this suffering or aggregate” here refer to the afflictions, which are specific instantiations of these two factors [suffering and the aggregates]. So a generic [“aggregate”] is being used here to refer to a particular. This explanation too is incorrect. Now, if a generic term cannot be explained in terms of a universal, it then needs to be interpreted in terms of a particular. Here, however, the word can be explained in the sense of a generic term.[185]

To summarize: according to the Buddhist essentialists, since one cannot explain the meaning of the word exhaustion in the manner the Sublime Continuum says that the afflictions are primordially exhausted[186] — which is that the aggregates are primordially exhausted because they are primordially devoid of arising through their intrinsic nature — one will have to explain exhaustion instead as “total elimination through actualizing the path.” However, when what is actualized, nirvana, is present, the one who is actualizing it no longer will be; and conversely, when the one who is actualizing it is present, the aggregates will not have ceased, and so no nirvana will have been actualized. Thus one will be unable to explain the meaning of the sutra cited above.
According to us [Madhyamaka], however, exhaustion in that sutra is not an exhaustion secured through the application of an antidote. Rather, it can be explained in terms of the statement “It is called exhaustion because it is primordially exhausted.”[187] Thus we are able to explain the meaning of this sutra well.

In light of the foregoing, the two things that the noble Nāgārjuna spoke of as being the same with respect to their referents are (1) nirvana that is the cessation of suffering as presented [in the Hīnayāna sutras] on the basis of defining what constitutes exhaustion, and (2) the cessation presented [in Mahayana sutras] in terms of the absence of intrinsic arising. This is a point that does not appear to have been understood, so I have explained it here in some detail.
In Fundamental Wisdom too it says:
The Blessed One, who clearly knows
entities and their absence, has denied
in the Advice to Katyāyana
both “it exists” and “it does not exist.”[188]
This statement too indicates how the rejection of the two extremes has been taught in Hīnayāna sutras. This sutra appears to be in the Connected Discourses.[189]

Here, in the Commentary it says:

Here, the opponent being critiqued is Bhāviveka. For example, Buddhapālita’s commentary on the seventh chapter [of Fundamental Wisdom] explains the meaning of the statements in the Hīnayāna sutras about all phenomena being devoid of self-existence in terms of their lack of existence through an essence.[191] Bhāviveka objects to this in his Lamp of Wisdom, saying, if this so, it would be pointless to teach Mahayana (the Great Vehicle).[192]

One could ask Bhāviveka: “Are you saying that the Mahayana teaching in general would have no purpose? Or are you saying that the teaching of selflessness of phenomena in the Mahayana would have no purpose?” If it is the first, and if there is a logical entailment here, then the teaching of the Mahayana would be reduced to the teaching of the selflessness of phenomena. There is no such entailment, however, for the Great Vehicle also teaches the following: the bodhisattva grounds, the practice of the perfections such as generosity, aspirational prayers and expansive dedications, great compassion and so on, as well as the great waves of the dual accumulations of merit and wisdom and the most excellent powers of the bodhisattvas, phenomena that are inconceivable by ordinary beings as well as by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.

For example, the Precious Garland states:
In the Vehicle of Śrāvakas,
the bodhisattva’s aspirational prayers,
their deeds, and their dedications are not taught,
so how can they become bodhisattvas?
The essential points of the bodhisattva deeds
are not taught in their sutras;
they are taught in the Great Vehicle;
this the learned ones should uphold.[193]
This was stated to dispel the misconception that one could travel to buddhahood on the basis of the path presented in the Hīnayāna baskets alone, that there is no need for another vehicle, the Mahayana. According to Bhāviveka, Nāgārjuna should have said here the following: Given that the selflessness of phenomena is taught in the Great Vehicle, what is taught in the Hīnayāna sutras must be inadequate. But Nāgārjuna instead explains how the Great Vehicle teaches the other dimension, the vast aspect of the path.

Now, if you, Bhāviveka, opt for the second alternative, {53} here too there is no logical entailment. For in the śrāvaka baskets the selflessness of phenomena is taught only briefly, while in the Mahayana the selflessness of phenomena is taught extensively through a multitude of avenues. This is indeed the view of the noble Nāgārjuna. He says, for example, in his Hymn to the World Transcendent:
“Without realizing signlessness,
there is no liberation,” you’ve declared,
so you taught this signlessness
in its entirety in the Great Vehicle.[194]
The first two lines of this stanza show how, since it is impossible to exhaust the afflictions without realizing signlessness, it is thus impossible to attain liberation without it. The final two lines indicate that signlessness — the selflessness of phenomena — has been taught in its complete form or in its entirety in the Great Vehicle. From this, one discerns that the selflessness of phenomena is not taught in its entirety in the Hīnayāna teachings.
Now one might wonder, “How does the word ‘so’ [in the above quote] indicate that the selflessness of phenomena is taught in its entirety [in the Great Vehicle]?”
[Reply:] Without realizing signlessness one cannot attain liberation, the exhaustion of the afflictions. This means the selflessness of phenomena has to be taught even in the śrāvaka basket. Yet there also has to be a difference between Hīnayāna and Mahayana in this domain. And the line “so you taught this . . .” needs to be explained in terms of the reason-indicating word “so.”
These analyses reveal how the objection raised by Bhāviveka in his critique as well as the contrary consequence it generates are flawed with no logical entailment. Therefore, these objections of Bhāviveka are contrary to reason. That they are contrary to scriptures has already been explained numerous times above.

“In that case,” one might ask, “what then is the meaning of what this master Candrakīrti says on whether or not the selflessness of phenomena is taught in its entirety in the baskets of Mahayana and Hīnayāna, and on whether or not one meditates on the selflessness of phenomena in its entirety on the paths of both of these vehicles?”
[Reply:] Now the point is not at all that the realization that all phenomena lack intrinsic existence is present in the Mahayana practitioner but absent in śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, who possess only a partial realization, or that they realize only certain phenomena as devoid of intrinsic existence. For once one has established, by means of valid cognition, the selflessness of phenomena in relation to even a single basis, then when one examines other bases in terms of whether they possess true existence, drawing on the previous reasoning, one will be able to realize others as lacking true existence as well.
Some among those who claim to be proponents of Madhyamaka, while supposedly upholding the tradition wherein the true existence of entities has been negated, assert the emptiness of true existence itself to be truly established. Some others assert that the ultimate nature of things is an affirmative truth, independent, and truly established.[195] Of these two, the first suffers from the flaw of not properly identifying the criteria of true existence, thus negating only a rough approximation of it. The latter standpoint, though casting itself as having negated the true existence of conditioned things, does not appear to have done so through valid cognition; {54} it instead appears constitute a view that denigrates conditioned things. There isn’t much left to say [about this view] beyond these points.

To conclude, even when a Mahayana practitioner is establishing the lack of true existence of even a single basis, he does so through limitless varieties of reasoning and proofs, like those found in Fundamental Wisdom. In this way, his intelligence comes to be greatly enhanced with respect to suchness. In contrast, the Hīnayāna practitioner establishes suchness by means of valid cognition only on the basis of limited reasoning. Since he does not proceed in a manner commensurate to the former, his enhancement of intelligence with respect to suchness is also not commensurate. Because of this, Candrakīrti distinguishes between the two in the following: how one employs extensive forms of reasoning while the other a condensed form, and how one engages in a comprehensive meditative practice of selflessness while the other a less comprehensive and incomplete meditative practice of selflessness. Such differences exist because śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas strive only to eliminate the afflictions, while Mahayana practitioners strive to eliminate the obscurations to knowledge. To achieve this latter objective, one’s intelligence must be greatly enhanced by the blossoming of one’s wisdom of suchness.

One might ask, “Be that as it may, how should one interpret the following lines from the Ornament of Realizations?:
Because they’ve shunned concepts of held objects,
because they’ve not shunned concepts of apprehending subjects,
within these two is perfectly encompassed
the path of the rhinoceros-like.”[196]
This states that the pratyekabuddha path can eliminate conceptualizations clinging to true existence in relation to the objects but not in relation to the subject.
“Also, how does one interpret the following, where clinging to the true existence of objects is said to be an obscuration to knowledge?:
Because they undermine, respectively, the three —
afflictions, knowable, and the path — there are the purities:
that of the śrāvaka, the rhinoceros, and the bodhisattva.”[197]

[Reply:] There are only two senses in which [a pratyekabuddha’s supposed] “elimination of clinging to the true existence of external objects” can be defined. One is that, while the existence of external objects is established through valid cognition, their true existence is negated through reasoning, and by meditating on this fact as set forth in Madhyamaka thought, one comes to eliminate clinging to their true existence. Alternatively, as in Cittamātra thought, one negates external objects through reasoning, and then by meditating on this fact, one eliminates grasping at the existence of external objects. Of these two, if it is to be understood in the first sense, this is untenable. For if, while capable of positing external reality in general, one has negated its true existence through a reasoning probing into the truth of its suchness, then on the basis of the force of the previous reasoning, one should be able, the instant one inquires, to realize that subjective cognition also lacks true existence.

For example, Āryadeva states:
He who sees the suchness of one thing
sees the suchness of all things.[198]
Choosing to understand the meaning in the second sense represents, in fact, the standpoint of the commentarial tradition of masters like Haribhadra. For according to them, the absence of external reality is established by valid cognition. {55}
In general, once the absence of external objects has been established, anyone, no matter how inferior his mental faculty, will affirm quite easily the fact that the perceiving subject does not exist as a separate substance from such purported objects. So the statement [in Ornament of Realizations] that pratyekabuddhas have not eliminated clinging to the true existence of the subject should be understood to mean that they still hold consciousness to be truly existent. It is definitely not the case that, from within a set of substantially distinct object and subject, pratyekabuddhas have negated one half while holding the other half to be truly existent. Regarding those who amusedly remark that it is astonishing to see a similarity between the philosophical standpoints of pratyekabuddhas, who propound the true existence of subject, and that of Cittamātra, who propound ultimate reality of nondual consciousness: their laughter only reveals their own ignorance.[199]

Here the Ornament of Realizations, when describing the pratyekabuddha path as the Medium Vehicle, distinguishes whether one has eliminated clinging to true existence with respect to objects and subjects. By analyzing these two aspects, such a vehicle is described as superior to that of the śrāvakas and inferior to the Great Vehicle; hence it is the Medium Vehicle. In this view, the persons of the three vehicles — Lesser, Medium, and Great — are characterized respectively as of inferior, middling, and greater mental faculties, a hierarchy of mental faculties posited particularly in relation to realization of no-self. Therefore, the Madhyamaka view, which represents the highest, is correlated with the Great Vehicle; the Cittamātra view is correlated with the Medium Vehicle [of pratyekabuddhas]; and the Lesser Vehicle is correlated with the lowest view — namely, the common-level understanding of selflessness of persons. Though this is how they are defined [in that text], this is not invariably the case. Even from the position that accepts that the view of suchness is present in all three vehicles, it is no contradiction to say there are three levels of mental faculties defined on the basis of whether, for instance, one can penetrate the view of suchness in a swift manner.

Given that Ornament of Realizations differentiates the inferiority and superiority [of the pratyekabuddha and bodhisattva vehicles, respectively] on the basis of whether or not clinging to the true existence of the subject is eliminated, the view of selflessness taught in the Ornament of Realizations cannot be described as the Cittamātra view, as is the case with the Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras and the two Differentiations.[200] Even in India there were approaches to reading the Ornament of Realizations that interpreted it according to Madhyamaka as well as those interpreting it according to Cittamātra. There thus is a need to say a lot about the reasons for these different interpretations; fearing excessive length, however, I will not write about them here.
The Ornament of Realizations also has the following stanza, which indicates that even among śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, some possess the realization of the selflessness of phenomena:
Because no differentiations exist in the ultimate expanse,
distinctness of lineages cannot be sustained;
due to particularities of the supported attributes,
distinctions are spoken of in relation to it.[201]

With respect to the term ultimate expanse (dharmadhātu), Light on the Perfection of Wisdom in Twenty-Five Thousand Lines says:
“Conceptualization” or “thorough conceptualization” refers to manifest clinging to entities and their signs. Since the ultimate expanse is devoid of such conceptualization, understand this to be the absence of attachment itself. This nonexistence itself is the thatness of all phenomena. Therefore it is stated here that because it is the ultimate expanse itself, which is the cause of the qualities of the āryas, {56} the naturally abiding lineage is the basis of meditative cultivation.[202]
Thus ultimate expanse is defined in terms of the emptiness of true existence, which is the nonexistence of entities and their signs as grasped at by the attachment clinging to true existence.
Following this explanation, an objection is entertained: “If ultimate expanse is the lineage, all sentient beings would abide in the lineage, for the ultimate expanse resides universally in all.”[203] Here, abiding in the lineage is understood in terms of abiding in the lineage in the context of the path.

In response, Vimuktisena writes that, since we speak of lineage as that which, when taken as an object, serves as the cause for the qualities of āryas, no such absurd consequence ensues. So it is not the case that the mere presence of ultimate expanse entails abiding in the lineage on the level of the path. Rather the meaning is that, when the path takes suchness as its object and meditates upon it, and when it becomes thereby a special cause for the qualities of the āryas, it [suchness] is then posited to be a special kind of lineage. However, in response to the objection, “Since there is no differentiation in the ultimate expanse, distinctness of the lineages of the three vehicles cannot be sustained,” it is explained that distinctness of lineages is spoken of on the basis of distinctness of the paths — the supported attributes — that take the lineage as their object.[204]

Here, “basis” refers to the object of focus and “supported” to that which focuses. Within that which focuses, the two vehicles of śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha are included as well. Now, to take suchness as its object, suchness must be present in the perspective of such cognition; and without negating true existence within the perspective of one’s cognition, the emptiness of true existence simply cannot be established in that perspective. If this is not established, ultimate reality will not be established within one’s cognition. This in turn needs to be ascertained first in relation to a given basis. And this [above stanza from the Ornament of Realizations] indicates how, even among śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, there are those who, on the basis of focusing on external and internal objects, perceive their ultimate reality — the absence of true existence. Understood thus, even some pratyekabuddhas have realized the truth of suchness. Therefore it is not the case that pratyekabuddhas are uniformly incapable of eliminating clinging to true existence of consciousness. [Seen in this way] we also need to distinguish between two kinds of śrāvakas — those who have realized suchness and those who have not. So the Ornament of Realizations mentions two kinds of Hīnayāna practitioners. Therefore, when it comes to grasping at the true existence of subject and object as substantially distinct, we must [according to this text] identify two types: one that constitutes the subtle obscuration to knowledge and one that does not.

If one contends that the dispute here is not about the untenability of the distinctness of the lineages of the three vehicles but about the inappropriateness of the division into thirteen lineages,[205] this too is incorrect. For example, Light on Perfection of Wisdom in Twenty-Five Thousand Lines says:
This is like this statement in the sutra: “So Mañjuśrī, if there is one ultimate expanse, one suchness, one perfect endpoint, how can such labels as suitable receptacle and unsuitable receptacle be applied to it?”[206]
{57} The sutra here raises the question of how one can determine, given there is no differentiation in the ultimate expanse, who is a receptacle of the Great Vehicle and who is not. This current argument is similar to the previous one. The debate is about the unsustainability of maintaining distinct lineages of the Great and Lesser vehicles. For if it is interpreted in terms of the thirteen lineages, the objection about whether someone is a suitable or an unsuitable receptacle simply cannot be raised.[207] The great master Haribhadra too upholds a position consonant with that of Ārya Vimuktisena.
Likewise, the root text as well as the commentary of the Sublime Continuum also make many statements about how there are both śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas who have realized the ultimate nature of things and those who have not. Fearing excessive length, I will not expand on these here.

The reason the Ornament of Realizations presents the knowledge of the path pertaining to the paths of śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha is to help sustain those who possess the lineages of śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha. Among Hīnayāna practitioners, there are those who are suitable receptacles for profound emptiness and those who are not. Since the latter is the majority, [Ornament of Realizations] mostly presents their paths [when presenting the Hīnayāna path].
Just as one finds among followers of the Great Vehicle those who will not discover the Madhyamaka view unless they are first led through the Cittamātra view, this is true also among pratyekabuddhas; and it appears to be true also among śrāvakas. Furthermore, in both Light on Perfection of Wisdom in Twenty-Five Thousand Lines as well as Exposition on the Eight Thousand Line Perfection of Wisdom, to substantiate the point that the ultimate expanse is defined as the lineage of all three vehicles, they cite the statement that all āryas are defined in terms of the unconditioned alone.[208] In the Diamond Cutter Sutra the line “Because ārya persons are defined in terms of the unconditioned alone”[209] is presented as a substantiation of the statement “Neither the attributes of the buddha exist nor all the teachings he has revealed.” This means that all the āryas of Hīnayāna and Mahayana are defined on the basis of actualizing the unconditioned, the ultimate truth, which is the nonexistence of all phenomena on the ultimate level. Therefore [on this point of the presence of the knowledge of emptiness among śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas,] there is no contradiction between this tradition of Candrakīrti and the Ornament of Realizations.[210] So, even according to the tradition of the commentators on the Ornament [such as Vimuktisena] mentioned above, we should understand there to be two types [among śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas]. I could elaborate further.

At this point when the ground of Perfect Joy is attained, it is the perfection of generosity alone among the ten perfections that becomes preeminent for that bodhisattva. It is not the case, however, that he does not possess the other perfections. This supramundane perfection of generosity is also the first cause of full awakening; this is, of course, to be understood in terms of the supramundane level of generosity.
Although generally the subsequent perfection is superior to the one that precedes it, generosity is described as superior here because the power to practice generosity on this ground excels to an extent that is not the case for morality and so on. On the first ground, the bodhisattva is capable of engaging in such acts of generosity as giving away his body and external belongings, without the slightest glimmer of the attachment or possessiveness that undermine the perfection of generosity. He is, however, not yet capable of engaging in the morality that never engages, even in dreams, in immoral acts, which are the forces contrary to discipline, a capacity he will attain on the second ground.
Furthermore, on this ground, realizations that remain imperceptible can be inferred through his generosity. For example, not only is the bodhisattva dedicated to giving away external belongings, he becomes committed ever more to generosity, giving away even his very flesh. So his giving becomes a sign to infer his inner realizations, such as his attainments, which remain unseen to many others. This is similar to inferring the presence of fire on the basis of smoke. This stanza describes how the bodhisattva is free of the taint of possessiveness in relation to giving away his body, life, and material resources. For even as he gives these away, his mental state remains steadfast, not wavering in any way.

All of these living beings eagerly yearn for happiness, which helps rectify such sufferings as hunger, thirst, sickness, heat, and cold. Yet for humans and their like, there is no happiness without consuming the resources that are the objects of desire — food, drink, cures against sickness, clothes, and shelters. So, knowing that these resources, in turn, come about from the accumulation of merit born of generosity in the past, the Buddha, who perceives the minds of all beings, thus spoke on generosity first. Leading others to this way [of generosity] is easier as well.
One might wonder, “In order to obtain excellent material resources through the act of generosity, must the giver be perfectly aligned [with the criteria of authentic generosity]?”
This is not necessary. We should even respect a merchant who seeks greater wealth by giving away a small portion of his wealth, or someone who gives to a beggar in hopes of producing greater wealth. Such givers are unlike the bodhisattvas who, under compassion’s sway, do not aspire for the fruits of giving but give celebrating the joy that is the wish to give. Now an ordinary giver may be not only weak in compassion, he may even possess a ruthless mind toward other sentient beings; he may seek with enthusiasm his own welfare, such as birth in the higher realms — that is to say, he may make his pursuit [of self-interest] his guiding principle. Even for them, it is from generosity — a generosity whose only positive quality, turning away from clinging to resources, is based on an expectation of the fruits of generosity — that wonderful and excellent wealth they desire will come about. In this way, such generosity can become a cause that relieves the suffering of hunger, thirst, and so on.[211]

{60} Indeed with respect to one who, while divorced of compassion, devotes himself to generosity to secure his own happiness and relieve his personal suffering, [the Commentary] states, “The sublime ones walk among those who give.”[212] So it is through the practice of generosity that he will swiftly, at some point, meet with the fortune of encountering the āryas. Then, from having such a sublime being teach him the Dharma, he will come to perceive that the cycle of existence is bereft of beneficial qualities. He will then, actualizing the uncontaminated path of the āryas, come to eliminate ignorance and thus cut clean the continuum of cyclic existence — the continuity of birth and death since beginningless time. And as a result of meeting with a sublime one, he will journey to the state of peace: the attainment of a śrāvaka’s nirvana or that of a pratyekabuddha.

Non-bodhisattvas do not invariably enjoy the happiness that is the fruit of their generosity immediately after the act — that is to say, simultaneous with the recipient being satisfied through that giving. Because they do not see the fruits of their giving directly, they may not continue to engage in generosity. In contrast, bodhisattvas who keep in mind their pledge to help sentient beings in the long run and to bring about their happiness in the immediate term, seeing the feeling of satisfaction brought about in the recipients through their generosity, they will, without much delay, attain supreme joy as the fruit of their giving. And as they experience such fruits of generosity, they will continue to delight in giving at all times. {61}

One may ask, “What kind of extraordinary joy arises in the bodhisattva when recipients are satisfied through material resources, the very cause that underlies the bodhisattva’s dedication to the act of generosity?”
If simply hearing or thinking about the meaning of the phrase “give me” brings such joy to the children of the Conqueror, giving rise to the thought “they are asking something from me” — such a joy is not experienced even by the arhats who enter into the state of peace, the expanse of nirvana. If this is so, what need is there to speak of the joy when giving away everything, both internal and external, and satisfying the recipient in such a manner that this engenders joy greater than that of the bliss of tranquility; there is no need at all.
When one’s mind is attracted to the bliss of tranquility, one becomes diverted from others’ welfare. In contrast, when one’s mind is inspired by the bodhisattva’s joys as described above, this would engender even greater enthusiasm for pursuing the welfare of others. There is a difference between these two [types of joy]. {62}

If asked, “Does a bodhisattva who gives away his outer and inner belongings — who has been described as engendering excellent bliss on the basis of giving — experience physical pain?”
Now, if the question relates to the great being that has attained one of the bodhisattva grounds, then, like the chopping up of inanimate objects, he experiences no physical pain. The Questions of Gaganagañja Sutra, for example, states the following:
It is thus. Say there is a great forest of sāla trees, and some people appear and cut a sāla tree. The remaining sāla trees do not feel attachment or aversion, or conceptualization or thorough conceptualization, toward them with the thought “That tree has been cut; we haven’t been cut yet.” So too the bodhisattva’s forbearance that resembles this, which is a thoroughly trained forbearance, is most excellent and is equal to space.[214]
The Precious Garland too says:
He has no physical pain,
so how would he have mental pain?
Through compassion he feels the world’s pain;
because of this he long endures.[215]
This statement too is intended from the point of view of a bodhisattva that has attained the grounds.

Now, if the question posed above were from the point of view of one who has not attained the ground of Perfect Joy — a ground totally free of attachment to one’s body and material possessions — there would be physical pain, since he would undoubtedly encounter conditions that tax his body. Nonetheless, even on such occasions, because of that suffering, he will abide in conditions that lead him to seek the welfare of other sentient beings even more. For when the bodhisattva sees those who are trapped in the unbearable states of existence as hell beings, as animals, as hungry ghosts, and so on, whose bodies are being consumed by intense suffering without interruption — suffering that is a thousandfold more unbearable than the pain of slicing off a piece of his own flesh — the bodhisattva will disregard his own suffering caused by cutting his body and giving it away. From his own pain, disregarding it {63} and taking this experience of his own suffering as the reason, swiftly he strives with effort to cut away the pain of others, such as their birth in the hells.[216] In Naktso Lotsāwa’s translation this stanza appears in the following:
Through the pain of cutting his body and giving it away,
he views the sufferings of others, such as those of in the hells,
and on the basis of what he has experienced,
he strives with effort to cut away the pain of others.[217]
Thus, the explanation I have provided above is based on drawing from two different versions of translation of this stanza.
So it is only when one possesses this kind of power of intention that one can give away one’s body. And since there is no contradiction in asserting the presence of such intention even before the bodhisattva grounds are attained, it is said that even bodhisattvas who have not yet attained the grounds give away their body.

Such generosity, the intention to give, when sustained by uncontaminated wisdom devoid of the perception of truly existent gift, receiver, and giver, is called by the great mother Perfection of Wisdom sutras a “supramundane perfection.”[218] Since the meditative equipoise of an ārya that does not objectify is supramundane, generosity sustained by this is characterized as supramundane perfection. In contrast, generosity that is not sustained by such nonobjectification is a mundane perfection. The clear distinction between these two cannot be ascertained directly by those who have not attained the ground of the ultimate awakening mind.
The term beyond (pāra in Sanskrit)[219] refers to the other shore or the other side of the ocean of cyclic existence, thus it refers here to buddhahood, the total elimination of two obscurations. “To reach beyond” (pāramitā) is to have gone beyond. In explaining this term, the Commentary writes:
The grammatical rule “If there is a subsequent term, do not make it invisible” makes the accusative case visible, retaining its form. Alternatively, because it belongs to the group of the type prīṣodara and so on, it is left as a word possessing a suffix ma.[220]
Paṇḍita Jayānanda explains this Commentary passage as follows:
In Sanskrit, “beyond” is pāra while “to go” is itā, and when these two words are combined, the accusative singular am is added onto pāra, while the particle su of nominative case is added after itā [thus deriving the compound] pāraṃ itā. When combined as pāramitā, although am and su should become invisible, {64} here, through the rule “If there is a subsequent term, do not make it invisible,” the su from the root word is made invisible yet am is not. “Through this rule the accusative case . . .” refers [therefore] to the accusative singular am. As this particle is not made invisible, the term assumes the linguistic form pāramitā. Being in “prīṣodara and so on,” the suffix ma is added to make the word pārama. Since it is to be read as pārama it is stated “do not make it invisible.” Thus by erasing a of am and leaving ma intact and giving it the vowel i, it becomes mitā. This is how it is explained.[221]
The nominative ending su given here seems to be incorrect, so check whether this should be si instead.[222]

Some Tibetans assert that from the Sanskrit word pāraṃ itā, the anusvāra atop ra is placed alongside on the same row,[223] which then results in pārama itā; and when the saṃdhi rule is applied to this, the vowel i is given to the letter ma, and when the vowel a is erased it assumes the form mitā. There seems to be many confused explanations such as this. However, the explanation offered by the paṇḍita cited above seems to be best.
The two lines beginning “Generosity devoid of the gift, receiver, and giver” take the wisdom realizing the three elements of giving to be imperceptible as a point of reference and indicates how generosity sustained by it is an instance of the perfection of generosity. Other instances of perfections such as generosity that are not sustained by this wisdom are still called “perfections” because they are similar to those perfections sustained by wisdom. For example, an instance of generosity may not be sustained by wisdom, but because it is sustained by dedication to great awakening, it is accepted as certain to go beyond. So it is suitable to be called the perfection of giving.

Thus, with respect to the etymological meaning of the word perfection (pāramitā), if it is read as “gone beyond to that state” — in terms of accusative case — the word refers to having arrived at the ground of the buddhahood. And if the word is read as “going beyond by means of this” — in terms of instrumental case — then perfections exist even on the learner’s path.
This explanation I have offered here in relation to generosity should be understood in the context of other perfections as well, such as for the perfection of morality and so on. In other words, those other instances also contain both kinds — those sustained by the awakening mind and by dedication and those that are sustained by wisdom as well.
But when attachment or clinging to true existence arises for these three elements of giving — if one is fettered by clinging to true existence of the [gift, receiver, and giver] — this generosity is then said in the sutras to be a mundane perfection.
Here is how what has been explained above can be practiced right now from this very moment. To give away your body to others and generate extraordinary joy in doing so, train first by taking it as an object of imaginative cultivation. As for other forms of generosity, such as giving material things, cultivate these in relation to the fields of giving, both to those of elevated status and to the lowly, on a regular basis through such acts as offering even a simple thing like water. {65} On these occasions be sure you are sustained by the wisdom realizing the imperceptibility (emptiness) of the three elements of giving. Mentally, give away repeatedly your body, material resources, and the roots of virtue for the benefit of other sentient beings. And contemplate how, even if you do not give them away, they will perish nonetheless, and you will have to discard them anyway. Contemplate how, since you will have to give them up anyway, it would be better to mentally give them away beforehand.

This ground of Perfect Joy is like the water-crystal gem — the disc of the moon. It resembles the moon in three ways. (1) It resides at a high point in that it abides perfectly in the mind of the bodhisattva on the first ground, who has attained the qualities of the ground described above. As such, it abides high up on the path, like the moon abides high up in the sky. Since the first ground is a facet of the mind of that bodhisattva, one speaks of abiding in it. This is like, for example, the eyes being located on the head. (2) Because the ultimate awakening mind of the first ground is endowed with light of gnosis in the mind of the sublime or excellent person, {66} thereby beautifying him, it is like the moon, which makes its space, the skies, beautiful through its bright illumination. (3) Also, because the first ground reigns victorious over the objects abandoned on the path of seeing, it resembles the moon that dispels all aspects of the thick or dense darkness.

The bodhisattva abiding on the second ground — because he is endowed with the perfect morality as well as the qualities of purity, not only during his waking period but even in his dreams — shuns the stain of immorality; that is, he remains untouched by it. This includes not just the immorality of root infractions and naturally reprehensible deeds; he also relinquishes the stains of the immorality of violating rule-based precepts.[226]
Because he does not inflame the afflictions that give rise to immorality, and because the nonvirtuous karma of transgressing prescribed rules does not occur for him, he has attained the coolness borne of having extinguished the fires of remorse from accruing the downfalls of violating prescribed rules. This is therefore called morality. The Sanskrit term for morality is śīla, which is composed of the words śīta, referring to “coolness,” and lati, meaning “to attain.” Alternatively, it is called “morality” (śīla, literally meaning also “correct discipline”) because, being the cause of happiness, it is something that is sought after by the sublime ones. These are explanations of the word śīla based on its etymology.
With regard to its actual nature, morality is defined in terms of the seven relinquishments, the abandoning of the seven immoral acts of body and speech. The underlying states of mind that give rise to these seven relinquishments are (1) nonattachment, which is the absence of covetousness, (2) nonaversion, which is the absence of harmful intent, and (3) right view, which opposes wrong view. By including these motivating factors, morality refers to the ten relinquishments, ten positive courses of action that overcome the ten negative courses of action. {68}

One might ask, “How do the qualities of this bodhisattva come to be purified because of his perfect morality?”
Since all his movements — the threefold activity of his body, speech, and mind — are pure, without even subtle downfalls throughout his waking and dream states, he accumulates, without omission, the sublime or excellent virtue of all ten courses of action. To accumulate all ten courses means to fulfill the first three courses of action, such as relinquishing killing, through his body, the four middle ones through his speech, and the three final courses through his mind.[227] In pursuing this, not only does the bodhisattva refrain from transgressing the bounds of proscribed acts, he also accomplishes all the positive prescriptions of the moral code.[228]

One might ask, “Isn’t it the case these ten courses of positive action are accumulated in their entirety by the bodhisattva on the first ground as well?”
[Reply:] Yes, they do accumulate them. However, to the extent that the second-ground bodhisattva excels in not only this path of virtue [in general] but in all ten [courses of positive] deeds, he becomes most excellent and pure, to an extent beyond the bodhisattva on the first ground. Because he already possesses optimally the superior generosity described in the discussion of the first ground, and since among the remaining nine perfections, he does not possess the excellence in the practices of forbearance and so on to the extent he has for morality, morality is described as superior here. It is not that the other perfections are not present. The reference to the ten deeds is but an illustration of the prescriptive morality intended, so we must include here all positive prescriptions of morality as well.
Just as the radiant autumn moon possesses the twin qualities of cooling the scorching pain of heat and being resplendent with a white halo of light, likewise the bodhisattva who always abides in utterly pure ethical discipline — the one who abides in such pure morality — is adorned beautifully with the peace of having guarded the doors of his senses {69} and radiance such that his body glows with light.

A fully ordained monk may be especially pure in his morality with respect to his pratimokṣa monastic vows, but should he not relinquish seeing phenomena as established through their intrinsic nature, this monk’s morality will remain impure because of this reason. He will be like a moral degenerate who pretends to be endowed with moral discipline. The Heap of Jewels Sutra states:
Kāśyapa, now here, some ordained monks who are endowed with moral discipline, who are restrained by pratimokṣa vows and abide in them, whose rites and sphere of conduct are perfect, who view minute reprehensible acts with fear — having correctly taken the [precepts], they cultivate the bases of the training and become endowed with perfectly pure actions of body, speech, and mind. Because of these, their way of life is perfectly pure, but they still speak in terms of selfhood. Kāśyapa, this is the first example of a moral degenerate pretending to be endowed with moral discipline. . . .
Kāśyapa, again here, some ordained monks embrace perfectly the twelve learned qualities, but they objectify them. Thus those who abide with grasping at “I” and grasping at “mine,” O Kāśyapa, is the fourth example of a moral degenerate pretending to be endowed with moral discipline.[229]
“To speak of selfhood” is to objectify. This is indicated by “abiding with grasping at ‘I’ and grasping at ‘mine.’” And its meaning should not be understood in terms of the commonly shared notion of identity view; rather, it should be understood as not relinquishing grasping at “I” and “mine” as existing through their intrinsic characteristics. Since the pronoun “he” cannot be related to what has immediately preceded [at the end of the previous verse], the following translation by Naktso seems to be better:
If one sees his discipline to be pure intrinsically,
by this he becomes morally degenerate.[230]
Because one’s morality does not become purified if one does not relinquish object-laden views, the bodhisattva on the second ground always remains free of the flow of dualistic thoughts grasping at intrinsic existence in terms of real versus unreal and so on with respect to all three elements — the beings in relation to whom immorality is to be relinquished, what antidote is applied to relinquish, and who relinquishes them. {70}

Generosity by a giver that, had it been endowed with morality, could have brought perfect enjoyment of extraordinary wealth in an existence as a celestial being or a human, may instead bring enjoyment of varieties of perfect wealth in the lower realms, such as when one takes birth in the occasional hells, as a bull, as a horse, as an elephant, as a monkey, as a nāga serpent, and so on, or as a hungry ghost with great supernatural powers. This occurs when one has fractured the legs of morality — that is to say, when one is divorced of morality.
This explains how, if one is divorced of morality, the material resources that are the effects of having practiced generosity, instead of coming into fruition during an existence in the higher realm, may be realized during an existence in the lower realms. Therefore the person who practices generosity and wishes the fruits of his generosity to ripen during existence in the higher realms, as referred to above, should guard moral discipline.

{71} If divorced of morality, the fruits of one’s generosity will ripen during existence in the lower realms, and in this life too, one will experience merely the fruits of past acts of generosity. Owing to extreme foolishness [in the lower realms], one does not cultivate generosity and the like anew, and in this way one exhausts the interest and, along with it, the capital, the root itself. Then once the fruits of all past generosity have been spent, no prospects remain for one of any future wealth.
Consider this analogy. A farmer plants a few seeds, obtains an abundant harvest, and then plants even more seeds to grow more crops. For such a man, there is no interruption [of the fruits of his labor], since crops multiply. On the other hand, the foolish one who consumes [his crops] without planting new seeds will experience no such continuous increase.

When, like a heroic warrior who is living with favorable conditions free of bondage, we freely engage in whatever we wish without relying on others and live in the congenial celestial and human realms, if we do not retain this status we enjoy and protect ourselves from falling into the lower realms, then just like a [captive] heroic warrior who is bound and tossed from a high cliff, we will fall into the abyss of the lower realms and be at the mercy of others, and we will have no freedom. Once gone to the lower realms, what could enable us to rise up again from such as state? There is nothing that will help do such a thing.
In general, it is extremely rare that one would cultivate virtue while living in the lower realms. Furthermore, one will accumulate negative karma rapidly, so one will be compelled to pass birth after birth solely in the lower realms. Therefore, the sutras state, “Even if one is reborn among humans once in a hundred eons, two types of fruitions will occur.”[231] Thus being reborn as a human is said to be difficult indeed. So starting now, we must prepare so that we do not fall to the lower realms. For this too, we need to strive in moral discipline. {72}

Immorality is a source of numerous flaws, such as being led to the lower realms. Having engaged in the discourse on generosity, the Buddha, who has defeated all negative karma, proceeded to the discourse on morality to ensure that qualities like generosity do not become wasted. That is to say, he conducted the discourse subsequent to generosity. The reason is that morality, as the foundation of all qualities, is the field. When qualities such as generosity and so on spring up in this field of morality, then acts of giving and so forth as well as the enjoyment of their fruits, such as excellent physical forms and wealth, will become continuous. In this way, the array of such excellent fruits will increase, and one will be able to enjoy these for a long time. Otherwise, one will not be able enjoy such continuous fruits.
The significance of the above lines is this: Those who give should consider not only the possibility of the perfect enjoyment of wealth, which is the fruit of generosity, but they should also consider what the perfect form of existence is for enjoying such material resources, and how one can enjoy such resources across successive lifetimes. For these too, one should understand that moral discipline is an extremely important means.
As for the bodhisattvas on the beginner’s stage, they too must strive in acts of giving as explained above, and they must undertake this for the purpose of attaining buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings, the intended beneficiaries of such an aspiration. However, in the near term, the fruits of their generosity must ripen during their existence in the higher realms, and this must occur over successive lifetimes as well. As for such births, this depends on morality, and without such forms of favorable existence, the conditions for practicing the bodhisattva deeds will remain incomplete.

{73} Both the attainment of physical existence in the higher realms as well as lasting enjoyment of the fruits of generosity while living there depend upon morality, and morality is indispensable for attaining definite goodness as well.[232] In this manner, the cause of birth in higher realms for ordinary beings who have not yet entered the path and the cause of definite goodness for śrāvakas, who are born from the Sage’s speech; for those who are established for the path of self-enlightenment; and for the bodhisattvas, who are the children of the conquerors, is none other than morality. The meaning here is not that morality is the sole cause and that other causes are somehow excluded, for there are numerous causes besides morality. The meaning rather is that to achieve an exceptional birth in the higher realms or to achieve definite goodness, all other conditions must be definitely connected to morality; if it is shunned, these fruits can never be achieved.

Even if one is ultimately born among humans, having taken a life, for instance, brings forth two undesirable effects — brevity of life and abundance of illness — and likewise, each of the remaining nine acts also brings about two undesirable effects. In contrast, the ten virtues result in births as humans and celestial beings in the desire realm on up to the peak of existence [in the formless realm].
Above this, if the ten virtues are accompanied by an intermediate intention, one that focuses on securing one’s own welfare and renouncing cyclic existence out of fear and without great compassion, and if this is thoroughly purified by means the wisdom that realizes selflessness by following another’s words, one will definitely gain freedom through the Śrāvaka Vehicle. Above this, if in one’s final life in cyclic existence one does not rely on another’s power and focuses on the awakening of a pratyekabuddha, and if, without great compassion and skillful means, one comes to be purified by penetrating the truth of profound dependent origination, one will definitely gain freedom through the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle. Above this, if one has a loving heart that is vast and limitless, if one is endowed with compassion, if one’s path encompasses the skillful means, if one makes great waves of aspirational prayers, if one does not forsake sentient beings, and if one comes to be purified by focusing on the expansive wisdom of the buddhas, one will totally purify the bodhisattva grounds and achieve the vast deeds of pure perfections.[234] It is these points from that sutra that Candrakīrti summarizes here.

These statements above have been made in the context of the second ground, but in terms of actual practice, even bodhisattvas on the beginner’s stage need to engage in the practice [of morality]. One must, for instance, contemplate the crucial ethic of applying restraint against the ten nonvirtues, guarding even against motives that give rise to them, just as stated in the lines [above] “Wealth through generosity is found . . .” up to “the cause is none other than morality.”[236] And every time one trains in morality, one must do so on the basis of being sustained by the wisdom that realizes things without objectifying them. In addition, mere intellectual understanding and familiarization on a few occasions will get one nowhere; one must contemplate these points on a sustained and regular basis. If one cultivates familiarity on a sustained and regular basis, then the time will come when one’s mind engages these with a natural ease, even the practice of the bodhisattva deeds — which, when one first hears of or tries to engage in, may make one disheartened — and even those deeds that our Teacher, the Buddha, was not able to put into actual practice for a long time.

The third ground of the bodhisattva is called The Luminous. If asked, “Why is it called The Luminous?” It is true to the meaning of this name. When the bodhisattva attains the third ground, the fire of gnosis burning off all the fuels of phenomena — a fire that has the capacity to pacify all dualistic elaborations within meditative equipoise — produces light here. Here at this point, the child of the Tathāgata who has generated the third ground of the awakening mind perceives the light of gnosis with a copper-colored glow like the glow that appears at sunrise. That is to say, during post-meditation periods on this ground, the bodhisattva experiences the dawning of pervasive red or orange lights. Thus the Precious Garland states:
The third ground is The Luminous,
for the pacifying light of gnosis dawns.
Absorptions and clairvoyance have arisen,
and attachment and aversion have utterly ceased,
and as a fruitional effect of these [attainments],
he will engage especially in forbearance and diligence.
This great celestial being is most learned;
he has undone the attachment of the desire realm.[239]

Since the bodhisattva already possesses optimal excellence in generosity and morality, as described above, here, from among the eight remaining perfections, forbearance comes to be superior for him. The way it comes to be superior is this: The bodhisattva achieves excellence in the practice of forbearance to an extent he does not for the other remaining seven perfections. The bodhisattva of the third ground is characterized here as being innocent — an inappropriate object for anger — because he guards others’ minds, because he possesses pacifying gnosis as described in the lines “. . . the fire burning off all fuels of knowable objects,”[240] and because he does not exhibit with his body, speech, or thoughts such concerns as “He harmed me and my kin in the past,” “He is causing harm now,” or the suspicion that “He might do so in future,” which fuel antipathy toward others.
Though this is so, were a person who is disturbed from within to not only slice flesh but to do so from the bones of the body of a bodhisattva — not in large slabs but cutting it off ounce by ounce [and this too] not in one go but over a prolonged period, pausing regularly so that the cutting is not completed quickly — the bodhisattva will not experience any vexation toward the torturer. In fact, this will serve to increase his forbearance toward that person, and the bodhisattva will direct his focus on the sufferings of the hells and so on that the person might undergo because of that negative karma, suffering that is graver than any other types of similar suffering. This is how the bodhisattva comes to excel in forbearance.
Now on the first two grounds such as Perfect Joy, there is no disturbance within his mental continuum in response to having his body cut, but it’s said that he has not gained quite this level of mastery in forbearance. Therefore one should understand that it is from this ground onward that one comes to excel in forbearance.

Not only does his forbearance come to excel on the basis of focusing on the extensive sufferings, such as those of the hells, a bodhisattva of the third ground who sees selflessness and directly perceives these three spheres — {79} the one who cuts, what is being cut, [the act of] cutting of the body at what point in time, and in what manner — in fact sees all phenomena as images in a mirror. Free of acquired conceptions of “I” and “mine” too, the bodhisattva will have such forbearance [when facing harm].
The Commentary says, “The grammatical particle ‘too’ indicates that this too is a cause of forbearance.”[241] Not only does the bodhisattva remain undisturbed because of the reason given above, he also has great forbearance because of what has been just explained here. Also, just before this in the Commentary, the phrase “For this reason too”[242] should be read as “By seeing thus too.”

Now if you respond with vengeance or anger when someone harms you — namely, you react with anger toward the perpetrator of that harm — does your bitterness or rancor against the person help reverse what was already done? No, it does not. Therefore, resentment toward that person serves no purpose here in this life. Rancor is a fierce state of mind that is utterly harsh and has the same meaning as hostility. Not only is anger pointless, it brings more conflicts with one’s own welfare in the world beyond too. By giving license to anger, one casts oneself into future undesirable effects that will ripen after death. {80}

How can he, by inflicting harm on others in retaliation and by being angry at them with anger churning from his depths, lead himself to misery that is greater even than what he currently experiences? This would be illogical. Therefore, just as one endures pain inflicted by a physician, such as with a sharp needle, to help cure an illness, likewise, to avert limitless future sufferings, it is most appropriate to have forbearance toward immediate minor suffering.

{81} Indeed for whatever reason — either not ascertaining the object to be a bodhisattva or, though ascertaining to be a bodhisattva, out of strong habituation to the afflictions — if a bodhisattva experiences an anger felt even for an instant toward the Conqueror’s children who have generated the awakening mind, based on exaggerated projection of real or unreal faults, this alone destroys a collection of merit gathered over a hundred eons, such as virtue derived from habituation to the perfections of generosity and morality as described before. If this is so, what need is there to speak of a non-bodhisattva experiencing anger toward a bodhisattva? Therefore, just as the volume of water in the oceans cannot be measured with a scale, the extent of the fruitional effects of being angry toward a bodhisattva cannot be determined. Therefore, when it comes to propelling unwelcome consequences as its effects and when it comes to harming the virtues, there is no evil similar to intolerance — namely, anger. In Explanation of the Commentary, the phrase “exaggerated projection of real or unreal faults” is explained as exaggerating a minor fault as a great fault.[243]

With respect to the destruction of the roots of virtue, the Manifestations of Mañjuśrī Sutra says:
Mañjuśrī, what is called “anger, anger” is so named because it verily destroys virtues gathered over a hundred eons.[244]
Although it is not explicit in this sutra whether the object of the anger and the person who is angry here are both bodhisattvas, in Candrakīrti’s Commentary, both the object and the agent are described as bodhisattvas.[245] The Compendium of Sutras too, just before citing the above passage from the Manifestations of Mañjuśrī Sutra, quotes the following from the Maitreya’s Lion Roar Sutra:
If a bodhisattva were to berate, utter threats, and beat all ordinary sentient beings within this billionfold world system with a whip, a club, or with his fist, to that extent the bodhisattva would not suffer wounds or become injured by these. If, however, a bodhisattva were to engender a harmful intent, enmity, or a thought of hatred toward a single fellow bodhisattva, this alone would inflict wounds to that bodhisattva and injure him. Why is this so? Because if he had [by such an act] not already forsaken omniscience, such a bodhisattva would need to put on an armor for eons equal to the moments he engendered harmful intent, enmity, and thoughts of hatred to another bodhisattva.[246]
{82} Thus Candrakīrti’s account of how both the object and the agent of the anger here are to be explained as bodhisattvas appears to be based upon this sutra passage.

Although some commentaries on Guide to the Bodhisattva Way state that a single instance of anger toward a sentient being destroys virtues gathered over many thousands of eons, this is hard to believe. In any case, although these two masters do not specify the object and the agent, the object of anger that destroys roots of virtue of a hundred or a thousand eons has to be a bodhisattva. As to the agent of such anger, the expression “great bodhisattva being” infers that it is a bodhisattva more advanced than the bodhisattva who is the object of such anger.
The agent of anger in this context is certain to be a bodhisattva on the ordinary stage, while the object can be either one who has attained the grounds or one who has not. So, the following three permutations are possible: (1) a more advanced bodhisattva being angry at a less advanced one, (2) a less advanced bodhisattva being angry at a more advanced one, and (3) both the object and the agent of the anger have equal attainment. In the first case, the virtues destroyed would be those of a hundred eons, and if a non-bodhisattva were to become angry at a bodhisattva, it seems the virtues destroyed would be that of a thousand eons. As to how extensively the roots of virtue are destroyed in the second and third cases, and how to understand the superiority and inferiority of the object in the context of the second example, these should be examined on the basis of scriptures.

The passages in the Maitreya’s Lion Roar Sutra citation “within this billionfold world system” up to “not . . . injured by these”[248] explain how a bodhisattva who, on the basis of experiencing anger in his mind toward a non-bodhisattva, verbally berates him and physically hits him is different from one who wounds a bodhisattva and injures a bodhisattva. From this we can understand that it is not necessary in such a case to don the armor once again from the start. In contrast, regarding a bodhisattva who merely engenders anger toward another bodhisattva, even without any manifestation in body and speech, it is said that he needs to don armor for eons equaling the number of instants such a state of mind lasted. It seems that the object of such anger is a bodhisattva who has received the prophecy, while the agent is a bodhisattva who has not yet received the prophecy.

The Condensed Perfection of Wisdom states:
If a bodhisattva who has not yet received the prophecy {83}
feels anger and initiates dispute with one who has received it,
he must don the armor for as many eons as the moments of his flawed mind of enmity.[249]
The need “to don the armor once again from the start” means the following. Say a bodhisattva is able to progress soon from the “great” stage of the path of accumulation to the path of preparation. Were he to become angry at a fellow bodhisattva who has received the prophecy, then equal to the number of instances he experienced such anger, for that many eons, he will not be able to advance to the path of preparation. He will instead need to train on the path once again.

In this respect, the Guide to the Bodhisattva Way says:
If, toward a bodhisattva who is a great benefactor,
one were to engender thoughts of ill will,
for eons equal to the instants such ill will arose
he will reside in the hells, so the Sage said.[250]
Here, it is stated that equal to the instants of angry thoughts that one has engendered toward a bodhisattva, for that corresponding number of eons, one would remain in the hells. There is also the ill consequence of destroying the roots of virtue gathered over many eons. Now, if someone who has not received prophecy were to experience anger toward a bodhisattva who has received it, he will remain in the hells; this is just as mentioned in the immediately preceding passage. There is also an instance where the bodhisattva will have to don the armor for that number of eons. Thus there are two cases.

The Gathering All Fragments Sutra states that if one accrues the karma of abandoning the Dharma, one would have to declare and purify this defect three times every single day for up to seven years to purity its fruitional effects, but to obtain the forbearance level of the path of preparation would require ten eons, even it were swift.[251] As this states, purifying and cultivating resolve in all possible ways may not rectify the delaying of the path, but it will cleanse the fruitional effects of the karma; so we must strive in them.

There are instances where both the object and agent are not bodhisattvas, yet when anger is experienced it destroys the roots of virtue. This is, for example, as explained in the following text from the Sarvastivāda school cited in the Compendium of Training:

Then, with his palms folded, Upāli approached where the Blessed One was and asked, “If the Blessed One speaks of how great the root of virtue of this monk is, {84} how does such a root of virtue come to be diminished, thoroughly purged, and completely exhausted?”
“O Upāli,” replied the Buddha, “I have seen nothing comparable to inflicting wounds on and causing injury to those who are engaged in the practice of pure conduct. Upāli, this will thin out, thoroughly purge, and completely exhaust that great root of virtue. Therefore, O Upāli, if one should not harbor malevolent thoughts even toward a log, what need is there to speak of harboring malevolent thoughts toward a body imbued with consciousness?”[252]
“Thinning out” refers, for example, to turning a root of virtue that was great when generated into a smaller one, what was long when generated into a shorter one, and so on. This is a weaker form of exhaustion, as it does not destroy the effects entirely. It appears that “purging” refers to a medium level of exhaustion, while “completely exhausting” refers to a great degree of exhaustion.

As to what specific roots of virtue come to be destroyed, this is not explicitly stated in the sutras cited above.

The Teachings of Akṣayamati Sutra, as quoted in the Compendium of Sutras, cites the simile of a drop of water that falls into the great ocean. Just as that drop does not dry up until the dawn of the great eon, the roots of virtue dedicated to enlightenment do not expire until awakening is attained.[254] Similarly, the Adornment of Trees Sutra cites the simile of transforming a thousand ounces of base metal into gold with an ounce of mercury elixir known as “gold-appearing” without the base metal ever consuming the elixir. Like this, it is stated, the mercury elixir of the awakening mind cannot be consumed by all the base metals of afflictions.[255]
If one thinks, relying on such statements, that the awakening mind, the roots of virtue sustained by it, and those virtuous roots dedicated toward awakening cannot be destroyed by anger, one would be mistaken. For it has been stated that even the virtuous roots of the great bodhisattvas can be destroyed. {85} Thus the meaning of the first sutra cited above is that these roots of virtue are not exhausted because of their fruition; it does not mean that they cannot be eroded by anger. And the meaning of the second sutra is that the afflictions cannot totally annihilate the awakening mind in the way in which, on the basis of awakening mind, the afflictions can be eliminated.

Regarding the phrase “destroying the roots of virtue,” some assert that it means the potency of the virtues to swiftly produce effects is destroyed — the production of their fruits is postponed, and the fruits of anger and the like are brought forth in its place. But it is not the case, they say, that their fruits cannot ripen later on if those roots of virtue meet the appropriate conditions. For if no mundane path can eliminate the seeds of their corresponding objects of relinquishment, how can an affliction eliminate the seeds of virtue? This would be impossible, they assert.
There is no logical entailment in this reasoning. Take the example of nonvirtues that have been purified by ordinary beings through applying the four powers in antidote practice. This does not eliminate the seeds, and yet it remains impossible for a karma thus purified to produce ripening effects, even if suitable conditions are later met. Similarly, one who attains the peak and forbearance stages of the path of preparation has not yet eliminated the seeds of wrong view or the causes for taking birth in the lower realms, and yet it remains impossible for wrong views to arise or for one to take birth in the lower realms, even if the bodhisattva were to meet the conditions in the future. So it has been stated.

As stated here, whatever karma happens to be reaped first, virtuous or nonvirtuous, this blocks the space for other karmic fruits to be reaped. But this alone is not reason enough to say that it destroys virtues or nonvirtues; nowhere has this situation been explained in such terms. Had it been so, all the other powerful nonvirtuous karma should also have been described as “destroyers of virtuous roots.” In any case, the autocommentary to the Essence of the Middle Way explains that in both of these two cases — cleansing of nonvirtues through application of the four powers and the destruction of the roots of virtue by wrong views and harmful intent — [the karma] are akin to damaged seeds from which no sprouts can emerge, even when suitable cooperative conditions are met; that is, they remain incapable of producing effects even if they later meet with conditions.[257]

The destruction of virtues by anger does not mean that the instant anger has arisen, virtues become nonexistent in the mental continuum of that person. Rather, it injures the virtues’ capacity to produce their effects. Here too, since three degrees of annihilation — small, medium, and great — are described, to the extent [a root of virtue] has been injured, to that extent it is made incapable of bearing its fruits. Thus there are two ways [the arising of anger] can inflict an injury. One is the destruction of the power to swiftly give rise to new levels of paths, and the other is to harm the arising of fruits such as birth in the higher realms.

Being angry toward a bodhisattva, insulting them, and disparaging them out of negative motivation are described {86} in the Compendium of Sutras as limitless in terms of their ill consequences.[258] Furthermore, the consequences are the same regardless of whether one has recognized one’s object to be a bodhisattva and whether one’s grounds for being angry are valid. In view of this, we must strive with all our efforts to prevent anger in general and, in particular, anger directed toward those who are engaged in monastic life as well as toward bodhisattvas.

The Ākāśagarbha Sutra states that a root infraction will destroy virtues that have been generated in the past.[259] The Compendium of Training states that gazing at the householder’s life while yearning for gifts and honor, swelling with manifest conceit, and forsaking the Dharma are all acts through which virtues generated in the past will be consumed and virtuous activities will fail to increase.[260] Therefore, recognizing the conditions that destroy roots of virtue, we must specially strive to relinquish them. What I have presented here is but a brief summary; one should definitely read the Compendium of Sutras and the Compendium of Training.

{88} Just as on this third ground the bodhisattva attains purity of the perfection of forbearance, in the same way, he attains the purity of four absorptions (dhyāna), such as the first level of absorption. And, exemplified by this, he will attain the four formless attainments (infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, and the peak of existence), the four immeasurables (loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity), and the five types of clairvoyance (supernatural feats, divine ears, knowledge of others’ minds, recollection of previous lives, and divine eyes).
Although he may enter and exit these absorption states and formless states seeing that they help complete the causes of awakening, he will take birth through the power of aspiration prayers thinking especially of this. He will not take birth through the power of the mundane absorptions and formless attainments. He is able to do this starting from the first ground, but on this ground the bodhisattva attains a higher training in concentration that is far superior to previous grounds, and with that, he experiences greater temptation to take birth through such power. This is why this point is mentioned here. And here, on this ground, attachment and aversion come to exhaust completely, thus attaining their cessation.

The conjunction “and” (dang) carries the meaning of “also,” and it is there to include what is not mentioned — namely, delusion.[262] The meaning of the word “exhaust” here should not be taken to be total exhaustion. For even the sutras state that all four fetters of desire, form, cyclic existence, and ignorance are thinned out.[263]
With respect to what is meant by these statements [about exhaustion of attachment, aversion, and delusion on this bodhisattva ground], Asaṅga’s Bodhisattva Grounds explains that it is through the power of mundane meditative absorption and formless attainment that one becomes free from attachment toward the desire, form, and formless realms. This is the elimination of manifest level as spoken of earlier. This seems, therefore, why the word “thinned out” is used. The fetters [being thinned out] too seem to be the ones mentioned in the Abhidharma texts.
In connection with this matter at hand, there is the statement in the Ten Grounds Sutra, “His fetters in the form of views were already eliminated previously.”[264] Some explain this sentence to mean that the last three of [five types of false] views are eliminated on the path of seeing. However, this should be taken to mean that the acquired dimension of the five views have been eliminated on the path of seeing. The Bodhisattva Grounds, however, reads this in the following way: “The fetters that are views are eliminated from the ground of engagement by imagination, because it is there that one first aspires to the suchness of the ultimate nature of things.”[265]

Next in that same sutra, it states that false attachment, aversion, and delusions, which are not likely to recede for many hundred thousands of eons, are eliminated on this ground.[266] This should be understood as the elimination of their seeds, and that too in terms of the specific object of abandonment relinquished on this ground. Of the innate afflictions relinquished on the path of meditation, the first six — the three levels of great and the three levels of the medium — {89} are correlated with the second to the seventh bodhisattva grounds.[267]

The Commentary’s author [Candrakīrti] does not speak explicitly of the elimination of acquired afflictions from the first ground and of the elimination of the innate dimensions from the second ground onward. But Nāgārjuna’s Precious Garland states that until the eighth ground is attained, there is no annihilation of the seeds of the afflictions; grasping at true existence must be considered an affliction; until grasping at true existence is annihilated, the identity view does not come to be annihilated; and on the first ground, the three binding factors are eliminated.[268] Therefore it is extremely clear that a differentiation between two classes [acquired versus innate] must be made within the afflictions in general and a twofold distinction needs to be made with regard to the identity view in particular.

<d e="2">
Now, in this Candrakīrti tradition, which takes grasping at true existence as an affliction, when the afflictions are eliminated by the uncontaminated paths, the seeds of grasping at true existence are invariably eliminated as well. However, at this stage, one cannot permanently annihilate, even in part, the habitual propensities for dualistic perception, which are other than these seeds and are taken to be subtle obscurations to knowledge. So, since no subtle obscuration to knowledge can be eliminated until all afflictions are annihilated, the subtle obscurations to knowledge are eliminated during the three pure grounds [the eighth to tenth].

The bodhisattva abiding on the third ground becomes almost like the celestial king Indra, the sovereign among the gods. He will at all times be able to destroy all the attachment of the world of the sentient beings associated with the desire realm. As such he will become a chief [of beings] and will be thus skilled in rescuing other sentient beings from the mires of desire. As for the conjunctive particle “also,” what appears in Naktso’s translation “Also at all times he will destroy attachments toward the desire realm”[269] seems to read better.

Although both lay and monastic bodhisattvas are practitioners of generosity, [morality, and forbearance], from the point of view of what is easier and what is more difficult to pursue, the three practices of generosity and so on are said to be easier for the householder bodhisattvas to pursue. So the Sugata lauded these three mostly for such practitioners. These three also constitute what is known as the collection of merit from among the twin collections [of merit and gnosis]. {90} This collection is the cause of the buddha’s form body — that is, its principal cause. The Precious Garland too states:
There, generosity and morality
and the teaching on forbearance
were taught especially for the laity.
So constantly cultivate familiarity with these
that take compassion as their essence.[270]
In the context of the three teachings that are easier for lay bodhisattvas to pursue, generosity refers to supplying material needs and fearlessness, morality is that of the laity, while forbearance is primarily the one derived from reflecting resolutely on the Dharma. In contrast, diligence, meditative absorption, and wisdom are easier to pursue for monastic bodhisattvas. It is not the case, however, that either of these two [lay and monastic bodhisattvas] do not possess the other remaining perfections. The “collection of gnosis” consists of meditation and wisdom, and these two are principally the cause of the buddha’s dharmakāya. Diligence is a condition for both collections.

Since this bodhisattva destroys the darkness of faults that undermine the higher qualities, on this ground he becomes extremely piercing, like the sun. Nevertheless, no heat of anger remains toward defective beings, for his habituation to forbearance has become supreme and his mental continuum has become well polished by compassion.

<d e="2">
No higher qualities come about for someone who does not take joy in virtue[271] because there is no engagement at all in generosity and so on. In contrast, for those who derive joy from having gathered or in gathering the qualities like generosity mentioned above, the qualities that he has already attained will be enhanced and those not yet attained will be achieved. Therefore, all higher qualities, without exception, follow after diligence, and it is the cause of the two collections of merit and wisdom, or gnosis. The ground where such diligence comes to be especially set ablaze, that ground is the fourth, The Radiant. Since on the third ground the bodhisattva has attained higher training in concentration far more excellent than that of the first two grounds, from this he has achieved a unique pliancy that permanently dispels laziness. So on this ground, the perfection of diligence comes to be superior.

The fourth is called The Radiant

The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment refer to the seven sets, such as the four establishings of mindfulness.
The four establishings of mindfulness are the establishing of mindfulness of (1) the body, (2) feelings, (3) mind, and (4) mental objects.
The four perfect endeavors are (1) generating the virtuous factors that have not yet arisen, (2) increasing those that have already arisen, (3) not generating the nonvirtuous factors that have not yet arisen, and (4) perfectly relinquishing those that have already arisen.
The four limbs of supernatural feats are those of (1) aspiration, (2) diligence, (3) mind, and (4) analysis in the form of concentration.
The five faculties are the faculties of (1) faith, (2) diligence, (3) mindfulness, (4) concentration, and (5) wisdom.
The five powers are the powers of faith and so on.
The seven limbs of enlightenment are the limbs of enlightenment of perfect (1) mindfulness, (2) clear discrimination of the character of phenomena, (3) diligence, (4) joy, (5) pliancy, (6) concentration, and (7) equanimity.
The eightfold ārya path consists of the ārya paths of right (1) view, (2) intention, (3) speech, (4) action, (5) livelihood, (6) diligence, (7) mindfulness, and (8) concentration.

As far as the actual training goes, the higher training in morality correlates to the second ground, the higher training in the mind [or concentration] correlates to the third ground, while the higher training in wisdom correlates to the fourth, fifth, and sixth grounds. So here on this ground, the bodhisattva becomes especially endowed with the training in wisdom that is highly versed in the coarse and subtle aspects of the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment. {93}

The meaning of the word cessation here is that the bodhisattva eliminates those seeds of the twofold self-grasping that are the specific objects of abandonment to be relinquished by this ground; it is not the case that the entirety of self-grasping is annihilated.

On this fifth ground, among the ten perfections, it is the perfection of meditative absorption that one comes to excel in. Seeing as the bodhisattva had previously become superior in the first four perfections — generosity up to diligence — it is easily understood that the point of reference here must come from among the remaining six perfections. This is to say, the bodhisattva has attained on this ground a level of absorption that can never be trodden upon by such opposing forces as distraction, and this extent of mastery is lacking for the perfection of wisdom and the rest. Not only does the bodhisattva become superior in meditative absorption, he also gains mastery in refined understanding of the nature or essence of the truths of the wise — namely, the āryas — understanding that requires comprehension through refined intellect. Therefore here he becomes endowed with superior wisdom versed in the coarse and subtle aspects of the truths.

The Ten Grounds Sutra[276] says that the fifth-ground bodhisattva comes to be versed in the four noble truths of suffering,{95} its origin, cessation, and path, and separately it also says that he comes to be versed in the conventional and ultimate truths. This raises the question of how there can be four truths distinct from the two truths when it is clearly stated in the Meeting of Father and Son Sutra[277] as well as in Nāgārjuna’s Fundamental Wisdom that the number of truths is exhausted within the division of two truths.
To respond to this question, Candrakīrti’s Commentary confirms that there is no truth not encompassed within the two truths. The four truths, he explains, were taught to demonstrate that what is to be relinquished (the class of afflicted phenomena) includes their origin (the cause) and suffering (the effect), and what is to be affirmed (the class of enlightened phenomena) includes the path (the cause) and cessation (the effect). Of these, the Commentary states that truths of suffering, its origin, and the path belong to the conventional truth, while the truth of cessation belongs to the ultimate truth.[278]

In his Commentary to Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning too, Candrakīrti explains nirvana to be the ultimate truth and the other three truths [out of the four] as conventional truths,[279] and nirvana here refers to the truth of cessation. Furthermore, in this commentary to Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning, Candrakīrti points out how the Buddha accepts the possibility of direct knowledge of the truth of cessation, and how this would be untenable for the Buddhist essentialists who assert direct valid cognitions to possess as their object things endowed with intrinsic characteristics. In his own tradition, Candrakīrti establishes the understanding of how cessation is directly known in terms of the realization of suchness by the uncontaminated gnosis of meditative equipoise. So, if cessation were conventional truth, such presentations would become utterly untenable. Furthermore, Candrakīrti repeatedly endeavors to establish the necessity of direct realization of the truth of suchness when nirvana is actualized. Therefore to speak of the truth of cessation as a conventional truth would indicate an incomplete analysis.[280]

Now, although the negation of true existence — the object of negation — on a given basis is defined as the ultimate truth, this does not entail that the object of negation of whatever constitutes ultimate truth is necessarily nonexistent. For example, the Praise to the Ultimate Expanse states:
That which if not known
makes one revolve in the three worlds,
that which definitely abides in all beings —
to that ultimate expanse I bow and pay homage.
That which is the cause of samsara,
from purifying this very thing comes
the purity that is nirvana;
dharmakāya too is this.[281]
This states that when the ultimate nature of things tainted with stains is purified, that constitutes nirvana and dharmakāya. Similarly, there are numerous instances [in the texts] where the object of negation in the context of pristine ultimate reality is described as a “stain.” Now, if it were impossible for the ultimate nature of things to become free of stains, endeavor would then be pointless. {96} If, on the other hand, it is possible, then this implies that its object of negation does have an existence and is knowable. This is analogous to the following example. The rabbit’s horn, which is the object of negation in the context of the phrase “the nonexistence of rabbit’s horn,” does not exist as a knowable, yet one can still posit the absence of a vase — whose object of negation [i.e., a vase] does exist [in general] as a knowable — as an instance of that nonexistence of a rabbit’s horn.[282]

So, from the point of view of the ultimate nature of things that pervades all phenomena, both pure and impure, this is indeed defined in terms of the negation of the two kinds of self, where what is negated has no existence in reality at all. However, as a given basis becomes progressively more purified of stains, its ultimate nature too becomes progressively more purified. Therefore, for certain special types of bases, it is inadequate to leave its purity only one-sided. Its purity must also include the purification of the relevant adventitious stains, and it is this [such ultimate nature] that is called “the truth of cessation.”[283]
Many terms mentioned in the Ten Grounds Sutra contain the word truth in them, such as “being versed in the truth of defining characteristics” on this ground, and among these, there is none that is not encompassed within the two truths.

Having attained on the fifth ground a thoroughly pure perfection of meditative absorption, the bodhisattva abides in the most excellent mind of meditative equipoise of the sixth ground — namely, Directly Facing, or The Manifest. Thus this bodhisattva on the sixth ground, who on this basis sees the profound truth of dependent origination of mere conditionedness, attains true cessation because of his dwelling in the most excellent perfection of wisdom. Prior to this, such as on the fifth ground, the bodhisattva did not attain such cessation, for he has not reached superiority in the excellent perfection of wisdom. One cannot attain the cessation through excellence in the first five perfections alone. This ground is called The Manifest (1) because here, on the basis of superiority in wisdom, the reflection-like ultimate nature of things becomes manifest, (2) because on the fifth ground the bodhisattva took the true paths as his object, and (3) because the bodhisattva now turns to the attributes of perfect buddhahood.

The Explanation of the Commentary interprets the second reason here in terms of the path by which the nonperception of cognition and its object becomes manifest.[285] However, the description of how “on the fifth ground the bodhisattva took the true path as his object” simply refers to the last of the four truths. The meaning, in other words, is that the bodhisattva on the fifth ground became versed in the coarse and subtle aspects of the four noble truths, and on the sixth ground, the wisdom versed in the four truths comes to full realization.
The first reason indicates how the wisdom versed in the sequential and reverse order of [the twelve links of] dependent origination comes to full realization here on this sixth ground. Thus the meaning here is that, on the basis of full realization of these two trainings in wisdom, the four noble truths and dependent origination have come to be manifestly known by the bodhisattva. Since the three trainings in wisdom [illusion-like reality, the four noble truths, and the twelve links of dependent origination] are fully realized on this ground; {98} given that the more distinctly superior one’s tranquility the more distinctly superior will be one’s insight; and given how on the fifth ground the bodhisattva attained the most excellent perfection of meditative absorption, so here on the sixth ground, the perfection of wisdom comes to be most excellent. Therefore it is from this ground onward that the special form of absorption into cessation is attained.

Just as, for example, a single man with eyes can easily lead a group of blind men to their desired destination, likewise here too, in the context of the path, intelligence — namely, the perfection of wisdom — leads or thoroughly sustains the virtues such as generosity that are sightless in relation to suchness. And in this way, wisdom guides them to the resultant Conqueror’s state. For it is through the perfection of wisdom that one sees without distortion what is a right path and what is not. The Condensed Perfection of Wisdom too states:
Millions and billions of blind people bereft of sight,
ignorant of the roads, how can they reach the towns?
Without wisdom these five perfections,
lacking sight, cannot touch awakening.[288]
The Diamond Cutter too says:
A person with sight who steps into the dark will not see anything. So too view the bodhisattva who has fallen into grasping at real entities while engaging thoroughly in generosity. O Subhūti, it is thus. When day breaks and the sun shines, the person with eyes will see all the varied forms. {99} So too view the bodhisattva who has not fallen into grasping at real entities while engaging thoroughly in generosity.[289]
The same applies to morality and so on.

One might ask, “How is it, as stated above, that when the bodhisattva on the sixth ground sees dependent origination, he sees the suchness of dependence origination in terms merely of this emerging from that?” To respond to this, the Commentary says:
The nature of this is something that does not fall within the purview of those like us whose eyes of intelligence are entirely covered by the dense cataracts of ignorance. It does fall, however, within the purview of those abiding on the advanced grounds, such as the sixth ground. Therefore, this is not something to be asked of someone like us. One should pose this question to the buddhas and the bodhisattvas who are free of the cataracts of ignorance, whose eyes of intelligence are anointed with the salve that is the excellent vision of emptiness, which destroys the cataracts of ignorance.[290]
The application of an eye ointment makes one’s vision clearer but does not remove the eyes. Likewise, applying the ointment that is the vision of emptiness makes one’s eyes of intelligence clearer, but it does not remove one’s eyes of gnosis. If one understands this point, one will not be tainted by the pitiful disparaging view that there exists no gnosis in the meditative equipoise of āryas.[291]
Now one might ask, “Don’t sutras such as the Mother [Perfection of Wisdom] and the Ten Grounds teach that bodhisattvas who engage in the perfection of wisdom see the suchness of dependent origination? So why don’t you follow the scriptures when you expound it?”
[Candrakīrti responds that] ascertaining the purport of the scriptures is also difficult, so someone like us cannot reveal suchness even by citing the scriptures.
This statement is made from the perspective of teaching suchness independently by oneself. However, to indicate that treatises have been composed by authentic masters who can expound the scriptures without distortion, and how, on the basis of these, one can ascertain the purport of the scriptures, the text says: {100}

One might ask, “How did the noble Nāgārjuna ascertain the meaning of the definitive scriptures?”
This we know on the authority of the scriptures. The Descent into Laṅkā Sutra states:
In the south in the land of coconuts,
there will come a monk known as the Glorious
who will be called by the name Nāga.
He’ll crush standpoints of existence and nonexistence;
he’ll expound in the world my vehicle,
this unsurpassed Great Vehicle.
Accomplishing the ground of Perfect Joy,
he’ll depart to [the pure land] Sukhāvatī.[292]
Thus it was stated that Nāgārjuna will expound the definite vehicle, which is the freedom from the two extremes of existence and nonexistence. This prophecy refers to the Licchavi youth Lokapriyadarśanā, a contemporary of the Buddha mentioned in the Sublime Golden Light Sutra[293] who would later take birth [as Nāgārjuna].

The Great Clouds Sutra states:
When it has been four hundred years after my death, this youth will become a monk known by the name of Nāga and will propagate my teaching. Finally, he will become a king called Jñānākaraprabha in the realm known as Utterly Transparent Light.[294]
These citations establish with certainty, therefore, that there exists in the definitive scriptures an undistorted prophecy of Nāgārjuna.

The Mañjuśrī’s Root Realizations Tantra also gives the time of Nāgārjuna’s coming and his name as found in the preceding sutra. There it is stated that he will live six hundred years.[295] In the Great Drum Sutra it is stated that this Licchavi youth Lokapriyadarśanā will be a monk bearing the name of a teacher and will propagate the teaching when it comes to decline eighty years after the Buddha’s death. He will pass away after a hundred years {101} and will take birth in Sukhāvatī.[296] This too is accepted by the elder Bodhibhadra and the great Atiśa to be a prophecy of the master[297] and is premised on the account of Licchavi Priyadarśanā sharing the same mental continuum with Nāgārjuna. In the Great Drum Sutra, the monk is stated to be of the seventh ground.[298] However, this statement and those cited above cannot be taken as contradicting each other. For example, some scriptures describe some of the Guardian Kings as stream-enterers, while others describe them as buddhas, so one finds a lot of variations in the scriptures.

As for the definitive treatises, they should also be taught to not just anyone but to those who, because of past habituation, have planted the seed for realizing emptiness. Others, even if they listen to treatises that present emptiness, will suffer grave injurious consequences because they are plagued with distorted understandings regarding emptiness. Such grave injurious consequences will transpire like this: some, being unlearned, will forsake emptiness and will depart to the lower realms; some will apprehend the meaning of emptiness of intrinsic existence in a distorted way as “All of these phenomena are nonexistent; they do not exist at all.” They will thus apprehend it mistakenly, and the wrong view disparaging all the phenomena of causes of effects will be first engendered and, held on to, will come to increase further and further.

In relation to this issue, Candrakīrti comments on the following stanza:
Emptiness viewed mistakenly
dooms those of weak intelligence,
like a snake wrongly held
or a spell wrongly incanted.[299]
He says that, to not fall to the extreme of disparaging conventional truth, one must not slight the reflection-like karma and its effects; and to not fall to the extreme of reifying ultimate truth, one must see karma and its effects only in things with no intrinsic existence.[300] To be contrary to these two is described as falling to the extremes of eternalism and nihilism. Thus Candrakīrti has stated that were one to conceive conditioned things as nonexistent, this would constitute a wrong view. Now there may be a linguistic level of difference between nonexistent and not being existent; but insofar as conveying the sense of nonexistence is concerned, no matter how carefully one might analyze, no difference whatsoever can be found between these two words.

Also, in commenting on the following lines from Four Hundred Stanzas —
One goes to the lower realms alone;
those not ordinary go to peace alone[301]
— Candrakīrti explains that some who are not sublime and listen to the teaching of selflessness only end up going to the lower realms because of a tendency to either (1) dismiss emptiness or (2) gain distorted understanding of it.[302] Thus both these responses are described as leading to the lower realms. {102} “To gain a distorted understanding” is to apprehend the meaning of emptiness in nihilistic terms as nonexistence.

Thus, regarding individuals who lack the power of intelligence to appreciate the extremely subtle points yet possess evident conceit of having such ability, if they engage with fervor in their false determinations of the mere words related to the profound truth that lies clearly beyond their capacity, this will bring grave injurious consequences. Therefore we need to be especially careful with matters such as these.
One may ask, “It seems to be difficult therefore to determine who is appropriate to teach emptiness to and who is not appropriate to teach. So how does one make such a determination?” To indicate that this can be made on the basis of external signs, the text says:

Even ordinary persons on the beginner’s stage, when hearing an undistorted discourse about emptiness, sheer joy surges again and again within their heart because of hearing such a discourse. Tears born of such joy fills their eyes, and their hair stands up in their follicles. Such people have what is called the seed of realizing emptiness, the seed of the nonconceptual gnosis of perfect buddhahood. It is people such as these who are the perfect vessels for this teaching by a well-versed master. So to them you should teach the sublime ultimate truth, the truth whose characteristics will be explained below.
The point here is that if one sees these physical signs emerge on the basis of two convergent facts — that the person hears the discourse on emptiness and that he understands what is being heard — then such signs indicate unmistakenly that the person is a suitable vessel. In contrast, if the person does not understand the meaning, or even if he does, if the signs do not arise, one cannot determine for the time being that he is a suitable vessel for the profound truth. Even so, if he adheres to the dictates of his sublime teachers, such a person may in the future become a suitable vessel to deposit numerous new potencies for realizing emptiness. {103}

Teaching emptiness to the vessels described above will not be fruitless. Why? Not only will such listeners not be saddled with the injurious consequences of distorted apprehension of emptiness, for them the ensuing qualities that result from listening to the view of emptiness will come to birth. How do these come about? These suitable vessels will relate to hearing the view of emptiness like finding a treasure; and so that this view does not degenerate in other lives, adopting perfect morality, they will always abide by it. They will do so by reflecting, “If, due to moral degeneration, I were to fall into the lower realms, the continuity of the view of emptiness will be broken.” Thus they will adopt moral discipline and guard it without degeneration. Becoming morally degenerate does not require first adopting a moral code; even committing those acts that are naturally reprehensible, which are contrary to virtue, constitutes moral degeneration.

They will further reflect, “Even if, because of observing morality, I am born in the higher realms, I may become poor and bereft of the conditions for sustenance, such as food, drink, medicine, and clothing, and devoted to seeking these, the continuity of my hearing the view of emptiness and meditating on its meaning will be broken.” Thus, as explained before, they will practice generosity in relation to the higher and lower fields.[303] Reflecting “It is the view of emptiness sustained by great compassion that will lead to buddhahood and not otherwise,” they will cultivate the habit of great compassion, which is the root. Reflecting, “Through anger one goes to the lower realms, destroys one’s virtues, and acquires an extremely unappealing countenance, and because of these the āryas will not be pleased,” they will practice forbearance. Given that morality and so on that are not dedicated repeatedly to a buddha’s omniscience do not become causes for buddhahood, and that uninterrupted continuity of their fruits in the form of embodiments and material resources will fail to emerge, {104} they will dedicate thoroughly their virtue of morality and so on to freedom from cyclic existence for all beings. And seeing that others like śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas cannot teach the profound dependent origination like bodhisattvas, they will come to tremendously revere the bodhisattvas who aspire to perfect awakening.

For those of the Great Vehicle whose understanding of the view of emptiness has penetrated the essential point, a perfect understanding as described above will arise, and they will become reverential toward cultivating the vast aspects of the path. Such people would certainly be objects worthy of the highest acclaim. The Commentary on the Awakening Mind states:
Those who understand this emptiness of phenomena
and also conform to the law of karma and its results:
that is more amazing than amazing!
That is more wondrous than wondrous![304]
Such things will come to pass for those who have the following two characteristics: (1) They have shunned the two faults, which are forsaking emptiness by being either of the two kinds of unsuitable vessels — one that lacks admiration for the teaching and the other that seems to admire it but concludes that reason negates the entire world of cause and effect — and (2) they have come to realize that, on the basis of the view of emptiness as the absence of intrinsic existence, all presentations [such as causality] are all the more tenable.

Otherwise, when one allegedly engages from the standpoint of someone who has found the view, the entire presentation of karma and its effects, such as morality, risks being reduced to something akin to counting the ridges of a rabbit’s horn. One might come to hold the view that “All such presentations [of morality and so on] are for the benefit of those who have not understood the definitive meaning but are irrelevant for someone who has understood the definitive meaning. They are nothing but conceptual fabrications, and all thinking constitutes grasping at signs in the form of clinging to true existence.” Thus, like the Chinese monk Heshang Moheyan, one will come to undermine all the virtues.

Some might say that for now, one does need to observe the ethical norms [at least] from the standpoint of delusory perception. Now, if one does distinguish two kinds of thinking — one that grasps at true existence and one that does not — then the assertion that reason negating intrinsic existence negates everything becomes meaningless chatter. If one recognizes no such differentiation of two types of thoughts, then the two categories of realization — those pertaining to the view of emptiness and those pertaining to the aspect of altruistic conduct — will each come to undermine the other, just like heat and cold. Furthermore, it will become impossible to define (1) the delusory perspective the standpoint from which [things are posited], (2) that which posits, and (3) what are being posited. So to speak in such terms [that things are posited purely from a delusory perspective] amounts to nothing but a conjuration in the dark.[305] Such protagonists in fact uphold the very standpoint critiqued by the treatises referred to above. {105}

The Commentary on the Four Hundred Stanzas says:
If he grows to esteem the discourse on emptiness of intrinsic existence, then by cultivating conditions conducive to it, his behavior will help increase his admiration for emptiness. His compassion will be great, he will repay the kindness of the Blessed Tathāgata, and he will have the wish to completely relinquish the causes that obstruct the sublime Dharma — namely, the causes of the great abyss. He will consider the destitute and will give away even those things that are hard to give. He will gather others as well through the four means of attraction. So, with all your efforts, certainly reveal this sublime teaching to those who are the vessels of sublime Dharma.[306]
So, as the above teaches, one should reveal this discourse with great effort. This is, of course, to those who are free of the two faults of being an unsuitable vessel. Even to those who have admiration but do not understand it exactly as it is, one should explain this teaching skillfully so that it does not undermine their conviction in dependent origination. For a speaker who is most learned, to teach his listeners, including those at least minimally qualified as suitable vessels, is a deed of great merit.

He who aspires for the profound teaching collects all the merit, for he will, until buddhahood is attained, accomplish all the mundane and supramundane perfect factors. This is spoken in the Gift of Youth Ratna Sutra: “O Mañjuśrī, compared to a bodhisattva bereft of skillful means who engages in the six perfections for a hundred or thousand eons, someone who listens to this class of teaching [on emptiness] even with doubts {106} will generate far more merit. If this is so, what need is there to speak of listening to it without doubt. What need is there too to speak of someone who writes it out in words and transmits it through reading, upholds it, and teaches it extensively to others as well?”[307]

In the Diamond Cutter too it says:
The Blessed One stated, “Subhūti, what do you think? Say, for example, there were banks of the river Ganges equal in number to the number of grains of sand that exist on the banks of the Ganges, will this be a great number of grains of sand?”
“If the grains of sand on the banks of the Ganges are so numerous, what need is there to speak of the grains of sands of that many banks of the Ganges?” replied Subhūti.
To this the Blessed One said, “O Subhūti, I will share this with you. Understand thus. Say a man or a woman fills worlds equal in number to the grains of sand on the banks of the river Ganges with seven types of precious materials and offers these to the tathāgatas. Will that man or woman generate, on that basis, a vast amount of merit?”
“O Blessed One,” replied Subhūti, “yes, this will be a vast amount. O Tathāgata, this will indeed be a vast amount.”
Then the Blessed One said, “One who upholds even a stanza of four lines of this class of teaching and reveals it to others as well will generate even greater merit.[308]

In the Treasury of Tathāgatas Sutra too, after enumerating the ten great nonvirtues, it states that if someone who possesses these were to enter the teaching of selflessness with faith and aspiration to understand all phenomena as being primordially pure, such a sentient being will not go to the lower realms.[309] Also the Chapter on Defeating the Māras says:
A monk who understands all phenomena to be utterly tamed understands even the initial thresholds of misdeeds to be devoid of intrinsic existence and dispels the remorse borne of the occurrence of misdeeds and thus does not consolidate it. Because of this, if this act subdues even the heinous deeds, what need is there to speak of the minor deeds — erroneous practices of the rites and moral discipline?[310]

Now, to optimize the benefits received from expounding [the profound truth], two conditions must be present: one’s motivation must be pure through not seeking gifts, honor, or fame, and one must not misconstrue the meaning of the teaching one is expounding but explain it without distortion. For it has been said that if one expounds on the basis of both or either of these two faults, this will impede the gathering of great stores of merit.

Since the listener too must have a pure motivation and not misconstrue the meaning, both teacher and student should ensure that at least a minimum of qualifications is present when teaching and listening.

Here in the Ten Grounds Sutra it states:
When the bodhisattva on the fifth ground enters the sixth ground, he does so by means of ten perfect equanimities with respect to phenomena. What are these ten?
They are (1) the perfect equanimity of all phenomena in their absence of signs; (2) the perfect equanimity of all phenomena in their absence of defining characteristics, likewise (3) in their absence of birth, (4) in being unborn, (5) in being void, (6) in their primordial purity, and (7) in their freedom from elaborations; (8) the perfect equanimity in their absence of affirmation and rejection; (9) the perfect equanimity of all phenomena in their resemblance to illusions, to dreams, to mirages, to echoes, to reflections of the moon in water, to mirror images, and to conjurations; and (10) the perfect equanimity of all phenomena in their absence of the duality of real and unreal.
When he realizes the nature of all phenomena in such terms, because of his sharp and apposite forbearance, {108} he will attain the sixth ground — namely, The Manifest.[313]

“Likewise” indicates that the phrase “[the perfect equanimity of] all phenomena” must be extended up to “in their absence of affirmation and rejection.” These two [the absence of affirmation and rejection] are a single perfect equanimity. The equanimities in terms of phenomena’s resemblance to the seven similes such as illusions should be taken as one perfect equanimity. And the last two [of real and unreal] should also be considered as a single perfect equanimity. There seems to be some variance in the identity of the ten perfect equanimities even between the Commentary on the Ten Grounds Sutra and the Bodhisattva Grounds.[314] Since those two texts differ in their interpretation of emptiness from this tradition, the ten perfect equanimities are here explained in a manner distinct from them.

Of these [ten perfect equanimities], the first is that all phenomena are equal insofar as all these appearances of diverse signs do not exist from the perspective of the ārya’s meditative equipoise. The second is the equanimity of all phenomena insofar as they are all devoid of existence by virtue of their intrinsic characteristics. These two represent a general presentation.
The remaining eight present particular variations of the very truth thus explained in general. For instance, the “absence of birth” is from the perspective of the future, and “unborn” is from that of another temporal standpoint. That all phenomena are equanimous or equal must be understood in the context of other [remaining statements] as well. “Being void” refers to being devoid of “what is to be born” and “what is already born.” These, in turn, must be understood in the sense of being “absent” of existence qualified by intrinsic characteristics, as stated in context of the second perfect equanimity. This fact too [of being devoid of existence through intrinsic characteristics] is not something constructed by scripture or reason; rather, they remain so as primordially pure. This is the sixth.

The seventh, the absence of dualistic elaboration, should be correlated to the first equanimity, while the freedom of elaboration of language and conceptualization should be correlated to the second equanimity.[315] The same [second] equanimity statement should be applied to the eighth as well. The ninth consists of numerous analogies that help ascertain the truth as explained above. The tenth refers to the fact that whatever the phenomenon, all are the same in lacking intrinsic existence in terms of the duality of real versus unreal. “Sharp” refers to swift intelligence, while “apposite” refers to forbearance toward the unborn nature commensurate with that of the eighth ground.[316] There appears to be various types of apposite forbearance depending upon the context.
Although many scriptures teach the suchness of phenomena, the context here is the explanation of how the wisdom of the sixth ground realizes suchness. Thus the citation here is from the scripture that states how the bodhisattva enters the sixth ground by means of ten perfect equanimities.

In setting forth all phenomena as devoid of true existence, if one does not understand well what constitutes true existence and what constitutes grasping at true existence, one’s view of emptiness will certainly go astray. Here, Guide to the Bodhisattva Way states {109}:
Without touching upon the imputed entity,
the absence of its reality cannot be grasped.[317]
Thus if the imputed entity — namely, the generic concept of “what is to be negated” — does not appear clearly to one’s mind, it is said that one will not be able to pinpoint the absence of that object of negation. Therefore, if a clear sense of what is the purported true existence — that which is said not to exist — as well as what phenomena are understood to be empty of — the object to be negated — does not arise in one’s mind, it would be impossible to ascertain clearly the nature of the absence of true existence as well as the nature of emptiness. It is not enough to have identified true existence as postulated by proponents of philosophical tenets or their corresponding apprehensions of true existence. It is most essential, therefore, to have identified well the innate grasping at true existence — which persists since beginningless time and is present both in those whose minds are tempered by philosophical tenets and in those whose minds are not thus tempered — as well as the purported true existence grasped at by such an innate mind. Without identifying these, one might engage in eliminating the object of negation through reasoning, but this would not undermine whatsoever the clinging to true existence that persists since beginningless time, and thus miss the entire purpose at hand. Now to do this, we must first identify the grasping at true existence that lies within our own mind and understand how the various Madhyamaka reasonings function directly and indirectly to eradicate its object. Negation and affirmation that are directed solely outward will have scant benefit.
On a related note, if one can understand the identification of what is to be negated according to the Prāsaṅgika Madhyamaka and Svātantrika Madhyamaka, one will be able to appreciate the fine differences in their views. Hence, this presentation has two parts: identifying grasping at true existence according to the Svātantrika Madhyamaka standpoint and identifying grasping at true existence according to the Prāsaṅgika Madhyamaka standpoint.

Other reliable treatises of Svātantrika make no clear identification of the object of negation, but Kamalaśīla’s Light of the Middle Way presents a criterion for conventional existence, the contrary of which can be recognized as constituting the criterion of ultimate or true existence. Here is what the text says:
Though things do not possess essence in reality, the erroneous mind reifies them contrary to their nature. This [erroneous mind] is called the conventional [saṃvṛti, literally, “concealer”] because, as it were, it obscures suchness or, through it, suchness is covered over.

As such the sutra states:
The arising of things is on the conventional (saṃvṛti);

is held to be a concealer (saṃvṛti) of the perfect truth.[318]

Because it [perception of things] originates from this [erroneous mind], what it reveals — namely, all the false things being perceived — are stated to be conventional only. This [erroneous mind], in turn, comes about from the ripening of a habitual propensity to err that exists since beginningless time. That [mind] reveals entities to all sentient beings as if they were real in nature, and this they all come to perceive. Therefore all things that are false in their nature and [are posited] by virtue of the power of the minds [of sentient beings] are said to exist only conventionally.[319]

Up to “This [erroneous mind] is” [in the first part of the citation] indicates how beings mistakenly ascribe ultimate existence to what are ultimately devoid of intrinsic nature. From “conventional” up to “covered over”[320] presents the meaning of the phrase “concealer of final truth”; here “conventional” is taken to be the concealer in that it conceals the final truth. Because it originates from grasping at true existence, that which sees what that grasping reveals as truly existent is a thought, not a sensory cognition. The commentary to the Two Truths states that true existence, which is the object of negation, does not appear to sensory perceptions,[321] and this remains true here as well. From “This [erroneous mind], in turn,” up to “beginningless time” presents this grasping at true existence to be innate. Thus “to all living beings” is mentioned. As for the minds of these living beings, this is not only conceptual thoughts; it also includes the nonconceptual cognitions. Things come to be posited by virtue of these two [classes of consciousness]. That things do not exist on the ultimate level and that these false entities exist only on the conventional level is the meaning of the line “The arising of things is conventional.” The meaning here, however, is not that they exist as the concealer — as the grasping at true existence. Understood thus, an existence through its own objective mode of being and not posited in dependence on being perceived by cognitions or posited by virtue of the power of cognitions constitutes true, ultimate, and final existence.[322] And grasping at this is the innate grasping at true existence.

One might ask, “If this is so, how do you explain this statement in the Light of the Middle Way: ‘To say that ultimately there is no arising is to say that they [arising, disintegration, and so on] are not established as such by perfect cognition’?[323] For, through implication, this defines ultimate existence and [ultimate] arising in terms of being established as arising and as existence by a rational cognition of suchness?”
[Reply:] Yes, this is true. But you must understand that, with respect to the proviso “ultimately,” there are two senses of the term ultimate. One is where rational cognition [of emptiness] in the form of the threefold wisdom of hearing, reflection, and meditation are characterized as “ultimate”; phenomena are not established by such cognitions in the manner defined above. The other sense of ultimate is where existence through a thing’s own objective mode of being and not by virtue of the power of cognitions is defined as “ultimate existence.” {111}
Of these two, the first ultimate and something established from its perspective do exist, while it is impossible for the second ultimate and something established from its perspective to exist.

</d>
<d e="2">
Therefore, while existing ultimately in the second sense does imply existing ultimately in the first sense, grasping in terms of the first sense of ultimate existence does not constitute innate grasping at true existence. For innate grasping at true existence requires grasping at things in the second sense of ultimate existence.

Failing to draw this distinction, many appeared who considered “that which is capable of withstanding reasoned analysis” or “an entity capable of withstanding such analysis” to be the measure of the object of negation. Numerous errors have apparently been made because of this. For instance, some assert that ultimate truth is not a knowable phenomenon; others view it as truly existent.[324]

In contrast, if one appreciates well the above distinction [between the two senses of “ultimate”], one will come to appreciate such crucial points as there being no contradiction between the statements “things do not exist through their own essential mode of being or ultimately” and yet “the ultimate nature of things does exist” and to speak of this as constituting the essential mode of being and the ultimate.[325]

The analogy of magical illusion has been hailed as a way of making one understand how something exists by virtue of being posited by the power of the mind and how something exists without being posited in such a manner. When the magician conjures a horse or an elephant from pebbles, sticks, and so on, three types of people are present — the magician himself, the spectators whose eyes are affected, and the spectators whose eyes are unaffected. In the first case, the horse or elephant is perceived but not apprehended; in the second case, it is both perceived and apprehended; while in the third case, there is neither perception nor apprehension of a horse or an elephant. Now, when the basis for conjuring the illusion is perceived as a horse or an elephant — unlike in mistaking a rope for a snake, where one can say that the rope is a snake for that perception but not in general — one cannot say that the basis for conjuring the illusion appears as a horse or an elephant merely to an erroneous cognition but that, in general, there is no such appearance. For even without such qualification, one has to accept that [the pebbles or the sticks] are being perceived as a horse or an elephant. Were this not so, then no perceptual error in relation to appearance would be possible. Therefore one can posit that the basis for conjuring an illusion does appear as a horse or an elephant.

Now, for the magician, the illusory elephant or horse is posited from the point of view of how it appears to an erroneous perception. It is not posited, however, from the point of view of the basis for conjuring the illusion. From the perspective of the spectators, however, the appearance of a horse or an elephant does not seem to be posited through the power of the mind; rather, they apprehend a real horse or elephant fully occupying space on the very spot where it is being perceived. This is how, on the basis of the analogy, one apprehends something to be posited through the power of the mind or not posited through it. So when an appearance is perceived in relation to a given basis, there are two possibilities — one where what appears constitutes its mode of existence as perceived and {112} another where it does not.

By comprehending this point well, one will be able to avoid the confusion that arises from the thought “Since objects are established by valid cognitions, and since valid cognitions are themselves cognitive states, their establishment of the objects would constitute the objects being posited through the power of the cognitions. In that case, true existence will be negated even in the system of the Buddhist essentialists.” One will thus be able to disentangle the conflation of these two senses. For the sense in which objects are said to be defined by valid cognition refers to the two classes of objects being cognized by valid cognition. So this sense is very different from the previous sense [of the objects being posited by virtue of the power of cognitions].

According to Yogācāra-Madhyamaka, the appearance of the illusion is established by reflexive awareness. According to Svātantrika Madhyamaka, which accepts external reality, it is established by sensory perception that apprehends either the basis, such as the environs, or the empty space. That it does not exist in the way it is perceived is established through such reasoning as “If it did exist in such a manner, this would be seen by unaffected eyes as well, but that is not the case.” When, through negation such as this, there is the convergence of its appearance as such and it being empty of such, then, from the perspective of ordinary conventional cognition that is not seeped in philosophical standpoints, such an illusion is established to be a falsehood. This [cognition of falsehood] and the cognition that establishes a mirror image to be empty of what it appears to be, therefore, do not constitute either coarse or subtle levels of rational cognition [pertaining to suchness].

Even with respect to true existence from the perspective of ordinary conventional cognition generally, when there is the appearance of a thing as being something, then it being empty of such a thing simply does not occur. Similarly, when it is found to be empty of being such a thing, its appearance as such just does not occur. Where there is indeed the convergence of the two [e.g., mirror image], such things are false even from the perspective of ordinary conventional cognition.

Compared to the mind grasping at the object of negation as defined by Prāsaṅgika Madhyamaka, this presentation of Svātantrika Madhyamaka is very coarse and therefore does not constitute the subtle innate grasping at true existence. Nevertheless, when true existence as conceived by such grasping has been negated through reasoning, then just like the magician, one will no longer apprehend outer and inner phenomena as possessing a mode of existence not posited by cognitions; one will come to understand them as existing merely as established by virtue of the power of cognitions. And it is those things established by virtue of the power of cognitions and not invalidated by [other] valid cognitions that are accepted to possess conventional existence. It’s not the case that whatever the mind posits is accepted to have conventional existence. {113}

Suppose our cognition posits the arising of a sprout from its seed; this does not contradict the sprouts arising from their seeds on their own part as well. Similarly, things that are the basis for conjuring an illusion do appear, on their part too, as a horse or elephant. By this one should understand the way all phenomena exist on the conventional level. Since even the ultimate nature is established by virtue of its appearance to the cognition that perceives it, it does not stand as a counterexample to the entailment of [whatever is established by virtue of the power of cognitions necessarily being] conventional existence. Therefore the following is definitely not the sense in which the analogy of illusion is to be understood: “Just as an illusion appears as a horse or an elephant but is empty of them, all things, such as a vase, appear as a vase and so on but are devoid of vases and so on.” For if that were so, there could be nothing that could be said to be itself. Furthermore, the parallels being drawn between the analogy and its referent here would be in terms of their appearance as such but not in terms of their actuality.[326]

Determining that all knowables are subsumed by the twofold classification into the conditioned and the unconditioned, conditioned things are further differentiated into material and not material. Based on this, one then refutes the notion that matter is composed of particles that are partless in the sense of having no directional parts, such as east and so on, and the notion that mental phenomena are composed of a series of indivisible points devoid of temporal parts, such as preceding and subsequent moments. These refutations one should understand as explained elsewhere.[327] One establishes in this way the logical entailment that all conditioned things are composed of parts. Next, if the parts and the bearer of the parts are distinct entities, they will then become unrelated, which is rejected; thus they are shown to be a single entity. Now at this point, however much one directs one’s thought to a given thing, it becomes undeniable that parts and their bearer, though being a single entity, appear as if they are distinct. Like a magician’s illusion, the convergence of two facts is established: the appearance of things as something and their emptiness of it.

This is not a problem for a false mode of existence posited through our cognition. But such a convergence becomes untenable if we are speaking of an objective mode of existence not posited by virtue of its perception in cognition. For if something were to possess true existence as defined earlier, there could be no disparity between the way the thing actually is and the way it appears. For if something is truly existent, it must remain so invariably, shunning any aspect of falsehood. Furthermore, the cognition that perceives the parts and their bearer as distinct entities would have to be veridical, which would invalidate their being one entity.
Once this absence of true existence of conditioned things is established, one can also negate, with the very same reasoning, {114} the true existence of the unconditioned. For example, one must admit that even unconditioned space pervades some material objects, and thus there must be parts that pervade the east and parts that extend in other directions.

Likewise, suchness too has numerous directional parts in terms of its extension as well as [conceptually] distinct parts, those realized by distinct preceding and subsequent moments of cognition. The same is also true of other unconditioned phenomena. Now, since parts and their bearer cannot be of different entities, they are of one entity. Furthermore, a disparity between appearance and reality is permissible in something that is false but not in something that is truly existent. So when one engages in the foregoing refutations, one will establish that all phenomena lack true existence. This is the approach of Śāntarakṣita and his spiritual heir Kamalaśīla. Those who confine their analysis of parts and wholes to conditioned things alone suffer from a weak intellect.
Now there is indeed a sense of falsehood that is well known even to a mind not informed by philosophical thinking, but this is not the same sense of falsehood being proposed here by the Madhyamaka.
Therefore, although things can be posited by such a [nonphilosophical] mind, this is only in the sense acknowledged within such a perspective. This would not be accepted by the Madhyamaka to exhaust the meaning of “being posited by the mind.”

In view of this, although there is no mode of existence that is not posited by virtue of being perceived by the mind, it is not a contradiction in this tradition [of Svātantrika Madhyamaka] for there to be a mode of existence that is posited by virtue of being perceived by the mind yet is not a mere nominal designation. Given this, a great deal of difference can be perceived by the mind between the objects of negation of the two Madhyamaka schools.

In its commentary too one reads:
Those things that exist only because of the presence of conceptualization and have no existence when there is no conception are without doubt like the snake conceived upon a coiled rope — definitely not established in their own right.[332]
“Perfectly real” means something existing in its own right, and “conceptualization” arises in relation to it. The statement in this commentary about how attachment and so on are like the imputation of a snake upon a rope merely presents them as examples. The statement in fact shows how all phenomena are posited by conceptualization just like a snake conceived on the basis of a rope.
For instance, when a rope that looks like a snake because of its multicolored pattern and the manner in which it is coiled is encountered in a poorly lit area, the thought “This is a snake” may arise. At that moment, there is not the slightest objective basis on the part of the rope — either in aggregate or in its parts — that can be identified as an instance of a snake. Therefore this snake is a mere conceptual imputation. Similarly, when the thought “I am” arises in dependence upon the aggregates, there is not even the slightest basis on the part of the aggregates — whether as a collection of earlier and latter continua or as collection of simultaneous factors and parts — that can be posited as an instance of this “I.” This will be explained more extensively below. For this reason and because there is not even a slightest entity that is distinct from the aggregates — whether in terms of their parts or their bearer — that can be taken to be the basis [of this “I”], so this “I” is posited through mere conception in dependence upon the aggregates; it has no existence in its own right.

This is stated in the Precious Garland as well:
The individual is not the earth or the water;
he is not the fire, not wind, nor space;
he is not the consciousness; so if he is not all these,
where then is the individual apart from these?[333]
Here “individual” is the person, the sentient being, the “I,” or the self. “Not the earth” and so on up to “not the consciousness” refutes the postulation of the six elements of the sentient being, which are its parts, as constituting the person, while “not all these” {116} negates postulating the sum of these elements as the person. The final line refutes postulating something that is a different entity from these elements as the person. Nevertheless, it is not the case that one does not accept the existence of the person at all; nor does one accept foundation consciousness and so on as the person. Therefore the noble Nāgārjuna too accepts [the nature and existence of the person] exactly as explained by the Commentary’s author.
If one understands how the person is posited through conception like this, one will understand how all other phenomena are posited through conceptualization in exactly the same way.

The point of the first line is to state the reason “Because the person is designated in dependence on the collection of the six elements.” The point of the third and the fourth lines is to state that, since it is impossible for something not to consist of parts and a bearer of the parts, each element is, in turn, designated in dependence on the collection of many constitutive parts. Therefore they do not exist on the level of absolute reality or by virtue of their own essence. Furthermore, if they are designated in dependence on the collection of their constitutive parts, neither the parts nor the bearer of the parts can be the thing itself, yet something of different entity from these cannot be the thing either.
Now, insofar as the way vase and so on are conceptually posited, they are, in that respect at least, exactly similar to a snake imputed on the basis of a rope. However, between the vase and so on on the one hand and the rope-snake on the other, the two cases are entirely different when it comes to whether they exist, whether they are capable of effective functions, and so on. This is because there is a clear distinction between the two in whether their conventions remain essential for everyday transaction and whether the usage of such conventions is susceptible to invalidation. That everyday transactions remain tenable in this world posited through conceptualization represents, among the commentators of the words and meaning of the Madhyamaka treatises, a unique tradition of interpreting the noble Nāgārjuna and his son by the three masters — Buddhapālita, Śāntideva, and this master Candrakīrti. This issue [of how everyday translations remain possible in a world posited through conception] is indeed the most difficult point of the final view of the Middle Way.

Understood thus, then as the Precious Garland states, nothing whatsoever, not even the mere names, exist on the ultimate level, and on the conventional level too, nothing exists other than what are posited as mere designations through conventions such as names:
Because material things are mere names, {117}
the space too is a mere name;
how can there be matter with no elements?
Therefore mere names too do not exist.
Feelings, discriminations, mental formations,
and consciousness — contemplate these
just like the elements or the self.
Therefore the six elements have no selfhood.[337]
And
Apart from being designated by conventions,
how could there be a world in reality
as either existent or nonexistent?[338]

If one understands these well, one will soundly comprehend (1) how phenomena are necessarily posited through dependence, (2) how, by the very virtue of their being dependently designated and having arisen through dependence, they have no existence in their own right, (3) how they do not possess an independent nature, something not posited through the power of some other conventions, and (4) no matter the phenomenon, when it is posited as existent, it is done so without analysis — without seeking a true referent behind the designation.

Grasping at things as existent as described above — not posited by the power of conventions such as name alone — constitutes innate grasping at things as (1) “true,” (2) “ultimate,” or (3) “absolute existence,” (4) “existence by virtue of an essential nature,” (5) “existence through intrinsic characteristic,” or (6) “intrinsic existence.” And the object grasped at by such a mind is, hypothetically speaking, the measure of true existence.
It is the case here as well that one needs to be cognizant of there being two senses of the term ultimate when qualifying the object of negation with the proviso “ultimately.”[339] Although the proponents of Svātantrika Madhyamaka maintain existence in terms of the first three — true existence and so on — to be impossible, they nonetheless accept, on the conventional level, the remaining other three — “existing by virtue of an essential nature” and so on.[340] Personally, I see this Svātantrika standpoint to be an example of great skillful means to help guide those who are, for the time being, not capable of easily realizing the extremely subtle view of suchness.

Thus “the purported reality of phenomena, not dependent upon some other factor (namely, the convention-making conceptualizing subject) — an intrinsic nature supposedly not posited through such conceptualization” — is what is called self-existence, and this is the object of negation. And the absence of this in relation to a person has been stated to be the selflessness of persons, while its absence upon phenomena such as eyes and so on has been stated to be the selflessness of phenomena. From this we can implicitly understand that grasping at such an intrinsic nature on the basis of the person and on the basis of phenomena are the two forms of self-grasping.

This is as declared in Commentary on the Four Hundred Stanzas:
Here what is referred to as “self” is that intrinsic nature — namely, the nature of things conceived of as not dependent upon others — {118} and the absence of this is selflessness. Because of the twofold distinction of persons and phenomena, this selflessness is understood in terms of two kinds — the selflessness of phenomena and the selflessness of persons.[341]
Here too, in the following, Candrakīrti explains that the two forms of selflessness are distinguished not from the viewpoint of what is to be negated but from the viewpoint of their basis:
The Buddha taught no-self in twofold terms, that of phenomena and that of persons. (6.179b)

With regard to the innate identity-view of grasping at self-existence, since the root text [of Entering the Middle Way] rejects the aggregates as its object of focus, and furthermore, in the Commentary, the self that is dependently designated is said to be its object of focus, we should take the mere “I” or the mere person that is the focal object giving rise to the thought “I am” to be the object of the identity view. As for its aspect, the Commentary says:
The thought “I am” imputes a self that does not exist, conceives such self to exist, and manifestly clings to it as real.[342]
So, as stated here, the identity view grasps the “I” as truly existent.

Furthermore, the Commentary states:
The identity view is an afflicted intelligence that operates by way of “I” and “mine.”[343]
Therefore, as described here, for something to be the focal object of the innate identity-view, it must spontaneously give rise to the thought “I am.” Thus, although the innate grasping at persons with separate continua as existing through their own intrinsic characteristics does constitute grasping at the self-existence of persons, it is not the innate identity-view. The phrase “operating by way of ‘I’ and ‘mine’” does not indicate that mere “I” and mere “mine” are the held objects of apprehension [of this innate identity-view]; what is indicated is that such an innate identity view possesses the aspect of apprehending these two, “I” and “mine,” as existing through their intrinsic characteristics. Furthermore, it is “mine” itself that is the focal object of the innate identity-view grasping at “mine;” we should not understand the eyes and so on to be its focal object. As for its apprehending aspect, it grasps at “mine” as existing through intrinsic characteristics, on the basis of taking “mine” it as its focus.[344]

[Question:] If this is so, how is it that in the Commentary, in the part pertaining to the line “then, with the thought ‘mine’” (1.3b),[345] Candrakīrti writes, “Thinking ‘this is mine,’ they manifestly cling to all the things that are other than the object of grasping at ‘I’”[346] and thus states that clinging to “this is mine” on the basis of focusing on bases such as the eyes is a form of grasping at “mine”?
[Reply:] The meaning here is this. On the basis of having perceived the eyes and so on as “mine,” we tend to manifestly cling to a “truly existing mine.” It is not the case, however, that eyes and so on — which are instances of “mine” — are themselves the objects of focus. For this would bring the consequence that being an instance of identity view and a grasping at the self-existence of phenomena would not be mutually exclusive. {119}
As for the focal object of the innate grasping at the self-existence of phenomena, this includes grasping at the aggregates of form and so on, at the eyes, ears, and so on of both self and others, as well as at the external environment that is not part of our inner world. As for the aspect apprehended by this grasping at the self-existence of phenomena, it is the same as explained above [in the context of grasping at self-existence of persons].[347]

Now it is these forms of grasping at self-existence, of persons and phenomena, that constitute the ignorance binding us to the cycle of existence. For example, Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness says:
Things arisen from causes and conditions:
that which conceives these to be real
the Buddha taught to be ignorance;
from this emerge the twelve links.[348]
Thus taking the things and phenomena as one’s objects and grasping at them as existing with final reality is said to be the ignorance that is the root of cyclic existence. And since such grasping at the self-existence of phenomena brings ignorance grasping at the self-existence of persons, it is taught that the twelve links of dependent origination come into being from such grasping. For this ignorance to cease, one must see how nothing exists in the way such ignorance apprehends it and how the self-existence it conceives has no bearing on reality.

The Commentary’s author too writes “Yogis engage in the negation of selfhood” (6.120d) and states how it is necessary to realize selflessness through eradicating the object of self-grasping. Therefore, if one simply withdraws the mind from pursuing its object, without eradicating the object of self-grasping, {120} this cannot be taken as engaging with no-self. The reason is this: When the mind engages an object, it does so in one of three modes: (1) apprehending that object as truly existent, (2) apprehending it as not truly existent, and (3) apprehending it without qualifying in either of these two terms. It is not invariably the case that because one does not apprehend something as lacking true existence one apprehends it as truly existent. Likewise, just because one does not engage with either of the two forms of selfhood does not necessarily mean that one is engaging with either of the two forms of selflessness. There are countless instances where the perspective of the mind remains in a third option.

When it comes to the two forms of self-grasping as well, we should identify them in our own mental continuum. Looking there, we need to establish, on the basis of the very thing we are deluded about, how it does not exist in the manner we ourselves are apprehending it. Otherwise, if our refutation [of self-existence] and affirmation [of emptiness] are directed only outwardly, then our pursuit becomes like a person searching for the footprints of a thief in the meadow while the robber has in fact fled into the woods. Such a pursuit will have no impact at all.

So when we have thus identified well what constitutes grasping at true existence, we come to recognize numerous instances of thought that do not constitute either of the two forms of grasping at self-existence. This will, therefore, help prevent all the misconceptions pertaining to the view that reasoning inquiring into suchness negates all objects apprehended by conceptual thoughts, no matter what. There are so many issues arising from questions such as this that require more discussion. Some of these have already been addressed on numerous occasions elsewhere, and some will be addressed below as well. So I will not elaborate further here.[354]

Understanding that, out of the ten perfect equanimities, the other perfect equanimities can be easily indicated by presenting through reasoning the perfect equanimity of the absence of arising through intrinsic nature alone, {121} the noble Nāgārjuna states the following at the beginning of his Treatise on the Middle Way:
Not from itself, not from other,
not from both, nor from no cause —
nothing anywhere
ever possesses arising at all.[355]

“Ever” is synonymous with “on any occasion,” while the word “anywhere,” which is synonymous with “in any place,” is a locative. And these terms, which present the basis where there is no arising, indicate place, time, and philosophical standpoints. The word “nothing” refers to things of inner and outer that do not arise in any of these three terms. Thus the meaning of this stanza that begins “Not from itself” is as follows.
“It is never possible for anything of the outer and inner worlds to arise from itself at any place, at any time, and through any philosophical standpoint.” This is how one should apply the three terms and explain. Similarly, one should extend this application [of the three terms] to the other three propositions as well: “It is never possible for anything to arise from other, from both self and other, and from no cause.” Although in the Tibetan version of Clear Words, this phrase is translated as “from itself nothing whatsoever” the translation [suggested] here reads better.[356]

The phrase “at any place, at any time” negates the possibility of interpreting along the lines akin to the situation where grapes do not grow in some areas (due to place) and crops do not grow during some seasons (due to time). Thus the inclusion of the word “never” is not meaningless. Similarly, the phrase “through any philosophical standpoint” rejects the thought that although intrinsic arising may not exist from the standpoint of Madhyamaka, it could exist due to the philosophical standpoint of an essentialist school. This is not to state, however, that things do not arise according to the essentialist schools.

The Commentary says:
Here the term “not” should be associated with arising from itself [and so on] — the proof of existence — and not with existence per se. For the negation of that [existence itself] is effected by way of implication.[357]
What this states is that [Nāgārjuna’s stanza] should not be read by dividing the stanzas into two parts, with the last two lines presenting the thesis and the first two lines presenting the argument. Rather, it should be read as “There is no arising from itself [ever or at any time]” and extend this same predication to the other three theses as well. The point is simply this: Were there arising through intrinsic nature, one would have to accept arising from any of the four possibilities as its evidence. Hence Candrakīrti refers to arising from four extremes as the “proof of existence.” Now when arising from the four extremes is negated, then by implication, arising through intrinsic nature is also negated, hence there is no fault of not being able to establish the absence of intrinsic arising by formulating the argument in this way. This then is the meaning of the last word “implication” [in the above Commentary passage.] I am not saying that it is incorrect to take the negation of arising from the four extremes as the logical reason to establish the absence of intrinsic arising, as it is done in Light of the Middle Way.[358] {122} What I am saying is that dividing Nāgārjuna’s stanza into separate parts, in the manner described above, is not what the text itself intends.
“Things do not arise from other at any place, at any time, or because of any philosophical tenet” is how the three terms should be applied.

Similarly, the following appears in Clear Words:
We accept conventional truth to be established by mere conditionedness, not on the basis of adhering to any of the four positions. To do so entails the consequence of speaking of things as endowed with intrinsic nature.[359]
So arising from other is not a convention of the scriptures; it is a convention of philosophical schools. Furthermore, when arising from other is proposed, it is done so on the assumption that the other is something that exists by way of intrinsic characteristics. Therefore, if one accepts such arising, one naturally subscribes to the notion that things are endowed with an intrinsic nature. In this Candrakīrti tradition, however, arising from other does not exist even on the conventional level. We accept cause and effect to be distinct entities on the conventional level, but this alone does not meet the criteria of what constitutes arising from other. This is analogous to the following: as is stated [in 6.23a], given that each and every phenomenon bears dual natures on the conventional level, nature is something that does exist, but such a nature is not accepted in terms of intrinsic arising.

Clear Words states that the thesis that things are devoid of arising from themselves is a nonimplicative negation, and this is true also of the other three propositions. Therefore, when establishing the absence of intrinsic existence, the thesis to be established must be a nonimplicative negation — that is, the simple elimination of what is being negated. This is stated by Clear Words when it says:
Since statements such as “Whatever sounds there are in the world, / they are all unreal” and “nothing exists” are found, the intention is to express the negation without implication. So the meaning of “unreality” here is absence of intrinsic existence.[360]

Also, the Commentary says:
Having stated the four theses, now to establish these through reasoning, I will explain . . .[361]
Later on, using the negation of arising from the four extremes as the reason, things are spoken of as being free of intrinsic arising. Furthermore, at the end of negating arising from the four extremes, Clear Words states, “Thus this establishes that there is no arising.”[362] It is not the case therefore that Candrakīrti does not wish to establish that things are devoid of intrinsic arising.[363]

The statement in Clear Words that “The inferences have as their effect only the negation of what others propose”[364] refers to the fact that propositions are there only to refute intrinsic existence adhered to by the other; the sense here is that, apart from this, they do not establish anything else. The statement does not, however, reject the establishment of that simple negation. Likewise, there is the following statement:
As for us, {123} we do not establish this to be either nonexistent or existent; rather, we refute what others impute to be existent and nonexistent. This is because our wish is to clear away the two extremes and establish the path of the middle way.[365]
The meaning of this statement too is that one merely eliminates the two extremes of existence and nonexistence as adhered to by the other, and apart from this, nothing else is to be established. It is not the case, however, that the simple negation of the two extremes is not being established; for it states that the wish is to clear away the two extremes and establish the path of the middle way. If things are not established as devoid of intrinsic existence, then since there is no third possibility, this would entail that things have intrinsic existence.

As for the reasons why, although one accepts the thesis and proofs such as these, one does not become a Svātantrika Mādhyamika, I have explained these extensively elsewhere.[367] So I will not elaborate further here.
How then are the two forms of negation defined? In general, negation is cognized by the mind on the basis of explicit elimination of the relevant object of negation. So the determination of something as not being that which is not itself [e.g., a vase not being a non-vase] is not in itself a negation. On the other hand, we find terms like ultimate nature and ultimate truth, which do not explicitly negate any opposites on the linguistic level, yet when their referents appear to the mind, they do so in the aspect of eliminating conceptual elaborations. Such terms are therefore terms of negation.

Negation is of two kinds.[368] Of the two, nonimplicative negation does not imply or affirm any other fact following the explicit elimination of its object of negation. For example, when asked, “Are brahmans allowed to drink alcohol?” the response “They do not drink alcohol” is a simple rejection of the drinking of alcohol. The statement does not affirm in any way that they do or do not drink other beverages. Conversely, an implicative negation implies or affirms other facts following the mind’s elimination of its object of negation. For example, when wishing to demonstrate that one of two individuals belongs to the commoner’s caste, if one utters the statement “He is not a brahman,” this does not merely negate the person being a brahman. While a negative statement, it also affirms that the person belongs to a caste other than that of the brahmans — namely, a commoner’s caste.

There are three ways such other facts may be implied [by a negative statement] — through direct implication, indirect implication, and contextual implication. First is like the statement “No-self exists,” whereby the elimination of the object of negation and affirmation of other facts are both effected with a single declaration. The second is like the statement “Stout Dharmadatta does not eat during the day,” where another fact is implied indirectly. These two, respectively, give specific examples of implying another fact directly or indirectly. {124} An example where [a fact] is implied both directly and indirectly is the statement “Dharmadatta, who does not eat during the day, is not skinny.” The third type is like the statement “He is not a brahman” when stated in a context where it has not yet been determined whether the person is of the royal or brahman caste. Here the statement [what caste he is] is not explicitly made.

Some assert that when a negation term is combined with a term that is affirmative, it is not a nonimplicative negation. This is incorrect. Just because the term brahman is affirmative does not preclude the fact that the statement “Brahmans do not drink alcohol” represents a simple elimination of its object of negation. This is analogous to the fact that just because sound itself is an evident fact does not preclude sound’s impermanence being a concealed fact. Some others say that when a negation is paired with the subject of the proposition [e.g., “Brahmans do not drink”], some other fact is implied. This too is incorrect. “Brahman,” for example, is the basis upon which one considers whether some other fact is being implied; it certainly cannot be the other fact that is being implied.

Not originating from itself — namely, from its own essence — how can the effect originate from something other — causes that exist as other through intrinsic characteristics? It cannot.

Within the notion of intrinsic arising, there are only two possibilities: from a cause or from no cause. And within the possibility of arising from a cause, there are only three possibilities — arising from itself, from other, or from the combination of both self and other. Therefore these four positions are exhaustive.

[Question:] On the basis of what reasons can one ascertain that things do not arise from themselves?
[Response:] If things — a sprout, for example, which is the agent in the context of something coming to arise — originate from themselves, nothing additional is gained by coming into being in such a manner. The reality of the sprout, which is its existence, has already been obtained before, at the time of its cause.
Here Sāṃkhyas maintain there is no denying that diverse causes and conditions bring forth a single common effect. For this to be possible, they assert that a single primal substance must pervade them all, a shared single nature of these causes and conditions. Therefore whatever is the nature of the cause — a barley seed, for example — is the same nature as that of the conditions, the water, fertilizer, and so on. Likewise, the nature of the sprout and the nature of its causes and conditions are also the same. This they assert to be the nature of all manifestations of phenomenal reality.[370]
Now since they do accept that the seed and the sprout are distinct, they do not say that the sprout arises from the sprout itself. Nevertheless, when they assert that the sprout arises from its seed and from its own nature, given that according to them the two natures are identical, it must arise from its own nature and an unmanifest sprout must exist at the time of its cause. This is, in fact, how they uphold the notion of self-arising. Although some elements of Sāṃkhya do not speak in terms of “arising” but assert that what was unmanifest [at the time of cause] becomes manifest from the cause, the meaning remains the same.
This is also the manner in which Sāṃkhyas accept the universal and its particulars to be identical in nature, which is utterly different from the Buddhist view that holds, say, functional thing and vase as sharing the same nature. Now if the entire reality or nature {126} of the sprout were to exist at the time of the seed, given that it is impossible for there to be a manifest sprout that is different from the sprout’s reality, then the sprout itself will have to be present at the time of its cause, not just the sprout’s nature or its reality. In that case, having already come into being, it would be pointless for it to arise again.

Furthermore, something that is already born cannot repeat its birth again, arising in a redundant manner having already arisen. The conjunctive “furthermore” indicates that this is a fault that ensues in addition to the point about how arising becomes pointless if something arises from its own nature.
Even if one upholds the thesis of manifest [versus unmanifest effects, we could refute by saying that] if the manifest effect is already present at the time of the cause, this contradicts one’s own premise. And if it is not present, we could refute the thesis by analyzing whether the manifest effect and its nature are identical or different.
Since the mere statement “Self-arising is contrary to reason” is only a proposition, the following is stated to present the reason that refutes self-arising:

Now if you conceive — that is, assert — that what is once arisen, such as a seed, can arise again, repeating its birth, on what grounds will you assert that this repeated arising of the seed will end and the sprout will appear? What condition is there to prevent the seed arising again? There is none. In that case, the growth of sprouts and so on — the stalk, the sprouting blades — will never happen here in this world. Another fault that ensues is that seeds will reproduce themselves perpetually, without interruption, until the end of time; for what has already arisen must arise again [and again].
This objection reveals two flaws — effects within a shared continuum will never arise, and causes within a shared continuum will arise perpetually with no interruption — and states self-arising to be contrary to reason.

Suppose they maintain that the conditions beneficial for the arising of the sprout — water, the spring season, and so on — help transform the seed into something resembling a moist grain and, in this way, produce the sprout. Furthermore, since it is contrary for the sprout to be present at the same time as the seed, the sprout causes the seed to cease and allow itself to come into being. So we are not vulnerable to these two flaws of being contrary to reason. {127} And since the seed and the sprout are not of different nature or reality, it is also not the case that things do not arise from themselves.
This response too is untenable. Given that the two natures — the nature of the seed and that of the sprout — are identical in all possible respects, how can the sprout ever bring about the seed’s cessation? This is not possible, just as the sprout cannot bring about the cessation of the sprout. So Candrakīrti understands.
Even if they foresee these sorts of possible objections, the reason they cannot avert them is this: They rebuff the objection with the thought that since the sprout’s destruction of the seed is on the manifest level, this is not similar to something destroying itself. But to argue in this way is actually quite foolish. For if all the realities and natures are identical to each other, distinct manifestations cannot be established. So the objections cannot be avoided.

There are other flaws as well. For you [Sāṃkhya] then, there cannot exist a sprout distinct from the seed that causes it, in shape such as long and short, color like green, yellow, and so on, taste like sweet, sour, and so on, potency, and ripened effects. This is because you make no distinction at all between the reality or the nature of the seed and that of the sprout.
Given all these undesired consequences, and furthermore, given that we do not perceive them as being not distinct, the realities of these two [a sprout and its seed] cannot be identical in all respects. In this way Candrakīrti throws [to his Sāṃkhya opponent] the reverse of the consequence. There is, however, a great difference between throwing the reverse of the consequence and throwing a reverse of a consequence that contains an autonomous syllogism.[371]
“Potency” here refers to such properties as that of medicine against hemorrhoids, which clears away the ailment the moment it comes into contact with the body, and that of some medicinal essences that permeate the surroundings when hung in the air. “Ripened effects” are the changes effected in results owing to variable conditions. For example, when Indian gooseberry and long pepper trees[372] and their like are nourished with milk, their fruits acquire a sweet taste. {128}

You might assert, “By abandoning the seed stage, it changes into a different state — namely, that of the sprout. The seed and the sprout are merely different stages. The seed itself becomes the sprout.”
[Response:] Now, if it is through shunning its prior stage, the stage of the reality of the seed, it turns into a stage that is another thing, the reality of the sprout, in that case, how then can it be correct to assert that the two are identical, such that the nature of that seed is also the very nature of the sprout? For, according to you, the reality at that stage is the reality of that thing itself, and apart from that reality, there is no other thing that is separate. Therefore the [thesis that] the reality of the seed and the sprout are not distinct at all in any respect is undermined.
If the thought occurs, “Although the shapes and so forth of the seed and sprout are distinct, they are not distinct with respect to their substance, so there is no contradiction [in the thesis of self-arising],” this too would be untenable. For without apprehending the shapes and so on, one cannot apprehend the seed and sprout even in terms of their substance.

There are other faults as well. With regard to the realities of the seed and sprout, if for you the seed is not different from the sprout before us, then just like the seed cannot be perceived at the time of the sprout, likewise what you call the sprout would also be invisible. The term “or” indicates that alternately, being identical in all respects, just like the sprout, the seed too should be perceived by the senses at the time of the sprout. {129} Since this is not so, you who wish to avert these two faults should not uphold this thesis that there is no distinction between the realities of the seed and sprout.
If one understands these forms of reasoning well, all misconceptions — such as the view that while all phenomena are distinct realities with relation to each other, the ultimate natures of all are mutually inclusive of each other and are in fact one, the view that the ultimate nature of a thing’s earlier state is itself the ultimate nature of its later state, and so on[373] — will be avoided.

Since self-arising is contrary to reason both on the ultimate level and on the level of worldly conventional truth, this postulation that outer and inner things originate from themselves is untenable in reality — ultimate truth — as well as in everyday experience of the world. Because of this, when the noble Nāgārjuna refutes self-arising, he does not qualify it in terms of “ultimately” or “conventionally”; he refutes it in general, using the phrase “not from itself.” So when master Bhāviveka {130} applies the proviso “ultimately” in [his syllogism] “that things do not arise from themselves ultimately because they are existents, like, for example, sentient beings,”[374] we should understand that such a qualification is in fact pointless.

There are other faults as well. If you assert self-arising for effects, the produced (the effect) and that which produces (the cause) as well as the act being done and the agent that does the act will become identical. Since they are not the same, we should reject self-arising. For to assert it would entail many of the unwanted consequences explained at length in this text as well as in Fundamental Wisdom. For example, with respect to the first fault, Fundamental Wisdom states:
That the cause and effect are one,
this can never be tenable,
for if the cause and effect are one,
the produced and the producer would be one.[375]
So if the cause and the effect have identical natures, this is saying, then the father and the son or the eye and its consciousness will also become one.
With respect to the second fault, Fundamental Wisdom says:
If the fuel were identical with the fire,
agent and act would be one.[376]
When refuted thus, the opponent might respond by saying, “If the consequence leveled is ‘Are the father and his son and the agent and the act identical in their natures,’ the answer is ‘Yes, I agree.’ But if the consequence leveled is ‘Are they identical in general?’ the answer then would be ‘No, there is no such entailment.’” Nonetheless, because of the reasoning that forces the consequence that “if two things are identical in nature, as asserted in the manner characterized above, their manifestations would also be identical,” the opponent cannot avoid the above-stated faults. Therefore, because of the pitfalls exposed thus far, those who wish to realize the two truths without distortion must not subscribe to the notion of self-arising, so we are advised. Furthermore, [logically speaking,] existence and nonexistence of self-arising are direct opposites observing the law of the excluded middle. That is to say, when one is eliminated through negative determination, then if its opposite is not affirmed through positive determination, such an opposite has no existence.[377] As such, one must accept the truth that there is no self-arising. {131}

The Buddhist essentialist schools assert the following: “Since arising from self would be pointless, self-arising is untenable; and since that does not exist, arising from a combination of both self and other is also untenable. As for arising from no cause, this is utterly deplorable and deserves to be rejected. However, arising from other cannot be rejected, as done so in the line “How from something other?” (6.8a). And furthermore, because the scriptures state that the four conditions, intrinsically distinct from their effects, are the causes that produce things, one has no choice but to accept arising from other.”

As to what these four conditions are, some schools assert the following. The term causal condition refers to five out of the six causes, excluding active cause, as stated in the line from the Treasury of Abhidharma that “What is called cause refers to the five causes.”[378] The objective condition is as found in the line “Objective conditions include all phenomena”[379] — that is, all phenomena that are objects of six consciousnesses. The antecedent condition is as found in the lines “The minds and derived factors that have arisen, / their final instance, not of the same kind, is the immediately preceding,”[380] meaning all the minds and mental factors that have arisen prior to entering the nirvana without residue. The dominant condition is the active causes, as stated in the line “What is called active cause is the dominant conditions.”[381] So the six causes are, as the Treasury of Abhidharma says:
Active cause and the simultaneous,
the homogeneous and the concomitant,
the pervasive and the ripening cause —
these are the six causes, they assert.[382]

Some schools, based on the statement “That which creates something is its cause,” assert the following. That which abides in the state of its producing seed is its causal condition. And, just as in the example of an old man standing up, the objects that serve like walking canes for the mind and mental factors that are in the process of arising are their objective conditions. The final moment of the cessation of the cause is the antecedent condition of the effect that is arising. For example, the final moment of cessation of the seed is the condition immediately preceding the origination of the sprout.[383]

The Commentary says, “For example, the final moment of cessation of the seed is the antecedent concomitant condition of the sprout.”[384] In Clear Words too, his refutation of intrinsically real antecedent conditions is done in relation to the antecedent concomitant condition of the sprout.[385] Buddhapālita upholds a similar position. So theirs is a tradition in which an antecedent concomitant condition is accepted even for material things.

The dominant condition is that which, when present, the other (the effect) comes into being. Clear Words states that such a condition includes what has arisen before, {132} that which is arising concomitantly, and that which will arise subsequently.[386] The Commentary too describes the latter two the same way.[387] This is identical in meaning to the statement in the Lamp of Wisdom that reads, “The conditions as postulated by the other schools, such as the immediate condition that is in front of us, the existing condition, and the no longer existing condition . . . ,”[388] where the translation of the terms seem in fact better. As for the meaning of this passage [from Bhāviveka’s Lamp of Wisdom, Avalokitavrata’s] explanatory commentary says the following:
The immediate condition that is in front of us, as postulated by Sthavira, refers to the objective condition that has arisen directly before our senses. The existing condition refers to the causal and dominant conditions, while the no longer existing condition refers to the antecedent condition, so they assert.[389]

So were we to examine their characteristics, despite some slight variance in their names, all the conditions can be subsumed into the four conditions. Since Īśvara and so on are not conditions, there is no fifth condition. This must be definitely upheld, for it is as stated in the Treasury of Abhidharma:
Four conditions generate the mind and mental factors,
three produce both meditative attainments,
and the others arise from both [causal and dominant conditions].
Not from Īśvara and so on, for things arise in sequence.[390]
This is how they accept [the notion of the four conditions].

If, in dependence upon a cause that is intrinsically other, something — an intrinsically different effect — can originate, then pitch darkness can originate from burning flames, which are actually what is dispelled and that which dispels. In fact, everything, regardless of whether it is an effect, could arise from everything, whether it is its cause or not. Why? Because all nonproducing things, insofar as being something intrinsically “other” with respect to the effect, are exactly equal to those things that are accepted as the cause of that effect. Thus these two extreme absurd consequences ensue from the opponent’s own accepted reasoning.
Let me explain these two consequences. Just as, according to the opponent, a rice seed that produces the rice sprout is, by virtue of its intrinsic characteristic, “other” than its effect, the rice sprout, in the same way, those things that do not produce rice sprouts — fire, charcoal, barley seeds, and so on — are also, by virtue of their intrinsic characters, “other” than the rice sprout. This is the way in which those who propound other-arising assert their position. Now, if these two cases of being “other” are admitted as equal, then just as from a rice seed — which is “other” — a rice sprout grows, then by extension, a rice sprout should arise from fire, charcoal, and so on as well. Similarly, just as a rice sprout — which is “other” — grows from a rice seed, things like a vase, cloth, and so on too must also come from a rice seed. Like this, parallels are drawn [between the two types of “other”]. This reasoning revealing such an extreme consequence is presented in the following in Fundamental Wisdom:
That cause and effect are different
is [a thesis that is] not tenable . . .
for if cause and effect are different,
cause and non-cause will become equal.[392]
In the case of both of these consequence-revealing arguments, Commentary states that they throw their reversals.[393]

Here, some Tibetans assert that absurd consequences ensue for subscribing to the thesis of arising from other because cause and effect are, in temporal terms, necessarily sequential while otherness requires simultaneity. This is totally incorrect. For in that case, all the faults one has leveled against the opponent to refute arising from other will equally apply to one’s own position. Now if one responds to this by saying, “We have no position,” then one’s effort to seek the reason [to refute arising from other in the first place] becomes pointless.

Now, many Tibetans assert[394] the following. When logicians establish an entailment, for example, between fire and smoke on the basis of a specific instance of a smoke, or between being impermanent and being a product, they do so by establishing invariability across all places and all times. This is done first on the basis of a specific instance, such as in relation to a kitchen [in the case of fire and smoke] or a vase [in the case of being impermanent and being a product], and their aim then is to establish invariability [between the two members of the entailment] by drawing similarity across other times and places. So what Candrakīrti is doing here, these Tibetans assert, is to throw an absurd consequence against them by using the argument that “insofar as being ‘other’ is concerned, all things are equal.” They say that this type of argument topples the opponent’s position with a kind of domino effect.[395]

This too is an expression of someone who has not understood the meaning of the text and has failed to comprehend how logical reasoning works. Now when invariability is established between fire and smoke or being a product and being impermanent in general terms, without specifying a particular smoke or the product in a specific time and place, one can certainly remove the doubt that perhaps there are instances where although fire and being impermanent are negated, the two examples cited as reasoning proofs [smoke and being a product] are not negated. In contrast, there are many instances where the two things can be negated as being cause and effect but may still exist as mere others. So how can these cases be similar? In fact, the very expression “toppling with a domino effect” reveals that theirs is an argument betraying ignorance of the way of reasoning. That this is so I have discussed extensively elsewhere.[396]

In view of the above, how is this [statement of no position] to be understood? Here, Clear Words states:
We accept the establishment of conventional truth in terms of mere conditionedness, not on the basis of adhering to any of the four positions [self-arising, arising from other, from both, and from no cause]. Otherwise there is the consequence that things possess intrinsic nature, which is untenable. If one accepts this mere conditionedness, cause and effect will then be mutually contingent and thus will not exist by virtue of an essence. As a result, one will then not speak of things as being endowed with intrinsic nature.[397]
In this manner, Candrakīrti explains the distinction between the kind of arising he does accept and the kind he does not. Fundamentally, he states that if one accepts arising in terms of the four theses, {135} one then has to speak of things being endowed with intrinsic natures. Therefore, if one accepts arising from other, one subscribes to the notion of intrinsic arising necessarily; and in contrast, if one accepts arising by way of mere dependent origination, one need not accept intrinsic arising.

Therefore other in the context of “arising from other” does not refer to just “otherness”; it is an intrinsically established other. As such, extreme absurd consequences are revealed to those who accept this thesis. Such consequences are not leveled against accepting mere otherness.
This [consequential] argument is similar in logical style to the one found later in the text, where it reads:
Things different from each other through intrinsic characteristics
could not logically be part of a single continuum. (6.61cd)

There, against the assertion that although the earlier and later temporal stages of a thing are distinct, they share the same continuum, the objection is raised that if the two things are distinct by virtue of their intrinsic characteristics, they cannot belong to the same continuum. For if they [the two relata] are other from each other by virtue of their intrinsic characteristics, any contingent relationship between the two would become untenable; yet if they are totally unrelated, then absurd consequences will ensue. That is, when a particular effect arises from its cause, it should do so from all others, even those that are non-causes; and when a particular cause produces its effect, it should produce all others that are not its effects as well.

The reason some people do not understand this type of reasoning, as explained above, is because they fail to clearly differentiate what exactly is to be negated in delineating the object of negation, on the one hand, from what minimal standpoints are to be accepted in the presentation of dependent origination. So when engaged in refuting the object of negation, recall what was said above concerning the criterion of what is to be negated.[398]

One might wonder, “If one accepts the reverse propositions of those two consequential arguments presented above, how would one then interpret the following statements in Clear Words:
The reverse propositions of consequential arguments are relevant only to the opponent, not for us, as we have no thesis.[399]
And:
When the proponent of no intrinsic existence presents a consequential argument to those who propound intrinsic existence, how can it follow that the proponent [himself] has to accept the reverse propositions of these consequences?[400]
Also:
Therefore the statement in a consequential argument merely refutes the opponent’s thesis; there is no [affirmation of] the reverse proposition of such consequences.[401]

This is not a problem. These statements are relevant only in the context of refuting self-arising, not with respect to all consequential arguments presented by the Mādhyamika. These statements apply to the two reductio ad absurdum arguments refuting the thesis of self-arising. {136} The reductio consequences being drawn out in those two arguments are not simply that “arising will become pointless” and that “it will be endless”; the consequences being drawn out are that “re-arising will be pointless” and “there will be an infinite regress of arising.” The reversal of these consequences — that “there is a point in such re-arising” and that “the process of such re-arising is finite” — are positions the Sāṃkhya opponent alone upholds. And because we Mādhyamikas do not have such a thesis [of self-arising], we are not implicated by contradictions ensuing from adhering to such a tenet. This then is the meaning of the first citation [from Clear Words].

Buddhapālita too speaks of “there being no point in arising again,” mentioning the word “again”[402] just as Clear Words uses the word “again.” The present text too reads, “If you conceive that what is once arisen can arise again . . .” (6.9a). So it is existence and re-arising that are incompatible, not existence and arising per se. Similarly, it is existence and finitude of re-arising that are incompatible, not existence and finitude of arising; the latter two are not mutually exclusive.

The meaning of the second citation [from Clear Words] is this: When the Mādhyamika — the proponent of no intrinsic existence — presents the two reductio arguments against the Sāṃkhya, as outlined above, he himself has no wish to subscribe to the reverse propositions of those consequences. It is also not the case that, despite having no intention to subscribe to them, he is somehow compelled to do so against his will. Therefore the citation states that we Mādhyamikas do not subscribe to the reverse propositions of those two reductio arguments.

The meaning of the third citation is as follows. Although the reverse propositions of the two reductio arguments — that there is a point to arising again and that such arising is infinite — do not operate as logical proofs to establish the absence of self-arising, this does not mean they serve no purpose whatsoever. Through demonstrating that arising would be pointless and that there will be an infinite regression to arising — something the Sāṃkhya does not accept — these reductio arguments serve merely to negate self-arising, which the Sāṃkhya does adhere to. In contrast, in the case of the two reductio arguments [in the context of refuting arising from other], we Mādhyamikas do accept the reverse of the two consequential arguments.[403] We should therefore understand that there are two kinds of reverse propositions of consequentialist arguments: ones we accept and ones we do not.

Here the opponent states the following. Cause and effect are other from one another by virtue of their intrinsic characters, {137} but this does not mean that anything can arise from anything, for one can see that cause and effect, in their own ways, have a determinate correlation with one another. This is so because that very thing that is capable of being produced by another thing is called or deemed, therefore, the effect of that [other thing]. The presence of the word “therefore” is at variance with the Commentary.[404] And a specific cause that is capable of producing it [the effect], though it is intrinsically other, is the cause and hence is determined to be the cause. Therefore, so they assert, it is only by means of a special type of otherness that cause and effect are posited, not on the basis of mere otherness in general.

Furthermore, rice sprouts come from rice seeds sharing the same continuum; they cannot come from something like barley seeds, which do not share the same continuum, in the way that barley sprouts grow from barley seeds. Even in cases where they share the same continuum, only from those that are its producer can the effect arise. For example, subsequent instances do not produce preceding instances — it is only the preceding instances within the same continuum that produce subsequent instances. Hence, [the opponent] might assert, not just anything can arise from anything.

To those who speak of the cause and effect as existing by virtue of their own essences, we ask the following: “What accounts for the determinate correlation between a rice seed and a rice sprout?” If the opponent answers, “We can see such a determinate correlation,” we might then ask, “Why is it that you see such fixed correlation?” When probed in this way, the opponent is reduced to simply stating, “Because such a determinate correlation can be observed, we see such a determinate correlation.” In doing so, the opponent in fact presents no reason for the existence of such a determinate unique causal connection. Therefore he cannot avoid all the objections outlined above, not in the slightest. Thus Candrakīrti argues.[405]
The meaning of the [above paragraph] is this: The opponent has failed to demonstrate any reason why there is no contradiction in asserting a determinate correlation between [cause and effect] even though the two are distinct by virtue of intrinsic characteristics. So his rebuttal does not remove the fault.
Furthermore, to underline the fact that this otherness through intrinsic characteristics would equally apply to everything — whether or not they are related to each other as cause and effect — and that the opponent’s heralded claim would in fact undermine his own standpoint, the text says the following:

For example, in the case of examples of already existing Maitreya and Upagupta, it is only on the basis of their contrast with each other that we perceive one to be different from the other. In contrast, a sprout does not exist at the same time as the seed, for without the transformation of the seed’s form, there is no sprout at all. There is, in the seed, no otherness from the sprout that exists by virtue of its own essence, and without its correlate, how can the seed be truly “other” from the sprout? It cannot. Since there is no intrinsically real otherness, it is not established that the sprout arises through its own essence from the seed. So you, the opponent, should discard the view that things arise from other.
This demonstrates that, if the seed’s separateness from the sprout were to exist by virtue of its intrinsic nature, given that what possesses intrinsic existence can never cease to exist, then even at the time of the seed it would exist as a substance separate from the sprout. {139} And in that case [given that the seed’s existence as a separate substance presupposes the existence of its point of contrast — namely, the sprout], then the two would become temporally simultaneous. Since this cannot be so, this demonstrates that these two things have no intrinsically existing otherness. This argument does not reject the view that cause and effect are different entities on the conventional level. It is critical to understand that this argument touches upon the object of negation [i.e., the purported intrinsic otherness of cause and effect].

[Opponent:] You may say that our statement that the sprout does not exist simultaneously to the seed is incorrect. For example, like the up and down of two sides of a scale, which cannot but be seen to take place at the same time, the twin acts of arising and ceasing of, respectively, the producer — the seed — and the produced — the sprout — occur together in temporal terms. Therefore the seed and sprout too can be said to be simultaneous.
[Response:] It is inappropriate to employ the analogy of a scale to conceive the simultaneity of the ceasing of the seed and the arising of the sprout. For even if the ascending and descending movements of the two sides of the scale are simultaneous, there is no simultaneity here between the seed and sprout, the referents of that analogy. So the analogy does not hold. The following is stated to show how this analogy does not hold:

For as you contend, that which is called arising, because it is about to arise and exists as a future sprout, does not yet exist in the present. {140} While that which is ceasing, though existent, is about to disintegrate, so it does exist in the present. If this is so in that, at the moment when the sprout is about to arise, the seed is present but the sprout is future, how can such a case — the temporal status of the seed and sprout — be likened to the ascending and descending sides of a scale? They cannot be. Because when the twin movements of the two sides of a scale are present, the ascending and descending of the scale also exist simultaneously. In contrast, there is no simultaneity between the seed and the sprout.

These passages show that citing the example of the two sides of a scale — one ascending and the other descending — is inappropriate for demonstrating how the seed and sprout are simultaneous because their two acts [ceasing and arising] happen to occur simultaneously.

Now, if the opponent were to think, “Although there is no simultaneity between something like a seed its sprout, there is simultaneity between the acts of these two,” this too is untenable. These opponents did not assert actions to be objectively distinct from the things themselves.[406] Furthermore, the context here is the refutation of the intrinsic existence of the twin acts.
There is another fault as well. The sprout — which in relation to its act of arising is the agent — is of the future in the moment of its arising, so the sprout does not yet exist at that time. Without its existence, however, it makes no sense to speak of an arising, which is the dependent activity, when there is no sprout, the producer. Therefore, since the sprout is not concurrent with the [process of] ceasing, the claim that the two processes are simultaneous is untenable.

[Opponent:] “Does not this passage in the noble Rice Seedling Sutra, ‘The instant the seed ceases, the sprout arises, in the manner of the ascending and descending of sides of a scale,’”[407] present this very analogy of a scale?

[Response:] “It is true that this analogy is cited in that sutra. However, this does not demonstrate arising from other; nor does it illustrate arising by virtue of intrinsic characteristic,”[408] states Candrakīrti. Therefore the arising that is negated in the context of the line “Such arising is . . .”[409] is the arising that exists by virtue of the thing’s own essence. The simple arising of a sprout from its seed is not being negated at all.

The Commentary states that this analogy is employed to thoroughly illustrate the illusion-like mutually dependent originations, which come about simultaneously and are established within an unanalyzed perspective.[410] The phrase “dependent originations, which come about simultaneously” {141} needs to be related to the simultaneous presence of the two processes. Furthermore, in that sutra the analogy of the ascending and descending sides of a scale is supposed to illustrate [two things] that are simultaneous, but this cannot be related to the simultaneity of seed and sprout. Therefore, the rejection of the simultaneity of two acts here is that of two acts said to exist by virtue of their intrinsic nature; temporal coexistence of two acts in general is not being rejected. For, as long as one accepts arising, the cessation of the cause and the approach of the effect to the point of arising would have to be taken to be simultaneous.

Thus there is nothing wrong with accepting arising per se and arising on the conventional level. The contradiction only comes into play for ultimate arising or arising by virtue of intrinsic characteristics. In the first case [on the conventional level], even if the processes of cause and effect, ceasing and arising, are simultaneous, the cause and its effect themselves need not coexist in time. In the latter case [on the ultimate level], however, if the processes are simultaneous, the cause and effect themselves must necessarily coexist in time as well.
Here is the point. When it comes to the activity of an effect’s arising, it is in relation to an agent, such as the sprout, that one can say such things as “This arises.” So there is a mutual relationship of the “support” (agent) and the “supported” (its activity). Now if the two, the support and the supported, were to possess ultimate existence, then it would be illogical for the two to change their natures into something else. This would mean that the activity [of arising] would exist at all times as the supported, with the consequence that even when the sprout and the like are in the arising phase, the sprout must exist as the support for the arising process. Since such a standpoint is vulnerable to objections, such as that cause and effect would be simultaneous, it is untenable. In the conventional sense of arising, however, even if [two things] are once the support and the supported, they need not remain so at all times. So the situation differs between these two cases.

[To summarize,] the act of a sprout’s arising — which temporarily coexists with seed — is the process of the sprout approaching the moment of arising. Such a process and the sprout are the supported and the support, yet at the time of this process, although the sprout does not exist, its process can exist, and there is no contradiction in maintaining this. This is analogous to the following example. Generally speaking, if a thing that is in relation does not exist, the other relatum will also not exist. Furthermore, the seed is the thing that is in relation, while the sprout is the other relatum. Nevertheless, one can say, without contradiction, that at the time of sprout, the seed is no more but the sprout is present.
If one understands how to posit the flawless Madhyamaka standpoint on the basis of understanding well how to refute the opponent through these types of reasoning and how our arguments do not revert to our own side, one is then a true Mādhyamika. If, in contrast, we encounter those who utter all sorts of fallacious arguments when engaged in refutation but, when these arguments are upended, seek haven in duplicitous bluster, we should relate to them as Candrakīrti says in his Clear Words, “I will not debate with those who blatantly deny what is obvious.”[411] {142}

The opponent here asserts the following. Now arising from other may be untenable for seed and sprout, which have no intrinsic otherness owing to their lack of temporal simultaneity. However, arising from other could exist when causes and effects are simultaneous, since they possess real otherness. Take, for example, eye consciousness and its concurrent factors of feeling and so on. Just as eye consciousness arises through the mere coming together of the eyes, form, and so on, as well as feelings and so on, in the same manner, the eyes and so on as well as the minds that are concomitant serve as conditions of feelings and so on. So some opponents might assert.
[Response:] Say that, if, for visual cognition, eye consciousness, what exists at the same time as itself — such as eyes and so forth, as well as other concomitant factors like discrimination and so on — are conceived to be its producing conditions. In that case, even if one were to allow that such an eye consciousness were to be distinct from discrimination and so on, still, since something that already exists at the time of its cause will come into being again, what need is there for it [visual cognition] to arise? None whatsoever. Wishing to avoid the fault of nonarising, you, the opponent, may say the effect does not yet exist at the time of the cause. In that case, the faults of this — how there can be no intrinsic otherness to things that are sequential — we have already shown above.
In sum, this argument demonstrates how with respect to what are asserted to be cause and effect, even if otherness per se exists, intrinsic arising remains impossible. In this way, the argument shows the impossibility of arising from other. The previous argument (6.17–19) demonstrated how, though arising is possible in relation to cause and effect, intrinsic otherness is not possible for them, and how because of this, arising from other is impossible. Therefore the statement “there is arising from other” has long become empty of content, reduced to a mere sound proclaiming such a thing. {143}

If the cause is a producer that produces something other, we will examine by asking, “Is what that cause produces intrinsically existent, nonexistent, both, or something neither existent nor nonexistent?” Now if, for now, the effect is intrinsically existent, what need is there then for it to have a condition as its producer? For if something that has intrinsic existence can come to arise, then what has already arisen will arise again, and this we have already demonstrated to be untenable. For a nonexistent effect, too, what can its producer, the conditions, do? Like the horns of a rabbit, it is nonexistent! As for the combination of both existent and nonexistent, again what use is a producer, the conditions? Such a combination of the two is impossible. Also, with regard to that which is neither existent nor nonexistent, what use does the producer, the conditions, serve? For that which is neither of the two is impossible.[412]

And that things, effects that are other, do come from causes that are intrinsically other than themselves is perceived by people of the world. Furthermore, when presenting logical proofs of the two kinds of facts — those that are evident and those that are not — reason is relevant only in the latter case. Since the first is established by direct valid perception, proof through reasoning is unnecessary. So here in this context of other-arising, what use is any other type of logical reasoning? It is pointless. Thus, as other-arising is established without recourse to any other proof, what need have we of reasoning? None; it is established by direct perception. So the opponent might assert.

Those who do not understand without distortion the meaning of the scriptures, those who are bereft of the means — repeated study of the nature of no-intrinsic existence — that helps one part from the long-acquainted friend, the manifest clinging to the true existence of things stemming from the ripening of the habitual propensities for grasping at true existence imprinted within during the beginningless cycle of existence, such people might appeal to mere worldly convention, the arbitrary terms of the world. Now this objection from arbitrary worldly conventions cannot be averted easily; it requires a lot of explanation about how the conventions of the world came to be. For one, one needs to demonstrate how the perspective of the world can invalidate in the case of certain phenomena, identifying the specific characteristics of such a category of facts, and demonstrate how the worldly perspective cannot invalidate in the case of another category of facts. {145}
To do this, one must first present the differentiation of the two truths. This has five parts: (1) general presentation of the two truths, (2) relating this presentation to the actual context, (3) the nature of each of the two truths, (4) objections to the assertion that worldly perspectives invalidate the refutation [of arising from other], and (5) the contexts and the manner in which worldly perspectives can invalidate.

The buddhas, who realize without distortion the individual natures of the two truths, have shown that all entities — both inner, such as motivational factors like intention and so on, and outer, such as sprouts and so on — bear dual natures. What are these two? It is their nature in terms of conventional truth and their nature in terms of ultimate truth. This indicates that, when differentiated, there are two natures even in the case of a single entity such as a sprout — a conventional one and an ultimate one. It certainly does not indicate that one and the same entity — the single sprout, for example — is one truth or the other depending on whether the point of view is that of ordinary persons or āryas.

This understood, it is furthermore impossible for a phenomenon to have no nature at all. So insofar as something is an established base, it must be either identical in nature or different in nature from other things. Furthermore, it is not inconsistent to accept things to possess a nature yet reject that they possess intrinsic nature. Here, the ultimate nature of entities such as sprouts is the nature of the thing obtained as the object of a specific gnosis by those who possess correct view and directly perceive the perfect truth. Such a truth is not established, however, through its own essence. This then is one of the two natures referred to above. “Specific gnosis” indicates that it is not obtained by just any gnosis of an ārya person; rather it must be a specific or particular type of gnosis. That is to say, it is obtained by the gnosis that realizes the way things really are.
Now, in presenting this as obtained or established by that gnosis, one might wonder whether something established by that [gnosis] must be truly existent. To help avert this, Candrakīrti writes, “It is not established by virtue of its own essence, however.”[413] {146} Given this statement, some assert that if the meditative equipoise of āryas were to realize the ultimate truth, it would become truly existent; hence ultimate truth is not an object of knowledge in the tradition of this master [Candrakīrti]. Such people have not understood at all the significance of this tradition’s statement that just because something is obtained by meditative equipoise does not mean it has true existence. By making such an assertion, they allow the tradition of the learned ones to be defiled.

The conventional nature, which is other than the ultimate, is that nature obtained by ordinary beings, whose eyes of cognition are utterly obscured by the cataracts of ignorance through the force of their false views. This reality, perceived within the field of the vision of the childish [ignorant ones] as possessing existence by virtue of intrinsic characteristics, does not exist in the manner in which it is perceived. This, then, is [the second] one of the dual natures.
One needs to understand the statement that it is āryas who obtain ultimate truth in the sense of their being primary. The statement does not imply that Candrakīrti holds that ordinary beings who have gained the Middle Way view cannot obtain it. Similarly, the statement that it is the ordinary common person who obtains conventional reality should be understood in the sense that perceptions of outer and inner phenomena, which are the instances of conventional reality, occur primarily through the power of ignorance. It is not the case that Candrakīrti says these phenomena cannot be obtained by the valid conventional cognitions of the āryas.

Although individual examples of conventional truth, such as vase and so on, can be obtained even by those who have not found the Middle Way view, to ascertain a particular phenomenon as a conventional truth by means of a valid cognition, one must first gain the Middle Way view. Because if a given phenomenon had been established as a conventional truth, this would mean that it would be established as false; and to establish something explicitly as false, one first has to negate true existence with respect to that phenomenon by means of valid cognition. Therefore, although as suggested by the phrase “through the force of false views,” ordinary common people perceive false realities, this does not imply that they establish these phenomena as false. For example, when the spectators at a magic show see conjured horses and elephants, they do see false things, but they do not necessarily establish these perceptions to be false. Therefore the fact obtained through seeing false reality, which defines something to be a conventional truth, refers to that which is obtained by valid conventional cognition perceiving false and deceptive objects of cognition.

Of these two natures or realities described above, what is seen by perfect vision — the object obtained by rational cognition realizing that perfect truth — is suchness, the ultimate truth. This will be explained below in the section pertaining to the lines “Through the force of an eye disease, one perceives / such false things as floating hairs” (6.29). {147} That object of knowledge — namely, what is seen by false vision and obtained by conventional valid cognition — is taught by the Buddha to be conventional truth. The two domains in relation to which the ultimate and conventional truths are defined have been described as distinct; there are not two different modes of obtaining one and the same thing.

There seem to be a variety of views when it comes to the basis for differentiating the two truths. Here, however, we take as that basis the object of knowledge. The Meeting of Father and Son Sutra says, as cited in Compendium of Training:
Thus the Tathāgata comprehends the two truths, the conventional and the ultimate. What is to be known by conventional and ultimate truth is also exhaustive. Furthermore, because the Blessed One clearly saw them, clearly understood them, and excellently actualized them within emptiness, he is referred to as the Omniscient.[414]
The expression “what is to be known” identifies objects of knowledge to be the basis for differentiating [the two truths], while “is also exhaustive” indicates that the division into the two truths encompasses everything, and so because the Tathāgata comprehends both truths, he is described as the Omniscient. Therefore the exposition of those who propound that the standpoint of Guide to the Bodhisattva Way is that ultimate truth is not an object of knowledge and that it is not realized by any cognition is a distorted one.[415]

The division into two — conventional truth and ultimate truth — constitutes the actual differentiation. On the question of what exactly the meaning [or nature] of such a differentiation is, here too there seem to be many diverse opinions. I will explain this, however, as follows. Both of these two truths possess natures, and it is impossible for two members to be neither identical nor different in nature. Now if things happen to be different in nature from their emptiness of true existence, they will then come to possess true existence. Therefore, just like being a product and being impermanent, the two [the conventional truth, such as a vase, and its ultimate truth, its emptiness of true existence] are identical in nature but have distinct conceptual identities.

The meaning of the first four lines is this: The suchness of the conventional is not of a different nature, because conventional truths are themselves empty of true existence, and furthermore, the emptiness of true existence is itself posited as the basis of the conventional. The last two lines state that such being the case the two observe an invariable relationship whereby one does not come into being without the other. And since theirs is a relationship of identical nature, the two are shown to be like “being produced” and “being impermanent,” which are also identical in nature.
As for the character of the individual members of this division, {148} this is as mentioned above, when the individual truths were defined as what is obtained by the two types of valid cognitions (6.23).

The first two lines here present the division into the two truths. Then, when identifying the individual members of that division, ultimate truth is identified in one line, “The ultimate . . . ,” while conventional truth is identified in another line, “The intellect is . . . conventional.” The assertion that what has been presented as the thesis in the preceding line — that the ultimate is not an object of intellect — is being established by the subsequent line [“the intellect is said to be conventional”] does not appear to be the intent of the text at all. In fact, the identification of the two truths found here in Guide to the Bodhisattva Way appears to be a restatement of the following passage from the Meeting of Father and Son Sutra, as quoted in Śāntideva’s own Compendium of Training:
Of these two, the Tathāgata sees the conventional to be the purview of the world. That which is the ultimate is ineffable: it is not an object of knowledge, it is not an object of detailed knowledge, it is not an object of thorough knowledge, it is not shown. . . .[418]

The meaning of the statement that the ultimate truth is not knowable is that it is not an object of cognition in the manner that I will explain below when interpreting a passage from Entering the Two Truths Sutra.[419] Otherwise, if the ultimate truth is not an object of any cognition at all, this will contradict the statement [found in that same Meeting of Father and Son Sutra] that because the Buddha has directly actualized both conventional truth and ultimate truth — namely, emptiness — he is defined as the Omniscient. I will touch upon this point [about the buddha’s cognition of the two truths] more extensively in a section below as well.[420]

As for the identification of conventional truth [in Guide to the Bodhisattva Way], it is not that intellect alone should be taken as such; the intended referent is the object of the intellect. Just as the sutra states this to be “the purview of the world,” here too it refers to facts obtained from within the sphere of experience or from the purview of the worldly or conventional consciousness, which perceives false realities. This is how one should understand the sense in which the object of the intellect constitutes the conventional truth.
The division of objects of knowledge into two truths underlines the point that all objects of knowledge are exhausted within this twofold division. For a scriptural citation on this point, there is the passage from the Meeting of Father and Son Sutra quoted above, and this is also stated explicitly in the Meditation on the Definite Revelation of Suchness:
There is the conventional and likewise the ultimate;
there is never such a thing as a third truth.[421]

The Commentary too says: {149}
Likewise, whatever other truths there may be, all of these should also be ascertained as encompassed by either of the two truths.[422]
In this way, the Commentary explains how the numerous enumerations bearing the word “truth” found in the Ten Grounds Sutra are encompassed within the two truths. There, the truth to be understood by means of differentiation is identified as referring to the presentations of the aggregates, elements, and sources, so this master [Candrakīrti] too accepts the division of truth into two as exhaustive.

Here is the reasoning: When something is determined to be false and deceptive, then its being nondeceptive and true must necessarily be negated. This is because being deceptive and being nondeceptive are direct opposites, mutually excluding each other. Given this, [the two truths] must pervade the entire class of knowables, and as such they exclude any third possibility that is both or neither. This is as stated, for example, in Light of the Middle Way, where it says:
Those that have the characters of mutually excluding each other are such that, when one is eliminated through negative determination, if its opposite is not affirmed through positive determination, then its opposite has no existence. To conceive of something that is neither of the two is illogical.[423]
Also:
Those two things — of which one does not exist if it is not established through positive determination when its opposite is eliminated through negative determination — mutually exclude each other. Those characterized by such mutual exclusion are pervasive with respect to everything. And that which pervades everything eliminates any other possibilities. Take, for example, the case of an embodied being and a non-embodied being.[424]
This point should be understood in the context of all other examples of direct opposites.

Now if an example of direct opposites that excludes the possibility of a third term cannot be shown, there will then be no facility to engage in refutations based on critical analysis where the possibilities are confined to binary terms, enquiring “whether something does or does not exist,” “whether it is one or many,” and so on. But if there do exist [such examples of direct opposites], then when one of the two terms within that direct opposition is negated, if the other is not established, then the other term has no existence. Therefore, to say that there are no direct opposites according to Prāsaṅgika Madhyamaka suggests a failure to become versed in the ways of refutation and affirmation. Insofar as when one term in a direct opposition is eliminated the other comes to be established, and when one is negated the other is affirmed, there is no difference between Prāsaṅgika and Svātantrika Madhyamaka.[425] {150}

Not only is the class of knowables differentiated into two truths, false vision in the case of subjective mind is also said to be of two kinds — those that are veridical and those that are distorted. They are that of clear senses, untainted by temporary conditions of illusion and cognitions based upon them, and that of impaired senses, subjects tainted by temporary conditions of illusion. Of these, cognitions deriving from tainted senses are held to be distorted compared with those of the unimpaired, cognitions untainted by temporary conditions of illusion. The former [cognitions of clear senses] are accepted to apprehend the objects without distortion. This distinction between the two is drawn not from the Madhyamaka’s own standpoint but from the perspective of the everyday world.
Just as the class of subjective cognition is differentiated in terms of distorted and undistorted, this is true for the class of objects as well. That this is so is stated in the following:

The conditions that impair the senses from within refer to cataracts, having yellowish vision, eating datura fruit, and so on.[426] Datura is a resin plant, and when its fruit is consumed, everything appears golden. The phrase “and so on” includes disease epidemics among other things. The conditions that impair the senses from without are mirrors, cave acoustics, bright colored sand when struck by the spring sun, and so on. In these cases, even though the conditions distorting the senses do not reside within the person, they still become the cause for apprehending mirror images, echoes, and mirages grasped as water. One should also understand this class of external conditions [of illusion] to include the spells and relevant substances prepared by magicians.

This being so, the causes of impairment in the particular context here should not be held to be the impairment caused by the contamination of ignorance, such as of the two forms of grasping at self-existence ingrained in us since beginningless time. Here, as explained above, the causes of impairment are the conditions of illusion that impair our senses temporarily. And the distinction drawn here — how conventional facts apprehended by the unimpaired six consciousnesses are veridical and how those that are contrary are distorted — remains solely within the context of the world’s perspective. The analysis is on the basis of whether something perceived to exist within such a perspective is invalidated by everyday cognitions of the world. From the perspective of the āryas, however, no such distinction between veridical and distorted conventional truths can be made. Just as reflections and the like do not exist in reality as they appear, blue and so on perceived by those who possess ignorance do not exist by virtue of their intrinsic characteristics as they are perceived to. Thus no distinction can be made between these two types of cognitions with respect to whether or not they are mistaken.

[Question:] Now, with respect to such instances — the perception of false objects due to one’s sense organs being impaired by immediate conditions, perception of people and so on in a dream due to impairment of mental consciousness by conditions such as sleep, perception of magical horses and elephants and mirages grasped as water and so on that occur in waking states — it may well be true that even ordinary worldly cognition can realize that such perceptions are distorted. {152} However, what is apprehended falsely by the mind impaired by inferior philosophical tenets cannot be cognized as distorted by ordinary worldly cognition. How then are such things posited as distorted solely from the perspective of the world?

[Reply:] The impairment here in the context of examining whether a perception is impaired is not the impairment from grasping at things distortedly due to our innate ignorance. In any case, the postulations of inferior philosophical tenets refer to notions such as primal substance and so on, which are conceived falsely because one’s mind has been conditioned by philosophical views. True, ordinary worldly cognitions would not realize that such notions are distorted. Nonetheless, if the valid conventional cognitions of those whose minds may have not been directly informed by an understanding of suchness realize they are distorted, this constitutes their being realized as false by worldly cognition.[427] As for other categories, such as the referents conceived by the two types of grasping at self-existence, these belong to the class of what are referred to as “objects apprehended by unimpaired senses.” Such things are thus veridical or true from the perspective of ordinary worldly understanding; nonetheless, they have no existence even on the conventional level.

[Reply:] This is because the positing of conventional truth by valid conventional cognition, if one posits distorted conventional truth, must be done from the perspective of such cognition. However, valid conventional cognition cannot establish the distortion induced by the habitual propensity toward ignorance to be an error.

Tīrthikas are overcome by ignorance’s sleep. Their minds suffer from impairment by inferior philosophical tenets and false logic, and because they wish to engage with suchness, they do not uphold accurate [notions of] arising or disintegration that even the philosophically untrained like the cowherders, [unlearned] women, and so on acknowledge. {153} Instead, out of their desire to surpass ordinary people of the worldly perspective, they are like someone climbing a tree who lets go of the lower branch before grabbing on to the next; they will suffer a great fall into an abyss of inferior philosophical views. Because they are divorced from the perfect vision of the two truths, they will not obtain the resultant liberation. Therefore the “self” postulated by these upholders of extreme views as found in their individual treatises, characterized by three attributes [eternal, unitary, and indivisible], does not exist even on the level of worldly conventional truth. This statement clearly refutes the assertion that, in this tradition [of Candrakīrti], existence on the conventional level is defined purely in terms of an existence from the perspective of a deluded cognition. Similarly, as with all things imagined as real owing to illusion, mirage, mirror images, and the like — as real horses, real elephants, and real faces, for example — this has no existence even according to the world: namely, conventional truth. Therefore, for something to exist on the conventional level, it must be established by valid cognition. Now although such conceived objects [of deluded perceptions] do not exist even on the conventional level, Candrakīrti does not hold the situation to be the same when it comes to their appearing objects.[428]

The perception of the five sense objects of forms, sounds, and so on as existing by virtue of their own characteristics, which we experience right now with our sensory cognitions, is due to the contamination of ignorance. Therefore, insofar as their being deluded with respect to their appearing objects is concerned, the only difference between our everyday perceptions tainted by ignorance, on the one hand, and the delusory perceptions of mirror images, echoes, and so forth on the other is the degree of subtlety. Furthermore, although the intrinsic existence of blue and so on as well as reflections being the real face remain impossible, just as the reflection itself exists, likewise, blue and so on exist, despite their lack of intrinsic existence. Moreover, Candrakīrti accepts reflections to be visible forms just like other external objects. Later in the text, in fact, he speaks of how mirror images produce sensory perceptions. This mode of understanding should be extended also to the example of magical illusions, in which the eyes perceive horses and elephants, as well as to echoes and so on. And this presentation is unique to the excellent system [of Candrakīrti].[429]

Given that the truth of suchness is not established by conventional cognition, arising from other cannot be refuted if one remains only within the ordinary worldly perspective. It is negated on the ultimate level by accepting the vision of the āryas. Hence the refutation of arising from other takes place with the proviso “ultimately.” In view of this, just as what is perceived by an eye afflicted by disease, such as the vision of floating hairs and so on, cannot invalidate the perception of those free of such defect and thus do not experience such false vision, likewise the mind of ordinary persons tainted by ignorance and deprived of or divorced from the stainless or uncontaminated wisdom cannot invalidate a pure mind that is untainted, not polluted by ignorance. Hence, this negation of arising from other on the ultimate level cannot be invalidated [by a worldly cognition], even if one were to allow other-arising to exist, for the sake of argument, from the perspective of worldly cognition. Therefore the opponent is justifiably a source of amusement for the learned sublime ones.

Because it obscures sentient beings from viewing the true nature — the way things really are — it is called delusion. This ignorance that reifies the reality of things, attributing intrinsic existence to them when there is no such intrinsic existence, and that has the characteristic of obscuring vision of the true mode of being is a concealer. This line identifies what is the concealer (saṃvṛti) {155} in relation to the word truth in the context of the term conventional truth (saṃvṛtisat), where one is speaking of the concealer from the perspective of which [things are conceived to be true]. This line does not define what conventional [truth] is in general.

This identification [of what “conventional” means] parallels the following stanza from the Descent into Laṅkā Sutra, where cognition that mistakes what is essentially devoid of ultimate intrinsic existence as possessing such existence is stated to be the “concealer”:
The arising of things is on the conventional (saṃvṛti);
on the ultimate there is no intrinsic nature.
That which is mistaken toward no intrinsic nature
is held to be a concealer (saṃvṛti) of the perfect truth.[430]

The Sanskrit term for “conventional,” saṃvṛti, can also connote something that conceals, so saṃvṛti is referred to here as a “concealer.” What does it conceal? As the phrase “concealer of the perfect truth” suggests, it conceals the meaning of the perfect truth; so it is asserted to be “conventional” (saṃvṛti) or a “concealer.” This phrase “concealer of the perfect truth” is not referring to veridical conventional truth within the distinction of veridical and distorted conventional truths. Thus the saṃvṛti in the first line and the saṃvṛti in the last two lines [of the sutra quote] should not be understood to have the same meaning. The first refers to “conventional” in the sense of a framework within which one accepts that things possess [attributes like] arising and so on. The latter usage [of saṃvṛti] is in the sense of a “concealer” that grasps at true existence, which is the perspective that holds all things to be true.

Through the force of that “concealer” grasping at true existence, phenomena such as blue and so on, which are in fact contrived and fabricated, appear to sentient beings as possessing intrinsic existence despite being devoid of such status. These phenomena that are contrived by it and appear to be real — since they are true [only] from the perspective of distorted conventions of the world — the Buddha spoke of as true for a concealer. How it was taught is as found thus in the sutra cited above.[431] Those entities fabricated by conceptualization, which remain untrue from the perspectives of any of the three individuals [śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha arhats and bodhisattvas who have attained the purified grounds] because they remain untrue from their perspectives, are referred to as “merely conventional.” The following passage, which I will explain, appears here in the Commentary:
A few examples of dependent origination, such as reflections in a mirror, echoes, and so on, do appear as false to those ridden with ignorance; yet some examples, such as the blue color of material forms, the mind, feelings, and so on, appear to them as real. The true nature that is the mode of being of all phenomena never appears to those ridden with ignorance. Therefore such intrinsic nature and those things that are false even on the conventional level are not conventional truths.[432]

The phrase “a few examples” is translated as “some” in Naktso’s version, which reads better. “Reflections in a mirror, echoes, and so on do appear as false” refers to these perceptions being erroneous. This is a falsehood in the sense of something appearing as a face but at the same time being devoid of being such. So emptiness of true existence in that context refers to its lack of being the real face it appears to be; {156} it does not mean the reflection’s emptiness of true existence in the sense of its lack of existing by way of intrinsic characteristics. Therefore, even when the reflection is established as the absence of being the real face, there is no contradiction at all in deeming it to be real from the perspective of the “concealer,” the mind that grasps it to exist through its intrinsic characteristic. So a mirror reflection is indeed a conventional reality.

The statement here [in the Commentary cited above] that mirror reflections are not conventional truths should be understood as follows. From the perspective of the worldly conventions of those versed in language, something like a mirror image is false in that it is not a real face, and in that sense it is not a conventional truth. It cannot be the case that a mirror image is not accepted to be a conventional truth as defined in the line “and what is seen by false vision is conventional truth, it is taught” (6.23d).
If, in contrast, it were contradictory for something to be a conventional truth because it lacks true existence on the conventional level, this would violate many presentations: such as the statement that there is no existence by virtue of intrinsic characteristics even on the conventional level, or that negating true existence and establishing the absence of true existence are all undertaken on the conventional level, and so on. Therefore the assertion that such things as mirror images, recognized as erroneous even by ordinary everyday cognition, are not conventional truths but are “mere conventionalities” reflects an apparent failure to properly understand the following points: the exhaustive nature of the twofold division of truth, and the distinction between the differentiation of truth and falsity from the perspective of the world and the Madhyamaka’s differentiation of truth and falsity.

The statement “The true nature that is the mode of being of all phenomena never appears to those ridden with ignorance” also needs to be understood in terms of cognitions tainted by ignorance. For it is maintained that āryas who have not yet fully abandoned ignorance do realize suchness through direct perception. Now, although post-equipoise states of the gnosis of āryas on the learner’s stages and the views of ordinary beings realizing suchness, since they are tainted by ignorance and its habitual propensities, do not perceive ultimate truth directly, it is not the case that they do not perceive it at all.

Understood thus, Candrakīrti’s statement “Therefore conventional truth is defined on the basis of afflicted ignorance, which is one of the factors connected with cyclic existence”[433] indicates that the ignorance that grasps at phenomena as truly existent — known as grasping at the self-existence of persons and of phenomena — is understood to be the link of ignorance within the twelve links of dependent origination. It is thus not held to be an obscuration to knowledge. The statement that conventional truth is defined on the basis of such ignorance grasping at true existence indicates how such conventional facts are characterized as true from the point of view of a specific perspective. {157} It does not suggest that conventional realities like vases, bolts of cloth, and so on are established by this ignorance grasping at true existence. Because what is posited by such grasping at true existence is something that Candrakīrti does not accept even on the conventional level. Since the “conventional” in “conventional truth” — which refers to the perspective from which things are posited as being true — and the “conventional” in the conception of a vase and so on as “conventionally existent” are the same term, it appears there have been many who conflated these two senses of the term. It is therefore critical that we differentiate these different senses correctly.

[Question:] Are these phenomena like vases and so on true from the perspective of the conventions of all beings who are not fully enlightened, or are there some individuals from the perspective of whose conventions these are not true?
[Reply:] Phenomena like forms, sounds, and so on, which are defined as conventional truths, says Candrakīrti:
These, in fact, possess the nature of being contrived for śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas who have abandoned the affliction of ignorance and perceive the conditioned world to be like mirror images. These phenomena are not true for them because these beings have no pretensions of them being true.[434]
As to the meaning of this statement, there are three kinds of persons for whom such phenomena are not true — śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas.

<d e="2">
Here too, it is not just any śrāvaka or any pratyekabuddha or bodhisattva; it is those with specific characteristics. One such feature is the direct realization that all conditioned things are just like reflections in that although devoid of intrinsic existence, they appear as such. To exclude bodhisattvas below the seventh ground and śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas on the learner’s stage, who also have this realization, the three individuals are also described [in the Commentary] as having “eliminated the affliction of ignorance.” Thus we must understand these persons to include bodhisattvas on the purified grounds and śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha arhats. It is from the perspectives of these three that phenomena remain untrue.

That which is untrue includes, as the phrase “these, in fact”[435] suggests, outer and inner phenomena. The reason they are untrue [for these beings] is because these beings have no inclination for apprehending true existence given that ignorance grasping at true existence has ceased for them. Therefore these [passages from the Commentary] establish how the outer and inner phenomena remain untrue from the perspective of the convention (saṃvṛti) of these three kinds of persons. So since the Commentary in no way establishes these phenomena to be not conventional truths [for these beings] other than demonstrating them to be untrue [for them], those who read these passages as demonstrating these phenomena are not conventional truths [for the three persons] expose a great crudeness in their intellectual engagement. This is therefore an inferior standpoint whereby the intention of the master Candrakīrti is soiled by the stains of their own [feeble] intellect.

It is not that these phenomena are being demonstrated as untrue to the three kinds of persons for their benefit; it is for people like ourselves that these phenomena are demonstrated to be untrue from the perspectives of those three kinds of person. {158} As for beings who are other than the three classes and below them, they all possess innate grasping at true existence, and so nothing can be demonstrated to be devoid of true existence from the perspectives of any of their conventions (saṃvṛti).

Now if the meaning is not as explained above, and that it is the case that these phenomena are being shown to not be conventional truths for these individuals, then the rationale presented would become totally irrelevant.[436] For to establish via an instance of cognition that a particular thing is a conventional truth, that thing needs to be established as false, and so to cite the absence of clinging to true existence as the reason in that case would be laughable. The reason why a fact needs to be established as false to be established as a conventional truth by an instance of cognition is this: When the meaning of truth is understood in the context of the conventional truth of, for example, vases and so on, we need to bear in mind two senses of the term truth — one from the perspective of the subject (for the cognition) and the other in the objective sense. When one sees that their truth is not posited in the objective sense but posited as true merely from the perspective of grasping at true existence, a concealer (saṃvṛti), one comes to recognize that without such qualification, such phenomena do not possess true existence and are instead seen to be false. This is the critical point to understand.

I feel it is crucial to recognize that this tradition has an identification of the afflictions that is distinct from the Upper and Lower Abhidharma systems. In general, grasping at the true existence of things is twofold — grasping at the true existence of persons and grasping at the true existence of phenomena. It was already mentioned above that Candrakīrti also considers these two to be the two types of grasping at self-existence. Candrakīrti describes such grasping at true existence as afflicted ignorance both in his commentary on Entering the Middle Way and in his commentary on Four Hundred Stanzas.[437] He states furthermore that such ignorance has been eliminated by śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha arhats, and in his Commentary on the Four Hundred Stanzas, he states that bodhisattvas that have obtained forbearance toward the unborn nature have also eliminated such ignorance.[438] Therefore this afflicted ignorance is the force opposing the knowledge of suchness — namely, no-self. The opposite of such knowledge, in turn, should not be understood as a mere absence of knowledge or some such. It should be understood as a direct opposite, for it reifies the person and phenomena as intrinsically existent. Understood thus, the reification of self-existence of phenomena is considered afflicted ignorance, and the twin grasping at the intrinsic existence of “I” and “mine” constitute the identity view. So in this respect [on how identity view is defined], this Candrakīrti tradition diverges from that of the Abhidharma.

The Abhidharma tradition, as found in the ninth chapter of Vasubandhu’s Treasury of Abhidharma autocommentary, on the other hand, identifies grasping at persons as self-sufficient, substantial realities as the identity view that grasps at “I,” and the identity view that grasps at “mine” {159} it identifies to be viewing things conceived as “mine” belonging to such a person. So the way identity view is defined is very different. Now although the grasping at persons as self-sufficient, substantial realities is found in those whose minds are not tempered by philosophical thinking, grasping at persons as entities separate from the aggregates with distinct characteristics does not exist in those whose minds are not conditioned by philosophy. So even with respect to views grasping at extremes, there are two types.[439]

[Reply:] Now insofar as intrinsic existence of persons and phenomena is concerned, this will be negated by those reasonings that refute it; and when this happens, apprehending things in such terms as true existence will come to be established as erroneous with respect to its apprehended object. When this is established, then grasping at the true existence of persons and phenomena will come to be confirmed as constituting the twofold grasping at self-existence. Once these facts are confirmed, then grasping at true existence will come to be affirmed as the force directly opposing the knowledge of suchness, and as such, it will be understood to be a form of ignorance. Since it can be shown that as long as such ignorance [grasping intrinsic existence] does not cease, identity view too will not come to an end, this leads to the conclusion that such ignorance is indeed an afflicted ignorance. Thus it is critical to understand how to define [Candrakīrti’s] unique presentation of the afflictions.
The way other afflictions such as attachment operate on the basis of the delusion grasping at true existence is explained in Four Hundred Stanzas and its commentary as follows:
Just like body faculty in the entire body,
delusion resides in all [afflictions].[440]
Candrakīrti’s commentary on these lines says:

“Delusion” refers to ignorance, for it apprehends things as real; as such, it operates by way of exaggeration superimposing truly existent natures upon things. Attachment and so on also operate by thoroughly attributing qualities of attractiveness or unattractiveness upon the nature of things imputed by delusion, and as such, they do not operate independently of delusion. Furthermore, they are contingent on delusion in that delusion is the primary factor.[441]
Up to the end of the first sentence shows that delusion here refers to grasping at true existence.

The statement that attachment and so on do not operate independently of delusion indicates that they function in association with delusion, not divorced of it. The reason for this is presented in the passage that reads “Attachment and so on” up to “imputed by delusion.” Since attractive and unattractive qualities are superimposed {160} by incorrect mentation, which is in fact a cause of attachment and aversion, the passage here does not identify the mode of apprehension of attachment and aversion themselves. Therefore the phrase “upon the nature of things imputed by delusion” is to be understood to mean that attachment and aversion operate on the basis of superimposing intrinsically existing qualities of attractiveness and unattractiveness. The passage is not saying that it is only the true existence superimposed by delusion that constitutes the focal object of attachment and so on — that is, in the differentiation between the focus and aspect [of these emotions]. This is because, between the two facets of the object of the two innate self-graspings — their focal object and their object in terms of apprehending aspect — their focal objects do exist as established bases. And since afflictions such as attachment are concomitant with delusion, their focal object is the same as that of the delusion. This means attachment and aversion are defined by their aspects of attraction toward an object and repulsion from an object induced by the two types of incorrect mentation. So states of mind with aspects of wanting or not wanting induced by grasping at persons as self-sufficient, substantial realities alone is not defined here as attachment and aversion. Therefore the way in which attachment and aversion are defined is also quite different here.

“Furthermore, they are contingent on delusion” means that it is through the initial delusion of grasping at things as existing by way of their characteristics that attachment and aversion are brought forth. The analogy of body faculty and its connection to the body illustrates that, just as there is no support for the other four sense faculties that is discrete from the body, similarly all the afflictions operate with delusion as their support and not divorced from delusion. Because of this, all the afflictions will become undone if delusion is destroyed. Thus, Āryadeva says, we should revere the discourse on dependent origination in terms of the emptiness of intrinsic existence, which is its antidote.[442]

This grasping at true existence of things is described in Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness as the ignorance that is the root of cyclic existence; and Sixty Verses of Reasoning also says:
Having found a locus, one is caught
by the twisting snake of the afflictions.
Those whose minds have no locus
will not be snared [by such a snake].[443]
Thus it says that if one finds any locus as the focus of objectification for grasping at true existence, one will then be snared by the snake of the afflictions.

Immediately after this stanza, it says:
In those whose minds have a locus,
why would the grave poison of afflictions not arise?[444]
This then is the excellent standpoint of the noble Nāgārjuna.
In a comment linking these last two lines [to the preceding ones], one reads in Candrakīrti’s commentary [on Sixty Stanzas] the following: {161}
To demonstrate that it is impossible for those who objectify forms and so on to relinquish the afflictions, though they might aspire to, Nāgārjuna states the following. . . .”[445]

And in subsequent comments too it says:
Now if one objectifies things as real entities, then myriad afflictions like attachment will emerge inexorably. Why? Because in the event something appeals to one’s mind, it would be difficult to avert attachment toward it. In the event one’s mind finds it unappealing, however, it would then be difficult to avert aversion and hostility toward it.[446]
Even if the object happens to be something that is neither appealing nor unappealing, the commentary states, ignorance will still arise in relation to it.[447] Therefore, while the apprehension of things as existing by way of their own characteristics remains present within in one’s mind, it is maintained that either attachment or aversion will arise; and even if these two are absent, instances of delusion will continue to arise.

The Guide to the Bodhisattva Way too says:

just as in the meditative attainment of nondiscrimination.[448]
In this regard, there is no difference between these two masters [Candrakīrti and Śāntideva] and Buddhapālita when it comes to the interpretation of the intention of the noble Nāgārjuna.

An implication of this important point is this: The presentation that one could attain nirvana through only the path of the sixteen characteristics [of the four noble truths] such as impermanence becomes provisional, and the identification of the afflictions based on such a presentation of the path remains incomplete as well. One can, from this discussion, also understand other afflictions such as conceit. With respect to ignorance, identity view, and the view grasping at extremes as defined in this unique way too, one should understand that each consists of two levels: the acquired and the innate. Fearing excessive length here, I will not spell out these issues in greater detail.

Similarly, there is the presentation where the conceptualization of grasping at things as true existence is characterized as what is to be relinquished on the path of meditation, differentiating it into nine levels of small, medium, and great, and correlating these to their corresponding antidotes — namely, the nine stages of the path of meditation. This too should be understood as being provisional, a teaching presented for the benefit of those who, for the time being, are not capable of fully realizing both the coarse and subtle levels of selflessness of phenomena. This is analogous to the [Yogācāra] teaching where the conceptualization grasping at subject-object duality is differentiated into nine levels in terms of lesser, medium, and greater degrees, each correlated with its relevant antidotes vis-à-vis the nine stages of the path of meditation, which too remains provisional.

Entities, though not possessing intrinsic existence, appear to childish ordinary beings to do so, and through this they deceive such beings. {162} In contrast, for the three classes of persons referred to above, who are different from these ordinary childish beings, things remain contrived entities that are dependently originated; for them they exist as mere conventionalities, not truly existent. And these [merely conventional] entities appear to the āryas abiding in the stages subsequent to meditative equipoise — stages where one remains within the sphere of perceptual experience tainted by ignorance and its habitual propensities. This is because they possess a form of ignorance that is not afflicted but is characterized as an obscuration to knowledge. In contrast, the entities do not appear at all to āryas who are abiding in meditative equipoise, for they are devoid of [dualistic] perceptions.[449]

“How does one define the obscuration to knowledge according to this Candrakīrti tradition then?” In this regard, the Commentary says:
Now, the habitual propensity toward ignorance constitutes the obstacle to thorough comprehension of the object of knowledge. And that habitual propensities toward attachment, aversion, and so on exist is indicated by their corresponding physical and verbal actions, which are also their causes. These habitual propensities toward ignorance, attachment, and so on cease for the omniscient and the buddhas alone, not for others.[450]

“The physical and verbal actions” here refer to such behaviors as those present even in an arhat, such as jumping about like a monkey or calling someone a “lowly commoner,” physical and verbal deportment proscribed by the Buddha that they still have not curtailed. “Also” indicates that the habitual propensities toward attachment and so on are obstacles to fully comprehending objects of knowledge as well. Thus the habitual propensities of afflictions are obscurations to knowledge, and included within this class of obscurations are all the facets of deluded dualistic perceptions as well, which are the effects of those habitual propensities. Of the two types of habitual propensities toward afflictions — one in the form of a seed of the afflictions and the other not in the form of such a seed — it is the latter that is understood to constitute the obscuration to knowledge. As such [with respect to the three classes of persons cited above], because all the seeds of the afflictions have ceased for them, grasping at true existence no longer arises in them. Nonetheless, since they remain tainted by the habitual propensity toward ignorance, cognitions deluded with respect to their appearing objects still arise in them.

Since āryas who have yet to attain buddhahood have still not eliminated ignorance belonging to the class of obscurations to knowledge, the two states — post-equipoise states characterized by dualistic conceptual thoughts and meditative equipoise devoid of [dualistic] perceptions — will occur intermittently. In contrast, given that the buddhas have thoroughly comprehended or directly realized the aspects of both the ultimate and conventional truths of all phenomena, for them all turnings of conceptualizing mind and mental factors have come to cease permanently.[451] Buddhas, therefore, have no intermittent meditative equipoise and post-equipoise states involving conceptual thoughts characterized by [dualistic] perceptions. The term “permanently” indicates that the ceasing [of dualistic perceptions] for the other āryas during their meditative equipoise is only intermittent. {163} Because of this, meditative equipoise and post-equipoise states occur sequentially for them. The rationale “because they experience ignorance that belongs to the class of obscurations to knowledge”[452] is not a reason to demonstrate that [the āryas] possess [dualistic] perceptions; it is an explanation to substantiate the point that for them the absence and presence of dualistic perceptions alternate in line with periods of equipoise and post-equipoise. The “turnings of mind and mental factors” is to be understood in terms of conceptualizing thoughts.

The Commentary says:
That which is the ultimate for ordinary beings is merely conventional for those āryas who [still] possess the sphere of experience within which dualistic perceptions remain. Emptiness, the nature of these [merely conventional entities], is the ultimate truth for them.[454]
The meaning of the first part is this: Phenomena such as vases, which ordinary beings grasp as possessing ultimate existence, remain merely conventional for the three classes of āryas referred to above, who experience dualistic perceptions in post-equipoise states after arising from meditative equipoise. Thus Candrakīrti’s statement negates such phenomena to be true for these beings. It does not negate these to be conventional truths for them, and it also does not suggest that the conceived objects of ordinary beings who grasp vases and so on as having ultimate existence becomes conventional for the āryas. Such conceived objects have no existence at all.
As for the latter part of the citation, it states that the ultimate nature of things, which is the nature of the dependently originated conventional truths, is the ultimate for the āryas. So to assert that one and the same thing — a vase, for example — is itself a conventional truth for ordinary beings and an ultimate truth for the āryas contravenes the meaning of the text. Such an utterance reveals an ignorance of the fact that to establish something as a conventional truth entails that it is negated [first] as true within the perspective of that cognition.
Next, the Commentary reads,
What is ultimate for the buddhas is true nature alone. Because it never deceives, it is the ultimate truth, and it is known by buddhas alone.[455]
The word “alone” in “it is true nature alone” is a term of exclusion; it excludes in that it demonstrates how [the ultimate of the buddhas] is unlike the shifting characteristics of the other āryas for whom the ultimate truth is posited as absent of dualistic perceptions during meditative equipoise but characterized by dualistic perceptions in post-equipoise. Thus it suggests that what is ultimate for buddhas constitutes {164} the ultimate nature of things, which is the true nature upon which buddhas remain equipoised at all times. The purpose of the statement “Because it never deceives . . .” is to define the meaning of the truth as “that which abides as undeceiving from the perspective of seeing suchness,” so as to demonstrate how such ultimate truth does not constitute true existence.

Now I wish to present ultimate truth. Because ultimate truth cannot be expressed by words, because it is not an object of cognition that follows from the words, it cannot be presented directly. To help elucidate its nature, I will give those who wish to listen an analogy drawn from the ordinary person’s experience.[456]
The meaning of the statement that ultimate truth is not an object of cognition is as indicated by the phrase “it cannot be presented directly.” In Naktso’s translation, this phrase appears as “cannot be shown in a direct demonstration.”

As to the meaning of this point, there is the following from Clear Words, when Candrakīrti comments on Nāgārjuna’s statement that suchness cannot be known from others:
When someone with myodesopsia sees false realities such as floating hairs, even though the person who free of the eye malady may show him [that there are no such floating hairs], the other person remains incapable of perceiving the fact as it is — he is incapable of perceiving the absence of floating hairs in the way in which the person without myodesopsia does.[457]
The person who has no myodesopsia, Candrakīrti says, might point to the one who has it and say, “There are no floating hairs here,” but that does not mean the other person will then perceive the absence of floating hair in the same way as the person without myodesopsia. The point is that the listener does not perceive the absence of floating hairs the way [the one without the eye malady does]. This does not mean, however, that the other person does not understand the absence of floating hair whatsoever. Taking this as an analogy, when suchness is presented, Candrakīrti maintains, although the listener does not realize it in the way those who are free of ignorance’s taint perceive it, this does not mean that, in general, they do not realize suchness at all. Therefore it is not the case at all that ultimate truth {165} cannot be taught in the definitive scriptures about the profound truth, that it cannot be expressed by the speech that reveals it, or that it cannot be realized by cognitions that arise from such statements. This understanding should be applied in all contexts where suchness is characterized as not being the object of cognition and words.

Through the force of the eyes being affected by an eye disease, someone afflicted with such a malady perceives false things as such as floating hairs in a dinner bowl — one made from rhinoceros horn perhaps — held in the hands. The phrase “and so on” indicates things like flies. To remove them, the person may try and shake the bowl again and again. Someone with clear vision, on seeing this, might approach that person who sees hair and so on, who might direct his attention there. But not only will he not perceive hair and such, he will also have no conceptions of any properties predicated on such hair. And when the person with myodesopsia shares his thoughts with the one who is free of disease, saying, “I see floating hairs,” the one free of myodesopsia, wanting to dispel the false thoughts of the one affected by the disease, may for the benefit of the other utter words to negate this, saying, “There are no floating hairs.” Nevertheless, in so saying, such a speaker is by no means denigrating the phenomenon of floating hair. In fact, it is only the one who is free of myodesopsia, not the one with the disease, who sees what is actually so pertaining to the supposed floating hairs seen by the one with myodesopsia. And as with these two examples [of one afflicted by myodesopsia and other not], understand suchness to be like this as well, which is the referent of the analogy.

Understand this as follows.[458] The reality of the aggregates, elements, sense bases and so on perceived by those who do not see suchness and those whose mind is tainted or adversely affected by the eye malady of ignorance is the conventional nature of the aggregates and so on, analogous to the perception of floating hairs by someone with myodesopsia. That very reality of the aggregates and so on that are perceived by those who do not see their suchness is in fact perceived by the buddhas — who are free of the obscuration to knowledge in the form of habitual propensities toward ignorance — in a manner similar to those whose vision is unaffected by eye malady and thus do not perceive floating hairs and so on, and this nature of the aggregates and so on is the ultimate truth for the buddhas.

[Question:] Just as eyes unaffected by myodesopsia do not see even the appearance of floating hairs, if the buddhas do not perceive conventional realities like aggregates and so on — which appear to a mind adversely affected by ignorance {166} — wouldn’t these things then become nonexistent? For if they do exist, the buddhas would necessarily see them. Furthermore, if conventional realities like aggregates and so on do not exist, there will then be no attainment of buddhahood as well, because the being who first generated the awakening mind had to be someone who was affected by ignorance.
[Reply:] Let me explain how this fault does not follow. To begin with, there are two modes by which a buddha’s gnosis perceives objects of knowledge: (1) the way in which all that is knowable within the sphere of ultimate truth is known and (2) the way in which all that is knowable within the sphere of conventional truth is known.

Of these, the first is the knowing of suchness in a manner of not seeing the diverse appearances of the conventional truth. As for the second, since an indirect knowing — knowing but not directly perceiving it — cannot be posited in relation to a buddha, conventional realities must be known by a buddha on the basis of directly perceiving them. So within the perspective of a buddha’s gnosis perceiving things in their diversity, the buddha perceives conventional realities in a manner where the subject and its object do appear as distinct.
Now it is not that a buddha’s knowledge of things in their diversity perceives aggregates and so on because it is affected by habitual propensities of ignorance. Nevertheless, a buddha must perceive the appearances experienced by other beings whose cognitions are tainted by ignorance. There is no denying that such appearances do exist, and if such conventional truths exist, it must be perceived by buddha’s gnosis pertaining to things in their diversity. In the case of the analogy, however, though there is no appearance of floating hairs and such for the visual perception of someone free of myodesopsia, this does not entail that such an appearance does not exist at all. In this respect it is different from the case of the buddha.

Until the habitual propensities toward erroneous dualistic appearances cease, one is not capable of generating direct realization of things in their diversity and the way things really are within a singular instance of knowing. Until then one cognizes the two in alternation, one during meditative equipoise and the other during post-equipoise states. Thus the knowing of the two [things in their diversity and the way things really are] within a single instance of wisdom does not occur. Once all habitual propensities toward error are eliminated, the two aspects of the buddha’s gnosis arise uninterruptedly as a singular instance of knowing within each and every individual moment. As such there is no need for a temporal sequence for the direct realization of the two objects of knowledge.

Therefore the following statement contains no contradiction:
Even with a single instance of knowing,
he pervades the entire field of knowledge.[459]
This feature — that the two dimensions of gnosis, which are identical in nature, have not the slightest contradiction in knowing the two objects simultaneously — appears to be a characteristic unique to the buddhas. There are some who appear to take the mode of knowing ultimate truth alone to be the buddha’s mode of knowing and denigrate the buddha’s knowing of things in their diversity, asserting that such knowing is absent in the buddha’s own mind and exists only within the mental continuum of trainees. {167} Some appear to claim that even the gnosis knowing the way things really are is absent in the buddha’s mind, thus denigrating both aspects of the buddha’s gnosis. I will address some of the remaining related points below in the section on the resultant ground.[460]

[Question:] Isn’t it the case that such nature, which is constituted by the dissolution of all dualistic appearances, is not seeable? So how it is that the buddhas see such ultimate truth?
[Reply:] Since all dualistic appearances have ceased within the perspective of seeing suchness, it is true that suchness is not seen in a dualistic manner. Nonetheless, we do speak of seeing suchness in a manner of nonseeing.[461]
Here is how the statement above suitably responds to the objection raised: it states that the buddha’s gnosis that directly knows the way things really are does see the suchness of aggregates and so on; the fact that the aggregates and so on are not established from the perspective of that seeing is itself the suchness of these phenomena; and that such gnosis therefore sees the suchness of the aggregates and so on in a manner of not seeing.

Thus the Commentary states:
He directly perceives the true nature alone without touching the produced entities themselves. Having fully realized this nature, he is called an awakened one.[462]
Here Candrakīrti is saying that a buddha’s gnosis that knows ultimate truth actualizes the ultimate nature of things alone without touching their bases. This has the same meaning as the statement that the buddha’s gnosis sees the suchness of the aggregates and so on in a manner of not seeing the aggregates and so on themselves. As for the meaning of the citation “No seeing is the sublime seeing,”[463] it is not suggesting that one accepts not seeing anything at all as a form of seeing. Rather, as explained above, not seeing conceptual elaborations is defined as seeing the absence of elaborations. Therefore, seeing and not seeing are not being defined in relation to one single thing.[464]

This said, the Condensed Perfection of Wisdom states:
He sees no form, nor does he see feelings as well;
he sees no discriminations, nor does he see volitions;
he sees no consciousness, nor mind and mentality,
this is seeing reality, so taught the Tathāgata.
People utter words like “I see space.”
“How do they see space?” This we will examine here.
Seeing reality is shown to be likewise by the Tathāgata;
such seeing cannot be conveyed by any other analogy.[465]
Here, what is not seen is stated to be the five aggregates while what is seen is referred to as “reality,” which means suchness. This is similar to the statement “He who sees dependent origination sees reality.”[466]

Space, given here as an analogy, is defined in terms of the mere absence of obstructive property, and so seeing or perceiving it entails not seeing what is to be negated — namely, a space-obstructing property that if it existed would have to be perceivable. {168} Here, what is seen is space while what is not seen is the property of obstructing space. Just as in this analogy, not seeing should be understood in terms of not seeing suchness in a manner similar to seeing a blue color, a manner of seeing negated in the final line of the citation.

To substantiate the assertion that the buddha’s gnosis sees suchness in a manner of not seeing, Candrakīrti cites the Entering the Two Truths Sutra:
O celestial child, if the ultimate truth, on the ultimate level, takes on the nature of being an object of body, speech, and mind, it would then not belong to what is called ultimate truth. It would become a conventional truth only. Instead, O celestial child, on the ultimate level, ultimate truth transcends all conventions. It has no differentiation; it’s unborn, unceasing, free of what is uttered as well as of utterances, and free of what is known and knowing.[467]
The meaning of the first part of the sutra citation is this: If ultimate truth, from the perspective of seeing the ultimate truth, is not seen in a manner of not seeing conventional truths such as the aggregates but instead becomes an object within the field of experience of body, speech, and mind, like the aggregates and so on, then such a seen truth would not be ultimate truth. It would become a conventional truth, a conceptual elaboration. Understood thus, this first part of the sutra citation becomes a reason explaining how a buddha’s gnosis sees the ultimate truth in a manner of not seeing.

The second part of the sutra citation has the meaning that, from the perspective that directly sees ultimate truth, there can be no differentiation — varied instantiations — within ultimate truth. The next three attributes [being unborn, unceasing, and beyond conventions] are easy to comprehend. The phrase about the ultimate truth being, from such a perspective, free of the activity of speech is easily understood as well. Although one can posit the gnosis directly perceiving the ultimate truth as the knower and ultimate truth as the known object, there is no contradiction in maintaining that, from the perspective of such gnosis, there is no such act and its agent. This is because the distinction between the two — an act and its agent — is posited from the standpoint of cognitions related to conventional truth alone. It is like the case where, although one can posit an inferential rational cognition of emptiness as the subject and ultimate truth as its object, the distinction of the two as subject and object is not posited from within the perspective of that rational cognition.

Next, the Commentary goes on to cite:
O celestial child, this ultimate truth, which is endowed with all supreme qualities, transcends being an object [of cognitions] up through a buddha’s omniscient gnosis . . . It does not exist in the manner expressed in the statement “This is ultimate truth.” All phenomena are false in that they are deceptive realities.[468]
The meaning of this citation is as follows. Up to the phrase “up through a buddha’s omniscient gnosis” indicates how ultimate truth transcends being the object of the omniscient gnosis. {169} As to the sense in which ultimate truth transcends [such gnosis], this is indicated by the next part that reads, “It does not exist in the manner expressed . . .” up to the end, where it reads “deceptive realities.” As an example, when someone says, “This is ultimate truth,” the subject and object appear as two distinct entities to the thought that follows after that utterance. For the buddha’s omniscient gnosis perceiving the way things really are, however, ultimate truth lies beyond the sphere of knowing it in such a dualistic manner. All phenomena within dualistic perception are false and deceptive, and as such, they do not exist from the perspective that perceives only the undeceiving truth of suchness.

All of these authoritative sources substantiate the point that, within the perspective of direct seeing of suchness, conventional realities like aggregates and so on are not perceived. For within the perspective of direct seeing of suchness, all dualistic elaborations like “things and nonthings” remain impossible because these conceptual elaborations cannot be found within such a perspective. Thus when contemplating suchness, only āryas are valid with respect to suchness in a manner that is direct; non-āryas are not valid in such direct manner. In view of this, the rejection of arising from other is done from the perspective of āryas; it cannot be invalidated by perspectives stemming from the everyday world.

Now the opponent might wish to raise objections from [the perspective of] the everyday world to the refutation of arising from other on the ultimate level. Had we here admitted that perceptions of the everyday world were authoritative in the sphere of inquiring into the nature of suchness, such objections might be appropriate. For if ordinary perception constitutes valid knowledge with respect to suchness, suchness will then be seen or directly realized by common worldly folk. And given that this situation would have to have been true since beginningless time, one would then have to admit that common people have eliminated ignorance. In that case, what need is there for the āryas then, who are others, for direct realization of suchness? {170} And what need is there then for seeking the ārya paths? There will be no point in doing so. Yet it is wrong to take the foolish mind of ordinary people as valid with respect to suchness as well. Since ordinary perception has no validity in every respect in the context of inquiring into suchness, no worldly perspective can invalidate in the context of suchness.
Some, taking the phrase “Since ordinary perception has no validity in every respect” as a rejection of any notion of valid cognition, criticize this system [of Candrakīrti] as an inferior tradition. Others, citing the same reason, extol it as an excellent system. Both interpretations make assertions without properly understanding the standpoint of this master, thus revealing their own true selves. This is because both parties apparently take the statement that worldly perspectives are never authoritative in every respect when it comes to suchness to mean that valid cognition cannot be accepted in any context. Insofar as valid cognition and its object are concerned, these must be understood [in Candrakīrti’s system] as they are explained in Clear Words, where valid cognitions and their objects are negated as existing by virtue of an essence and are presented instead as mutually defined. I will expound more on this below.[469]

“In that case,” one might ask, “what is the manner in which the worldly perspective might invalidate?” Now, if everyday facts acknowledged and established by the world are rejected from the perspective of worldly consensus, then [the standpoint of] this person will be invalidated on the authority of everyday experience.
Say a person states that “Someone stole a substance of mine!” Another person asks him, “What kind of substance?” to which he replies, “A vase.” Now if, in response, the other person retorts, “A vase is not substance because it is a cognizable object, like the vase in a dream,” it is the content of this kind of refutation that is undermined by the perspectives of the world. In contrast, when it comes to the presentation of suchness, which is done on the basis of taking one who is learned in ultimate truth as authoritative, taking into account the āryas’ perspective on the ultimate truth, in such a context, there can be no invalidation stemming from the perspectives of the everyday world.[470]
The Commentary states that “The learned ones should analyze other [similar] questions on that basis as well.”[471] {171} This demonstrates how refutations like the following, which some today consider exemplars of great Madhyamaka reasoning, are open to invalidation from the perspectives of the world. These include such refutations as “I am not the owner of the vase, and Devadatta is not the one who stole it, because [Devadatta and I lack intrinsic existence].” Similarly, when someone says, “It grew at my farm,” and another asks, “What is grown?” to which he replies, “A sprout.” Say then that the other person counters, “A sprout is devoid of arising because it is a cognizable object” and “just like a dream person or a dream sprout.”[472]

Why is it that, in everyday experience, a man points to another person with male characteristics and claims “I fathered this son?” Though he may claim this, the father has not extracted from his body a person with full male features and somehow implanted him into the womb of the mother. What is it then? He has simply left or placed the mere seed of the son, an impure substance, inside the mother’s womb. So the father, having placed the cause of the son, points to someone to be his son. This clearly proves that within the everyday experience of the world, people do not conceive the seed and the son to be intrinsically different. So, even from the perspective of the everyday world, grasping at the impure seed and the son as well as the barley seed and its sprout as arising from other doesn’t exist. For were these conceived as different by virtue of their own essences, the father would not point to his son and claim “I produced him” any more than a different person would in relation to that son. Similarly, when someone plants the mere seed of a tree and a tree grows from this, {172} he thinks “I planted this tree.” [In relation to this example too], one should reflect, as above, “there is no arising from other within the perspectives of everyday world” and so on.

Although the two seeds planted are not the tree and the son, when a tree or a son is born as a result of having planted either of these two seeds, one can point to one or the other and claim legitimately, “I planted this.” Analogously, although a hand that is injured and healed is not actually the person, one can legitimately say the person has been injured and healed when his hand was injured and healed.
Thus arising from other does not exist within the conventions of the everyday world. But that does not mean that the existence of arising from other can be negated through everyday-world perceptions. This is because one must probe the nature of suchness to negate cause and effect being different entities by virtue of their intrinsic natures. Therefore the sense of arising from other asserted by proponents of other philosophical schools is this: arising from something that is other by virtue of its intrinsic characteristic; it is not something established simply as other. It is also not the case that this sort of mere otherness is not established from the everyday-world perspective.
Now the statement “So other-arising doesn’t exist / even from the perspective of the everyday world” should not be confined to mean solely that ordinary people of the world do not grasp a substantial cause and its effect — a seed and the sprout, for example — to be different by virtue of their intrinsic characteristics. These lines also demonstrate how arising from other does not exist even on the conventional level.

For example, the Commentary says in the section on the refutation of arising from both:
So, just as it has been shown how arising from self and arising from other are untenable on the level of worldly convention as well as on the level of ultimate truth, likewise, to those who speak of arising from both too, the arguments stated above demonstrate it to be impossible.[473]
Thus the nonexistence of arising from other even on the conventional level has been stated explicitly.

In Clear Words too, in response to the question “If there is no arising of things from themselves, from other, from both, and from no cause, how is it that the Buddha taught ‘Conditioned by ignorance, there is volition’?” Candrakīrti writes, “Let me explain this. This is on the conventional level; not on the level of suchness.”[474] Thus he explains how the engendering of volition by ignorance and so on is on the conventional level and not on the ultimate level. Then, in response to the question “What kind of presentation of conventional truth you are speaking of?” Candrakīrti replies, “We accept the establishment of conventional truth in terms of mere conditionedness; not on the basis of adhering to any of the four positions.”[475] Thus he clearly explains how, in accepting the arising of this from that condition on the conventional level, he does not adhere to arising from one of the four possibilities. {173} So the assertion some make that “This tradition [of Candrakīrti] does not reject arising from other on the conventional level” is a statement that does not understand this system properly.

If the sprout were intrinsically other than the seed, the seed and the sprout could not be a cause and its effect. In that event, the seed’s continuum would certainly cease once the sprout exists. The seed and the sprout would be totally unrelated, and so even if the sprout were present, this would not in any way preserve the lineage of the seed. To illustrate, the presence of a cow-like beast in no way ensures the non-cessation of a cow’s lineage after death. Likewise, the presence of ordinary beings in no way ensures āryas do not sever the continuum of their own cyclic existence.[476]

Because there is no contradiction for the seed and the sprout to be cause and effect even when the sprout is not intrinsically other than the seed, there is no extinction of the lineage of the seed at the time of the sprout. In this way, one avoids the extreme of annihilationism. It has on numerous occasions been explained that the seed comes to cease at the time of the sprout, and the meaning of seed’s extinction has been explained in the Commentary as the termination of its continuity.[477] Furthermore, the nondisintegration of the seed is rejected as well. Therefore the phrase “cessation of the seed’s continuum”[478] here has to be understood in terms of the cessation of its lineage.

And because the two, the sprout and the seed, do not exist as identical, and also because the seed did not transpose itself onto the sprout, the non-disintegration of seed at the time of the sprout has been rejected. So it cannot be said that seed exists when the sprout is there; hence the extreme of eternalism is prevented as well. These statements convey the intent of the following lines from the Play in Full Sutra:
If the seed exists, the sprout would be the same.
What is the seed? It is not the sprout;
it is not something other nor is it identical with it;
thus it’s neither eternal nor annihilated. Such is their truth.[479] {174}

The meaning of these lines is as follows. Were the seed to exist, the sprout, which is caused by the seed, would come into being in the same manner as the seed. Now when the sprout comes into being, it cannot do so from something other than the seed, and so one might think that the seed and the sprout are identical in nature. [The sutra states] that although the sprout does not come into being from something different from the seed, it is not that the seed comes to transpose itself onto the sprout. Why? Because the sprout is neither intrinsically other from the seed nor is it intrinsically identical with it in nature. When both of these possibilities are rejected, the true nature of the sprout is revealed to be a reality that is free of the extremes of eternalism and nihilism.

The same sutra states this point in the following:
The volitions are conditioned by ignorance;
such volitions do not exist in ultimate reality.
Both volition and ignorance are empty,
for they lack intrinsically real movement.[480]
The first line presents the logical reason — that volitions originate in dependence upon ignorance. The second line presents the thesis, which is that the volitions do not exist in ultimate reality. The third line presents how both the cause and effect are empty. And the fourth line presents the manner in which they are empty. “Movement” here refers to [volition’s] activity of conditioning, and the lack of this indicates how volition is empty of volition. This too is stated with the proviso “they lack intrinsically real movement,” indicating how what is being negated is qualified. This qualification has the same meaning as the phrase “do not exist in ultimate reality.”

Now, in contrast, if the intrinsic characteristic of a thing such as form or feelings were to arise in dependence upon causes and conditions, through its own essence, this would imply that a yogi directly perceiving the emptiness of intrinsic existence of all phenomena would realize emptiness by denying such a nature of things. Meditative equipoise does not actually perceive form and so on, but if they were to exist through their intrinsic characteristics, then meditative equipoise would necessarily perceive them. It does not. And if this were so, these things would then become nonexistent. If they do become nonexistent, it would then be the case that what was existent prior to the meditative equipoise would subsequently come to be destroyed or ceased. The meditative equipoise would become the cause for their destruction. So just as hammers and the like are causes for the destruction of vases and the like, seeing emptiness too would then be a cause for the destruction of the nature of things, thus denigrating them. But this is illogical, so no real entities exist — that is, say, by virtue of their intrinsic characteristics — and we must never uphold such a notion of intrinsic arising.

Now, those Mādhyamikas who accept arising by virtue of intrinsic characteristics do maintain that even though things exist through their intrinsic characteristics, this does not constitute [an admission of] true existence. They assert that if phenomena such as forms exist through their intrinsic characteristics, this does not necessarily entail that they are perceived within the direct vision of suchness.[484] They may claim such things, but that this degree [of objectivity] does in fact constitute true existence has already been explained above.[485] I will elaborate on this point further below as well. So the opponent cannot avoid the flaws revealed in this argument above.

Here as well in the Commentary, Candrakīrti cites the following passage from the Heap of Jewels Sutra:
Kāśyapa, furthermore, the middle path perfectly discerning reality does not make phenomena to be empty. Phenomena are themselves empty . . .[486]
Candrakīrti cites similar statements in that sutra in relation to signlessness, wishlessness, and the absence of conditioning, as well as to being unborn and unoriginated.[487] {176}
Now, if phenomena were to possess natures that exist through their intrinsic characteristics, then these phenomena would not be empty. And then the sutra’s statement that “phenomena are themselves empty” would become incorrect.[488] Since existence in its own right by virtue of an essence is not then negated, things will have to be shown to be empty of something else. This of course will contradict the sutra’s statement that “emptiness does not cause phenomena to become empty.” All of this shows how the middle path, by examining the individual characteristics of phenomena, reveals how all phenomena are empty of existing in their own right — that is, existing by virtue of their own essence.

This sutra also rejects the assertion of the Cittamātra school that the dependent nature is not empty of existence by virtue of intrinsic characteristic but is empty in the sense of being devoid of a substantial duality of subject and object. It says in Four Hundred Stanzas:
It’s not that what is not empty is seen as empty;
if one harbors the thought “May nirvana be mine,”
one cannot attain nirvana
through such a false view. So taught the Tathāgata.[489]

This then is also the intended meaning of the statement that all phenomena are empty of their own essence. Therefore it is totally incorrect to assert that a vase being empty of true existence but not being empty of itself constitutes extrinsic emptiness and that the vase being empty of the vase itself constitutes intrinsic emptiness.[491] For if the vase were empty of itself, the vase would not exist in a vase. And if something, say a vase, does not exist in itself, since it cannot exist in any other thing either, this implies that the vase does not exist at all. This will be equally true of all other things as well, and so the person uttering such statements would also not exist. This renders the entire discourse about emptiness — something being empty of this but not of that — totally impossible.

Now some people assert this form of emptiness [a thing being empty of itself] to be a perfect view while others hold it to be a nihilistic emptiness. Both of these remain, however, outside the true understanding of dependent origination free from the extremes of eternalism and nihilism, which has been established by the conqueror [Nāgārjuna] and his spiritual heir [Āryadeva], not just once but repeatedly. In particular, those who assert that the entire reality of conventional truths must be established as empty of themselves and assert this form of emptiness to constitute a nihilistic emptiness are utterly incorrect. There is none among the four Buddhist philosophical schools that recognizes a particular view to be nihilistic yet cultivates it within their own mind.[492]

The notion of emptiness generally entails that a given entity, the basis of negation, is demonstrated to not exist in a manner that is being negated or is shown to be empty of what is to be negated. This much is the same for all forms of emptiness. It is, however, the emptiness of phenomena in the sense of being devoid of existing by virtue of intrinsic characteristic that constitutes the true meaning of things being empty of their own essence. {177} All other forms of emptiness do not constitute the emptiness of things’ own essence. Here is the reason. As long as the impact of having established emptiness of the first type [intrinsic emptiness] by means of a valid cognition remains undiminished, there is no possibility at all during such a period for any reification of that basis to arise through grasping at true existence owing to any kind of philosophical reflection. With respect to those other types of emptiness, however, though one may have established them through valid cognition and their impact remains undiminished, there is nothing to preclude, during the same period, reifying things as truly existent or as real due to philosophical speculation.[493]

Here, some assert the following: “It is logical that, since there is no arising on the ultimate level, arising from self and other are negated. Nonetheless, insofar as the natures of form, feeling, and so on perceived by the two kinds of valid cognition are concerned, these will arise without doubt from [something that is] other. For if one does not accept this, how can one speak of the two truths? There will be only one truth. Therefore,” they say, “arising from other does exist.”[494]
Those who argue in the above manner, given that they appear to accept the absence of arising on the ultimate level but assert arising from other on the conventional level, are certain Svātantrika-Mādhyamikas. Their assertion, “If arising from other in terms of intrinsic arising does not exist on the conventional level, there will then be only one truth,” is intended to suggest that if there is no arising by virtue of intrinsic characteristic on the conventional level, conventional truth will have no reality. Since conventional truth would be untenable, there would be only the ultimate truth.

In response, the Commentary says:
You are right. From the point of view of ultimate truth, there are not two truths. For we find statements such as the following: “O monks, this truth, the ultimate, is only one: it is nirvana, a reality that is nondeceptive. All conditioned things are false and deceptive.”[495]
The meaning of these statements is this: Given that “nondeceptiveness” is what is meant by truth, a view Candrakīrti himself upholds, it is true that ultimate truth alone is true in the sense of being nondeceptive. So Candrakīrti responds, “You are right.” The phrase “From the point of view of ultimate truth . . .” indicates that, within the perspective of seeing suchness, there is no duality of conventional and ultimate truth. {178} Within such a perspective, the Buddha has spoken of only the ultimate truth. The truth that is ultimate is to the ultimate truth. That within such a perspective there exists no conventional truth can be understood by the statement that “conditioned things are false and deceptive.”

To summarize the meaning [of the above Commentary passage]: Were phenomena to exist by virtue of their intrinsic characteristics, conditioned things would not be established as false and deceptive. And without conventional truth, there would be no two truths. In contrast, when there is no existence by virtue of intrinsic characteristic, both conventional truth and ultimate truth become possible.
Based on the sutra citation above that states that nirvana alone is true while other conditioned phenomena are false, the thought might arise that although conditioned phenomena do not exist by virtue of their intrinsic characteristics, nirvana — the ultimate truth — must exist by virtue of its own intrinsic characteristic. But the sutra itself defines the truth being referred to here in terms of nondeceptiveness, not in terms of existing by virtue of intrinsic characteristic. Furthermore, from the statement that “All conditioned things are false and deceptive” too, we can infer that the meaning of truth in the sutra citation is that of nondeceptiveness. In his Commentary on Sixty Stanzas too, Candrakīrti explains how, unlike conditioned phenomena, which deceive childish beings through appearing in false manner, nirvana does not deceive beings by appearing thus. Hence, he explains, nirvana is said to be true while others remain untrue.[496] The distinction between truth and untruth here must therefore be drawn in the sense of being “nondeceptive” and “deceptive.”

Candrakīrti’s Commentary on Sixty Stanzas elsewhere makes a statement to the effect that nirvana is true on the conventional level.[497] There the meaning is that nirvana’s status as an ultimate truth is to be posited from the perspective of conventional truth. It is not that Candrakīrti accepts nirvana to be a conventional truth. Since conventional truth is the means by which one enters ultimate truth, then just as one entertains conventions in the everyday world without probing into whether things arise from self or another, the Mādhyamika accepts [conventional truths] in the same [unanalyzed] manner.

Thus, when such phenomena as form, feelings, and so on are analyzed thoroughly, in terms such as “Does it arise from itself or does it arise from other?” beyond the fact they do not arise or cease on the ultimate level — that is, apart from suchness as their nature — nothing else is found, no other or extra dimension such as arising and so on. So the conventional truth of the everyday world should not be subjected to thorough analysis in terms such as “from itself, from other,” and so on. {179} We should just accept the facts of worldly perception, captured in statements such as “If this exists, that follows.” We should do this on the basis of participating in the conventions that are dependent on others — those of the world.

Here “analysis” and “nonanalysis” refer to analysis or nonanalysis pertaining to suchness. And in this regard, it is critical to understand what mode of analysis constitutes an analysis into suchness, so I will explain this point a little.
In the Prāsaṅgika system, if one is unsatisfied with conventional designations, and in relation to statements such as “the sprout arises,” one analyzes what exactly is the referent of that phrase — does the sprout arise from itself, from another, and so on. From that point on, the analysis becomes an inquiry into suchness. This is entirely different from everyday inquiries based on worldly conventions, such as “Where have you come from?” “Where are you going?” “Where is it, outside or inside?”

Svātantrika Madhyamaka, on the other hand, does not consider the above degree of analysis to constitute probing into suchness. For them, an analysis becomes an inquiry into suchness when someone analyzes whether something exists by virtue of the power of being perceived by a cognition as defined above,[501] or whether it exists objectively as not posited by virtue of being perceived by a cognition. Thus, because of their two different ways of identifying the object of negation, two different boundaries of what constitutes an analysis into suchness emerge for them as well.

Failing to comprehend [what exactly constitutes an analysis into suchness], some define the distinction in the following manner. Say Devadatta has not arrived at a specific place. Initially, one mistakenly thinks that he had arrived but subsequently, when one examines whether he has arrived, comes to realize that he has not. In this way, they characterize all unanalyzed perspectives to be erroneous and all analyzed presentations to be veridical. But such an approach is neither that of the Madhyamaka system nor that of Buddhist epistemological (pramāṇa) schools. For one finds in both of these two traditions numerous facts established by valid cognition within the unanalyzed perspective. I have addressed this question extensively elsewhere, so I will not elaborate further here.[502] In brief, we should understand that if one analyzes the facts of conventional truth through critical reasoning inquiring into suchness, all conventions of the everyday world will come to be undermined. {180}

Why is it that when all [the ropes of] clinging to things as true existence are cut, one clings terrified to conventional truth as real? If you say, “We must ensure that some things do arise with a reality established by intrinsic characteristics or by virtue of substance, for they constitute the causes of bondage and freedom by being part of the afflicted class or the enlightened class,” to this I would say, “Now what remains for you are merely the words.”[503]
Why? In the context of an analysis into suchness or the ultimate truth, certain reasoning presented above disallows the arising of phenomena such as form from self or from something other. Likewise, on the conventional level too, that same reasoning disallows them — the arising of form and so on through intrinsic characteristics. So by what means of valid cognition then is your intrinsic arising established? It is not.

“Therefore,” Candrakīrti states, “arising by virtue of intrinsic characteristic does not exist on either level of truth. You may not like this, but you should undeniably admit it nonetheless.”[504]
As for the arising negated through an analysis into suchness even on the conventional level, the Commentary characterizes this — in his commentary preceding the relevant root text — as an arising possessing a reality borne of substance. The [subsequent] summary statement explains it as well in the same manner. Therefore it refers only to [a form of arising] whereby what is to be negated is qualified in terms such as “arising by virtue of intrinsic characteristic.” It in no way refers to arising per se. For Candrakīrti states on countless occasions that it is inappropriate to apply ultimate analysis to the facts of conventional truth.
Why does Candrakīrti maintain that if the reasoning probing into suchness does not negate arising by virtue of intrinsic characteristic on the conventional level, it would mean that ultimately established arising remains not negated as well? It is because the moment something is characterized as existing by virtue of its intrinsic characteristic, this in itself constitutes true existence. In that case, Candrakīrti maintains, it makes no difference whether one applies the qualifier “on the conventional level.”
Now there are countless instances in the sutras, in the writings of Nāgārjuna father and son, and in those of this master [Candrakīrti] where the object of negation is qualified in terms such as “by virtue of intrinsic characteristic,” “through intrinsic nature,” “by virtue of an essence,” and so on. Furthermore, as we saw above, Candrakīrti even takes some fellow Mādhyamikas to be the object of critique when he is engaged in such negation. {181}

In his Clear Words too, Candrakīrti writes:
Indisputably, it must be accepted exactly in this way. Otherwise conventional truth will come to possess objective evidence, would it not? In that case, it would then become suchness itself, not conventional.[505]
Thus, when refuting the approach whereby, being unsatisfied with mere designations on the conventional level, one posits the facts of conventional truth on the basis of analyzing the referents of their designations, Candrakīrti objects that the facts in that case will become ultimately existent and that form and so on would then not be facts of conventional truth. These consequences are being thrown against someone who rejects the ultimate existence of form and so on and takes them to be conventional. Since this cannot be said of the proponents of real entities, it is very clear that the opponent here is Svātantrika Madhyamaka.
Master Candrakīrti also states in the Commentary that “Some assert that the refutation of arising by the noble Nāgārjuna in the treatise, in lines such as ‘Not from itself, not from other,’ refers to the rejection of arising in relation to the imputed nature whereby subject and object are conceived as being substantially different; it does not refer to the negation of the true existence of dependent nature. Since they cannot establish this [claim] without evidence, those who interpret thus deserve only to be disputed and examined.”[506] Some early Tibetan scholars claim that the opponent here is Sthiramati, but such statements are not readily found in his works. Dharmapāla, in his commentary on Four Hundred Stanzas, reputedly interprets the view of the Four Hundred to be Cittamātra; so it is more appropriate to relate this critique to Dharmapāla.[507]

The question now is: “How do those who interpret the meaning of the profound sutras in Cittamātra terms explain the intent of the treatises of the noble Nāgārjuna?” The works of great ones such as the master Vasubandhu contain no explicit statements about how they would interpret the meaning of Nāgārjuna’s treatises. In works such as Rules of Exposition, basing himself on the Unraveling the Intent Sutra, Vasubandhu appears to characterize the Perfection of Wisdom sutras as provisional. Thus we could assume he would explain [Nāgārjuna’s treatises] similarly. It seems inconceivable that [Vasubandhu] would refute the noble Nāgārjuna’s treatises; but at the same time, if he were to explain them according to their literal meaning, then what reason would he have not to do the same for the Perfection of Wisdom sutras? Now if he were to interpret [Nāgārjuna’s works] in nonliteral, interpretable terms,[508] he would clearly do so from the Cittamātra standpoint.
This said, since those statements that present all phenomena as lacking ultimate existence and as not existing by virtue of their intrinsic characteristics are established to be literally true by means of reasoning, there is no effective objection to their literal meaning. Hence these treatises cannot be explained as provisional, requiring further interpretation. It is with this point in mind that Candrakīrti says, “They deserve only to be disputed and examined.”[509] {182} The point of giving effective objections against a nonliteral reading and presenting countless proofs to support a straightforward reading is to establish that the meaning of Nāgārjuna’s treatises cannot be interpreted in some alternative manner. Candrakīrti addresses this point [about differentiation of definitive and provisional sutras] only briefly here.

[Objection:] If arising by virtue of intrinsic characteristic does not exist on the level of both truths, form and so on would become nonexistent. In that case, the perception of the reality of form and so on by cognitions — by that of the eyes and so on — would be impossible in the world. Otherwise, [nonexisting things like] rabbit’s horns could be perceived by cognitions such as those of the eyes and so on. The reason is exactly the same in both cases.

Here Candrakīrti speaks of the arising of a visual perception on the basis of a mirror image. Now a mirror image is a conditioned thing, and since it is different in nature from cognition, it is an external reality. {183} Furthermore, since it is the objective condition of visual perception, Candrakīrti takes it to be a visible form.

The existence of things by virtue of intrinsic characteristics — which is being perceived by cognitions of any of the five unimpaired senses — is analogous to phenomena such as a face’s reflection, a double moon, floaters, and so on, which appear to distorted sensory perceptions. That existence by virtue of intrinsic characteristic is perceived despite being impossible is analogous to the existence of reflection as a face and so on being impossible and yet still being perceived as such. Form, sound, and so on are analogous to phenomena like mirror images, echoes, and the like. So, just as we would not take the intrinsic existence of the five sensory objects such as form to be external realities yet would posit the form and so on that are perceived as such to be external realities, likewise, although one would not regard the reflection of a face to be an externally real face, one can still characterize phenomena themselves, mirror images and so on, as external realities. So when it comes to characterizing what is and is not an external reality, the situation is equal for both [form and so on, on the one hand, and mirror images and so on, on the other].
The false nature of a reflection — in the sense of it lacking the reality of a face — is something that can be established by all reasonable, literate people of the world whose minds are not informed by scripture or reasoning presenting emptiness. So it is entirely wrong to say that the realization of this level of falsehood represents some kind of a coarse rational cognition [of emptiness].

With a reflection perceived as a face, no differentiation whatsoever can be made on the level of appearance itself, saying, “This part of the reflection appears as the face and that part does not.” It is the entirety of the reflection that appears as the face. So citing this analogy of how, though the entirety of the perception of a face [in a mirror image] does not exist as it appears, there is no contradiction in maintaining that such a reflection arises in dependence upon its causes. In the same way, when a blue [object] appears as existing by virtue of its intrinsic characteristic, no differentiation whatsoever can be made as to which part does and which part does not appear as existing through intrinsic characteristics. Furthermore, what is perceived does not exist as perceived in its entirety. Nonetheless, it can be established that there is no contradiction with the fact that the blue thing is produced from its own causes and that it can produce its own effects. Now if one can maintain the standpoint whereby, while there is nothing in the mirror image that exists as a face as perceived, {184} this does not lead to the mirror image becoming nonexistent, it would then become possible to uphold the standpoint whereby, although nothing within the entire field of perception of a blue object exists by virtue of intrinsic characteristic as it appears to, one can definitely still posit the existence of the blue object. This kind of clear differentiation employing refined intellect as to how, in relation to form and so on, one distinguishes between the two — “This is to be negated” and “This is not to be negated” — on the basis of the analogy of a mirror image, is an indispensable aid to finding the Middle Way view. So we should not be easily contented [with our understanding of the role of such an analogy].

While understanding the fact of causes and effects even in relation to a mirror image that has no intrinsic existence, what learned person would, simply on the basis of perceiving form, feelings, and so on that are not outside the realm of causes and effects, determine these to be endowed with intrinsic nature? Therefore, although learned ones perceive these as existing, they have no intrinsic arising.[510]
Candrakīrti thus draws a distinction here between mere existence and intrinsic existence. Furthermore, Candrakīrti demonstrated above that things do arise, and here he demonstrates that there is no intrinsic arising, so he makes a clear distinction between arising and intrinsic arising. Without such distinctions, then existing things would exist in their own right, and things that do not exist in their own right would then become nonexistent. In this way, one would fail to transcend the two extremes of reification and denigration.

In his Commentary on the Four Hundred Stanzas, for example, Candrakīrti says:
Those who propound the existence of real entities consider things to be existent only so long as they are thought to possess essence. The moment things are understood to lack an essence, they come to be [for them] utterly nonexistent. For them such things then become as nonexistent as the horn of a donkey. They are thus compelled to speak in such dichotomous terms, so it is difficult for them to satisfy all their expectations.[511]
Therefore, being free from all extremes of existence — through understanding that nothing exists by virtue of its own essence — and being free of all the extremes of nonexistence in that one can posit everything from cause and effect to the very facts of the world as possessing no intrinsic existence appears to be a distinctive interpretation of the noble Nāgārjuna’s thought by the master Buddhapālita and the revered Candrakīrti. So distinguishing two types of existence and two types of nonexistence is crucially important.

That emptiness should be presented by the analogy of reflection is found in the following from the Meeting of Father and Son Sutra:
Just as a reflection of a form

That is, one should understand the other analogies of falsehood — how these analogies and their referents are to be correlated — along the same lines as this example [of the mirror image]. {185}

Like reflections, all things are empty of intrinsic existence, and since no intrinsic nature exists equally in either of the two truths — that of the ultimate and that of the conventional — phenomena such as form do not intrinsically exist; they are neither eternal nor annihilated. “Annihilation” here refers to the sense explained in the line “So at the time of the sprout, there is no extinction of the seed.”[513] In Fundamental Wisdom it says:
As they assert what existed before is now no more,
they fall therefore into annihilationism.[514]
Nāgārjuna is stating here that if, having asserted intrinsic existence of things, one accepts that something that existed previously later becomes nonexistent or is impermanent in the sense of having disintegrated, this would constitute an annihilationist view. For if one holds that things exist intrinsically, Nāgārjuna says, then whether one asserts a thing to be permanent or impermanent, this would constitute either an eternalist or a nihilist view.
At this point in the Commentary, Candrakīrti cites the passages from Fundamental Wisdom where Nāgārjuna states that the agent and the acts done are like when the Buddha manifests one emanation who in turn manifests another emanation.[515] “Thus,” Candrakīrti writes, “Nāgārjuna has shown how things with no intrinsic existence do arise from no intrinsic existence.”[516] Candrakīrti’s point is that when every function is posited in a context of no intrinsic existence, there is no [danger of falling into] nihilism.
In brief, if one fails to negate existence by virtue of intrinsic characteristic on the conventional level, one will fail to realize the extremely subtle level of selflessness. It would also become difficult to ensure that the subtlest degrees of eternalist and nihilist views do not arise within one’s mind. Therefore the benefit that comes from eliminating that object of negation on the conventional level is the relinquishing of all eternalist and nihilist views, with no residue. If such an existence is negated on the conventional level, one will not only avoid falling into eternalist and nihilist views with respect to the ultimate truth, one will escape being soiled by the stains of eternalist and nihilist views with respect to conventional truth as well. It thus has the merit of easily abandoning the views of eternalism and nihilism. {186}

In this way, because things do not have intrinsic existence on the level of both truths, one casts views of eternalism and nihilism far away. Not only that, it becomes tenable to maintain that karmic acts — even if committed long before — remain connected to their effects without conceiving such notions as foundation consciousness, mental continuum, noncorrosion, or obtainment.[517]
Here Candrakīrti states that for the standpoint with no intrinsic existence, not only is there the merit of casting eternalist and nihilist views far away, there is also the merit of the complete tenability of connecting karma and its effects without having to resort to notions like the foundation consciousness and so on.
From the traditions of interpreting the treatises of the noble Nāgārjuna comes this unique interpretation, whereby one can still posit all effective transactions [of the world] even though not even the tiniest particle of intrinsic reality exists. Based on this approach, many perfect tenets emerge that are unique compared to other commentators. What are these tenets? For now here are the principal ones:
1. Rejecting a foundation consciousness that is separate from the sixfold classes of consciousness
2. A unique method of refuting reflexive awareness (self-cognition)
3. Rejecting the use of autonomous syllogism to engender of the view of suchness in others; thus three rejections.
4. Accepting external reality’s existence to the same extent as one accepts the existence of consciousness
5. Accepting that even śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas realize the selflessness of phenomena
6. Accepting that grasping at the self-existence of phenomena is a form of affliction
7. Accepting that the disintegration [of things] is a conditioned thing
8. Because of this reason, accepting a unique way of defining the three times.[518]

How the fifth tenet is due also to this rejection [of intrinsic existence] is as follows. Just as Buddhapālita defines the self-existence that is negated in the śrāvaka scriptures — such as in the statement “All phenomena are devoid of self-existence” — to be that of existence by virtue of an essence, this approach is accepted here as well. The sense here is that of a comprehensive understanding of selflessness. The meaning of a comprehensive understanding of the selflessness of persons is to be understood as the absence of a person existing by virtue of its own essence. The point is that realizing such selflessness of persons correctly requires correctly realizing the selflessness of phenomena as well. Given this, one must definitely admit grasping at the self-existence of phenomena to be a form of affliction. This in turn gives rise to numerous distinctions [between this system and that of Svātantrika Madhyamaka], such as two different ways of defining the afflictions, one subtler and the other coarser; two different opinions on the question of whether the path of the sixteen characteristics [of the four noble truths] such as impermanence can itself lead to freedom; and different opinions on what specific stage of the path one begins to eliminate the obscurations to knowledge, and so forth.

[Question:] Both Madhyamaka schools accept that there are some who, having entered the Mahayana path first, established well the view of suchness but later fell into the śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha path. In that case, one must accept, he would gain insight into such truth through meditation on the selflessness of phenomena in a direct manner, and he will have gained deeper familiarity with what he has seen. If so, one must also admit that through such a path, he will have eliminated, on the path of seeing, the acquired levels of grasping at self-existence of phenomena, and he will have eliminated, on the path of meditation, innate self-grasping. This being so, the question becomes, within the standpoint of the Madhyamaka tradition that accepts things to exist through intrinsic characteristics [that is, the Svātantrika Madhyamaka], should one accept two types of grasping at the self-existence of phenomena — one that belongs to the class of afflictions and one that does not?

[Reply:] No clear statements on this point appear [in the Indian sources themselves]. These Svātantrika Mādhyamikas do have to maintain that such śrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas may attain temporary elimination of the manifest levels of grasping at the self-existence of phenomena through their meditative cultivation of the path. Nonetheless, without the complementary factor of the limitless collection of merit, it remains impossible to eliminate the seed of either of the two levels [acquired and innate] of grasping at the self-existence of phenomena. So such Mādhyamikas would have to say that although some śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas may be able to temporarily eliminate the manifest levels of the obscuration to knowledge, the elimination of their seeds remain impossible. In the view of our master Candrakīrti, in contrast, grasping at the self-existence of phenomena belongs to the class of afflictive obscurations, so to eliminate its seed does not require the complementary factor of the limitless collection of merit. {188} Such a complementary factor is only necessary, he maintains, to purify the habitual propensities toward delusory dualistic perceptions, which belong to the class of obscurations to knowledge. Since gaining some understanding of these points just addressed seems to make a great deal of difference, I have discussed them here.

What then is the account from the standpoint that asserts no intrinsic existence for how the connection between karma and its effects is maintained without accepting foundation consciousness or the like?
Now all Buddhist schools, both higher and lower, agree that even when a long period has elapsed between karma and its effects, from virtuous and nonvirtuous karma will emerge effects in the form of happiness and suffering. This said, for the karmic act to remain present up to the point immediately before issuing its effect, it would have to be permanent. Since something permanent cannot be causally efficient, the causal relation that allows effects to originate from such an act would become impossible. If, on the other hand, the karmic act were to disintegrate in the subsequent moment — that is, in the moment immediately following the execution of the act — this would mean that from that point on up to the moment before the effect is issued, the karmic act would not be present. And yet the disintegration of a karmic act cannot be a conditioned thing; so how then can effects arise from these karmic acts?
To respond to this problem of how the karmic act — which comes to cease in the second moment — deposits its potential immediately prior to ceasing, (1) some postulate a foundation consciousness (ālayavijñāna). (2) Others assert something called noncorrosion (avipraṇāśa), resembling a guarantee or a promissory note in relation to a loan, that belongs to the category of nonassociated mental formations and is allegedly separate from either of the two karmic acts. (3) Some others postulate what is known as obtainment (prāpti), something different in nature from the karmic act and belonging to the class of nonassociated mental formations. (4) Others postulate a mental continuum (cittasaṃtāna) that has been imbued with the habitual propensities of the karmic acts. Thus they all maintain that there is no contradiction for a karmic act that has ceased to bring forth its effects in the future long afterward.[520]
Since the karmic act deposits its imprint upon foundation consciousness, such imprinted potential is the effect of the karmic act, and it is through the continuity of successive series of such an imprint that eventually effects come into being. This is how, they say, effects of the initial karmic act come into being through a continuous series of effects. We should understand the other three positions along these same lines as well.

Of these, the first is the standpoint of certain Cittamātras. As for the second, {189} Avalokitavrata attributes it to the Vaibhāṣika school;[521] however, it is a school other than the Kashmiri Vaibhāṣika. The third is also a subdivision of the Vaibhāṣika school. As for the fourth, although no explicit identification of it is found, this position looks like the view of the Sautrāntika and Kashmiri Vaibhāṣika if one correlates it to the ninth chapter of Vasubandhu’s Commentary on the Treasury of Abhidharma.[522] However, although it is true that Kashmiri Vaibhāṣika accepts a notion of obtainment, they do not assert that obtainment is a product of the two karmic acts, the thing being obtained. Here [the third position] appears to refer to someone who does accept this. This is the significance of the phrase [in the Commentary] “According to you . . .”[523]

For the Prāsaṅgika Mādhyamika, according to whom the karmic act did not arise of its own being, since karmic actions do not cease in an intrinsic manner, there is no contradiction for an effect to originate from something that has not ceased intrinsically. So, even though one does not subscribe to a foundation consciousness, in its absence one can maintain that they, the karmic acts, remain potent in bringing forth their effects. Indeed in some cases, the two karmic acts [virtuous and nonvirtuous] committed themselves may have long ceased in the mental continuum of the sentient being such that many eons have past, yet once committed, their effects will come about without fail. This, that effects inviolably follow from their causes, is something you should know. This being so, the causal connection between karma and its effects remains entirely tenable according to this standpoint.

The point of these lines is that each of the four positions responding to the above debate adhere to the view that a karmic act possesses arising and ceasing by virtue of its intrinsic characteristic, and that it ceases in an intrinsic sense in the aftermath of the act itself. Candrakīrti refutes these standpoints by stating that it is incorrect to respond by saying that although the karmic act ceases in an intrinsic sense, there is no problem because we accept foundation consciousness or the like. And he refutes them with the argument “because there is no intrinsically established arising and ceasing of karmic acts.”

To demonstrate that this is the way in which Nāgārjuna would respond, Candrakīrti cites the following:
Why has karma no arising?
Because it lacks intrinsic nature.
And since it is unarisen,
it does not corrode.[524]
The meaning here is this: Because there is no intrinsically existing karmic act, there is no arising through its own being. Therefore, since it is not possible for the karmic act to cease intrinsically, it is incorrect to hold that cessation of the karmic act following its commission to have intrinsic existence and then think of it as constituting noncorrosion. Although this reasoning is presented in [Fundamental Wisdom] in the context of refuting noncorrosion, this can be applied equally to refute the other three positions as well, for the reasoning is exactly the same in all respects.

Furthermore, Candrakīrti cites the following from the sutra:
Human lifespan is a hundred years;
one might say humans live up to that; {190}
but there is no real piling up of years.
What is established too is like that.
Whether one speaks of no exhaustion
or one speaks of the exhaustion of karma,
in emptiness there is no exhaustion;
exhaustion is taught in conventional terms.[525]
This is a scriptural source to demonstrate that there is no intrinsically existing exhaustion or cessation and that these two are posited from the standpoint of conventions.

[Question:] There may be no intrinsic ceasing according to your own standpoint, but there are still statements like “Indeed in some cases, the acts themselves may have long ceased” (6.39c), “actions ceased and lacking intrinsic existence” (6.40c), and “exhaustion is taught in conventional terms.”[526] So you have to admit that following its execution, the karmic act has ceased to exist. Since being ceased does not exist as conditioned thing and you do not accept foundation consciousness or the like as the ground for the relationship between a karmic act and its effects, then the objection still stands that it is untenable for effects to emerge when much time has elapsed following the cessation of the karmic act. So your responses remain inadequate.
[Reply:] There is no such problem. The very reason stated in the lines “Since actions do not cease in an intrinsic manner . . .” (6.39a) establishes that from the disintegration of karmic acts, which consists in the fact of the karmic acts having ceased, the subsequent effects originate. Because of this, Candrakīrti did not present any specific separate solution. The key point here is this: For all the standpoints asserting things to exist through their intrinsic nature, being disintegrated cannot be a conditioned thing. For the Madhyamaka, however, which upholds no intrinsic existence, being disintegrated is established as a conditioned thing.

According to the first standpoint [that asserts intrinsic existence], when a conditioned thing such as a sprout has disintegrated, all conditioned factors that are part of the sprout have become undone, and no other entity — say, a vase — is obtained either [in the aftermath of disintegration]. They maintain, therefore, that this fact of being disintegrated is in no way a conditioned thing. This is because no aspect of the specific conditioned thing can be identified with its disintegration, whether it is an individual sense base, such as blue color, or a composite thing like a vase, which is made up of its parts. {191} Therefore, in their mind, disintegration cannot be a conditioned thing.

According to the second standpoint [that of Madhyamaka], take for example [someone named] Upagupta. None of the five aggregates of Upagupta — whether individually, collectively, or of a different nature from these — can be said to constitute Upagupta, and neither can Upagupta himself be identified with any of these three. Yet there is no contradiction in saying that what is imputed as Upagupta, on the basis of his aggregates, is a conditioned thing. In the same manner, in the case of disintegration too, nothing within the conditioned thing that has disintegrated or any other conditioned thing that shares the same nature can be identified with it. Yet, because disintegration occurs in dependence upon the conditioned thing that has disintegrated, it is a conditioned thing.

In Clear Words Candrakīrti presents both scriptural citations and reasoned arguments to prove this. The first refers to the statement in the Ten Grounds Sutra that “Conditioned by birth, aging and death come about.”[527] “Death” refers to the disintegration of a sentient being, and this, the sutra states, is produced in dependence on birth. The same sutra also says:
Dying consists of two activities: it involves disintegration of karmic activity, and it brings forth the cause that ensures uninterrupted continuity of ignorance.[528]
The sutra states that dying performs two functions: it makes death a caused event, and it perpetuates ignorance. Disintegration is produced by a cause, and disintegration thereby also has the capacity to produce effects. Although the disintegration referred to here is that of a continuum, the same is also true of momentary disintegration, where the first moment disintegrates at the time of the second moment. So this [sutra citation] also indicates how the first moment is the cause of its own disintegration in the second moment. Therefore, whether it is between a sentient being’s birth and death or between a momentary phenomenon’s not persisting at the time of its second moment and not having persisted at the time of its second moment, they are entirely equal in whether they can be considered conditioned things and whether they are produced by their causes.

In view of this, Fundamental Wisdom says:
Things and nonthings are both conditioned phenomena.[529]
And Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning states:
The pacification derived from extinction of cause
is understood to be exhaustion.[530]
Thus, in the above, things such as sprouts as well as their nonexistence are both described as conditioned phenomena, and the extinction of the cause, like the exhaustion of oil in a lamp, is said to be the cause for the extinction of the effect, such as the lamp flame. We must therefore accept this without doubt to be the intention of the noble Nāgārjuna.

Now, since the disintegration of the first moment at the time of the second moment is something that must be cognized by means of an explicit elimination of its object of negation, it is a form of negation; and, furthermore, since it is not a nonimplicative negation, it is an implicative negation. This is because it has not simply eliminated a thing that has become disintegrated; it also implies, in the course of its negation, some other conditioned thing. As for more details on the remaining parts of the reasoning proving [disintegration to be a conditioned thing], you could learn these from my commentary on Fundamental Wisdom.[531] This reasoning [on disintegration] represents a form of reasoning that is most subtle and an important feature of Candrakīrti’s tradition. {192}

[Question:] One may not accept foundation consciousness, but one must nevertheless acknowledge that the propensities of virtuous and nonvirtuous karma can be imprinted and that, through maturation of these propensities, effects do come into being. For in Commentary on Entering the Middle Way it says that “Beings cling to things as real owing to thorough maturation of the propensities toward real entities deposited through the beginningless cycle of existence.”[532] Many similar statements can be found as well. Since habitual propensities will be untenable if there is no basis for depositing them, the question arises, “What is this basis?”
[Reply:] Just as those who assert foundation consciousness take such a consciousness — which they conceive to be the objective support for the afflicted mind generating the thought “I am” — to be the basis on which the propensities are imprinted, in the same manner, this tradition [of Candrakīrti] holds the very object of the innate mind that takes the form of the thought “I am” to be the basis on which the propensities are imbued.

In that case, one might ask, “What is the meaning of the statement in the Commentary on Entering the Middle Way that the mental continuum is the basis of habitual propensities?”[533] [Reply:] Since the mere “I” is a continuum imputed upon the mind or consciousness, it is referred to as the “mental continuum” as well. And if we take the mind’s own successive states as being referred to as the continuum here, in the sense of the type continuity,[534] this too constitutes an intermittent basis for imbuing the habitual propensities. As for the nature of ignorance’s habitual propensities, Commentary on Entering the Middle Way says:
That which percolates the mental continuum, imbues it, and makes it follow is a habitual propensity. The “final base” of the afflictions, their “habit,” their “root,” and their “habitual propensities” — these are synonyms. Even śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas who have already eliminated the afflictions through their uncontaminated path do not eliminate them. They are like, for example, when one has already removed the sesame oil or the fragrant flowers, one can still sense their subtle traces in the vase or the piece of cloth that came into contact with them.[535]

One should extend this point about how there are these two types of bases[536] to other habitual propensities as well, such as those of virtue and nonvirtue.
“In that case,” one might wonder, “at the time of the uninterrupted phase of the path of seeing, although it is true that the object eliminated by the path of seeing is no more, the latent dispositions of the object eliminated by the path of meditation still persists. Nonetheless, the mental consciousness in that phase remains uncontaminated, unsoiled by habitual propensities toward delusory dualistic perceptions. Thus it would be incorrect to maintain that latent dispositions reside within such a mind. Sensory consciousness cannot serve as the basis for these propensities, nor can the physical body be such a basis. Since you do not accept foundation consciousness, {193} there is then no basis for these dispositions.”

If one understands the unique way this system [of Candrakīrti] defines the nature of person, arguments such as the following pose no problems. These include “When uncontaminated states of mind manifest in the mental continua of āryas born in the first three formless states — infinite space, infinite consciousness, and nothingness — their very status as persons would come to an end because no mundane levels of mind are present.” “Similarly,” one might object, “when within the mental continuum of an ārya born in the [highest] formless state peak of existence arise uncontaminated states of mind belonging to the [second-highest] formless state nonthingness, the beings of both peak of existence as well as nothingness would come to cease. Their uncontaminated mind cannot serve as the basis for the identities of the two beings as well as serve as the basis for the identity of the person who has attained nirvana.”
The reason [such arguments pose no threat to Candrakīrti’s view] is because, according to Candrakīrti, one can legitimately define a person even without positing either of the two — contaminated or uncontaminated mind — to constitute the person’s identity.

The opponent’s standpoint, on the other hand, assumes that the nature of the person, those who have not yet entered a path and those on the learner’s stage [i.e., the first four of the five paths], belongs to the class of phenomena that is neutral and nondefiling.[537]
As for the responses offered above, how can someone like me speak independently on matters related to these great systems of thought? I have spoken on these issues, however, on the basis of the traditions of the great charioteers who knew how to present the thought of the savior Nāgārjuna exactly as it is and in its entirety. Judging from these responses, it appears that the remaining arguments aiming to prove the existence of foundation consciousness would also pose no problem to this system of Candrakīrti. Anyway, those whose intelligence is great, refined, and sharp should inquire further.

Having perceived certain things such as beautiful women in a dream, {194} a fool may continue to lust for them, things now ceased, even when he is awake — that is, even after having woken up. Likewise, even from karmic actions ceased and also lacking intrinsic existence, effects will come to be. This illustrates how effects can arise from karma following its disintegration.

To substantiate the point of this analogy, Candrakīrti cites the Transferring to Another Existence Sutra:
“O great king, it is thus. A man experiences a dream wherein he is making love to a beautiful woman. Were he to continue to think of that beautiful woman after waking from that dream, O great king, what would you think of this? Is this person who, having dreamed of making love to a beautiful woman, continues to think of that beautiful woman even after waking from sleep someone who has the character of a learned one?”
“Blessed One,” replied the king, “this is not so. O Blessed One, if the beautiful woman of his dream does not exist, and if she cannot be observed, what possibility is there to experience her? Such a man will be someone who is depraved and desperate.”[538]
Up to this, the sutra presents the analogy.

The following presents how the analogy should be applied to its referent:
O great king, likewise, childish beings on the ordinary stage who are not endowed with learning, having seen forms with their eyes, manifestly cling to forms that inspire pleasure in their mind. And having clung to them, they engender attachment toward them. Being attached, they engage in acts with their body, speech, and mind stemming from attachment, from aversion, and from delusion. Having executed the karmic acts, the acts come to cease. When these karmic acts have ceased, they do not reside in the east with a support. . . . They do not reside in the intermediate directions.[539]
“Not endowed with learning” here refers to not having the realization of suchness on the basis of having heard the teaching on suchness; “manifest clinging” is clinging to self-existence. As for the three karmic acts [of body, speech, and mind] stemming from attachment, these include both virtuous and nonvirtuous karmic acts. Karmic acts stemming from aversion are nonvirtuous, while karmic acts stemming from delusion can accumulate both [virtuous and nonvirtuous] karma. The statement that karmic acts cease immediately after their execution is on the conventional level, while the remainder of the sutra citation rejects such cessation to exist by virtue of an essence.

Next the sutra says:
Then, at another time, when the person nears the time of death, and as the lifespan propelled by a karma that is commensurate with it becomes exhausted and the last moment of consciousness ceases, {195} then like the mind of a person waking up from sleep turning to the beautiful woman he dreamed of, the person’s mind will turn toward that karma.[540]

Having exhausted a karma that is commensurate — namely, the karma that helps sustain the continuity in this life of the aggregates of the same kind — and when the last moment of consciousness of this present life comes to cease, then like the lustful man who, after waking, instantly thinks of the beautiful woman of his dream and turns his attention to her, the dying person’s mind at the point of death turns toward the karma whose potency has been reactivated and is therefore likely to mature in the next life. This, however, is not an instance of remembering.

Candrakīrti then goes on to cite the following:
In this way, as the last moment of consciousness ceases and the first moment of consciousness that is part of the next birth arises — and if one is going to be reborn among the celestial beings . . . Alternatively, if one is going to be reborn among the hungry ghosts . . .[541]
The cessation of the last moment [of consciousness] refers to that of this life. The emergence of the first moment of consciousness that is part of the next birth is indicated with the phrase “among the celestial beings” and so on. Since the intermediate state does not represent any of the six realms of existence, [the first moment of] consciousness referred to here is that of the new birth. Although an intermediate state exists between death and the next birth, [the scriptures] often do not mention it [when speaking of karma and its effects]. This is because the primary aim is to establish the causal connection between karma and its effects from the perspective of birth and death.

Candrakīrti then cites the following from the same sutra:
The instant the first moment of consciousness ceases, the continuity of the mind will emerge commensurate with the fruitional effect that one will come to experience. O great king, no phenomenon whatsoever is transferred from this world to the next; yet there is the transition of death and what manifests as a rebirth. O great king, here the cessation of the final moment of consciousness is what is called the transition of death; and the emergence of the first moment of consciousness is what is called birth. O great king, when the final moment of consciousness ceases, it does not go anywhere. When the consciousness that is part of the rebirth emerges, it does not come from anywhere. Why is this so? It is because they lack intrinsic existence. O great king, the final moment of consciousness is empty of the final moment of consciousness. Death and transmigration are empty of death and transmigration; karma is empty of karma; the first moment of consciousness is empty of the first moment of consciousness. Birth is empty of birth, yet one observes that karmic acts do not corrode.[542]

</d>
<d e="2">
So, the sutra states, prior to connecting with existence via rebirth, one experiences happiness or suffering as a result of past karma. From the continuity of that consciousness that experiences these, birth emerges in the form of the first moment of the consciousness of rebirth. The sutra also states how the two — the transition of death and birth — exist on the conventional level and not on the ultimate level. {196} And the reason stated for this is “because they lack intrinsic existence,” where what is being negated is qualified, a qualification that must be applied to the statements about how consciousness and so forth are empty of themselves. Now when such statements are made, given that there is the risk that people might consider karma and its effects to be nonexistent, the sutra states that karmic acts do not corrode.

[Question:] You assert that fruitional effects emerge from karmic acts, which have no intrinsic exhaustion because they are not born by means of an intrinsic nature. If so, then fruitional effects should similarly emerge from those [karmic acts] for which fruitional effects have already ripened. There will therefore be the fault of endless process.
[Reply:] While nonexistent objects are equal in their unreality, those with eye disease, for example, perceive with their eyes nonexistent forms such as floating hairs and do not see the forms of just any nonexistent thing, such as the horns of a donkey or the son of a barren woman. Know likewise that, while they are equal in having no existence through intrinsic nature, fruition takes place from [karmic acts] that have not yet ripened and that already ripened acts do not bear fruit again.

There is a reason those with eye disease see floating hairs and not donkey horns. As such, wholesome fruitional effects do not emerge from nonvirtuous karma, and undesirable fruitional effects do not emerge from virtuous karma. {197} One can see that it is from dark karmic acts that unwholesome or undesirable fruitional effects come, and it is from virtuous acts that wholesome or desirable fruitional effects come. As for the wise, for whom there is no virtuous or nonvirtuous karma — that is, those who realize [karma and its effects] cannot be objectified in term of intrinsic existence — they become free from the cycle of existence. Therefore, thinking that ordinary people — those who strive to determine through evidential reasoning why this or that specific feature of the effect emerges from such and such specific karma — may come to denigrate karma and its effects, thus destroying conventional truth, the Conqueror stated that the fruitional effects of karma remain inconceivable. Thus speculation on, or analysis of, karma and effects has been discouraged by the Buddha.
Fearing the danger of losing conviction in the law of karma, this treatise strives to engender conviction in karma through numerous avenues such as those presented above. This point needs to be appreciated. We should make our view of emptiness a complementary factor that strengthens this conviction [in the law of karma], and on that basis, we should strive to ensure that this one time we do not return empty-handed from our visit to the island of precious gems.

[Reply:] This is not the case. For the benefit of those who can be tamed through teaching the existence of foundation consciousness, it was indeed taught to exist. {198} This response indicates how the existence of foundation consciousness was accepted for a specific purpose from the perspective of trainees. Thus, according to Madhyamaka’s own standpoint, when such a statement is being shown to be a teaching with specific intent, it is done like this: the basis of the intention — what is in fact intended — is emptiness in the sense of a lack of intrinsic existence, and it is referred to here by the term foundation consciousness (ālayavijñāna); the reason emptiness is being called the foundation of all (ālaya) is because this nature pervades all entities.

Furthermore, not only did the Buddha teach foundation consciousness for a specific purpose, he taught the substantial reality of persons as well. This is because by teaching that persons possess substantial reality, the Buddha can sustain those individuals who can be tamed through such a teaching. This refers to, for example, the statement, “O monks, the five aggregates are the burden; that which carries this burden is the person.”[543] Here, in response to questions from those who conceive the person to be substantially real, instead of teaching that this does not exist, the Buddha taught that the person who is the carrier of the burden does exist. Although the word “substantial” is not explicit [in the quote], the reference is to a substantially real person.

Again for the benefit of some other trainees, the Buddha taught mere aggregates with no substantially real person, such as in the following:
Whether one calls it “mind,” “mental faculty,” or “consciousness,” it is this that is thoroughly imbued over a long period of time with faith, moral discipline, and so on, and when it advances further, one will go to the higher realms in the next life.[544]
Thus, for the benefit of those who, because of grasping at the true existence of the way to the higher realms and to the freedom of enlightenment, wonder what degree of reality they should accept, the Buddha taught that aggregates alone exist, without refuting the object of their clinging to true existence. So by implication, the Buddha is teaching here that the aggregates have true existence. All of these were taught by the Buddha due to specific underlying intentions.
“For what kind of trainees, then, did the Buddha teach foundation consciousness?” one might ask. In response, the root text reads:

In regard to teachings such as “Foundation consciousness exists,” “Persons exist” as a substantial reality, and “These aggregates alone exist” in that they possess true existence, such teachings were, as explained above, given for the sake of those trainees who, for the time being, cannot understand or realize the meaning of the most profound truth. Some trainees have been habituated to extreme views over long periods and remain incapable of engaging the profound reality. For example, the Precious Garland says:
“I do not exist!” “I will not be!”
“Mine do not exist!” “They will not be!”
Thus the childish come to be terrified.[545]
So when the ultimate nature is first taught, {199} some may become terrified and regard the Buddha’s teaching as akin to an abyss. In doing so, they will turn away from the teaching and will not enter it; the teaching will then serve no great purpose. On the other hand, by not teaching the profound final truth right at the beginning but teaching foundation consciousness, true existence of the aggregates, and so forth, the teaching instead cleanses trainees of their heterodox standpoints and leads them toward greater objectives. In the future, they will come to comprehend the meaning of the scriptures excellently and will relinquish their belief in the existence of foundation consciousness and the like. Therefore there can be only merit for teaching such things, and for the Buddha to teach these is not a fault. Understanding this to be the proper sequence of teaching, Four Hundred Stanzas says:
In whatever teaching one delights in,
one should partake in this first.
He who might come to be damaged
is in no way a vessel of that teaching.[546]
Now, those who need to be taught that there is a foundation consciousness that is separate from the sixfold collection of consciousness must also be taught to reject external reality. They are therefore suitable vessels for teaching suchness only in terms of the emptiness of a substantial subject-object duality. Since they do not know how to posit a causal relation between karma and its effects without embracing a consciousness characterized in the above terms, they are referred to as “those who cannot understand the most profound truth” (6.43d).

Many scriptures, such as the Hundred Thousand Lines on the Perfection of Wisdom, mention a sixfold collection of consciousness when listing classes of consciousness; thus many sutras do not speak of more than this sixfold collection. So there are two categories of scriptures — those that posit foundation consciousness and those that do not. In the same vein, when the revered Maitreya expounds the meaning of these scriptures in his Differentiation of the Middle and the Extremes, Ornament of the Mahayana Sutras, and Differentiation of Phenomena and Their Ultimate Nature, he presents the standpoint that accepts foundation consciousness and the absence of external reality. In contrast, in his Ornament of Realizations and Sublime Continuum, Maitreya presents the standpoint that does not posit foundation consciousness and does not reject external reality. The great master Asaṅga too did not interpret the intention of the Sublime Continuum from the Cittamātra standpoint at all; rather, he expounded the text from the Madhyamaka perspective.

<d e="2">
Furthermore, in his commentary on the Sublime Continuum, Asaṅga explains in the following manner the very scriptural proof cited from the Abhidharma in his Summary of the Great Vehicle to establish the existence of foundation consciousness:
The Buddha said that although the Tathāgata element that constitutes an essence is present in sentient beings, they do not recognize it. For example, it says in the sutra:
This element since beginningless time
is the locus of all phenomena;
due to its presence, all migrations
as well as nirvana are attained.[547] {200}
This verse is cited as a scriptural authority to establish the presence in all sentient beings of the ultimate reality that is buddha nature. Such an approach accords with our master Candrakīrti, who explains emptiness to be the underlying intended meaning of the teaching of foundation consciousness. So Asaṅga too understands that a foundation consciousness separate from the sixfold collection of consciousness is something taught by the Buddha for the sake of certain trainees and for a specific purpose.

[Question:] “In that case,” one might ask, “how does one interpret the following in Commentary on the Awakening Mind, where it says that foundation consciousness sustains existence?”
When close to a lodestone,
an iron object swiftly moves forward;
it possesses no mind of its own
yet appears as if it does.
Likewise foundation consciousness too
appears to be real though it is false;
it moves to and fro in this way
and sustains [the three realms of] existence.
Just as the ocean and the trees
move about though they possess no mind,
likewise foundational consciousness
moves about in dependence upon the body.[548]

[Reply:] It is shown [earlier in Commentary on the Awakening Mind] how the teaching of mind only — according to which, following the rejection of an external reality independent from the mind, the mind alone is left, without negating its intrinsic existence — was taught to help the childish overcome their terror toward the teaching that everything is empty, and therefore it does not constitute the definitive truth. Furthermore, the text refutes the Yogācāra view that a pure state of mind possessing intrinsic existence and attained through the transformation of the base exists as the sphere of experience of the reflexive gnosis [of āryas]. When this is refuted, there remains the salient question, “If the mind has no true existence, how can processes such as a sentient being entering this world from the previous one and departing to the next one from this present world function?” In response to such a qualm, the text states how the iron object and tree do not have minds of their own and yet they move about as if they do. In the same manner, the text says, foundation consciousness has no true existence and yet it is perceived with activities like leaving and entering as if it does possess true existence. So this text does not indicate that the author accepts intrinsically real foundation consciousness, as described in other treatises.

One might think, “Although this text [Commentary on the Awakening Mind] might not accept a foundation consciousness that exists by virtue of its intrinsic characteristic, it does accept an illusion-like consciousness that is separate from the six classes of consciousness — a form of consciousness endowed with all the seeds of afflicted phenomena and all those of the enlightened class of phenomena.”

[Reply:] Were the text to accept this kind of foundation consciousness, it would also have to reject external reality, since [on that view] forms, sounds, and so on are claimed to appear merely from the maturing of propensities contained in foundation consciousness. In that case, how would one understand the following from the same text?
The cognizer perceives the cognizable;
without the cognizable there is no cognition.
Therefore why do you not admit
that neither object nor subject exists [at all]?[549] {201}
This says that, insofar as their existence or nonexistence is concerned, both the outer object of knowledge and the inner cognition are equal. If one does not exist, neither will the other, the text states. This standpoint is no different from the statement here in our work [Entering the Middle Way], where Candrakīrti says that objects and their cognitions are exactly equal with respect to their existence or lack thereof. As such, it is wrong to discriminate between the two in terms of their existence or nonexistence on the level of either of the two truths. Therefore the existence of a consciousness with no parallel external reality is not a position of the master Nāgārjuna.

Since there is no foundation consciousness separate from mental consciousness according to Nāgārjuna, what is called “foundation [consciousness]” [in his Commentary on the Awakening Mind] refers, in general, to the mind characterized by mere awareness and luminosity and, more specifically, to mental consciousness. The reasons are that the context here is a response that demonstrates (1) that causal efficacy remains tenable despite the mind’s general lack of intrinsic existence, (2) that it is mental consciousness that assumes birth in cyclic existence, and (3) that it is mental consciousness that is the basis of all classes of phenomena, both afflicted and enlightened.

The literal truth of [the teaching of] foundation consciousness is rejected in [Bhāviveka’s] Essence of the Middle Way too. Similarly, given that he accepts external reality, the master Jñānagarbha does not accept foundation consciousness. There also seems to be two camps within the Cittamātra, which rejects external reality — one that asserts foundation consciousness and another that does not. Even the master Kamalaśīla, who does not accept external reality, writes, “Mental consciousness alone is endowed with the potency to connect with another life.”[550] He then goes on to cite the following from Vasubandhu’s Treasury of Abhidharma:
Severing, reconnecting, being freed from attachment,
degenerating, transitioning through death, being born —
these we maintain to be mental consciousness alone.[551]
It is clear from the above that the great master Śāntarakṣita also does not accept foundation consciousness. The same is true also of master Abhayākaragupta.

Other Mahayana scriptures too do mention the term foundation consciousness, but they do not specify clearly what the term actually refers to. However, if one examines their meaning, there is never any apparent acceptance of something distinct from the six classes of consciousness. So, to conclude, this tradition [of Commentary on the Awakening Mind] appears, in fact, to belong to the standpoint that accepts external reality; and it is mental consciousness that is being designated by the term foundation consciousness. These issues require extensive treatment, but fearing excessive length, I will not write about them more here.

It is not only foundation consciousness that has been taught to help trainees initially engage [with the teaching]. For example, even though the Buddha, being free of identity view and its habitual imprints, totally eliminated all conceptualizations grasping in terms of “I” and “mine,” he did still speak in terms of “I” and “mine.” This is a skillful means to help the world comprehend the truth of his teachings. Likewise, though things are devoid of intrinsic existence, the Buddha spoke, in a provisional sense alone, of their existence as though they possessed intrinsic nature. This is a skillful means to help the world to gradually comprehend suchness.

In brief, the meaning is this: It appears as though the Buddha possesses conceptions of I and mine as judged by his utterance of “I” and “mine,” yet the Buddha’s lack of conceptualization remains the definitive truth. In the same way, when the Buddha taught as though phenomena possess intrinsic existence, this appears to reflect his intention. Nonetheless, the definitive truth remains that phenomena do not exist in such terms.

The way the Buddha engaged with conventional truths in consonance with the world is as extensively presented in the following stanzas from a sutra belonging to the [early Buddhist] Pūrvaśaila sect:
If the saviors of the world
do not engage in accord with the world,
no one will know the nature of the Buddha
and what is buddhahood.
Maintaining that aggregates, elements,
and sense bases are one in their natures,
[yet] he speaks of the world of three realms.
This is to accord with the world.
The realities that have no name
are inconceivable, yet through names
he speaks of these to sentient beings.
This is to accord with the world.
Revealing clearly the absence of entity
and abiding in the buddha’s nature,
“There is no absence of entity at all,” he teaches.
This is to accord with the world.
Not seeing truth or the absence of truth,
yet he speaks of cessation and sublime truth;
he utters such excellent speech.
This is to accord with the world.
There is no disintegration or birth,
and though things are equal within the ultimate expanse,
he speaks of the eon-ending conflagration.
This is to accord with the world.
Whether past, present, or future, the nature
of sentient beings cannot be observed,
yet he speaks of sentient beings’ natures.
This is to accord with the world.[552] {203}

Of these, the last stanza presents the selflessness of persons in terms of sentient beings lacking intrinsic existence, while the remaining stanzas present, by reference to “entity” and “absence of entity,” the selflessness of phenomena. In the Blaze of Reasoning, the Pūrvaśaila sect is described as having emerged as a branching off from the Mahāsāṃgika.[553] Thus it appears that at least one sutra in the śrāvaka scriptural collection clearly teaches phenomena to be devoid of intrinsic existence.

The bodhisattva on the sixth level who abides or resides in the superior perfection of wisdom and meditates on suchness, using the very reasoning that led him to cognize ultimate reality without distortion and to see without superimposition of a subject-object duality, realizes suchness in terms of consciousness only. {204} This is how Cittamātra interprets.
This bodhisattva also realizes that mind and mental factors, given there is no external reality, are mere dependently originated entities with no correspondence to an external reality. This is therefore referred to as “realizing suchness in terms of mere consciousness.” When asked, “How does such a bodhisattva realize suchness?” they respond as follows.
This bodhisattva has established, through reasoning to be presented below, that phenomena such as forms emerge from the maturation of inner habitual propensities. He is apprehending no objects separate from the mind, and without them he perceives no apprehending subject separate from such objects. Thus thoroughly understanding the triple world to be mere consciousness, he cultivates familiarity with this suchness of nonduality, and through such familiarity, he sees this suchness of nonduality directly with his own reflexive awareness. Having pursued such gradual familiarization in the past, the bodhisattva on the sixth level realizes suchness in terms of consciousness only.
If asked, “If all this is consciousness only and there is no external reality, how does mere mind possessing the aspect of such external reality come to arise?”

[Response:] Just as in the great ocean, source of waves, for example, when it is whipped and beaten hard by windstorm, what previously seemed calm as if sleeping gives way to waves that rise high one after another, as if competing with each other. So like that, this imperfect dependent world that is mere consciousness arises from foundation consciousness, the seed of all outer and inner phenomena, through the maturing of its potentials commensurate with their own class. These potentials were deposited upon foundation consciousness through the ceasing of afflictions such as attachment and virtues such as faith. The childish conceive the world in dualistic terms of subject and object, dividing it into the inner and the outer. Yet no object exists, not even the slightest, that is substantially separate from consciousness. {205}
This above statement indicates that in much the same manner as those who assert God (Īśvara) and so on to be the creator of the world of beings, the proponents of foundation consciousness speak of it as the bearer of all the seeds, since it is the basis of all the entities that are perceived as objects of consciousness. For example, one reads:
A spider is the cause of a spider web,
water stone that of water,
and just as the tree trunk is the cause of its branches,
it [God] is the cause of all beings.[554]

[Question:] When presenting the view of the Cittamātra, the Commentary often speaks of there being “no external reality.” It also says things like “Objects separate from consciousness do not exist in the slightest,” which qualifies the nonexistence of objects such as form in terms of [not existing as] “separate from consciousness . . .” And on the line “is what is conceived as the physical eye organ” (6.62d), Candrakīrti writes in the commentary, “There is no eye organ that is separate from consciousness.” So in relation to Cittamātra, should one qualify what is being negated in the context of the rejection of external reality in the above terms, or should one accept, without any qualification, that the five sense objects such as visible form and the five sense organs do not exist at all?
[Response:] Yes, in the Commentary both instances are found — namely, with the qualification applied and without it. That said, just as repeated instances of qualification in the context of negating arising must be extended to all instances where it is not found, the same must be done here as well.

For example, Summary of the Great Vehicle, an authoritative text representing the opponent’s standpoint, says:
Why is it called the appropriating consciousness? Because it is the cause of all physical sense organs, and it is the basis upon which all physical bodies are appropriated. Therefore, so long as one’s lifespan endures, it sustains the five physical sense organs without disintegration.[555]
And:
The “common ones” are all the seeds of the container world; the “uncommon ones” are all the seeds of an individual being’s sense bases. The common ones are seeds from which insentient things emerge.[556]
Thus the seeds for the container world residing in the foundation consciousness are described as the seeds of all the entities that are insentient; and the same statement is found in the Summary [of the Explanations of the Levels of Yogic Practice] as well.[557] In Commentary on the Dependent Origination Sutra also, it says that name-and-form come into being through being conditioned by foundation consciousness, where it identifies name as the remaining four aggregates and form as material forms composed of elements and their derivatives.[558] Further, it speaks of how such a form does not exist in the formless realm but does exist in the other two realms. Thus there appear to be many instances where the Cittamātra school does seem to accept material form.

If this is not the case, then when it comes to all the contexts where {206} one speaks in terms of form, sound, and so on — which are defined on the basis of the form aggregate — it would not be viable for the Cittamātra to engage in everyday transactions using such conventions, unless some entirely new system of convention were created. As far as I can tell, there is no one among the Buddhists of the noble land of India who, despite seeing that conventions such as [form, sound, and so on] cannot be maintained within their system, still maintains that theirs is an excellent standpoint. As for the meaning of the phrase “those who propound objects of knowledge to be internal,” “objects of knowledge” refers to form, sound, and so on, and these are not asserted to be external but are propounded to be inner realities.

[Question:] Now if the Cittamātra school accepts form, sound, and so on, then their rejection of external reality will amount to a merely semantic point. For it is those very things like form and the rest that are perceived as external that others posit to constitute external reality.

[Response:] This would be like saying to the Madhyamaka that its argument rejecting the intrinsic existence of form and so on yet maintaining their existence is raising a merely semantic point, because they still acknowledge the existence of form and so on whose very intrinsic existence they deny. In any case, this touches upon a point that seems to be most difficult for both schools. Not only is it a challenge for the Madhyamaka standpoint [to posit form and so on in the aftermath of negating their intrinsic existence], there is the similar challenge for the Cittamātra too. For if external reality is negated, form and so on become nonexistent, and if form and so on are posited, then external reality may need to be admitted as well. These are certainly thorny questions, but fearing length, I have not written more about these matters here.

[Cittamātra:] Given that the settled meaning of the scriptures is known to be as we have explained above, one should accept without hesitation, therefore, that dependent nature has intrinsic existence.

Now the illusion of a snake that is based on seeing a coiled rope does not arise where no rope is present, and similarly the false perception of objects such as a vase does not occur just in the sky, without some physical locus. In the same manner, there is the question of what is the basis or the cause of the illusion that conceives things such as a blue patch as external since there is no external reality? Therefore, one must accept without doubt the existence of an imperfect dependent nature that is perceived in dualistic terms of substantially distinct subject and object, which is the cause for the illusion of external reality. And this basis of perception [namely, dependent nature] constitutes the cause of both the bondage to afflicted existence and the freedom of enlightenment. {207}

In either of the two systems, whether Madhyamaka or Cittamātra, if there is a presentation of emptiness whereby the very thing that constitutes the basis of clinging — the thing that ordinary sentient beings perceive and grasp as truly existing in the manner they perceive it to — is shown to be empty of that mode of existence, then the realization of such an emptiness constitutes the path [to liberation]. If one does not take the negation of that conceived object of ordinary sentient beings’ clinging to true existence to be the realization of emptiness but establishes some extraneous emptiness to be the truth instead, this will not be an antidote to any levels of the clinging to true existence, coarse or subtle, that has been ingrained in us since beginningless time.

Understood thus, one will come to recognize correctly that, just as the dependent nature that appears in dualistic terms is perceived in the dichotomous terms of substantially distinct subjects and objects, the absence of such an imputed nature that one grasps to be real constitutes the emptiness of that object of negation. And what is left behind — the basis of emptiness and the emptiness itself — possesses true existence according to this [Cittamātra] system. Knowing this perfectly, one will comprehend excellently the meaning of emptiness as well.[560]

This dependent nature emerges from its own habitual propensities alone in the absence of external objects; it actually exists intrinsically; and it exists as something that is, as understood in this [Cittamātra] system, ultimately beyond the realm of concepts — namely, of language and thought.

In brief, the dependent nature has three characteristics: (1) it comes into being in the absence of external reality, (2) it exists intrinsically, and (3) it is not an object of conceptual elaborations in the ultimate sense as understood in this tradition. Since being “the cause of the imputed nature of things” is included within the characteristic of “being an intrinsically real entity,” it is not a separate attribute from the three. The statement that “the dependent nature exists” does not refer to its mere existence; it refers to a special kind of existence.

If you, Cittamātra, assert that there is no external reality but there is a mind that exists through its intrinsic characteristic, where is your analogy for this — something you could cite and say, “for example”?
To this Cittamātra responds: “Say one is sleeping inside a tiny room and, due to illusion caused by sleep, one dreams of an entire herd of mad elephants. Could those elephants be inside that room? They could not. Like this dream, I accept with certainty that while there are no external objects, an intrinsically real consciousness does exist.[564]
To demonstrate that such a response is pointless, Candrakīrti says: “Let’s examine — that is to say, analyze — this example here.” What is it that needs to be analyzed? It is this: Just as elephants in a dream have no existence, this mind that dreams of a herd of mad elephants, a mind that [supposedly] exists by virtue of its intrinsic characteristic, has no existence for us either. {209} This is because it is unborn. And if there is no consciousness that exists by virtue of its intrinsic characteristic, then this analogy of yours has no validity, for it would not be established for both parties. Therefore there can be no consciousness without external reality.

What is not being demonstrated here is that, just as elephants in a dream do not exist, neither does consciousness. One must understand that this statement indicates the nonexistence of intrinsically real consciousness. For the dependent nature devoid of external reality asserted by Cittamātra is said to possess intrinsic reality. In the Commentary too, when commenting on the concluding summary “Just as there is no cognizable object, understand that there is no cognizing mind either” (6.71cd), one finds the following explicit qualification: “Know that the cognizing mind that takes on the aspects of the objects of knowledge too is unborn by virtue of its own essence.”[565]

Furthermore, both the root text and its relevant commentary contain numerous instances where, when refuting concepts such as this, the object of negation is qualified. Moreover, what Candrakīrti states in the following line about how ignorance gives rise to volition and how volition gives rise to consciousness has to be from the perspective of his own standpoint:
Why then would the Great One proclaim in the same sutra
that the mind was born from delusion and karma? (6.88cd)
In light of this statement, how could any thinking person attribute to Candrakīrti the view that consciousness has no existence? Therefore, with respect to all such instances where parity is being drawn between the cognizer and cognized insofar as their existence or nonexistence is concerned, we should understand these to be from the perspective where what is being negated is qualified.

If you say that the intrinsically real dreaming mind must exist because we remember our dream when we wake up, the same must be true for the objects of that dream, such as the elephants being perceived as external; they too would similarly exist. Why is this so? Because, just as you assert that mental consciousness exists because, when awakened, you can recall in terms of “I dreamed this” when I was dreaming, {210} similar recollection exists for external objects that one has dreamed as well, in terms of “I saw this and that in my dream.” Thus you are compelled to admit either that external objects exist as well or that even consciousness has no existence.
[Question:] Since recollections of both the experience of a dream and the objects in it do exist even from our own standpoint, how does one understand their existence or nonexistence?
[Reply:] The Commentary mentions two aspects of recollection — remembering the experience of dreaming itself and remembering experiencing the objects of the dream. So in the context of seeing elephants and so on in a dream, just as when one sees a reflection of a face in a mirror, the eye consciousness does not experience the face, but it still experiences an object — namely, the face’s reflection — in the same manner, even though there is no actual experience of an object in the sense of seeing a real elephant at the time of the dream, there is still an experience in the form of the perception of an elephant. So although one might speak of “remembering the object,” what one actually remembers is the experience of perceiving such an object. Differentiating between perceiving and experiencing as having distinct senses may be necessary in some specific contexts, but in numerous contexts such as the present one, there is no need for such distinction.[566]
So the assertion that dependent nature devoid of external reality exists by virtue of its intrinsic characteristic cannot be sustained. This is because no possible analogy could directly illustrate this; nor could there be analogies similar to those used in the proof of past and future lives — where although no direct example exists, illustrations can be made on the basis of providing a proof through a different syllogistic formulation.[567] [In view of all the above,] one should understand that the arguments entailed in the refutation of Cittamātra are extremely powerful.

You may say, “If the body of an elephant and so on were to exist during dreams, then visual cognitions perceiving them would also be present while dreaming. This, however, is not correct. Since there is no visual cognition present in dreams for the person who remains afflicted by sleep, no external object, such as the body of an elephant perceptible to visual cognition, is seen during dreams. And thus in that state mental cognition alone exists. Therefore no external reality such as a visible form exists at all, and it’s only the forms of external objects appearing as aspects of the mind that are ineluctably grasped as external. {211} So as in dreams, it’s the same with waking life, wherein mere cognitions emerge with no external objects at all.”
To argue thus is to assert that, even if one grants that the dream analogy offered previously does not work, the dream example still establishes the existence of consciousness devoid of external reality. Here the Commentary states, “This is incorrect because it is impossible for mental cognitions to emerge in dreams.”[568] The meaning of this statement is that even if we grant the absence of visible forms in a dream, a mental cognition existing by virtue of its intrinsic characteristic yet devoid of such content would be impossible even in a dream. Candrakīrti is saying that the Cittamātra [analogy of a dream] marries two things — the nonexistence of external reality and the intrinsic existence of mental cognitions — and therefore it cannot be a viable analogy.

Just as for you no external objects or facts are born in a dream, no mental cognitions are intrinsically born either. Thus, just as during the waking state when one perceives a form three things converge — the eyes, the visible form, and mental faculty — in the same manner, when one registers an object in a dream, it is through the convergence of three things that a cognition would perceive that object. Also, just as the eyes as well as their object, the visible form, are not present in a dream state, the mind engendered by these two factors — namely, visual consciousness — also does not exist. So all three factors of perception — the eyes (organ), the visible forms (object), and the mental faculty (antecedent condition) — are fictitious. Just as for the eyes, these three factors lack intrinsically real birth for the ears and the rest too.

The Commentary says “the words ‘and the rest’ include from sound and auditory consciousness up to mental element and dharma element, as well as up to mental consciousness.”[569] So the four remaining physical sense organs (from the ears up to the body organ), the four remaining sense objects (from sound to texture), and the four remaining cognitions such as auditory consciousness — all of these remain fictitious. Even though they have no existence in the dream states, they appear as if they do, hence they are all false. The three factors of mental cognition do exist during the dream state, but they still remain false, for they appear to possess intrinsic reality when they do not.

Those who take the presence of sensory consciousness in a dream state as representing master Candrakīrti’s position and then go about refuting it reveal excessive crudeness in the use of their intellect. This is exactly like the saying “Letting the sun of refutation rise before the daybreak of opponent’s standpoint has arrived.”[570] So cast this kind of activity far away. Some Tibetans, while harboring pretensions of being great scholars, fail to comprehend even the rough outline of the positions of the great bodhisattvas {212} who are most learned in philosophical matters such as these. They thus relate to these masters as objects of continual accumulation of demerits and lead many others to such demerits. So please be mindful.

Bhāviveka responds to Cittamātra’s positing of its own standpoint, as outlined in the lines “Since there is no visual cognition in sleep . . .” (6.50), by demonstrating how the opponent’s analogy remains unestablished. He writes how in a dream state there do exist forms belonging to the class of mental objects, forms that are perceivable by mental consciousness, hence no instance of consciousness exists that has no object.[571]
In critiquing this [passage of Bhāviveka], Candrakīrti writes:
This too is incorrect because the existence of all three factors remains utterly impossible in the dream state. If you accept these [three factors in the dream state] for the sake of refuting the opponent’s standpoint, the dream analogy would in that case become meaningless. If the dream has content that is not fictitious, then it cannot illustrate that the actual referent, the things, have the character of being false.[572]
The meaning of the above statement is this: The intrinsic existence of objects, sense organs, and consciousnesses is totally impossible even in a dream state. It is therefore illogical to say that in a dream state there exists a mental-object form that is an entity distinct from consciousness. This is how one should [correctly] respond [to the Cittamātra proposition].

Now the existence of such a form is something that one must also accept; there is no contradiction in maintaining that such form exists in the dream state. So what becomes clear from the above exchange is that Bhāviveka accepts such a form [in dream state] to possess an intrinsic existence, while Candrakīrti’s passage argues against such existence. If the intrinsic existence of a mental-object form were to be accepted because doing so could help refute Cittamātra’s dream analogy that purports to demonstrate consciousness without external reality, this would then make the Madhyamaka’s own use of the dream analogy to illustrate the absence of true existence of things meaningless. For [according to Bhāviveka] dream would then have content that is not fictitious and would itself exist by virtue of its intrinsic characteristic. This would then make it impossible to use the analogy of a dream to help establish the falsehood of the things that are the actual referents of such an analogy. For as long as one does not reject intrinsic existence, it is impossible to relate the reason as well as the predicate to be proven to the example cited.[573] In view of all of these, [compared to what Bhāviveka has suggested] the response we have presented above — that everything perceived in a dream lacks intrinsic existence — is far more excellent. {213}

[Question:] According to our own system, are those forms that are perceived vividly in dreams accepted as mental-object forms or not?
[Reply:] Since there is no sensory consciousness in a dream state, what appear as five sense objects are in fact being perceived only by mental consciousness. So although one cannot posit the presence of the five sense objects such as visible form, the objects of dreams are mental-object forms. This is analogous to recognizing the vivid perceptions of skeletons in mental consciousness [in meditative states] as being mental-object forms. Out of the five types of mental objects, dream objects belong to the category of imputed forms.[574] Through this analysis we should understand the status of many other similar facts.

Having established that dreams have no reality on the grounds that what appear as the three factors in a dream — object, sense organ, and consciousness — are all unreal, Candrakīrti, to demonstrate the unreality of all the other phenomena that have yet to be established as lacking true existence, states that even during the waking state, all phenomena are proven to lack intrinsic existence.

This truth has been shown by the Tathāgata.
Also:
The beings of cyclic existence are dream-like:
there is no birth nor death for anyone,
and no “sentient,” “human,” or “life” can be found.
All these phenomena are like foam or a banana tree.
Statements such as these then become truly well-uttered insights.[575]

The phrase “no birth for anyone” and so on should be understood just as in the case above, where the negation is expressed with the phrase “do not exist in reality.” {214} These sutra passages demonstrating all phenomena as lacking existence in actual reality fit well with the Madhyamaka standpoint but not with that of Cittamātra. This is why Candrakīrti states that these [sutra citations] become truly well-uttered insights.

So here, with respect to people in the world, there are some who, though caught in ignorance’s sleep, are free from ordinary sleep in the sense of being awake. Nothing arises for them through its own essence, but within the dream-like perspective of ignorance’s sleep, all three factors [object, sense organ, and cognition] do exist [intrinsically for them]. Just as with the waking state, for someone who is asleep, as long as they remain in that state and until woken up, the three factors — objects, senses, and cognitions — of dream continue to exist. Yet, upon rousing from sleep, the three things of his dream become no more. So it is for the buddhas who, having awakened from, or eradicated, the sleep of delusion in its entirety, have actualized the ultimate expanse of reality; for them all three factors no longer exist at all. So consciousness in the absence of external reality [as postulated by Cittamātra] has no existence at all. This said, it is from within the perspective of a buddha’s seeing the way things really are (emptiness) that the three factors are not perceived. As for his seeing things in their diversity (conventional truth), although no perception arises from the buddha’s mind being infected by the propensities of ignorance, it does know these three factors through perceiving what appears to sentient beings whose minds are thus afflicted.

The cognition of one suffering from defective eyesight perceives floating hair because of his malady. Now for such cognition of the person, both visual perception and its object, the floating hair, are true. Yet from the perspective of those who have clear sight — those whose vision has not been affected by such a malady — {215} both these things, what appear as floating hair as well as the cognition that perceives it, are false; both are unborn. For without an object, even a merely appearing one, it would be difficult to posit the existence of cognition. However, this is exactly what [the opponent] will have to admit.
If one does not admit [the above consequence] and asserts that even without the cognized floating hair, intrinsically real cognition perceiving floating hair does exist for someone affected with myodesopsia, in that case, one should see floating hair even without the malady — the defect that makes the eyes see such things as floating hair. For they are both exactly equal insofar as nonexistence of their objects are concerned.
This argument is similar to the one where it’s demonstrated that if something arises from an intrinsically real other, it must then do so from everything else that is other. Here too, if something arises from an intrinsically real consciousness, the nonexistence of floating hair being equal, one cannot maintain that someone with an eye malady sees floating hair while the perception of floating hair does not arise in someone free of such a malady. This is because, with the implication that such a cognition [seeing floating hair] does not depend on the presence of the eye malady, we can force the consequence that these two will be totally unrelated to each other. So since it is not the case that cognition of floating hair arises without such an eye malady, no such intrinsically real cognition in the absence of external reality exists at all.

[Cittamātra:] “Granted, if the presence of objects such as the appearance of floating hair were the condition for the arising of the cognitions, such floating hair should appear to someone with no eye malady as well. This, however, is not the case.”
If asked, “What is it then?” “It is the maturation or the lack of maturation of the potencies, the propensities imprinted on one’s consciousness in the past, that causes the arising or nonarising of such cognitions. Thus the only person who will perceive floating hair is someone whose propensities imprinted by past perceptions of floating hair have come to mature.” {216}
Now if [you assert] that such perceptions as that of floating hair do not occur in those who have clear sight and have no eye malady because the potentiality or the propensity for perceiving floating hairs has not matured in such persons, then it’s not merely that such cognitions do not arise because the cognizable objects, the floating hairs, do not exist.

If there were an intrinsically existent potentiality, one might allow for the possibility of the occurrence or nonoccurrence of cognitions on the basis of the maturation or the absence of maturation of such a potentiality. But such inherently established potential does not exist, so this cognition [you assert to be intrinsically real] is not established.
“How is it that it is not established?” you might ask.
When you conceive of such potentiality, is it associated with the present cognition? Alternatively, is it connected with past cognition or future cognition? Now for what is already arisen — that is, present cognition — no such intrinsically real potentiality is possible; such a thing cannot exist. For what is not yet arisen, the future, too, there can be no such potentiality.
For instance, when one asserts potentiality in present cognition, the cognition and the potentiality would exist simultaneously. In that case, if the relationship between the potentiality and its bearer is represented by the sixth genitive case as the “cognition’s potency,” the two cannot be separate entities. Yet the potent cognition cannot be the same as the potentiality itself, for if it were, then the effect would have no cause distinct from the effect itself.[578] Furthermore, even when the sprout is born, the seed would persist without disintegrating. If, however, the relationship between the potentiality and its bearer is represented by the fifth ablative case as “cognition from potentiality,” it would be incorrect to assert that cognition already arisen emerges from a potentiality that is contemporaneous to it. For there would be the consequence that the effect would already exist at the time of the cause. So the so-called potentiality, the purported cause of the cognition, does not exist in the present cognition. {217}

Now if [you contend that] the potentiality exists in the not yet arisen cognition, there is the following analysis. When we relate the two terms in the phrase “potentiality of cognition,” potentiality is the qualified and cognition the qualifier. However, when it comes to the future or not yet arisen cognition, one cannot characterize it in positive terms as “cognition,” nor can it be characterized in negative terms as “noncognition” in the sense of something with intrinsic existence. Furthermore, since future cognition does not exist in the present as cognition, how can one qualify such potentiality in terms of “this potentiality is of this cognition”? This is not possible. So without the qualifier, the “cognition,” there can be no qualified, the “potentiality.” Otherwise, there would be the consequence that even a barren woman’s son could have such potential!

Thinking of a specific cognition that may emerge from its potentiality, [the opponent] might assert: “When we say, ‘This is the potentiality of this cognition, and it’s from this potentiality that this cognition will emerge,’ the two become qualifier and qualified. For example, in worldly convention, one uses imperatives like ‘Cook the rice’ and ‘Weave a cloth from this thread’ on the basis of imagining the cooked rice or woven cloth. In the Treasury of Abhidharma too, when the author writes, ‘The womb-born is threefold: the universal monarch and the two self-arisen ones,’[579] he is speaking of someone entering the womb who will [in the future] become a universal monarch. So here, too, we are speaking of potentiality of cognition because we are thinking of the consciousness that will emerge.”

[Response:] This rejoinder too is pointless. If something does have existence on occasion, then at some point in time, such an effect will come into being. In contrast, things that will never come into being — the son of a barren woman or unconditioned space, for example — will come into being neither in the present nor at any subsequent point in time. So although one might accept the occurrence of cognition if intrinsically real potencies do exist, {218} given that no such intrinsically real future cognition exists at any time, the potentiality that produces such cognition does not exist at all. Therefore, just like the son of a barren woman, since there is now no intrinsically real potential producing cognition, there will be no occurrence of intrinsically real cognition.

In numerous instances of Madhyamaka’s refutation of the sprout arising by virtue of its own characteristic, consequences like the following are leveled [at the opponent]: “If the sprout can arise even though it does not exist at the time of its seed, then such things as the horn of a rabbit too could come into being.” The significance of hurling such extreme absurd consequences is this: An intrinsically existing sprout, if it lacks existence at any particular point of time, would have no existence at all at any time. Such a sprout would thus be indistinguishable from something with no existence whatsoever. This is the point. It’s patently not the case that, in general, if the sprout can arise even though it is not present at the time of its cause, then the horn of a rabbit can also come into being. Through this reasoning, such examples as the cooked rice are explained. For if things do come into being through their intrinsic natures then potential things such as cooked rice would become totally nonexistent.

[Reply:] This is exactly why the sublime ones taught that cognitions have no intrinsic or true existence. In the Commentary, Candrakīrti states that relational existents like “long and short,” “here and there,” and so on exist as imputed constructs and that they lack existence through intrinsic nature.[580] Therefore one should understand that it is not existence in general that is being negated in relation to these things; rather it is their intrinsic existence that is being rejected. This distinction must be understood.
Now if you [Cittamātra] speak in such terms [of relationality], you are then actually following our discourse.[581] In short, such potentiality does not exist even in the future cognition.

{219} If it is from the maturing of potentiality already past — such as a specific potentiality imprinted on foundation consciousness by cognition as it was ceasing, a potentiality for the production of a commensurate effect — that future consciousness arises, then an intrinsically distinct effect will have emerged from a potential that is an intrinsically extraneous cause. Why is this so? Since the moments of this continuum emerge in a sequence, the preceding and subsequent members in the continuum would for you be alien to each other by virtue of their own intrinsic natures.
The root for the Sanskrit word for a continuum is tan, and it is stated “continuum refers to ‘extend,’”[582] and by applying an affix to this verbal root, there emerges the sense of “transmitting,” hence “continuum” (tantra). So through the formation of a continuum, causes and effects operate in a related sequence like the flow of a stream, and the continuity of birth and death remains without any intervals of disruption. It is just such a momentary phenomenon, composed of three temporal stages and persisting from past to future, that is called continuum.[583] Since the individual moments are its constitutive parts, the continuum itself is a whole, the bearer of the parts, and not merely the absence of interruption between the preceding and subsequent moments. Furthermore, since the continuum encompasses all its parts, the individual moments within the continuum are referred to as “moments of the continuum.” Similarly, because the constituents or the parts of the continuum belong to the continuum, the continuum is referred to also as the “appropriator of these members.” A “vase,” for example, is the appropriator of the lip, neck, and so on of that vase.
According to the opponent, such preceding and subsequent moments [in a continuum] are distinct from each other, and their distinctness exists by virtue of their intrinsic natures. This means that from a potentiality that is intrinsically distinct can emerge something that is intrinsically separate from it. Now if you, the opponent, were to think: “Since I do accept this consequence, there is no fault here,” [we would say] then anything and everything other than itself could emerge from anything.

You may say that though these individual moments in a continuum — in which the successive moments function in a temporal sequence — are distinct from each other by virtue of their intrinsic nature, these sequential moments have no separate continua. They all share a single continuum. So therefore the objection that everything can originate from everything else does not apply. This assertion that the successive moments share a single continuum is also the core of the opponent’s rebuttal against Madhyamaka refutation of arising from other.[584]
[Reply:] It may be that if a single shared continuum can be established for two temporally sequential moments that exist as intrinsically separate entities, {220} the fault charged might not hold. But since existence of such a shared single continuum has not been established, this thesis is unproven. How is this so? For such a single shared continuum is untenable for preceding and subsequent moments of things that are different from each other through intrinsic characteristics. For example, when one speaks of the attributes of Maitreya and Upagupta, who are distinct persons, they cannot belong to a single shared continuum. Similarly, intrinsically separate temporally sequential moments could not logically be part of a single shared continuum.
When understood thus, we can see that the essential point here is how the opponent’s defense — that a rice seed and its sprout share the same continuum but not a rice seed and a barley sprout so the absurd consequence that “everything can originate from everything else” will not ensue — fails to rebuff our objections precisely because the opponent asserts intrinsic separateness of things. It’s crystal clear that the objection is not against mere otherness. So some who use the approach of knocking over the first domino,[585] failing to understand that what is being negated is being qualified in terms of the phrase “intrinsically existing other,” they leave aside Candrakīrti’s own explanation of how the opponent cannot rebuff our objection and conjure their own fantasy explanation, something Candrakīrti hasn’t stated at all. To do this is to sully Candrakīrti’s perfect philosophical system.

The arising of visual perception or consciousness takes place on the basis of its own potentiality, which exists in the form of an imprint placed on the foundation consciousness, a potentiality that has been imprinted by another consciousness, wholly and at once, while it is ceasing. {221} It is from the maturing of such potentiality that an eye consciousness that resembles a previous visual cognition later arises. And this uninterrupted continuum of potentiality, which is the basis of such eye consciousness, is what is termed by worldly people because of their ignorance as “the physical eye organ.”[586] In actuality, no eye organ exists that is distinct from consciousness. One can extend this point to the other physical sense organs as well.
In this view, the propensity that is the cause for the arising of eye consciousness is its causal condition, while the eye faculty is its dominant condition. The statement made here of the eye faculty being an immediate cause of visual cognition should be understood in relation not to just any eye faculty but to those where the propensities for the arising of visual cognition have matured. In connection with this, Differentiation of the Middle and Extremes says:
Perceptions of objects, of sentience, and of self —
cognitions perceiving these do arise,
yet no external objects exist.[587]
The statement that perceptions of objects (form and so on) and sentience (the five sense faculties) do arise is a reference to foundation consciousness. The master Sthiramati, in commenting on this passage, also explains the physical sense organs as objects of foundation consciousness.[588] So according to the Cittamātra school, which accepts foundation consciousness, what appears as physical sense faculties to foundation consciousness is the eye organ and so on.
Having thus shown how there exist no faculties of the eyes and so on separate from consciousness, Cittamātra states the following to demonstrate that even material forms do not exist as separate from consciousness:

But no external reality exists apart from consciousness.
Alternatively, in dreams, where no external forms are present, mind assuming their aspects such as of forms, sounds, and so on arises from their ripened imprints or potentiality. So just as in dreams, in waking states too, the mind exists with no external reality. {222}

Since without sight, mental cognitions that perceive blue and so on occur in a dream, why would such a perception not arise from its ripened potential for an awake blind person without eyes? Why wouldn’t it arise exactly as it would in someone with unimpaired sight? For insofar as the eye organ is absent, both the dream state [of a sighted person] and the waking state of a blind person are exactly the same. The force of the argument stems from the fact that if intrinsically real cognitions can arise without any external reality such as visible form, then there should be no difference at all between dream and waking states.
The opponent might respond: The reason why mental cognition perceiving forms and so forth with clarity does not arise for a blind person — along the lines experienced in a dream [by the sighted] — is not due to the absence of eyes. If asked, “What then is the reason,” the opponent would say it is because the potential for the occurrence of such mental cognition has not yet matured. Therefore, for someone in whom such a potential has matured, associated mental cognition emerges. Here too, due to the condition of sleep, such mental cognition exists only in dreams, not in the waking state.

For if, according to you, there is the ripening of potentiality for the sixth consciousness in dreams but not in an awake blind person, then just as there is no ripening of potentiality of the sixth consciousness — such as those to which forms and so on appear clearly — for the blind, why can’t one say that it does not exist in dreams either? Not to do so would be logical.
Here too, the argument trades upon [the opponent’s assumption of intrinsic existence], which is the object to be negated. Now if you [the opponent] are going to engage in discourse by relying on mere words with no supporting reasons, we too can be content by leaving it at what we have already stated so far. Furthermore, just like with the blind person, there is no active functioning of the sense organ — the basis of cognition — in the case of seeing experienced during a dream. So the cognition in that dream state cannot be a mental cognition that has emerged from the maturation of a potentiality associated with the perceptual pattern of visual cognition that, in turn, arose in dependence on a potentiality called the eye organ. {223}

So just as eyelessness is not a cause in an awake blind person for such ripening of the propensity for perceiving external objects, in dreams too, sleep is not the cause for the maturation of the propensities for perceiving external objects in dreams. For if intrinsically real cognition can arise without external reality, such cognition would not depend upon the maturing of propensities at all. So, since it is from unreal propensities that unreal cognitions perceiving dream objects arise, you, the opponent, must concede that even in a dream, just as is the case with waking states, dream sight and its objects, such as forms and so on, are causes for false subjects.
The Commentary states in this context, “When an object is experienced in a dream, it is perceived in terms of the convergence of three factors.”[589] Again he declares that in a dream state no sense objects or eye faculty, or any visual cognition produced by these two, exists.[590] These statements indicate that, for Candrakīrti, all three factors — sense organ, object, and mental faculty — associated with the five sense perceptions such as visual perception are perceived within the perspective of the person who is actually dreaming. So [these statements] indicate that Candrakīrti does accept the existence of dream eyes, dream eye perception, and dream objects. This is not to say that he admits they exist as eyes and so forth in actuality. This is analogous to the case where even though one might accept the presence of magically conjured horses, elephants, and humans, doing so in no way entails admitting that such things are actually horses, elephants, and humans.

Let me illustrate these rebuttals by way of few examples. For instance, Madhyamaka presents the following argument:
(Subject) The three factors (object, sense faculty, and consciousness) of the waking state
(Probandum) are empty of intrinsic existence
(Reason) because they are perceived,
(Exemplification) like, for example, a dream.
In response, Cittamātra presents the following:
1. Cognition of waking state
is devoid of external reality
because it is a cognition,
like, for example, dream consciousness.
2. The objects perceived during the waking state
are false
because they are objects,
like, for example, dream objects.
3. Likewise, if there exists no dependent nature — which is
the basis for the afflicted and the enlightened classes of
phenomena — then phenomena of both the afflicted and
enlightened classes will have no existence. This is because
they will have no basis, like a cloak made of turtle hair.
“Likewise, we will also explain this by means of the analogy of eyes infected with myodesopsia.”[591] Their rejoinders are of this sort.

As for the first two syllogisms [of Cittamātra], since their exemplifications remain unestablished, the reasons they offer remain the same as their theses. {224} This is because in a dream state, there do exist mental object-forms that are of a different nature from mental consciousness. With respect to the third argument, the [opponent’s] intention is to prove the existence of an intrinsically real basis for the afflicted and unafflicted classes of phenomena. If the assertion is that no such basis will exist, the reason will be unestablished. If, however, the intended basis is something with intrinsic reality, then there will be no entailment.

Not only is refuting the Cittamātra standpoint unharmed by reason, it’s not possible for this refutation to be invalidated by the scriptures either. This is because, insofar as their own standpoint is concerned, the fully awakened buddhas never taught in any of the scriptures that real entities exist. In fact, the Descent into Laṅkā Sutra states:
The three worlds are mere imputations;
no entities exist by virtue of their essence.
What are in fact imputed things,
these logicians conceive to be real.
There is no matter (rūpa), no consciousness;
there is foundation consciousness, no entity.

The first line states that the three worlds exist as mere imputations of the mind, with the second line explaining what this means. Since the explanation is offered in terms of the absence of entities existing by virtue of their own essences, the scripture is not stating that nothing exists at all. Rather it is the entities established through their essence that have no existence, and it is the logicians who have failed to find suchness who assert what are mere imputations of the mind have existence by virtue of their essence. This is explained in the last two lines that contain the word “construct.” In this way, the absence of entities existing by virtue of their essences is presented in general. To present this point in specific terms, the Sanskrit term rūpa refers to both “matter” as well as to “intrinsic nature,” and here it should be understood to mean “matter.” This is because it is meant to contrast with the word paired with it, “consciousness.” The word “entity” in the phrase “no entity” refers to “essence” [not to things], for the absence of things such as cognitions and material objects was already stated. It refers to the “essence” that is rejected in contexts such as the negation of the true existence of things and other similar negations. [Logicians] are zombie-like in that they lack a mind capable of probing suchness. In brief, this scriptural citation refutes the view that dependent phenomena of the three realms possess intrinsic existence. {225}

The opponent might respond: “These scriptural citations present how one, the dependent, is essentially empty of the other, the imputed — namely, the substantive duality of subject and object. So these citations do not undermine [our Cittamātra standpoint].”
[Reply:] Such an emptiness is not suited to be the perfect emptiness. The Descent into Laṅkā, for example, says:
O Mahāmati, the emptiness of one being absent in another is the most inferior among all forms of emptiness.[593]
The Commentary explains:
The assertion that because an ox is empty of being a horse, it has no existence as such is illogical; for the ox still exists by virtue of its own essence for you. We would respond to you in terms such as this.[594]

In place of the phrase “exists by virtue of its own essence” Naktso translates “has its own essence,” which reads better.
Here is how this emptiness of “one being absent in the other” is captured by the above analogy. The Buddha taught emptiness in terms of the absence of intrinsic existence to help extinguish sentient beings’ beginningless clinging to entities such as form as possessing true existence. And for this it is necessary to demonstrate how dependent phenomena — perceived in terms of form and so on — do not have true existence. So when, instead of showing this, Cittamātra asserts that the dependent does not exist in terms of subject-object duality, this is like giving the ox’s nonexistence as a horse as proof of its nonexistence!

Therefore there is no difference at all between Madhyamaka and Cittamātra when it comes to identifying what is the basis for clinging by sentient beings. It is those very phenomena that are perceived as external or internal. The same is true of the purpose of demonstrating that these phenomena are empty — to help extinguish clinging to those bases. Where they diverge is on what constitutes such clinging. For Cittamātra clinging consists of grasping at subject-object duality, the perception that the dichotomy of outer versus inner represents a real separation. The antidote, says Cittamātra, is to take the perceived dependent phenomenon itself as the basis and to negate its existence in terms of a substantial subject-object duality. In that case, the basis of negation [say a blue object] is negated as being [substantially distinct from its perception] the object of negation, in the sense of one being the other. For Madhyamaka, in contrast, clinging consists of grasping at the apparent world as having true existence rather than as something posited by conventional cognition. So, for its antidote, the apparent world itself is taken as the basis and is revealed to not possess true existence. This too is a case where the basis of negation is negated as the object of negation in the sense of one being the other. For when sentient beings cling, they do so by grasping at the thing itself in terms of what is to be negated, not in terms of the negation of the presence of some extraneous fact over and above the thing. With emptiness too, what needs to be demonstrated is this: that things are empty of that very mode of existence as conceived by the sentient beings. {226}

Some, viewing the emptiness of true existence of everyday perceived objects as a kind of annihilationism, forsake it and take something else as the basis, and then instead of demonstrating how that thing is not being what is to be negated, they seek to show how the thing is devoid of some extraneous thing. This is not the approach of either Madhyamaka or Cittamātra. By searching within yourself, you should examine whether such a manner of grasping exists in the beginningless clinging of sentient beings. It appears that we are in an era when what the glorious Dharmakīrti said has come true, something discerning individuals should remain cognizant of:
For this Buddha’s way too, there are some who object.
So the darkness of evil pervades everywhere.[595]

In the Meeting of Father and Son Sutra, which is cited in the Commentary to present the absence of intrinsic existence of the twenty-two faculties, it states:
They are thus merely imputed as labels. On the ultimate level, no eye faculty is found. . . . Likewise, all phenomena are imperceptible in terms of their essence.[596]
Thus the scriptures state that phenomena are nominal designations alone and, ultimately, there are no eyes and no faculties. [The above citation] indicates how, when qualifying what is to be negated, these two [“ultimately” and “in terms of their essence”] are equivalents, and also how all of our own positions need to be posited from the standpoint of mere nominal designations. Furthermore, Candrakīrti makes the statement that “If the objects of lovemaking in dreams cannot be found by the person even within the dream state itself, what need is there to speak of not finding them while awake.” There are many such similar statements [of Candrakīrti]. Therefore those who assert that, for Candrakīrti, there is no difference at all between a dream person and an awake person in both being an actual person are totally wrong. For Candrakīrti has stated that even in the dream state itself, the individuals that one dreams of making love to cannot be found as actual persons. Nonetheless, one must admit that they can be found as actual persons in the waking state. Therefore those who claim that the existence of sensory cognitions such as visual perceptions during the dream state is the standpoint of this tradition [of Candrakīrti] are in grave error.
In view of all the above, the endeavor of the Cittamātras to lead people to their tenets, despite lacking the competence of intellect to realize the ultimate and definitive truth, is something that deserves only to be discarded. {227}

The opponent might entertain the following thought: If no intrinsically real cognition perceiving form, sound, and so forth exists in the absence of external reality, then how is it possible for the yogis who, on the basis of their guru’s instruction, see the ground around themselves as filled with skeletons? Therefore, although such skeletons do not exist, intrinsically real cognition [perceiving them] must have existence.
Even in this case of a yogi who meditates on foulness of his body in accordance with his master’s instruction and sees the ground around himself as filled with skeletons, here too, all three factors — the object, the sense faculty, and the cognition — must be seen as devoid of intrinsic arising. This meditative concentration is thus described in the sutras as attending to a fictitious object, something that is unreal.

However, if the cognition that perceives skeletons were to exist intrinsically, what it perceives too would similarly possess intrinsic existence. In that case, such cognition would be engaging with what is actually true in reality. This is something you, the opponent, would be compelled to admit. If such were the case, this consequence would follow: Just as when one person watches a performance such as a play, and sense perception bearing the aspect of the performance arises from directing his eyes to that object, the same objects of sense perception would be perceived by other spectators as well. In the same manner, for you, just as the yogi sees objects of foulness meditation, when other persons who are not yogis direct their mind to the object, the perceived skeletons, with the wish to see such objects, they too should cognize the skeletons. This would be just like the perception of blue and so on they experience.

Furthermore, this means this foulness meditation is not attending to fictitious objects. {228} The point of drawing equivalence between yogis and non-yogis is this: if cognition existed intrinsically, one could then negate its dependence on the meditation that accords with the instruction [on cultivating the perception of] skeletons.
We should also know how to respond in a similar manner to the citation of other examples, such as an illusion, the reflection of a face in a mirror, and so on, [recognizing how] the same is true of someone with an eye disease. In the case of a preta’s perception of a river as a stream of pus, too, we should understand this phenomenon similarly.

Now, with respect to the five mental-object forms, these are not metaphysical constructs of the Buddhist essentialists;[597] they are mentioned in the sutras, and Candrakīrti accepts them within his own system as well. So this vivid appearance of skeletons being perceived even though none exists must be considered a kind of a form like a mirror image. Since it is perceived only by mental cognition, however, it cannot be a visible form like the reflection of a face in a mirror. It also cannot be any of the remaining nine material forms [sound, smell, taste, and texture, plus the five sense organs]. Hence the occurrence of its name “imputed mental-object form.” The appearance of floating hairs being perceived by visual cognition, however, is a visible form just like the reflection of a face in a mirror. As for a hungry ghost’s perception of a flowing stream as pus and blood, it too must be accepted to be a visible form since it is perceived by their eye consciousness.

Summary of the Great Vehicle does not clarify what that “single thing” is and how it is perceived differently. Asvabhāva, however, gives the following explanation in his Interspersed Explanation [of the Summary of the Great Vehicle]:
In relation to that thing, a flowing stream, hungry ghosts, owing to the fruitional effects of their karma, see it as full of pus and blood. In relation to the same thing, animals like fish live in it, perceiving it as their habitat, while humans, considering it to be a sweet, clear, and cool water, clean themselves with it, drink it, and immerse themselves in it. Celestial beings abiding in the meditative attainment of Infinite Space perceive it as space, for they have dismantled all perceptions of materiality.[599]

Here, one might raise the following question: “The perceptions of these sentient beings are valid conventional cognitions.

[Reply:] Now if the question raised is this: “To understand the meaning of the text in the above terms would clearly render valid cognitions to be unreliable. Since this is unacceptable, how should one understand the meaning of the text?” If this is indeed the question, it is that of a discerning mind. If, on the other hand, one takes the above understanding to be the actual meaning of the text and one goes on to assert that valid cognitions cannot be established with any reliability, this would be utterly untenable. Such a person will not be able to posit a single thing and say, “I know this.” He will thus be denigrating all instances of valid cognitions.
“How then should we understand the text?” one might ask. To explain this, let me start with an analogy. Say a person who has mastered the mantra spell for not being burned when touching a burning red metal ball picks up such a metal ball with his bare hands. When he does so, his tactile sense does perceive the texture of that metal ball, but that texture is not experienced as extremely hot and burning. This is because his hand has been washed with water enchanted by mantra spells and other such conditions. To those who do not possess the mantra spells, the texture of that metal ball will be extremely hot and burning. Now both the burning and the non-burning textures will have to be accepted as textures of that single metal ball. It is also not the case that what is perceived by one type of tactile sensation is being affirmed by the other as well. So even though both sensations are accepted as valid, it is not that what is perceived by one is negated by the other.

Likewise, one dimension of that stream at the site where a river flows exists as pus and blood to the hungry ghosts owing to the power of their karma, while the stream arises for humans, owing to their karma, not as pus and blood but as water for drinking or washing. Now both [the pus and blood as well as the water] are dimensions of one and the same stream; at the same time, the facts affirmed by the perceptions of hungry ghosts and human beings are two distinct things. It is also not the case that what is established by one is somehow being affirmed by the other as something wholly different.

Similarly, the Friendly Letter states:
For hungry ghosts, the moon is hot in the fall,
and in winter, even the sun is cold.[600]
So due to the power of their past karma, hungry ghosts experience the light of the moon in the fall as extremely hot, while in the winter even the temperature of the sun manifests as freezing. Yet there is no contradiction in human beings experiencing sensations of coolness and heat in relation, respectively, to the rays of the moon and sun. It is also not the case that one and the same sensation perceived as cold by one instance of valid cognition is perceived as heat by another instance of valid cognition. However, since both of these temperatures reflect the sensory experience of one and the same sun or moon, {230} the expression “one thing” is used. So, without finely analyzing the intended meaning of the text, do not become complacent with a premature conclusion when some rough understanding happens to arise in you.

To summarize the points explained extensively above, in brief, this is the point: just as there is [for you, Cittamātra] no intrinsically real cognizable object, likewise understand that there is no cognizing mind arisen through its essential nature either bearing the appearances of such objects.
Here Candrakīrti demonstrates that, when it comes to their lack of intrinsic existence, there can be no difference between the cognizing mind and its object of cognition. In light of this, statements such as “Since there is no floating hair, there is no cognition that perceives it” and “Since there is no apprehended object of the mind that perceives magically manifested horses and elephants, the mind that apprehends such things does not exist either” cannot be the position of the master Candrakīrti at all.

So as stated in these lines, if something cannot be said to be known by a cognition, it cannot be characterized as an object of knowledge. Similarly, if a cognizing mind cannot be shown to know some kind of object, it cannot be characterized even as a form of cognition. Without the cognized, there can be no consciousness. Given that cognition and the cognized are defined mutually, Nāgārjuna states that you, the Buddha, taught that both lack intrinsic existence. This indicates that the position of the noble Nāgārjuna is to not differentiate between these two — cognition and cognized — on either level of the two truths when it comes to their existence or nonexistence.

If, as you Cittamātra assert, this entity dependent nature — which is free of duality and is devoid of external reality as an object and devoid of a subject that is distinct from such object — exists, we will then ask, “By what means of knowing is the existence of this dependent nature known?”
To assert that one and the same cognition apprehends itself would be untenable. For it would be a contradiction to speak of something acting upon itself. Here are some analogies: The blade of a sword cannot cut itself; the tip of one’s nail cannot touch itself; no matter how expertly trained and flexible, an acrobat cannot sit astride his own shoulders; fire does not burn itself; and the eyes do not look at themselves. I will later discuss a unique explanation according to another source as to why cognition cannot apprehend itself.[605] {232}

According to the opponent, cognition cannot be perceived by a separate cognition that is essentially distinct from it, for this would contradict their own Cittamātra tenet. For example, the following point is expressed in the treatises of Cittamātra:
If, when a transformation of the base into a resultant stage has not yet been achieved, a consciousness with a separate reality can be the appearing object of another consciousness, then the assertion of consciousness-only will be undermined.[606]
So for Cittamātra, there can be no such mode of apprehension whatsoever. Thus when Madhyamaka utters the challenge “Without observing it by cognition, you cannot say it exists,” Cittamātra might respond: “Yes, it is true that consciousness is not apprehended by a cognition that has a different reality; but there is self-cognition. And it is this reflexive awareness alone that apprehends dependent nature; so dependent nature does exist.”
Now if the opponent offers this defense, [the Mādhyamika would respond]: Cognition that is aware of itself is not established.
To present briefly sources for the opponent’s thesis — namely, the Cittamātra view on reflexive awareness — Blaze of Reasoning says that Cittamātra asserts that consciousness appears as twofold: self-perceiving and object-perceiving. The dimension of consciousness perceiving objects assumes aspects of external reality and becomes an object of the cognition perceiving itself. Responding to this [thesis],

Bhāviveka writes:
What kind of mind is perceived
apart from the perceiving of objects?[607]
Thus Bhāviveka says that he sees no cognition [supposedly] perceiving itself that is separate from cognitions perceiving objects.
Thus Cittamātra asserts an inward-directed cognition that is free of all dualistic perceptions and maintains this to be a reflexive awareness in that it is self-cognizing. This said, they maintain that there is no dualistic perception of knower and the known vis-à-vis such cognition.

When Cittamātra establishes the dependent nature to be devoid of the imputed nature (a substantial duality of subject and object), if cognition (the dependent nature) is first affirmed by a reflexive awareness free of dualistic perceptions, then such a basis could be realized in terms of the absence of subject-object duality. If, on the other hand, such a basis is not first established by reflexive awareness, then one cannot take it as the basis and establish it as empty of the imputed nature. This is what Cittamātra says. Hence Jñānagarbha presents the argument that, according to you Cittamātra, the dependent nature must be established by its evidence, which is the nondual reflexive awareness. {233} However, this [reflexive awareness] remains unestablished.
Some claim that in refuting this kind of reflexive awareness, Jñānagarbha is dismissing yogic reflexive gnosis wherein suchness is perceived within each unique individual experience, and that he is also rejecting reflexivity in the conventional sense indicated when a person utters statements such as “I am aware of myself.” These are simply foolish talk.

Subscribing to the Sautrāntika view, some — that is, Cittamātra — present the following to prove reflexive awareness. The instant a flame appears, it simultaneously illuminates both itself as well as objects such as a vase; it does not illuminate these sequentially. Similarly, when one utters the word “vase,” it engenders [awareness of] both the sound of the word and the vase that is the referent of that word. Consciousness too, when it arises, is aware of both itself as well as its object; it does not become aware of the two in sequence. Therefore reflexive awareness is something that definitely exists. So they claim.

Furthermore, they assert, even those who do not yet accept reflexive awareness will have no choice but to admit its existence. For if one does not accept it, there can be no subsequent recollection of an object in terms of “I have seen this” or recollection of the subjective experience of seeing that object in terms of “I have seen this.” Why is this so? It is impossible to have a recollection of something that has not been experienced. Remembering is thus a subjective experience that has as its object something that was previously experienced. According to you who deny reflexive awareness, they say, since the previous cognition such as the perception of a blue object was never experienced in its own time, there can be no subsequent recollection of it.

This argument seeks to prove the existence of a prior experience of perceiving a blue object by using its subsequent recollection as the logical reason. Otherwise, if the argument were formulated as “There exists for the previous perception of a blue object a reflexive awareness that experienced it,” no suitable example could be found that could be established for the other party [in the debate]. So they don’t formulate the proof statement that way. Once it’s established that there is a subjective experience of perceiving a blue object, then such an experience can be determined to be either self-cognition or cognition by other. The first alternative is not acceptable to you [who reject self-cognition], while the second is something that our standpoint has ruled out. In this way, the generality “being experienced” comes to be untenable for you, which means, for you, even experience itself would become impossible. This is how Cittamātra argues against [their opponent]. In fact, this is their best argument to prove reflexive awareness.

[To continue,] now it is incorrect to assert that the previous perception of a blue object is experienced by some separate cognition. {234} If such were the case, two problematic consequences would follow. First, there would be the problem of infinite regress. For if the cognition explicitly perceiving a blue object is established by another subsequent cognition, the question arises: Does that cognition require another separate cognition as its cognizer? If it does not, then the previous cognition too should not require this [subsequent cognizer]. And if it does require another separate cognition, it too would require another one and so on, ad infinitum. Such an endless chain incurs the flaw that there will be no experience of the first instance of perception of a blue object.

The second consequence is that cognition will not positively determine[609] other objects. If the preceding cognition were to be perceived by the subsequent cognition, the latter would then not perceive other objects such as form, sound, and so on, for the subsequent cognition would not direct [its focus] to other objects. This is because the entire continuum of cognition — all the moments within a stream — will have their preceding moments as their objects. There is no problem of the logical entailment not holding here. For if the preceding cognitions are perceived by the subsequent cognitions, it is on the basis of taking the preceding cognition as an appearing object that subsequent cognition has to arise. In that case, it will not let go of the inner objective condition, which is more proximal, to take on an external object, which is more distant.

Now you might offer the following rejoinder: the subsequent blue-perceiving cognition that cognizes the preceding blue-perceiving cognition arises simultaneously with another instance of cognition perceiving a blue object, so there is thus no problem of cognition not moving to other [external] objects. If you assert this, you will incur the consequence of two separate continua of eye consciousness belonging to the same class of consciousness arising simultaneously in one and the same person. If you admit this, you would be contradicting the scriptural statement: “Sentient beings possess singular or separate individual continua for [each class of] consciousness.”[610]

The Commentary says on this point:
Just as a hundred petals of a blue lotus are pierced [by a single shot of an arrow], consciousnesses arise serially even though it seems as if they engage simultaneously.[611]
Jayānanda’s Explanation of the Commentary takes this to be a response to a point being raised about whether all five sensory cognitions — perceiving all five sense objects, the dancer’s faces, their songs, and so on — can arise simultaneously. And the response, according to the Explanation, is that although the different classes of consciousness arise in a sequence, given the speed of their engagement, it feels as if they all arise at the same time.[612] This is totally wrong. Those who argue for reflexive awareness — Sautrāntika and Cittamātra, for instance — understand the meaning of the sutra statement that “sentient beings possess singular continua for [each class of] consciousness” in terms of how no two continua of consciousness of the same class can arise simultaneously in a single person. This is as stated in the following in [Dharmakīrti’s] Exposition of Valid Cognition:
Potencies [of consciousness] are determined
in terms of their similar classes.[613]
{235} It’s definitely not the case that they [Sautrāntika and Cittamātra] understand the sutra statement to suggest that consciousnesses belonging to different classes cannot arise simultaneously in a single person.

Some Tibetans assert that when asked, “When you look at a colorful brocade, do the numerous cognitions perceiving different colors — white, red, and so on — arise simultaneously?” one should respond: “Although these distinct cognitions arise sequentially, they appear to arise at the same time.” Those who say this fail to comprehend that the sutra statement about “the continuum of consciousness being singular” is intended to mean [the nonoccurrence of multiple streams of] primary consciousness belonging to the same class. By displaying their ignorance of the simple fact that visual cognition perceives multiple colors [simultaneously], they appear to be unable even to comprehend visual perception of multicolored object.

In light of these considerations, it seems we need to interpret [Candrakīrti’s passage together with his analogy] as a response to the objection pertaining to the simultaneous arising of [multiple streams of] consciousness belonging to the same class — with his response being that “although they arise serially, consciousnesses appear as if they are simultaneous because of their speed.” This said, as stated in Exposition of Valid Cognition,[614] the two schools [Sautrāntika and Cittamātra] that argue for reflexive awareness actually reject the fast speed of cognitive engagement as being a cause for the illusion of simultaneity. It is therefore difficult to state this as being the position of those two schools. Perhaps the problem here stems from some corruption in the Indian text [of Candrakīrti’s Commentary]. Whatever the case, this is a matter requiring further investigation by those of discerning intellect.
In brief, [Cittamātra concludes that] since one must avoid the above two flaws — that of infinite regress and that of [subsequent cognition] not perceiving other objects — others will have no choice but to accept reflexive awareness without any reservation. It is thus on the basis of subsequent recollection of both the object and its subjective experience that Cittamātra adduces the experiencing of both the object and subject in the very moment one perceives a blue object. Now once they succeed in establishing such self-cognizing reflexive awareness, they believe, then the existence of their dependent nature will be affirmed by such reflexive awareness. This is why, when the Mādhyamika asks the question “By what means is its existence known?” (6.72c), Cittamātra presents this [proof of reflexive awareness] as their response.

If, however, your assertion is within the context of worldly convention, in that case, there is no such recollection that is the effect of reflexive awareness. Why is that so, you may ask. Just as, if there is fire, smoke can be perceived as its effect, similarly, if reflexive awareness does exist, one can then establish its causal relations, such as the occurrence of subsequent recollection. In which case, one can ascertain self-cognizing awareness on the basis of subsequent recollection. However, since such reflexive awareness remains still unestablished for the other party, how can there be recollection — the supposed effect of self-cognition — which is thought to emerge through a necessary causal relation with reflexive awareness? That there can be no proof in the absence of a necessary causal relation is illustrated by the way one cannot infer the presence of the jewel water crystal from the mere presence of a body of water, and the way one cannot infer the presence of a magnifying glass from the presence of fire. For a body of water can appear from rain and so on, and similarly, fire can appear from the rubbing of dry sticks. I will explain later, how, likewise, recollections can occur according to our own system without the existence of such reflexive awareness.[615]

To this refutation, Cittamātra might respond as follows. We do not infer reflexive awareness on the premise of establishing a causal connection between subsequent recollection and reflexive awareness in the manner of [inferring] fire from smoke. Rather, as stated before, we first infer the existence of the experiencing of the prior cognition on the basis of its subsequent recollection. Furthermore, we demonstrate how such an experience must be either self-cognized or other-cognized, for there is no third possibility. In this way, a conclusion is drawn that cognitions are self-experienced.
This is what the opponent might contend, but being experienced by cognition need not in fact be limited to these two modes as defined by Sautrāntika and Cittamātra. For example, although the light of an oil lamp does not illuminate itself, this does not negate it being an illumination. Similarly, although cognition does not experience itself in the manner defined by the opponent, this does not negate its experience per se. If you, Cittamātra, say that the light of an oil lamp illuminates itself, in that case darkness must conceal itself. And if you admit this too, then just as a vase is concealed by darkness, then according to you, darkness would be obscured by darkness too.

Even if [for the sake of argument] we were to let go of our critical examination and allow reflexive awareness and its awareness of objects as well, {237} for you, it would still be illogical for memory to recall [both] object and its subjective experience. This is because you maintain subsequent recollection and prior cognition of objects to be distinct by virtue of their intrinsic natures. Upagupta’s mind, for example, does not remember Maitreya’s reflexive awareness or his experience of perceiving objects for the simple reason that he has no knowledge of these. Such recollection cannot occur in someone who does not possess [associated] prior cognition. This would be like the recollection of someone with no prior knowledge or experience. The two being intrinsically different, it means that even the subsequent cognitions within the same mental continuum would not have experienced prior cognition and its object; so there cannot be their recollection. If you, Cittamātra, think, “Recollection does exist because those that belong to a single continuum exist as cause and effects,” this too would be untenable. For this reasoning, “Because they exist intrinsically as other,” destroys as well all other aspects [of the purported proof], such as belonging to shared single continuum, being cause and effect, and so on. This is something that has already been explained extensively above in the context of the line “Qualities of Maitreya and Upagupta” (6.61a).

[Question:] According to you who do not accept reflexive awareness, how does recollection occur then?
[Response:] We already explained above how, in our system, there is no such recollection that is intrinsically extraneous to the prior experience of the object. I have also already stated (6.32) how in ordinary people there does not exist grasping at intrinsic separateness of things that are causes and effects within a single shared material continuum, like a seed and a sprout. Therefore even here, with respect to the prior cognition of an object and its subsequent recollection too — which are cause and effect — there is no grasping at intrinsically established separateness of the two insofar as the innate perception of worldly people is concerned. Not only is there no such grasping at separateness, but when recollection occurs of what was seen by visual perception of a blue object, he would use conventions like “This I have seen before as well.” This clearly shows that there is no conception of one’s prior experience and subsequent recollection as well as their respective two objects {238} as being somehow distinct by virtue of their intrinsic characteristics, when it comes to the perception of ordinary people of the world. If this is not the case [and cognition and its subsequent recollection are distinct from each other by virtue of their intrinsic characteristics], then a person could recall an experience belonging to someone else’s mental continuum! Since what the prior cognition has experienced and determined are not something that the subsequent recollection did not experience or determine, so the memory “I saw that before as well” can occur. This too is something to be accepted within the norms of worldly convention. It should not be posited by means of critical analysis, whereby, not content with mere designation, one searches for objective referents over and above the constructs. For were we to search for the objective referents of the designations, nothing can be found, indicating that they are fictitious and [mere] conventions of the world.

In the Commentary, after refuting substantially real reflexive awareness and recollection existing by virtue of their intrinsic characteristics, Candrakīrti writes:
If [the assertion] is from the perspective of worldly convention, even then there cannot be a recollection that is caused by reflexive awareness.[617]
Thus, reflexive awareness is rejected not only on the ultimate level but even on the conventional level. He then goes on to say, “I will show how recollection can emerge in the absence of reflexive awareness below.”[618]
Now [those who propose reflexive awareness] think that the thought “I have seen it” is a recollection of a subjective experience, while “I saw this thing” in relation to, say, a blue object is a recollection of an object. There is then the thought “I remember what I myself saw before,” which is a special case of recollection. When this kind of recollection occurs, it is clear that the prior cognition — say, an experience of seeing Maitreya — had experience itself. For recollection follows the exact pattern of one’s prior experience.

In our view, we accept that ordinary people experience recollections, but we do not say that these occur because the prior cognition experiencing the object has cognized itself. Such recollection occurs because the very object perceived by the prior cognition is determined by the subsequent recollection as well — that is, they share the same object. This is why subsequent recall takes the form “I have seen this person Maitreya before as well.” So we ourselves do accept conventions such as “I remember what I myself saw before.” Yet our acceptance of such conventions is very different from [the account according to the alleged] reflexive awareness.

The Cittamātra opponent posits the prior experience and its subsequent recollection as well as their respective objects as being distinct from each other by virtue of their intrinsic characteristics. And so, even though they may assert the prior cognition and its subsequent recollection as having the same object and also claim that they belong to a shared single continuum, these remain untenable for them. This has been explained numerous times above. {239}

So even though one [loosely] speaks of “this Maitreya,” it is not a locus and time-specific Maitreya, such as the one coinciding with the utterance of this very sentence or the Maitreya one remembers having seen in a specific place. Rather, what is being remembered is just Maitreya in a general sense. That this is so can be discerned by observing one’s own mind.

Of the two major schools of thought on how recollection can arise in the absence of reflexive awareness, the views of the illustrious Śāntideva are presented in his Guide to the Bodhisattva Way, such as in the following lines:
If there is no reflexive awareness,
how is consciousness remembered?[619]
The opponent’s standpoint cited here [in these lines] is the same one that has been discussed already quite extensively above. To the opponent’s proof statement [no reflexive awareness → no recollection], Śāntideva responds by pointing out that no entailment holds both for the consequence thrown as well as its reverse syllogism.[620] The question then remains, “How then can recollection occur in the absence of reflexive awareness?”
When cognition of an object rather than that of a subjective experience takes place, it is from that cognition experiencing the object that recollection of the subjective conscious experience occurs.

[Response:] No such fault exists. For when subjective experience is recalled on the basis of having experienced an object, it is not independent of [remembering that] cognition; rather recollection takes form through a blending of the object and its subjective experience, such as in the thought “I saw this thing before.” That is to say, the two are remembered in a fused manner.
Here is an analogy. When [an animal is] bitten by a shrew in the winter, even though poison enters the animal’s body at that time, it’s the bite that is experienced and not the infection with the shrew’s poison. Later, however, on hearing the sound of thunder [and rising from hibernation], the animal comes to remember that poison entered its body when it was bitten, even though it did not experience being infected the moment of the bite. Being bitten by the shrew is analogous to the cognition experiencing its object by perceiving a blue thing; poison entering the body at the time of the bite is analogous to the subjective experience present when the blue object is experienced; that the subjective experience does not experience itself is analogous to the absence of perceiving the poison when the animal is bitten; and subsequent recollection of being infected is analogous to remembering the experience of the blue object. The recollection of the experience of the object itself led to remembering the prior experience, even though such a subjective experience did not experience itself at the time, and this is analogous to remembering being poisoned even though this was not perceived before but arose only through the force of recalling the experience of having been bitten.
This seems to be a most excellent [analogical] argument developed by a learned master on how recollection occurs in the absence of reflexive awareness. However, those who have commented on Śāntideva’s Guide to the Bodhisattva Way appear not to have explained this [argument] satisfactorily. So to the syllogism “No recollection by subsequent cognition is possible because the prior cognition did not experience itself,” this tradition [of Śāntideva] responds by stating, “There is no logical entailment.” In view of this, those who claim that it is not the intention of Guide to the Bodhisattva Way to reject reflexive awareness on the conventional level definitely do not represent the great bodhisattva’s view. {240}

[A Mādhyamika might ask:] We do have to accept in our own system that cognitions such as the perception of blue do exist. And if that is true, wouldn’t the same objection we have raised against the opponent in the lines “By what means is its existence known? Without observing it, you cannot say it exists” (6.72) apply to us as well? For if that perception of blue is known through itself, we will have to admit reflexive awareness, and yet that it is known by some separate cognition remains untenable.
[Reply:] This raises an extremely challenging point, so let me explain. It might be easier to understand if I explain by citing the example of how we remember objects and our subjective experience of them. It’s owing to the simple fact of remembering the object that we recall its subjective experience as well; no separate independent recollection of the subjective experience is necessary. Likewise, the simple fact of establishing the object of a perception of blue, for example, affirms the cognizing subject that perceives that blue thing as well. Thus, apart from the means by which [the object] blue is established, no separate means is needed to establish the cognizing subject perceiving that blue thing.
That it’s the appearance of an aspect, a likeness, projected onto the perception by the blue object, that establishes the existence of this blue thing, on this point, our view is no different from those of other [Buddhist] schools. Here is where the difference lies. The other schools maintain that the cognition perceiving blue is established by means of reflexive awareness — a bare subjective aspect devoid of dualistic perception — something they assert is true for all other cognitive states as well. We, on the other hand, agree with Bhāviveka’s Essence of the Middle Way and with Jñānagarbha’s Two Truths and its autocommentary, where it says that such a bare subjective aspect is impossible. So [cognition] is not established by a self-cognizing reflexive awareness; rather the establishment of the blue object in itself establishes the perception of blue [at the same time]. It’s through remembering the object that its subjective experience is remembered as well; such recollection is not induced by the prior subject having experienced itself in the manner asserted by other schools.

That this is how we should proceed is stated clearly in Candrakīrti’s Clear Words:
The classification of valid cognition is due to the objects of cognition. And it is through finding their own characters, through simply assuming the aspects of their objects of cognition, that valid cognitions are defined.[621]
The meaning of these sentences is this: The classification of valid cognition into two [perception and inference] is determined by the fact that objects of cognition are determined to be twofold. And it is on the basis of how the aspect of an object appears to valid cognition that a valid cognizer comes to be defined as possessing its own character. The significance of the exclusion term “simply” is to reject the following assertion of Sautrāntika and Cittamātra: {241} Valid cognition resembles and assumes the aspect of the object, and the object comes to be established through this, while valid cognition itself is established by a separate cognition — a bare subjective aspect that is free of dualistic perception with respect to the valid cognition itself; that is to say, it is established by reflexive awareness. This is what the exclusion term “simply” precludes. In other words, [cognition] is established through the mere establishment of its object.

This is also the intention of the noble Nāgārjuna himself:
If valid cognition is established by itself,
then for you, the means of valid cognition will be established
independently of the objects of valid cognition;
for self-established does not depend on others.[622]
If the simple establishing of the object is not adequate to establish the valid cognition, and if valid cognition is established by itself, as claimed by the opponent, then a valid cognition can exist without depending on its object of cognition. Were this admitted, things could exist without needing to depend on other causes and conditions. This is how Nāgārjuna refutes [self-establishment], and by way of implication, he also reveals how the mere establishing of the object of cognition establishes the valid cognition as well. In brief, Nāgārjuna presents how the blue-perceiving cognition is not established by itself through reflexive awareness, as asserted in others’ system. Rather, as he demonstrates, it’s established by valid sensory perception, for its presence is known simply through the blue-perceiving cognition establishing its own object. Therefore all valid cognitions are established simply through the establishment of their objects.

In this [Candrakīrti] system, things like mirror images and echoes are, as explained above, accepted as visible forms, sounds, and so on. Furthermore, Clear Words says:
As for a double moon and so on, such things are not direct perceptions from the perspective of cognitions not affected by an eye disease. However, from the perspective of someone whose sight is infected, they are direct perception alone.[623]
So this school of thought applies the term direct perception (pratyakṣa) to objects such as forms and sounds in actual terms and figuratively to the subject that apprehends such objects. In so doing, Candrakīrti explains how, although a distinction may be made from the perspective of ordinary worldly people as to whether things like the appearances of a double moon are objects of direct perception, in our system, however, even the appearance of a double moon is an evident object of direct perception. Therefore, regardless of whether such sensory cognitions are deluded by the standards of ordinary worldly convention, the subject [cognition] is established simply through the existence of its object.
[Objection:] Those of you who do not accept reflexive awareness will not be able to establish the instances of mental consciousness of the ordinary ground that are deluded in relation to their objects of perception and conception. This is because there can be no establishing of the subject merely through the cognizing of their objects.
[Reply:] Let me respond to this. {242} Since this system [of Candrakīrti] accepts no additional consciousness outside the six classes of consciousness, only two types of valid cognition are possible — valid cognition contingent upon physical sense faculties and valid cognition based on the mental faculty alone. Also, when it comes to valid cognitions, Clear Words mentions four kinds — direct perception, inference, valid testimonial knowledge, and valid analogical knowledge. This is based on [Nāgārjuna’s] Averting the Objections and its autocommentary. That the last two valid cognitions are encompassed within inferential cognition is stated in the following in Candrakīrti’s Commentary on Four Hundred Stanzas:
Not all things can be known through direct experience; some must be cognized through inference.[624]

Within the class of perceptual valid cognitions, of the four types asserted by other schools, Candrakīrti rejects reflexive direct perception. He also does not agree with how mental direct perception is defined in the [Buddhist] epistemological texts. In his Commentary on Four Hundred Stanzas, for example, in explaining the meaning of the statement in the Abhidharma scriptures that each of the five sense objects such as form are to be known by the senses and mental consciousness, he states the following:
It is not that one object is known by two types of consciousness. Rather, that which arises first [sensory consciousness] directly determines the object; the subsequent cognition does not perceive the object in a manner of direct engagement. It arises and apprehends its object through the force of [the preceding] sense consciousness. And when this happens, we designate the latter too as having consciousness of that object.[625]
So Candrakīrti says that it’s the sense consciousness that cognizes things such as form directly first, and mental consciousness apprehends them through the force of the sensory perception. It does not cognize [the object] directly like sense perception does; in fact, he says that [mental cognition] is a form of recollection.

Furthermore, Commentary on Four Hundred Stanzas says:
It [mental cognition] does not experience [its object] along the lines of a feeling and so on; nor does it positively determine form, sound, and so on by means of the senses.[626]
Candrakīrti thus speaks of two modes of cognizing in the manner of direct experience — the manner in which sensory perceptions cognize their objects such as form, and the manner of positively determining through inner experience, such as through feelings of pleasure and pain. Of these two, the second must be accepted even on the ordinary level. Yet, as he does not speak of any form of direct perception apart from the four types mentioned [in the texts], and since such feelings cannot be considered yogic direct perception or reflexive awareness, they must be understood to be a type of direct mental cognition. So although Candrakīrti differs from the Buddhist epistemologists as to how mental perception is defined, it is not that he does not accept valid mental perception at all. {243}

Since “to feel” is an expression associated with activity by an agent, it has three aspects: “This person feels,” “It is being felt by this means,” and “This is what is being felt.” Of these, the second is a valid cognition — the mental factor of feeling — while the third is the object: the sensations of pleasure, pain, and neutrality. We are speaking here, of course, in relation to mental consciousness. As for the three categories of feeling belonging to sensory experiences, they engage in positive determination of sense objects like form, sound, and so on, and the manner in which they are established is as explained above [that is, the same as the sensory cognitions].

[Question:] If the feeling within mental cognition directly determines pleasure, pain, and neutral feeling, does this not constitute reflexive awareness?
[Response:] There is no such fault. Reflexive awareness that has been refuted refers to a bare subjectivity alleged to be present in all mental states, which is inward oriented and for which the knower-known duality has dissolved. Here, however, we are speaking of a unique class of subjective experience characterized in the sutras as feeling. In everyday conventions of the world too, one speaks of experiencing pleasure and pain. So what is being experienced and the experiencer [mental cognition] can be perceived as distinct, hence what we are speaking of here is not the same as the reflexive awareness postulated by the opponent. Therefore the existence of feeling too comes to be established simply through experiencing pleasure and so on.
When mental-object forms arise in mental cognitions — such as when a mental cognition perceives a vivid image of skeleton — they are established through their images appearing to the mind. How is it that the perceiving mental cognitions too come to be established in this way? It is exactly the same [as in the example of sense perceptions]. Such objects are, however, distinct from the mental cognitions themselves.

On the question of how mental cognitions like the two self-graspings are established, we should discern this in accordance with the following passage in Candrakīrti’s Clear Words:
All objects characterized as well as characteristics, be they individual characteristics or universals — insofar as they exist in the world — must be directly observable and not remain obscure. Therefore, together with the cognitions that have them as objects, all of these are established as direct perceptions alone.[627]

The Sanskrit word for objects characterized (lakṣya) is the same as the one for definiendum [“what is to be defined”], so some translators render the word as “object characterized” (mtshan gzhi) while others translate it as “definiendum” (mtshon bya). Since Candrakīrti’s statement that the defining characteristics (the means by which something is defined) as well as the objects characterized (that upon which something is defined) are directly observable appears in the context of identifying what direct valid cognition is within the fourfold division of valid cognition, he is not speaking here of how an omniscient mind directly observes things. {244} Nor is he suggesting that all instances of individual characteristics and universals are evident facts and [that there exist] no obscure facts at all. For immediately after the previously cited passage, he writes:
An inference is a cognition that has arisen through the use of a faultless sign in the context of establishing an obscure fact.[628]

Nonetheless, whether it is the perception of individual characteristics or universals, there does emerge in each of these cases the perception [of that thing], and what is perceived is the direct object of that cognition. In this way, what is perceived and its subjective experience, the cognition, are characterized as being direct perceptions. Thus Candrakīrti understands the term direct perception (pratyakṣa) to apply factually to the object and only derivatively to the subject, cognition.

If all the appearances directly perceived by a given cognition are direct objects of that cognition, then in that case, those appearances would be evident to such cognition. Furthermore, if that cognition is nondeceptive with respect to what is being perceived, it could be an instance of valid cognition; for in everyday convention of the world, nondeceptive cognitions are referred to as “valid cognition.” As for the fact that when the cognition’s perception of the object is established, the subject becomes established as well, this is exactly the same as before. This being so, even in the case of such mental states as the two self-graspings, they experience direct perceptions of the appearance of the two forms of selfhood; furthermore, insofar as subjective experience establishes the evident fact of the perceiving of their objects, this is again exactly the same here as before. In this way we should also understand other [cognitions that are] erroneous with respect to their object of apprehension.

In brief, although all mental states are equal insofar as their appearing objects — the perceived objects — are found to be evident, there is nonetheless a great difference in their validity with respect to their objects [of apprehension], such as between the two forms of [conceived] selfhood versus the two types of selflessness, and between permanence versus impermanence of forms and so forth. Thus the distinction between valid and nonvalid cognitions can still be maintained. In addition, these mental cognitions described as being valid with respect to their appearing objects, having eliminated all other possibilities, must be recognized as valid direct mental perceptions in relation these objects. Such mental cognitions cannot be direct perception in the form of reflexive awareness, since there exists a dualistic perception with respect to their object.

Although dualistic perceptions have ceased for the uncontaminated mind of meditative equipoise, such a meditative state and the ultimate nature of things can still be spoken of, respectively, as the knower and the known. This is totally different from [the alleged reflexive awareness], an inward-oriented subject supposedly present in all cognitions for which dualistic perceptions have ceased and yet still characterized in terms of knower and known. For in the second case, except for a philosophical postulation of a subject-object relation, no matter how much one directs their mind, no image of two things — a known and a knower — can be conceived. In the first case, however, if one directs one’s mind to it and speaks of it to others, distinct aspects of the subject, the mental state, and its object, suchness, can definitely be conceived. Now, when nonconceptual gnosis of meditative equipoise establishes its object, suchness, it also comes to establish through the force of this the subject, gnosis, {245} for which the dualistic perception of knower and known has dissolved. As to how this is not the same as the opponent’s claim of a bare subjective aspect — an inward-oriented subjectivity present in all cognitions for which dualistic perceptions have ceased yet can still be described in terms of the known and knower — this will be explained below in the section on the resultant ground.[629]

These kinds of nuanced distinctions may not be essential to those who, when the opponent turns back the objection we [the Madhyamaka] have raised against them with the line “By what means is this known?” and so on, fail to comprehend the subtleties of the particular philosophical standpoints of the great beings and are unable to ground their own positions in the meaning of definitive scriptures or in extremely complex and subtle paths of reason. Thus in response, such people may reply with statements like “Since we have no position of our own, we are not vulnerable to such faults.” In this way, they seek haven only in duplicitous bluster. However, thinking of the learned people who are wise and gifted with refined intellect — those who are not convinced until and unless they have seen the path that distinguishes what is flawed from what is excellent on the basis of subtle points of reasoning — I have offered my presentation here, in the manner of simply opening the door to reveal how this excellent system [of Candrakīrti] can be understood as flawless.

[Question:] Now the “I” in the context of remembering “I saw blue” refers to the person, and since person and cognition apprehending blue are not identical, how can such remembering of the person be a recollection of that blue-apprehending cognition?
[Response:] It is true that visual cognition apprehending blue and the person who is seeing the blue are not the same. Nonetheless, just as there is no contradiction in accepting the statement “I saw it” because the visual cognition saw the blue object, likewise, why should there be any contradiction in taking the recollection of the person — occurring in terms of “I saw this before” — to constitute the recollection of the visual perception’s cognition of the blue object?

How this objection applies can be understood from [Jñānagarbha’s] autocommentary on the Two Truths: {246}
With respect to cognition itself, neither atoms nor nondual [cognition] appear as things, and conventions do not apply to anything that cannot appear.[630]
So in critiquing the notion of pure subjective experience — an inward-directed awareness devoid of dualistic perception — which is posited, in the manner explained above, as both as the known as well as the knower, Jñānagarbha raises the following objection. If one posits a knower-known distinction for something that, no matter how much one applies their mind, no appearance of distinction of knower and known can be conceived, absurd consequences follow, including that the agent, the object of the act, and the act itself all collapse into one. So the master Jñānagarbha regards the Cittamātra’s reflexive awareness as having exactly the same status as the Śrāvaka school’s notion of indivisible atom insofar as its existence or nonexistence is concerned. Even for [the purported] indivisible atom, [so long as it’s material] it will have to occupy a spatial locus, and when its form appears [to the mind], there is no other way for it to be perceived than as composed of parts. Therefore these two concepts of the two schools — the [nondual] knower and known and the indivisible atom — remain mere philosophical postulations.

Jñānagarbha even rejects the idea that these two things appear [to the mind] but are not ascertained. For in his autocommentary on the Two Truths he writes:
If you assert that while they do appear [to the mind], they cannot be ascertained, then what exactly are they? There can be no terms for such things. Since we cannot rely on your statement that it does appear, you are asking us to simply take your word for it.[631]
Thus Jñānagarbha says that the only proof [the opponent has] for his claim that it does appear [to the mind] is his swearing it to be so.
Also, through the reasoning found in the Descent into Laṅkā Sutra, reflexive awareness becomes untenable:
Just as the blade of a sword
does not cut itself, and just as
the tip of a nail does not touch itself,
the self-cognition of mind is the same.[632]

That the dependent nature does not arise from itself or from something other has already been explained. Also I have just shown how reflexive awareness establishing [such dependent nature] does not exist as well. So if this entity that is your dependent nature — which has no intrinsic arising and is uncognized by valid cognition — can still exist by virtue of its essence, then why would something not fit to be existent, such as the son of a barren woman, offend you, Cittamātra? In other words, why do you not accept its existence? You should. {247} So you, the Cittamātra, should go ahead and assert that there exists something called the son of a barren woman that transcends all conceptual elaborations, that is ineffable by its very nature, and that remains only within the sphere of experience of ārya’s gnosis![633]

If dependent nature does exist through its intrinsic nature, what is stated in the lines “which is the cause of imputed things” (6.47b) and so on may be okay. Now if dependent nature possessing intrinsic reality does not exist in the slightest manner, what then can be the cause or the substantially real basis for the deluded conventional realities? Nothing at all. This [argument] demonstrates that because they assert the dependent nature to exist on the ultimate level, they [Cittamātra] fall short of the level of ultimate truth.
So it will turn out for the Cittamātra that whatever causes of worldly convention there may be, none exist by virtue of their essential natures. Alas, you, because you Cittamātra lack the competence of wisdom discriminating the final definitive truth, you remain attached to real existence of mental states alone as substantially real dependent nature. Yet without hardening the clay pot of dependent nature in a kiln, you have poured water-like inappropriate philosophical analysis into it. Thus through inferiority of your intellect and inappropriate reasoning, you demolish or destroy all facts of worldly convention that are established purely within the framework of everyday transaction, such as “Sit down,” “Go there,” “Do this,” and so on. Similarly, you defy or undermine all such facts as the arising of feeling on the basis of perceiving external forms and external objects. Therefore, misfortune awaits you, Cittamātra; you will not attain the higher or excellent state of existence.
The argument that if external reality is rejected, [conventions] such as “Go there” become untenable indicates how these conventions are related to external reality. So this argument demonstrates how Cittamātra falls short on the level of the conventional truth. {248}

Regarding those who — exposed to teachers who expound as definitive what is in fact provisional or false — have entered a system that has been constructed through someone’s own conceptualization and fail to arrive at the Buddha’s intention, they remain outside the way initiated by the noble master Nāgārjuna. For those who thus remain outside, they have no principal means for attaining the true peace of nirvana. Why? Because those who remain outside in such a manner have definitely strayed from the truths of convention and of suchness — that is, the ultimate truth. Once they fall short on the two truths, they will not achieve liberation because of this failure so long as this condition is not relinquished.

“Why is it,” one might ask, “that falling short on the two truths means liberation is out of reach?” Because flawless positing of conventional truth is the means for realizing the ultimate truth as it is, while the realization of ultimate truth is the end resulting from these means. So those who fail to know the distinction between the two truths will enter the wrong or corrupt paths through false conceptualization. This [stanza] shows how until one has established a faultless system of the conventional truth, there is no realization of ultimate truth as it is. We should hence follow only the tradition initiated by Nāgārjuna.

To substantiate this point by reference to scripture, let me cite the Meditative Absorption Definitely Revealing Suchness:
Not hearing it from another, the Knower of the World
taught these two truths by himself.
They are conventional truth and ultimate truth;
nowhere does a third truth exist.[634]
This presents how the Buddha independently taught the two truths and how all objects of knowledge are encompassed within the category of the two truths.

Then the sutra states:
For the sake of engendering faith in bliss {249}
in those beings journeying to the state of a sugata,
the Conqueror has revealed the conventional truth;
this is for the sake of helping people of the world.[635]
This stanza declares the [Buddha’s] purpose in teaching the conventional truth.

Next, the same sutra says:
The six classes of beings revealed among sentient beings —
hell beings, animals, and hungry ghosts,
those of the demigod class, humans, and gods —
the Lion among Humans labels these conventional truths.
“Lower castes” and likewise “higher castes,”
“wealthy households” and “poor households,”
“laborer’s class” and that of “servants,”
the classes of “women,” “men,” and “neuters,”
whatever classification of beings there might be,
you, the Peerless One, have revealed them to be transient.
Having comprehended [their truth], you who are versed in conventions,
Knower of the World, you taught this [truth] to others.[636]
These lines indicate the way conventional truth was taught.

Next, the sutra says:
Beings who delight in this [surface level of truth]
revolve in cyclic existence with eight worldly concerns:
gain and loss, pleasing and unpleasing,
praise and disparagement, pleasure and pain.
When they gain something, attachment for it arises;
when they do not gain, this too causes distress;
those not spoken of here should be known likewise.
Through these eight diseases, their minds are harmed.[637]
These lines show how clinging to this everyday conventional truth as real and delighting in it involves acting with eight worldly concerns and how, tormented by these, beings revolve in the cycle of existence. By presenting the first two worldly concerns, the sutra states how we should understand the remaining ones as well, those that are not mentioned explicitly.

So these lines indicate how Buddhist schools that assert this have flawed philosophies.

Who speak of unattractive as attractive,
pain as joy, what is not self as self,
and what is impermanent as permanent —
who delight thus in these and grasp at signs,
should they ever hear the Sugata’s words,
terrified, they will not comprehend and will shun them.
Having forsaken the Sugata’s words,
they will experience relentless sufferings in the hells.
They seek happiness but inappropriately,
and so the childish will endure the eight types of suffering.[639]
These lines explain how those who are habituated to the four distortions, {250} as well as non-Buddhists tainted by doctrinal tenets affirming such distortions, would turn away were they to hear the Buddha’s words. Because of this they will depart to the hell realms. Though they may search for the bliss of liberation, since it is through incorrect means, not only will they not attain liberation, they will instead be tormented by vast amounts of suffering.

Whosoever understands with undistorted mind
the teaching of the Benefactor of the World
will transcend all births, attaining true peace,
just like a snake that shuns its old skin.
All of these phenomena are devoid of intrinsic nature;
he who hears these words and experiences joy —
“emptiness,” “signlessness,” or the “ultimate” —
will attain the unexcelled enlightenment.
Conqueror, you saw the aggregates to be empty;
you saw the elements and sense bases to be likewise.
That our sense towns are devoid of signs,
O Sage, all of this you have seen as it is.[640]
Having stated how if one understands the meaning of the profound truth in an undistorted manner one will attain freedom from the cycle of existence, the sutra responds to the question “How does one gain such understanding?” by explaining that one will do so if one experiences joy when one hears that all phenomena are devoid of intrinsic nature and so on and then comprehends this truth. In brief, conventional truth was presented in the prior set of stanzas, and ultimate truth is presented here [in this set]. “Elements” refers to earth and so on; “sense bases” refers to [sensory objects such as] form, sound, and so on.

So how can there be liberation for those who lack the knowledge of conventional truths as mere designations and ultimate truth in terms of the absence of intrinsic existence?[641] Therefore those who propound consciousness only have entered only an erroneous path.
The presentation of conventional truth is the means; this is as stated in the King of Meditation Sutra:
Reality, which is devoid of letters,
who listens to it? Who teaches it?
By superimposing onto what is unchanging,
still some listen and some teach it.[642]

The first two lines of this stanza present how things do not exist on the ultimate level. So it is in relation to things devoid of letters on the ultimate level that through superimposition — that is, through conceptual designation — one comes to listen as well as teach about it. The Sanskrit term for “letter” is akṣara, which refers both to “letter” and to “unchanging.” Here, however, it is more appropriate to render the phrase as “devoid of letters.” Although the term superimpose often refers to exaggerating what does not exist as existent and what is not as is, we should not confine the meaning of the word to this alone. The term can also refer in a general sense to something posited on the basis of being imputed by conceptual thought. So it is by abiding in the conventional truth alone that the ultimate truth is revealed, and when one comprehends the ultimate truth on this basis, {251} then one attains the ultimate truth of nirvana.

[Objection:][644] If you Mādhyamikas say such inconsiderate things to us, we will not tolerate it. The only skill you display is in eliminating others’ positions, and if in employing such skill, you eliminate the intrinsic existence of dependent nature on the ground that evidence does not support it, we too will eliminate conventions known to you by simply stating that they are untenable and employ the proofs used for refuting self-arising, arising from other, and so on.
[Reply:] Imagine someone robs you of wealth you accumulated since beginningless time through inconceivable hardship. If another person, pretending to be a friend to this robber, were to give him a poisonous meal and take back your stolen wealth for you, you would be happy. Like this, we are actually helping you by taking away the object of your grasping, the true existence of dependent nature. If in response you derive joy from harming us, this would be fine by us. On our part, we will take it as a compliment and as a good thing.

There are two modes in which the aggregates and so on are posited from the perspective of worldly convention. One is the Madhyamaka’s own positing of things on the conventional level, which is done so on the basis of acknowledging them from the perspective of valid conventional cognition but not done from the perspective of rational cognition [inquiring into the ultimate nature of things]. On some occasions, however, aggregates and so on are posited [in the scriptures] as intrinsic existents for specific purposes. But such assertions are not accepted as representing our own standpoint; they are acknowledged purely from the perspective of others. So refutation does not apply equally to these two [distinct] cases. Acknowledging things in such manner from the perspective of others is done to gain results or for a purpose. It is a skillful means to turn spiritual aspirants away from inferior philosophical views and to help gradually lead them to the realization of suchness.

It is the world that disputes with me; I do not dispute with the world. What is accepted in the world to exist, I too agree that it exists. What is accepted in the world to be nonexistent, I too agree that it does not exist.[646]

Just as all things of this conventional truth do not exist for those arhats who have shunned the aggregates and abide in the expanse of the peace of nirvana without residue, in the same manner, if something does not exist from the perspective of the world, then in that case, just as in the case of nirvana without residue, we do not say that it exists even in terms of, or from the perspective of, the everyday world. It is therefore only in dependence on worldly conventions that I accept the conventional truth; I do not assert it independently without being contingent on worldly conventions. {253}
First, it’s the world alone that accepts this [conventional truth]. It is therefore on the basis of what has been accepted alone that [inappropriate claims] can be eliminated, and it would be legitimate as well to engage in such elimination. Such rejection cannot be from the Madhyamaka standpoint.[648] This is expressed in the following:

On our part, given the tremendous hardship required to bring about the cessation of deluded perceptions pertaining to conventional truth in our own mental continuum, we will abide in the cultivation of the path. However, if you think that the everyday world does not invalidate you, then go ahead and refute this conventional truth using [conventions of] the world itself. And if you do succeed through your reasoning in refuting this, we too will side with you and be your ally. This said, since you will almost certainly be wounded by the world, we will not assist but remain neutral. You should thus enter into a dispute with the world, and in its aftermath, we will follow whoever prevails from this. If you win — and this is something we wish for — we will then follow you. If, however, the world defeats you, we will trust the world that possesses such great power. In view of all this, since the nonexistence of external reality is controverted by valid conventional cognition, you Cittamātra can never succeed in proving that there is no external reality.

[Reply:] I do not say that such a thing is not negated by valid cognition. Even though that kind of external reality is negated, this does not mean there is no external reality at all. We should understand in the same way how although temporally indivisible moments of consciousness and mental continua comprised of such moments are negated, this does not negate cognition itself.
In the opponent’s view, when external reality composed of indivisible matter is negated, then sensory cognitions undeceived with respect to their perceptions are also negated. And since deluded sensory cognitions cannot posit facts, so the thinking goes, external reality itself comes to be negated. However, here in our system, we maintain that although deluded sensory cognition cannot posit a real object, such deluded cognition can in fact be a complementary factor for positing an unreal object. This is what Candrakīrti felt.

This point is accepted by Āryadeva as well. In Four Hundred Stanzas, for instance, he states:
“One exists” and “the other does not”:
this is neither in reality nor according to the world.[649]
He thus explains how a differentiation between external reality and consciousness with respect to their existence and nonexistence cannot be accepted according to the standpoint of either of the two truths. Making such discrimination is therefore not the view of the master Nāgārjuna either. {254}

[Opponent:] You, Madhyamaka, remain divorced of actual proof or reasoning probing suchness, but because you fear being wounded by the world if you accept conventional truth, you have no choice but to accept the mind-only as well out of fear of being harmed by scripture. The Ten Grounds Sutra states, for example:
He will think thus: “This world of three realms is mind only.”[650]
[Reply:] To this we reply as follows. Say the Conqueror’s words are like a field of precious lapis lazuli. Failing to recognize it as lapis lazuli, you who speak of consciousness as a real entity mistake it for water. So in your desire to fetch some water of real consciousness, you plunge into it the earthen pot of your intellect not yet hardened in a kiln. When as a result your intellect pot crumbles into a hundred pieces, you become an object of ridicule for those who recognize this fact. The meaning of the sutra, therefore, is not as it appears to your mind. What then, you may ask, is the meaning of the sutra? To explain this, we say:

This statement, “The bodhisattva on the sixth ground, The Manifest — who contemplates the omniscient gnosis and is directly facing the ultimate expanse — realizes the threefold world to be merely consciousness,” is made to reject an eternal self or creator and to understand that mind alone, a conventional reality, is the creator. Thus the bodhisattva understands the mind alone to be the creator of the world. {255} This point is expressed extensively in the Ten Grounds Sutra itself, such as in the following:
The bodhisattva will thoroughly contemplate dependent origination in its sequential order. He will have the thought, “The suffering aggregates, this tree of suffering, these come into being merely with no creator or experiencer at all.” He will then contemplate, “Because of clinging to an agent [a self], karmic acts come into being. Where there is no such agent, ultimately no karma will exist either.” He will think thus, “This world of three realms is mind only. All of these twelve links of cyclic existence, which have been clearly distinguished and taught by the Tathāgata, are also dependent on this one thing, the mind.[651]
This sutra thus explains how such things exist as mere this or that with no creator and, when the meaning of “mind only” is explained, speaks of how the twelve links of dependent origination are dependent on the mind. Hence, the word “only” as found in this sutra does not negate external reality but rejects an agent that is other than the mind.
As for the opponent’s thesis [being refuted here by Candrakīrti], it is the one found in the Summary of the Great Vehicle, where Asaṅga writes:
Here, the scripture is this. In the Ten Grounds the Blessed One states, “It is thus: this world of three realms is mind only.”[652]
In presenting both scripture and reasoning to prove consciousness only, Asaṅga takes this [sutra passage] as his scriptural source. Similarly, in his autocommentary on the Twenty Verses too, Vasubandhu cites this same sutra and explains how the term “mind” must be understood to include the concomitant mental factors and how the word “only” rejects external reality.[653] Historically, it was Bhāviveka who first refuted [the Cittamātra reading of the scriptural statement] in the above manner; Candrakīrti undertook a similar refutation later.

{256} Since rejection of some other agent is what is meant by the word “only” in the Ten Grounds Sutra, to enhance the minds of the wise capable of realizing suchness, in the Descent into Laṅkā Sutra we find diamond-like words from the Omniscient One crushing the towering lofty peaks of inferior views present in the minds of the tīrthikas — views that assert self, primal substance, and so on as the agent creating the world. These words were spoken by the Buddha to help get to the true intent behind the mind-only statements found in other sutras as well. The “diamond-like [words]” refer to the following lines from the Descent into Laṅkā Sutra:
“Person,” “continuum,” and “aggregates,”
likewise “condition” and “atoms,”
“primal substance” and “Īśvara, the creator” —
these I have explained to be mind only.[654]
Thus the sutra states that none of these creators proposed by others, from the person to the creator Īśvara, is the agent; mind alone is the creator. To explain the meaning of this sutra, the text says:

So, of the various things postulated by the tīrthikas based on their doctrinal viewpoints presented in their own treatises — the “person” and so on, including the “continuum,” the “aggregates,” and so forth — seeing none of these to be the agent, the Buddha said that mind alone is the creator of the world.
The reference to “tīrthikas” in the root text should be understood in broad terms; even some followers of the Buddha postulate the “continuum” or the “aggregates” as being the [creator] agent. Alternately, one could say anyone who conceives such things as a “person” to be the agent does not qualify as a Buddhist. For, just like the tīrthikas, they have a distorted understanding of the Buddha’s teaching. So the term tīrthika is a general, broad term. The Precious Garland too states:
Those who assert “person” and “aggregates,”
the Sāṃkhyas and the Aulūkyas,[655]
and the Digambaras — ask if they speak
of transcendence of existence and nonexistence.
Therefore what the buddhas have taught,
that which is immortal and profound
and transcends existence and nonexistence —
know this to be unique to his teaching.[656]
Thus Nāgārjuna says that among those who assert person and aggregates as possessing substantial reality, if any appear to speak of something that transcends the extremes of existence and nonexistence, ask them what it is. They will have nothing to say about it. Therefore, Nāgārjuna says, we should know that the teaching that transcends the extremes of existence and nonexistence is unique to the sublime Dharma, a distinctive feature that cannot be found in others’ teachings.

As this cycle of existence has no beginning, why would inferior notions not have emerged in the past? In the future too, why would they not emerge? {257} Even in the present, some such as the white-clad renunciates appear to present aggregates and so on to be substantially existent.[657]
In some versions of Candrakīrti’s text [in Tibetan], there is a difference in spelling.[658] In the Tibetan translation of Jayānanda’s Explanation of the Commentary, however, one finds the phrase “the light-color-robed monk and so on,”[659] and he explains its meaning as referring to the monks of the Jaina school. In general, renunciate is an epithet of a meditator, so the phrase [in the Commentary] refers to the proponent of a Buddhist school known as the White-Clad Meditators, a school that asserts that substantially real aggregates are the agent.

Just as the word buddha refers to

why then would the Great One proclaim in the same sutra

When the word buddha (“awakened and blossomed one”) refers to “the one who has blossomed into suchness,” although first part of the name “awakened” is left implicit, the convention “buddha” is still used [as an epithet for such a person].[660] Just so, we should recognize that it is only because the mind is primary between the matter and mind in the world that the sutras speak of the world of three realms as being “mind only,” leaving implicit the second part of the phrase, which is “primary.” In other words, this statement of “mind only” precludes form and so on as being primary in constituting the three realms. {258} The meaning of such sutras is not to state that mind alone exists intrinsically and to reject external reality and assert that matter has no existence.

So the meaning of the Ten Grounds Sutra must be accepted, without reservation, exactly according to how we have explained it. For if, in accord with your position, it were the case that the Buddha knew the world of the three realms to be intrinsically existent mind only and, on that basis, did engage in the rejection of matter in the Ten Grounds Sutra, in that case why then would the Great One proclaim in the same Ten Grounds Sutra that the mind or consciousness was born from karma and delusion, or ignorance? For he stated, “Conditioned by ignorance, volition arises; and conditioned by volition, consciousness arises.” Such statements will become untenable.

So the Buddha stated in the Ten Grounds Sutra that consciousness is an effect of ignorance and volition; he did not say it has intrinsic existence. Even if [in general] the Buddha had taught [elsewhere] that consciousness is both dependently originated and intrinsically existent, given that it is inconceivable for a faultless speaker to adopt both of these positions as his own, we would have to recognize that he adopted such statements for others’ sake, to help lead other spiritual trainees. Here is the reason why both positions cannot be the Buddha’s own standpoint. Were consciousness to exist by virtue of its own essence, it would not be dependent upon ignorance and volition. The fact is, consciousness is dependent upon such factors, and as such, it has no existence by virtue of its own essence. It is certain, therefore, that in no possible manner does consciousness possess intrinsic existence. So just like floating hairs being perceived by someone with an eye disorder, we should understand that [an intrinsically real consciousness] is something that exists when the conditions are present for such distortion and does not exist when such conditions for distortion are absent. This, then, is the understanding.

That the sequential presentation of dependent origination shows how, when there is ignorance, the condition for distortion, consciousness, comes to exist, and how, when there is no ignorance, consciousness will come to cease, is stated through presenting the reverse order of dependent origination. Having thus presented, the sutra makes extensive statements, such as the following:
Thus volition possesses faults of multiple ill consequences, and when it is discerned with discriminative awareness as devoid of essence, as unborn, and unceasing . . .[661]
So what sane person would, after seeing these statements in this sutra, conceive of consciousness as substantially existent? No one would. To do so would be because of philosophical biases grasping at true existence. The Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning also states:
Since the Buddha has stated
that the world is conditioned by ignorance,
why is it not reasonable [to assert]
that this world is [a result of] conceptualization?
Since it comes to an end
when ignorance ceases, {259}
why does it not become clear then
that it was conjured by ignorance?[662]
The point being made here is that if something were to exist by virtue of its own essence, it would exist as a true mode of being. That is, when delusory perception ceases, it should become clearer and clearer rather than becoming undone altogether.
To make the point that the mind is primary, the text says:

The domain of sentient beings obtains its reality through karma and afflictions accumulated by individual beings themselves, while the vast diversity of their universe, their container [the environment], is constructed or produced by the collective karma gathered by the mind of the sentient beings. This latter, container world spans from the wind-mandala base up to [the highest heavenly realm of] Akaniṣṭha.[663] As for the remarkable diversity of features, such as the brilliance of a peacock’s feathers, these arise as products of the unique karma of these sentient beings alone. In contrast, the diversity of petal shapes and colors that exist among lotuses are produced by collective karma of the sentient beings. We should extend this same understanding to other cases [of diversity] as well. It is stated:
It’s owing to the power of sentient beings
that volcanoes erupted in their time;
so likewise weapons and jewel trees are found
in the hells and in the higher realms.[664]

That these two domains [the universe and sentient beings] are produced by two types of karma — collective and not collective — is explained in the Cittamātra texts as well. So even according to Cittamātra, it is not the case that there is no container world.
Thus the Buddha said that all beings are born of karma; and furthermore, there is no karma without the mind, for it is only with mind that karma is accrued. So karma too is contingent upon the mind.
Thus, through statements with phrases such as “no agent,” “no experiencer,” the Ten Grounds Sutra shows how the word “only” rejects some other agent; and with statements of how all twelve links are dependent on one factor, the mind, the sutra demonstrates how the term “only” indicates the mind to be primary. The first explanation is from a negative standpoint, and the second from an affirmative perspective. In brief, it is the mind that is the primary cause of the activity of sentient beings, and factors other than the mind are not principal. Therefore the mind, not matter, is posited in the sutras as primary. Therefore, even though matter does exist and is indeed accepted, it has no status of a creator of beings like the mind. So what is being denied or negated is a creator other than the mind; it is not that external matter is being negated.

Some schools, such as the Sāṃkhya, {260} assert primal substance to be the creator, while some Buddhists assert the mind to be such an agent. In that matter is not the agent, there is no dispute. So, when examining things such as primal substance that others suspect or conceive to be the agent, the mind alone, which is observed to have the characteristics of an agent in the conventional sense, is spoken of as the agent to eliminate things such as primal substance, which actually do not possess the characteristics of being an agent. When the mind is thus spoken of as the agent, primal substance and the like are eliminated. So one could say that primal substance and so on have been expelled and that the disputed territory has been conquered. Say two kings are competing to rule the same region. If one loses and is expelled but happens to find his own land [to rule elsewhere], then because they both found what they need, ordinary people will not suffer harm. Similarly, here too, since both [matter and mind] are needed, and furthermore since there is no harm in accepting matter, we should conclude that matter too does exist.

Thus, just as explained above, while remaining within the truth of the everyday world, external realities such as the aggregates are known to the world; thus all five aggregates do exist. However, when we speak of the arising of the gnosis directly perceiving suchness, then, for the yogi who is in such meditative equipoise, within his own perspective, these five aggregates such as form will be no more. Given this, if one asserts there is no matter, then do not hold that there is mind, and if, on the other hand, one indeed asserts there is mind, the internal, then do not hold that there is no matter, the external. In other words, if you conceive external matter to be nonexistent because it is found to be so when probed by reasoning searching for the true referent of designations, {261} then in that case, you will have to realize that the inner, the mind, also lacks existence because the existence of both outer and inner lack such logical evidence. Also, given that both are acknowledged by the world, if you [Cittamātra] conceive the mind to be existent, you must in that case admit matter as well.

The matter being referred to here, in relation to “nonexistence of matter” in the context of Cittamātra’s differentiation between matter and mind with respect to their existence and nonexistence, is indeed matter of external reality. One reads, for example, the lines “[perceptions] such as the simple perception of blue / come from their own seeds with nothing outer to grasp” (6.63). In the relevant commentary too, Candrakīrti writes, “With no existence of external matter such as blue . . .”[665] Thus the negation of matter is qualified with the term “external.”

Again, in the Commentary one reads:
Having stated how the term “only” cannot reject the object of knowledge, now to present how it is impossible to negate external objects on the grounds of other explanations as well . . .[666]
So in demonstrating how a rejection of matter is not the intent of the sutra, Candrakīrti defines the matter that is being denied [by Cittamātra] as external reality. Also, if one reads literally Candrakīrti’s phrase “Having stated how the term ‘only’ cannot negate the object of knowledge,” one would also have to say that he sees Cittamātra as asserting that the word “only” in “mind only” negates the object of knowledge itself.
Furthermore, in presenting the arguments for foundation consciousness, Summary of the Great Vehicle says:
With respect to the appropriation of physical organs by [fetus] when the fluids have already merged, it is incorrect to assert that there exists no fruitional effect consciousness that is separate from that [fetus].
And:
The emergence of consciousness and name-and-form, which function in a mutually supporting manner, like a beam and the house, would not be possible if there were no fruitional effect consciousness.[667]
To assert that Cittamātra does not accept material phenomena at all would directly contradict these above statements. For those who assert so appear to maintain that if one accepts material phenomena, one must admit external reality as well.

With respect to scriptures too, we should understand in the following manner how both external objects and internal cognitions are treated equally insofar as their existence or nonexistence is concerned. The root text reads:

With respect to all five aggregates such as form, {262} the Buddha in the wisdom sutras rejects them equally — that is, he negates the intrinsic existence of all five aggregates. One reads, for example, “Subhūti, form is empty of intrinsic existence . . . consciousness is empty of intrinsic existence.”[668] But in the Abhidharma, on the other hand, he speaks of the existence of all five aggregates equally in terms of their unique and common characteristics and so on. Therefore, since it has been established through scripture and reasoning that both external reality and inner experience are equally nonexistent on the ultimate level and equally existent on the conventional level, the opponent [Cittamātra] will have torn down the structure of the two truths. Even after you have undone [the two truths] in such manner, Cittamātra, the substantial reality you assert — namely, the dependent nature — remains unproven. Why is this so? Since substantially real dependent nature has been refuted many times before, your effort will be pointless. To avoid undermining the system of the two truths, you need to accept that [dependent nature] does not exist on the ultimate level but on the conventional level. Thus, Candrakīrti states in accordance with the stages of explanations offered above, you should know that phenomena are, from their very outset, unborn in reality but born in terms of everyday conventions of the world. This [passage] indicates how the nonarising of things is accepted on the ultimate level while their arising is maintained on the conventional level. Therefore it is essential to qualify what is being negated.

What seem to be a “body,” “resources,” and “habitat”
I have stated to be mind only.[669] {263}
Here, “body” refers to sense bases such as the eyes, which are physical; “resources” are the five sense objects such as form, sound, and so on; “habitat” refers to the container world. Since nothing external that is separate from the mind exists, when the mind alone appears as body, resources, and habitat, they are perceived as objects and things such as body and so on — something external and separate from consciousness. Therefore the three realms of existence are mind only.

The intention of the sutras that state that what are perceived as external do not exist and that it is the mind that is perceived in diverse forms is this: Such statements are intended for those beings who, because they are extremely attached to material forms, act [in the world] with lust for things, with anger, with conceit, and so on, and who have thus lost their freedom and whose forceful clinging inclines them toward grave negative deeds and makes them fall short in accumulating merit and wisdom. So just like [meditation on] skeletons taught to help the lustful counter their attachment to external forms, likewise, to help such people to turn away from afflictions conditioned by attachment to matter, even though it is not the actual truth, the Buddha spoke of “mind only.” This is how we should understand.

As for the statement that “There is no external reality and it is mind only,” the Buddha himself stated this to be provisional in meaning, and reasoning too proves it to be only provisional.
So with regard to the word “only” in the context of “mind only” in the [Laṅkā Sutra] lines “What appears as external does not exist” and so on, this master [Candrakīrti] does not interpret it the same way he did the Ten Grounds Sutra — that is, that the word “only” does not reject external reality but an agent other than the mind. Instead, Candrakīrti acknowledges that here [in the Laṅkā Sutra] the word does reject external reality, but he says the statement is provisional in meaning.
The great master Bhāviveka, however, interprets even this Laṅkā Sutra statement as indicating how the mind arises assuming the likeness of body, resources, and habitat as if colored by their shadow-like forms. He understands the phrase “What appears as external does not exist” as negating the view that cognition perceives [objects] without an aspect [or mental image].[670] Thus Bhāviveka maintains that the term “only” does not reject external reality [even in this Laṅkā Sutra passage].[671] {264}

Not only is the statement about the existence of mind only and the nonexistence of external reality in the lines “What appears as external does not exist . . .” provisional in meaning, as for other sutras that may be of same type as the one already mentioned and held by Cittamātra as definitive, they too are indicated by this scripture cited below to be provisional in meaning.[672] Here the Commentary states:
What are those sutras of same kind? They are the statements found in Unraveling the Intent Sutra, where in presenting the three forms of identitylessness, it speaks of the nonexistence of imputed nature and the existence of dependent nature. Likewise, there are statements such as:
The appropriating consciousness is deep and subtle;
all seeds spring forth from it like a flowing river;
to conceive it as self would be inappropriate;
so I have not taught this to the childish.[673]

(1) In that sutra, a differentiation is made between the imputed nature devoid of existence by virtue of intrinsic characteristic and the dependent nature existing by virtue of such intrinsic characteristic. In that Cittamātra system, existence by virtue of intrinsic characteristic remains impossible for such imputations as the two selfhoods superimposed on persons and phenomena based on their identity and attributes, but many of the imputations pertaining to identity and properties of things do exist [on the relative level]. In the sutra itself, although both dependent nature and perfected nature are stated to possess existence by virtue of intrinsic characteristic, the reason why only dependent nature is mentioned in the Commentary [in the passage cited above] is because dependent nature is the primary object of dispute between Madhyamaka and Cittamātra when it comes to the question of true existence or its lack. This is because the dependent nature is the designative basis for the imputed nature, while the perfected nature is necessarily defined on the basis of dependent nature as well. Candrakīrti’s tradition maintains that this kind of differentiation [made in Unraveling the Intent Sutra] is only provisional in meaning.

(2) Further, there is in that sutra the presentation of eight classes of consciousness, where it speaks of foundation consciousness that is separate from the six classes of engaging consciousness, as in the passage that begins “The appropriating consciousness.” This statement too is to be interpreted as provisional in meaning. And if there is no foundation consciousness, there cannot be [the seventh], the afflicted mental consciousness, either.[674] The words “and so on” [in the Commentary on this verse] indicate the following two: (3) the rejection of external reality in that sutra, and (4) statements about the ultimacy of all three vehicles. {265} Thus, altogether, there are four types of statements [in Unraveling the Intent Sutra] that need to be interpreted here as provisional in their meaning.
If we fail to cultivate a decisive understanding of this issue [of how to interpret certain scriptural statements as provisional], we will comprehend neither Madhyamaka nor Cittamātra thought in general, and more specifically, we will fail to appreciate the unique standpoints of this tradition [of Candrakīrti]. Seeing this, I have explained these in detail in Differentiating the Provisional and Definitive Meanings.[675]

The following specific phrases in Unraveling the Intent Sutra, as cited in Asaṅga’s Summary of the Great Vehicle, are the ones that state the nonexistence of external reality:
“O Blessed One, is the image that is the object of concentration different from the mind or not?”
The Blessed One replied: “Maitreya, it is not different.”
“Why is it not different?”
“Because consciousness is defined purely in terms of cognition of its object, so I have stated.”[676]
This tradition [of Candrakīrti] interprets all four types of sutra passages mentioned above as provisional; it does not differentiate among them, as some do,[677] interpreting some as provisional and accepting others as definitive.
As for the teaching about there being three ultimate vehicles, given that Nāgārjuna himself established the finality of only one vehicle in his Compendium of Sutras,[678] thinking that this can be understood from there, Candrakīrti did not address it here in his Commentary.

With respect to the remaining three [types of sutra passages] that establish mind only to possess intrinsic existence and deny external reality, the following passage from the Descent into Laṅkā Sutra is the scriptural source revealing them to be provisional in meaning:
Just as to a patient suffering from illness,
a physician administers medicine,
likewise for the sake of sentient beings,
the Buddha taught mind only.[679]
Medicine cannot be administered to specific patients according the personal inclination of the physician; it must conform to the nature of the illness of the patients. In the same way, it is explained, the Buddha’s teaching on mind only is also not given in accordance with the Buddha’s own personal viewpoint; it is given in accordance with the mental dispositions of the spiritual trainees. In this way, we recognize the former scriptural statement [about mind only] to be provisional.

Following the passage “Just as to a patient suffering from illness . . .” cited in the Commentary, Candrakīrti writes, “Likewise, the Blessed One states in the sutra . . .” and cites [extensively] from the Descent into Laṅkā Sutra up to “How then can one attain full awakening?”[680] These passages are the scriptural sources that indicate how foundation consciousness, which Cittamātra hold to be definitive, is in fact provisional.
In his Explanation of the Commentary, Jayānanda says that the phrase “Likewise . . .”[681] has the following meaning. Just as the [Buddha’s] statements about permanent enduring essence is provisional, likewise the [Buddha’s] teaching of mind only is shown to be provisional.[682] This is a distorted explanation. {266} For the Commentary itself makes it clear that the meaning must be understood in terms of how the teaching of mind only is provisional.”[683] So just as the [Laṅkā Sutra] lines “Just as to a patient suffering from illness . . .” explain the teaching of mind only to be provisional, in the same manner, the statement about the provisionality of [the teaching of] permanent enduring essence proves that the teaching of foundation consciousness in the Unraveling the Intent Sutra is not literal. For this, however, one must first recognize that the teaching of an eternal immutable essence is not literal. Here, the Descent into Laṅkā Sutra states:
The sutra that is taught [purely] in conformity with the mental dispositions of sentient beings is erroneous with respect to its content; it’s not a discourse on suchness.

For example, not being water, a mirage deceives those animals that take it for water. In the same manner, the teaching thus taught will please only the childish; it is not a discourse that will delight the gnosis of āryas. You should therefore follow after the truth and not be attached to words.[684]
And the same sutra raises the following question:
Mahāmati asks: “In the sutras you spoke of a tathāgata essence that is naturally luminous, primordially pure, and endowed with the thirty-two exemplary marks of an ārya existing within the bodies of all sentient beings. You say that, like a precious jewel wrapped in a dirty rag, it is covered by the rags of aggregates, elements, and sense bases and has thus become tainted. If you speak of such an essence that is eternal, enduring, and immutable, how is this any different from the tīrthika’s proposed self?”[685]

In responding to this, [the Buddha] points out that, since such a teaching is not literal, it is not at all similar to the tīrthika’s self. The Buddha explains that the intended purport[686] — what was actually intended when such [an essence] was taught — is the selflessness of phenomena in terms of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness. The purpose for teaching the existence of such an eternal, enduring, and immutable essence is to help gradually lead the following classes of people to suchness: (1) the childish who shun selflessness out of fear, (2) the tīrthikas who are attached to propositions of self, and (3) those who were habituated to such views in past [lives]. So, the sutra states, present and future bodhisattvas must not cling to it as a self. Since to espouse such a view literally would be no different from clinging to the tīrthika’s self, the intended meaning [of the sutra] is not to grasp at its literal meaning. The explicit objection against the literal reading of the sutra is this: to espouse it literally would be no different from espousing the tīrthika’s self. As I have already explained these points extensively elsewhere, I will not elaborate further here.[687] {267}

In the Commentary:
Again in that sutra it states, “Mahāmati, this [truth] contained within the scriptures of all the buddhas has the character of emptiness, nonarising, nonduality, and absence of intrinsic existence.”[688]
After citing this, Candrakīrti says:
Having therefore clearly elucidated, on the basis of this scripture, how all such similar sutras accepted as definitive by Cittamātra are in fact provisional in their meaning . . .[689]
“Such similar sutras” does not refer to the two passages of the Descent into Laṅkā Sutra that have been just cited. Both of those segments are not accepted by Cittamātra as definitive. Furthermore, the Commentary already explicitly explained these [“similar sutras” to be passages] from the Unraveling the Intent Sutra. As to what is being referred to in “on the basis of this scripture,” Jayānanda’s Explanation identifies it with a section in the Ten Grounds Sutra pertaining to the contemplation of dependent origination that negates an agent [other than mind].[690] This is totally incorrect. The rejection of such an agent is presented as the reason explaining how the term “only” in the statement “mind only” in the Ten Grounds Sutra does not negate external reality; it is not a reason explaining that the negation of external reality is provisional.

Thus three scriptural citations are indicated in the root text in the line “They too are indicated by this scripture to be provisional” (6.95d). Of these, the four-line [passage of the Laṅkā Sutra] “Just as to a patient suffering from illness” and so on demonstrates the provisional nature of mind only with its rejection of external reality; the scripture that reveals the provisionality of permanent enduring essence is the one that demonstrates the provisional nature of foundation consciousness. How does the provisionality of permanent enduring essence establish foundation consciousness to be provisional?

In the Descent into Laṅkā Sutra too we read: “The tathāgata essence, which is expressed as foundation consciousness, together with seven classes of consciousness . . .”[692] Thus these two are said on numerous occasions to be synonymous. This said, given that one is characterized as permanent and the other as impermanent, it cannot be the literal senses of the two terms that are being shown to be equivalent. Nevertheless, since foundation consciousness was taught on the basis of exactly the same intended purport underlying the teaching of essence, so from the perspective of their intended meaning, the two are synonymous and share the same reference. Therefore, by demonstrating the first [passage here] to be provisional, the latter too is established as provisional.

The Commentary states:
Because it leads [beings to enter] the nature of all entities, {268} we should understand that the words “foundation consciousness” refer to emptiness alone.[693]
Thus it is by conveying well with [the scriptural citations] how the teaching of permanent enduring essence is provisional that we comprehend how that same scriptural citation [from the Laṅkā Sutra] reveals foundation consciousness to be provisional too.
Immediately following the passage “Mahāmati, this [truth] contained within the scriptures of all the buddhas . . . character of emptiness . . .”[694] it reads in that same sutra, “Whatever sutra it may be, comprehend this meaning alone to be contained in it.”[695] This is the scriptural citation that demonstrates the provisional nature of the teaching that differentiates between the first two natures with respect to their existence or nonexistence by virtue of intrinsic character.

As a skillful means to help lead them to [the truth of] suchness, [the buddhas] first expose those with good stores of merit to discourses on the practice of generosity and the like. In the same manner, with respect to those trainees who do not have the capacity to realize the full meaning of the profound truth right from start, the buddhas lead them toward the realization of no intrinsic existence gradually. To such [trainees], once cognizable objects, external reality, are first shown to be no more, then negation of intrinsically existing cognition is easily obtained, so the buddhas have said. This being so, the absence of the cognizable — in other words, negating external reality from the outset — is a means to help induce full realization of selflessness. So the buddhas first taught the negation of external objects of cognition alone; for if there is no object — that is, if the selflessness of external reality has been understood — cognition is easily negated as a consequence; that is to say, the selflessness of consciousness will be easily established.

Among those who have awareness of no intrinsic existence of external reality, some will realize no intrinsic existence of cognition on their own, while others will realize this on the basis of a brief explanation by another. That the statement about the nonexistence of external reality and the intrinsic existence of cognition are provisional is clearly stated in the Commentary on the Awakening Mind as well:
“All of this is but one’s mind”:
that which was stated by the Able One {269}
is to alleviate the fear of the childish;
it is not [a statement] of final truth.[696]
Āryadeva states this explicitly in his Compendium of the Heart of Gnosis as well.[697]

The sutras also state that “the meaning of impermanence is nonexistence.”[699]
The way in which the first citation presents logical reason is this: The Buddha taught in the Abhidharma that the four elements are tactile phenomena and are thus not visible objects of the eyes, while their derivative, the visible form, is a visible object. While one must accept both of these points, when it comes to presenting their suchness, one recognizes that were these phenomena to exist by virtue of their own essence, there would be this consequence: either one has to admit that the four elements are perceivable by the eye [just as the derived object is] or that the object, the visible form, is not perceivable by the eye [just as its constitutive subtle elements are not]. When one comes to appreciate this problem, one will then understand that the earlier [Abhidharma] statements do not present true suchness. In this way, one will realize their suchness anew and understand the earlier [Abhidharma] statements to be a means of leading to that suchness.

For instance, the King of Meditations Sutra states:

these are known to be provisional in meaning.[700]

The reference to “person” and so on are only examples; it also indicates those [scriptures that speak of] the existence of an agent, the object of an action, as well as the acts. This [citation from King of Meditations Sutra] is then a scriptural source for differentiating sutras into the two classes of provisional and definitive meaning.
Again the same sutra states:
In the thousandfold world systems,
all the teachings I have taught
consist of different words but one meaning,
but this [one truth] cannot be uttered.
When you contemplate this one thing,
you will be meditating on all [other teachings].
So the numerous teachings of all the buddhas,
all those that have been taught,
are about the selflessness of all phenomena.
If a person versed in meaning
trains in this essential point,
it won’t be hard to find the Buddha’s attributes.[701]

The first four lines, beginning with “In the thousandfold world systems,” indicate that of all those sutras that have been taught, those that explicitly elucidate ultimate truth directly engage with true suchness; and those that do not present ultimate truth — the provisional ones — even they engage with suchness indirectly. So they have the same meaning with respect to engaging with the ultimate truth. And given that those training on the path at the beginner’s level can never discover all the scriptures that exist throughout the universe, they should inquire into true suchness on the basis of whatever sutra is at hand. This is how we should read the passage. This can be discerned from the fact that this passage is cited to substantiate the point that even those sutras that do not explicitly teach suchness should be explained as conditions for approaching true suchness.

The two lines beginning “When you contemplate this one thing” indicate that if, on the basis of excellent understanding, one meditates upon the suchness of one subject, this is like meditating upon the suchness of all other phenomena. Thus it is not necessary to meditate individually upon the suchness of each and every specific phenomenon. As to how when one meditates upon [the suchness of] one entity, this constitutes meditating upon [the suchness of] all entities, this is explained by the three lines beginning “So the numerous teachings of all the buddhas.” The fact that the sutra identifies selflessness of phenomena to be that one entity should not be understood as saying that only one single practice is adequate when it comes to the domain of vast practices [as well].

Candrakīrti says that, just as the Candraprabha Sutra[702] presents the method of defining the provisional and definitive nature of the scriptures, we should also appreciate the extensive presentations found in sutras such as Teachings of Akṣayamati. I have already explained these points exhaustively in my Differentiating the Provisional and Definitive Meanings.[703] The Commentary’s statement “One point I will explain though”[704] {271} indicates that he will explain briefly how to respond to the following question: “If you interpret the explanation of the three natures found in Unraveling the Intent Sutra as provisional, how do you define these three natures within your own system?”

For example, the snake is a false construct in relation to a coiled rope because there is no such snake in that rope. In relation to an actual snake, however, it is established as real because it’s not an imputation of something that is not there. Likewise, intrinsic or true nature too remains a construct — an imputation of something that does not exist — in relation to the conditioned dependent phenomena. For as Fundamental Wisdom says:
Intrinsic nature is not fabricated;
it’s not dependent on others.[705]
Thus the true nature cannot be something produced.

This intrinsic nature, which is imputed in relation to the reflection-like causally produced world of dependent origination — the things we can perceive and observe right here and now — within the sphere of the buddha’s gnosis seeing the way things really are, represents actual reality, the true nature. There, it is not an imputation of something that is not there. This is because the buddha directly perceives the true nature alone without touching the causally produced things themselves. Having fully realized this nature, he is called an awakened one.[706]
As to how [such a gnosis] does not touch [the causally produced entities themselves], this will be analyzed later.
Candrakīrti then writes, “Having thus understood the presentation of the three natures, one should explain the intended meaning of the scriptures.”[707] So, through such mode of exposition, we should discern the intention behind the presentation of three natures as found in the “Questions of Maitreya” chapter as well.[708] We should, on this [same] basis, also understand how the stated meaning underlying the presentation of three natures in the Unraveling the Intent Sutra is provisional in meaning. In fact, what Cittamātra takes to be the imputed nature — the subject-object duality imputed with dependent nature as its basis — needs to be critically examined. For the two factors, subject and object, are in fact dependent phenomena, and apart from these two, no other [third class of] dependent phenomena exists. As for the presentation of three natures in the “Questions of Maitreya” chapter as well as the presentation of three natures according to the Unraveling the Intent Sutra, I have explained these exhaustively in my Differentiating the Provisional and Definitive Meanings.[709] {272}

The Jainas propound arising from both poles — self-arising and arising from other. So when a clay pot emerges from factors such as a lump of clay, a kneading stick, a spinning wheel, threads, water, and the potter, Jainas think that since the clay pot comes into being only in the nature of clay, it arises from itself. And given that factors other than clay, such as the activity of the potter, are engendering causes of the clay pot, it arises from something other than itself too. And just as with external things, inner experiences also arise from both self and other.
Jainas present nine categories of reality: (1) life force, referred to as “person” or “self”; (2) faculties and so on that are other than the life force; (3) dharma that helps attain higher rebirth and definite goodness [liberation]; (4) opposite of dharma, which leads to bondage; (5) pollutant afflictions; (6) vows that prevent immorality; “and so on,”[710] which include (7) happiness, (8) suffering, and (9) cohering force, which both arises from cognition and serves as the cause of cognition.
Jainas assert that a person — called, say, Maitreya — has taken birth in this life because he existed in past lives endowed with life force, and hence he is self-arisen, for Maitreya and his life force are not different. Life force possesses mobility, moving from one birth to another, they say; it travels into such transmigrations as those of the celestial realms. However, since Maitreya arises also from other factors — from his parents, from the wholesome and unwholesome factors, from the pollutants, and so on — Maitreya arises from something other as well. “Therefore,” they claim, “we do not assert arising from self or from something other individually, so the specific refutations of self-arising and arising from other presented above will not affect us.”

Just as arising from each is illogical, arising from the combination of both self and other is also not logical. For this standpoint of arising from both is vulnerable to the objections already raised to each of the two standpoints. {273} For example, if the opponent asserts that Maitreya is self-arising from the point of view of his life force, this would be refuted through arguments such as the pointlessness of its arising.[711] And if, from the point of view of his parents, they assert Maitreya as arising from something other, this would be refuted through [demonstrations of] extreme absurd consequences.
So, just as we have shown above how arising from self and from other are illogical, in both the sense of everyday conventional truth as well in the ultimate sense, here too, we say in the form of a summary that arising from both is impossible:

The Cārvākas who propound the theory of natural origination assert the following. If arising is due to causes, then from the point of view of the effect, arising would be either from itself, from something other, or from both, so one will be susceptible to the objections. {274} However, since we do not accept arising from causes, we are not vulnerable to the faults leveled against those three positions. For example, when it comes to the rough texture of lotus stems and the softness of lotus petals, we do not observe anyone creating these. Nor do we witness anyone crafting the varied shapes and colors of the petals, pistils, and the stamens of the lotuses. This is true also of such varied things like breadfruit (Skt. panasa) and apples. And just as with these external things, so also with those that possess inner experiences, such as peacocks, partridges (titiri), roosters — we do not see someone diligently sculpting their shapes and painting their colors. Therefore the arising of things is such that they originate naturally on their own.

If there can be arising of things from no cause at all, then anything could come always from anything, even from those that are not their causes; for everything will be equal in being not a cause. Furthermore, the ripening of mangoes, for example, is contingent upon the seasons and is seen only at a specific time of year. But something like this would exist at all times, for it would not depend on time. Likewise, crows would have peacock feathers, and peacocks would possess parrot’s feathers, even during the gestation period! For these things would not be contingent upon their causes.

If you are right, there would then be none of the manifold efforts of ordinary people, such as sowing seeds for the sake of raising a crop, which they pursue so that they may reap the fruits of their labors, such as enjoying bountiful harvests come fall. Yet they do engage in such activity, so arising does not occur by itself. Furthermore, there is the following fault. If sentient beings had no cause at all — that is to say, they came into being with no cause at all — they would be ungraspable, like the scent and color of blue lotuses in the sky. Yet the fact is, we do perceive the world in all its color and brilliance.

According to Cārvāka, four elements serve as the cause of the entire diverse world of sentient beings, what are referred to as “earth,” “water,” “fire,” and “wind.” Through the maturation of these four elements, evidence can be found for the diversity we observe — lotuses and apples as well as peacocks, roosters, and so on. In fact, cognition itself, which cognizes the diverse realities, also arises from this same [maturation of the four elements] alone. So just as from the specific interaction of the elements in alcohol arises the potency of the intoxicant that causes drunkenness and loss of consciousness in living creatures, consciousness arises from the specific interaction of the great elements during gestation — at the time of the kalala embryo and so on. These then evolve up to the point when they can positively determine all sorts of things. Therefore, whether it is external things or internal experiences, all things come into being only from the causes of this world alone. There is no such thing as an afterlife, with fruition of past-lives karma ripening in this life and the fruits of karma created in this life being realized in some other world. So they think.[712]

To this standpoint, we ask the following. “This certainty of yours that there is no world beyond, from what reason does it stem?” If the thought is that we do not presently see any life beyond, then is this nonperception of an afterlife an instance of direct perception or not? If you say that it is a direct perception, you would be asserting that what is in fact the opposite of a direct perception is an instance of direct seeing. In that case, it would not be contradictory to assert that a nonentity is an instance of direct perception, which means, according to you, something that is not an entity could also be an entity. This is because, for you, the absence of an afterlife would be an actual object of direct perception, just as an actual thing is an object of direct perception. This would mean that since there would be no nonentity at all, entity too would not exist, because there would be no contrasting point of reference for it. And if these two [entity and nonentity] do not exist, there cannot be the four elements. In which case, your thesis that an afterlife does not exist will be undone as well.

If, on the other hand, [your certainty] is not based on a direct perception, then it would not be an evident fact. {276} For if it is not apprehended by direct valid cognition, how is nonexistence of an afterlife established for you? Now if you assert that it is apprehended through inference, it is true in general that individuals can attain their goals not only through direct perception but also through inference, but you Cārvāka do not actually acknowledge inferential cognition! For instance, you assert:

The four elements such as earth do not have that nature by means of which you say in your treatises that they become objects of cognition. Now if they do not exist in such a manner, then how can you, whose mind is so thickly covered by darkness with respect to what are very coarse facts, ever correctly understand very subtle facts about the existence or nonexistence of the world beyond? This is not possible. There is also a further fault. For when you negate the world beyond, you Cārvāka should know that you are viewing the nature of things in a distorted manner. You will thus possess a body or a frame that resembles or is equivalent to a condition that supports a denigratory view pertaining to the world beyond. This is, for example, just as when one asserts self or true-existence of the elements.
The opponent may think, “When one cognizes the elements to possess true existence, one sees things in an undistorted manner, so the example you cite has no bearing on the predicated thesis.” This response is untenable. For conceiving the elements — which are intrinsically unborn and nonexistent — as intrinsically existent and arising establishes that you Cārvākas are viewing reality in a distorted manner. [Candrakīrti’s response] indicates that, in the case of our own valid proof statements, the example must have a bearing on the predicated thesis. [Candrakīrti also] explained above how “being a visible object of eye cognition” is an instance of an “unestablished proof” when cited as a logical reason to demonstrate that sound is impermanent. All of this reveals that all three modes of a sound proof are required to establish a thesis by means of valid reasoning.[715]
If you [Cārvāka] say that this fact of the elements being intrinsically unborn needs to be proven, we say this:

That these elements do not exist in such a manner — namely, by virtue of their intrinsic nature — has already been shown. For example, earlier when arising from self, from something other, and from both as well as from no cause {277} were refuted, we already refuted intrinsic arising of the elements together or in a general sense. As such the elements cannot exist in terms not already covered or negated in this general sense. So our argument still holds.
Likewise, when refuting the views that denigrate [the existence of] omniscience and other views, such as the essentialist tenets of those who assert intrinsic existence, we could extend [the same objection that] they are conceiving reality in a distorted manner. We could, for example, rephrase the verse in the following manner:
You should know that when you deny buddhahood,
you’re viewing the nature of things in a distorted manner.
You’ll thus possess a body that supports such [denigratory] view,
just as when one asserts self-existence of the elements.[716]
We could do this because we wish to refute all standpoints that view things in terms of existence and nonexistence.
If the opponent thinks, “This same consequence applies to you [Madhyamaka] as well,” we will respond, “This is not the case; there are no examples that help establish our view to be distorted.” We could in fact say the following:
You should know that when you recognize there is an afterlife,
you’re viewing the nature of things in an excellent manner.
You’ll thus possess a body that supports such [correct] view,
just as when one asserts the realization of selflessness.
Likewise, [we could say]:
You should know that when you recognize there is omniscience,
you’re viewing the nature of things in an excellent manner . . .
The [last two lines presenting the] reasoning sign and the example would remain the same [as the previous examples]. “We should extend this same rephrasing to the knowledge of all things as well.”[717]
Therefore it is in such terms that the four theses proposed in the following lines have been thoroughly established:
Not originating from itself, and how from something other?
Not from both, and how from no cause? (6.8ab)
Given what Candrakīrti states here, we should not say such things as “We refute others’ standpoints but do not establish any of our own.”

{278} One might ask, “If things do not arise from themselves, from something other, from both, or from no cause, how then do they arise?” Here I will say this: If things possessed some sort of intrinsic nature, no doubt things would have to arise or exist from themselves, from something other, from both, or from no cause because no other conception of arising is possible. Even for those who assert arising of things from Īśvara and so forth, Īśvara and so forth will have to be either self, something other, or both. Therefore, those who propose Īśvara and so forth as the cause, even they cannot escape the objections leveled [against arising from the four extremes]. No fifth possibility can be conceived of as the cause. Given that there is no such alternative, and since arising from the four conceived possibilities has been refuted, it has been demonstrated that things have no arising in any intrinsic sense. This is stated in the following:

In that there is no arising from self, from other, or from both, or independent of a cause, entities are devoid of intrinsic existence. This is what is being stated.
This [two-line passage] shows how, although arising from four extremes has been negated through consequence-driven logical arguments, in the end it’s on the basis of a reasoning sign that inferential cognition arises. Here, “no arising from the four extremes” is the logical reason, “entities” refers to the subject, and being “devoid of intrinsic existence” is the thesis.

One might ask, “If things have no arising through their intrinsic nature, how can such unborn things, like blue, be apprehended?” Now, whatever might be the essential nature of a phenomenon like a blue thing, it cannot be an object perceptible by someone deluded by ignorance. Therefore everyday cognitions like eye consciousness cannot apprehend the essential nature of such things as blue. “In that case,” one might ask, “what is it that is seen again and again in the form of an object right in front of us?” This is perceived out of our delusion, so it cannot be the essential nature [of things]. For it is only through the pollution of ignorance that things are perceived in such terms. To indicate this, we say:[718]

Since, or for the reason that, dense ignorance enshrouds the world of sentient beings like thick clouds, obscuring the essential nature from being seen, the childish have no vision of the essential nature of blue and so on. In fact, the natures of phenomena are misperceived in distorted ways by the childish who grasp at true existence of things.
“Even if one allows,” one might ask, “that [the childish] do not see suchness because of being obscured by delusion, how is it that they come to see it in a distorted manner?” To demonstrate by means of an analogy how it is owing to the power of delusion [that the childish] perceive what has no intrinsic existence as having such existence, we say:

Through the power of their senses being infected with a malady of the eyes, some individuals who have such an eye disease falsely perceive, or see, such things as floating hair, double moon, peacock feathers, swarms of flies, and so on — even though there are no such things. Likewise, through the power of delusion those who are unwise, the ordinary beings, {280} perceive, or see, all sorts of conditioned things, such as blue, with their cognitions. The Buddha states in the Dependent Origination Sutra, for example, “Conditioned by ignorance volitions arises . . .” Likewise, he states, “A person driven by ignorance will create merit, create demerit, and create unwavering karma,” and “From the cessation of ignorance, volition will cease . . .”[719]
Such statements as “Karma comes from delusion and not when delusion is absent” are doubtless for the understanding of unwise alone — namely, they are from the point of view of ordinary beings alone. As for the wise, when they see statements such as “Conditioned by ignorance, volition arises,” they realize volition’s emptiness of intrinsic existence, and with the sun of excellent intellect realizing the truth of dependent origination, they will totally dispel the thick darkness of ignorance. Having eliminated ignorance, the cause for appropriating karmic acts, they will thus not appropriate karmic acts. In this way, they will definitely become free from the cycle of existence. The Condensed Perfection of Wisdom states:
Just like a cloud-free sun dispels all darkness with its rays,
the bodhisattva who understands through his wisdom
that dependent originations have no arising or cessation
will destroy the darkness of ignorance and attain freedom.[720]

You should first argue with those with an eye disease, whose eyes are impaired by myodesopsia and so on and who see as objects of their perception such unarisen things as floating hair; and ask them, “Why is it that you see such nonexistent things as floating hair but not the son of a barren woman?” {281} Then, afterward, you can refute those who are afflicted by the ills of ignorance and whose eyes of intelligence are obscured and ask: “Why is it that, despite both being equally unarisen, you can see forms and so on but not the son of a barren woman?”
As for us, this is not a matter of dispute or argument. We, for one, accept what is stated in the scriptures that the yogis see all things in such a manner [as devoid of intrinsic existence], and that those who aspire to attain a yogi’s gnosis too should develop deep conviction in the statement that all phenomena are devoid of intrinsic existence. So, precisely according to scripture, we explain the absence of intrinsic existence of all things as comprehended by yogi’s gnosis. We do not explain the nature of things from the point of view of our own [ordinary everyday] cognition. For our eyes of intelligence remain obscured by the cataracts of ignorance.[721] This is as stated in a sutra:
Aggregates are devoid of intrinsic nature and empty;
enlightenment is devoid of intrinsic nature and empty;
the one who partakes in them is devoid of intrinsic nature and empty;
this is known by those with pristine gnosis, not by the childish.
They will know the nature of gnosis itself to be empty,
and having known the nature of knowables to be empty,
when they understand the known to be same as the knower,
I say, “They are traversing the path of enlightenment.”[722]
Therefore this [question about the absence of intrinsic existence of things] is not something to be disputed and argued with the yogis. As for the yogis, they do not see, even on the conventional level, any intrinsic nature established by virtue of an essence in relation to any phenomena. And on the ultimate level, they see nothing at all.
So you [proponent of intrinsic arising] should forget about looking at those with an eye disorder as someone to dispute and argue with. For now, instead, you need to dispute and argue with your own self. So we say:

how is it you see these but not the other? 6.109

unlike the son of a barren woman, they do serve

You should ask yourself this: “If indeed such unarisen things as dream objects like dream houses, gandharva cities, mirage water, a man and woman conjured through magical illusions, mirror reflections of faces, and so on — which includes echoes, magical emanations, and the like — can be seen, how is it that you see these but not the other, the son of a childless woman, given they too are equally nonexistent?” This is illogical. You should argue with yourself in this way, and afterward you can then come and argue with me. So although things such as forms do not arise in terms of ultimate reality, unlike the son of a barren woman, they do serve as objects perceived in the context of the everyday world. {282} Therefore your argument — “If things do not exist on the ultimate level, they would then be unseeable even on the conventional level, just like the son of a barren woman” — remains an inconclusive or flawed reasoning. The Buddha too says:
Beings are spoken of as dream-like;
they’re not posited in terms of reality.
While no entities exist in a dream,
someone with a distorted mind clings to them.
In whatever way one might perceive a gandharva city,
no such city exists in the ten directions or elsewhere;
this city remains in name only.
The Tathāgata sees sentient beings like this.
Though someone thinking of water might see it,
there is no water in a mirage.
Likewise someone stirred up by fantasies
sees what is not beautiful as beautiful.
Just as on the surface of a clear mirror,
a reflection appears as a face
that is devoid of intrinsic reality,
so, Druma, understand all phenomena to be likewise.[723]
So as shown in these scriptural quotations, form and so on, while intrinsically unarisen, do become objects of perception in the everyday world, which is not the case with the son of a barren woman. So this [dispute] remains unresolved only for you. As for us, there is no dispute about this matter. We do not assert intrinsic arising in relation to form and so on on the conventional level and then negate it on the ultimate level.

Likewise, all things do not arise in and of themselves,

[Question:] Why in your system do you not [first] perceive form and so forth as arising by virtue of intrinsic nature on the conventional level and then negate it on the ultimate level?
[Reply:] Just as in itself the son of a barren woman has no arising, either in reality or in the context of conventions of the everyday world, likewise, all things — form and so on — do not arise in and of themselves, either through their essence or in terms of the everyday world. {283}
Given what is stated here, it is not at all the case that Madhyamaka defines conventional existence as existence from an erroneous perspective that apprehends things as arising through their essences.[724] We should also note that what is to be negated is explicitly qualified here with the proviso “arising through their essence.” It is from this perspective that the Buddha states that all phenomena are primordially tranquil, free of intrinsic arising, and naturally transcend sorrow. Therefore throughout all times no intrinsic arising exists whatsoever.
This is stated, for example, in the Cloud of Jewels Sutra:
When the wheel of Dharma was turned,
you, O Protector, revealed the truths that
phenomena are primordially tranquil,
unborn, and naturally transcendent of sorrow.[725]
The suchness of all phenomena is “tranquil” because it is the object of gnosis that has been calmed. The reason that it’s [the object of such gnosis] is because it is intrinsically “unborn.” And the reason for this in turn is that, were something to exist by virtue of intrinsic nature or an essence, it would then possess arising, but since no such intrinsic nature exists, what can arise? Therefore [the nature of things] is beyond sorrow; it is utterly pure. “Primordially” indicates that these phenomena are unborn not only on the stage of a yogi’s gnosis. Prior to this [stage], even in the context of worldly conventions, these phenomena are unarisen through their own essence. This is what “primordial” indicates; it is a synonym for the word “first.”

Buddhist [essentialist] schools do not argue that “if something does not exist on the ultimate level, it would not exist even on the conventional level.” Why is this so? This is because for them things such as vases do not exist in ultimate reality; yet they exist as well-known entities of the world — that is, they exist on the conventional level. Since all entities are likewise the same — they share the same status — the consequence that if they do not exist on the ultimate level they are like a barren woman’s son is not entailed.

The Commentary on the Treasury of Abhidharma explains this in the following:
That thing whose conception no longer applies when it’s dismantled into its parts has conventional existence. Take a vase, for example; when it is smashed into pieces, the conception of “a vase” no longer remains. Things whose conceptions no longer apply when they are mentally dissected also exist on the conventional level. Take water, for example; {284} when the mind reduces it to other properties — materiality and so on — the thought “water” no longer applies.
That which retains its conception even when destroyed as well as those that retain their conception even when reduced to other phenomena, these are ultimately existent. Take matter, for example. Here, whether reduced to atoms or when other properties such as taste are removed, the conception that it is in the nature of matter still applies. Extend this perspective similarly to [the aggregates of] feeling and the rest.[727]

Candrakīrti is saying that it would be illogical for these schools to assert that if something does not exist on the ultimate level, it would not exist on the conventional level either. He is not showing that what these schools identify as the two truths is in accord with the two that he himself presents. For what these schools define as “conventionally existent” invariably involves what the Madhyamaka understands as grasping at ultimate existence.

[Opponent:] Now if the four elements, which are the designative basis of “vase” and so on, have substantial reality, it would then be logical to use terms like “vase” and so on, for there will be a cause or basis for such designations.

[Reply:] This [assertion] too is untenable. For you cannot prove that the basis of designation has to be substantially real. For example, in dependence on the coming together of nominally existent things like face and so on, a mere construct, the mirror image is perceived. Similarly, in dependence on nominally existent pillars and so on “house” is designated, and on the basis of trees “forest” is imputed. So, just as in a dream one perceives the arising of sprouts that are in actuality unborn by nature, it is perfectly logical for the designative bases themselves to exist only nominally when it comes to all things that are themselves nominally existent. {285}

The simple fact is, rejection of arising from the four extremes does not undercut everyday convention of cause and effect. The Buddha states, for example:
Here are the terms that refer to phenomena. It is thus: if this exists, that comes about; this having arisen, that arises. Conditioned by ignorance volition arises . . .[729]

So just as the Buddha taught arising of mere conditionedness, the noble Nāgārjuna did the same. In particular, since Nāgārjuna upholds the view of dependent origination in terms of mutual dependence — the agent being dependent on the object of the act and so on — he used the phrase “other than this,” thus distinguishing his own from others’ views of arising. He states that this understanding should be extended to all entities that could possibly exist. This master, therefore, spoke of the need to posit arising in general, and how since arising from four extremes remains untenable, this implies that things arise through dependence. Nāgārjuna establishes this point through numerous strategies. {286} So those who assert, contrary to the standpoint of these traditions, “If things do not arise from any of the four extremes, there is no arising at all” are doing a good job of defiling through the stench of their false conceptualization the unexcelled tradition in which the meaning of profound dependent origination — the unrivaled proof to help realize emptiness — emerges in terms of the meaning of emptiness. This is what we should know.

Thus, when the dependent origination of mere conditionedness is propounded, not only does arising from the four possibilities such as no cause become impossible, it also reveals the impossibility of the objects conceived in terms such as the eternalist view that reifies intrinsic existence, the nihilist view that makes everyday operations [of cause and effect] untenable, permanence in the sense of something that existed at an earlier temporal stage persisting at subsequent temporal stages, impermanence in the sense of momentariness with intrinsically existent preceding and subsequent instances, and the essential existence of the absence of entities and nonentities.

In a sutra too it says:
Whatever has arisen from conditions is unborn;
it does not have the nature of arising.
That which depends on conditions, I declare empty.
One who understands emptiness is at ease.[734] {287}
“Having arisen from conditions” is the logical proof; the meaning of “unborn,” which is the thesis, is presented by the second line. The sense here is “not being born by virtue of an intrinsic nature,” so it is not the case that no qualification is applied to what is being negated. This is clear from the Descent into Laṅkā Sutra, as cited in Clear Words, where the Buddha himself explains his intention:
Mahāmati, with the intention that they did not arise intrinsically, I have taught that all phenomena are unborn.[735]
With his heart enthralled by the Buddha’s teaching — that it’s through this very reasoning of dependent origination, sovereign among all reasoning, that intrinsic existence is to be negated — Nāgārjuna in his numerous works, such as Fundamental Wisdom and Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning, praised the Buddha for having taught dependent origination. So no intelligent person would utter any foolishness such as “Because things arose through dependence, they are not produced.”

So long as one does not accept intrinsic existence of entities, how could something devoid of intrinsic existence arise from itself, from something other, and so on?

It would also be possible to conceive such a thing in terms of permanence in the sense of nondisintegration of what has arisen and annihilation in the sense of [real] disintegration.

Such concepts grasping in terms of extremes would be in order if one apprehended intrinsically real entities. That no such entity exists has already been analyzed on the basis of reasoning outlined above. So, without grasping at such an entity, those concepts tending to extremes would not come to be. For example, without fuel, the cause, there can be no fire, the effect. Thus by gaining familiarity with the truth of suchness as set forth [by the Buddha], a yogi who has attained the ārya path and sees suchness in terms of not seeing any appearances of conceptual elaboration, in him conceptualizations clinging to true existence of phenomena habituated to since beginningless time will come to an end. For example, through application of eye ointment, someone affected with myodesopsia could experience the effect — namely, the disappearance of the perception of floating hair. {288} It is not that the floating hair and so on he had previously experienced somehow transformed into something that now has a different nature.

Ordinary beings, who have no knowledge of this ultimate nature of things as explained above, are chained primarily by conceptualization grasping at extremes. In contrast, yogis, because of their comprehension of this ultimate reality, do not conceptualize in a distorted manner; they become free. Therefore the wise have said that the very cessation of conceptualization grasping at extremes through negating all their objects of apprehension is the fruit of refined analysis presented by the noble Nāgārjuna in his treatise on the Middle Way.

[Four] Hundred Stanzas too says:
If things exist intrinsically,
what benefits exists for seeing emptiness?
Seeing through conceptualization is bondage;
and this is what is being negated here.[736]
Āryadeva states here that were phenomena to exist intrinsically, this would then be their true character. In that case, it would be better to recognize that fact; no benefit would come from seeing the emptiness of intrinsic existence. However, since one is chained by seeing things via conceptualization — that is to say, via grasping at intrinsic existence — it’s the object that is clung to [by such conceptualization] that is being negated here in [Nāgārjuna’s] Treatise on the Middle Way.

In the commentary [on Āryadeva’s stanza by Candrakīrti] too, it reads, “‘Conceptualization’ refers to superimposing a sense of essential nature onto things that does not accord with reality.”[737] So Candrakīrti explains it in terms of projecting what does not exist in reality as having such an existence in reality. {289} So the “conceptualization” referred to here should not be understood as just any kind of conceptual cognition. It should be understood as the conceptualization of true existence and as conceptual thoughts grasping at the extremes.
With respect to conceptualization grasping at an extreme too, the term extreme can connote many things. The meaning here, however, is the sense of being free from extremes presented in [Kamalaśīla’s] Light of the Middle Way:
If, for Madhyamaka, the mind were to exist in any way as an ultimate entity with its own nature, then since it would have such a nature, how could clinging to it in terms of permanence or impermanence be an extreme? How could a correct mentation corresponding to the way things really are constitute a pitfall? This is illogical.[738]

<d e="2">
So the object that exists as apprehended does not constitute an extreme, and the cognition [that apprehends it], being an instance of correct mentation, cannot be a grasping at an extreme either. The “extreme” in the context here refers to an edge one can fall off, just as in ordinary language one speaks of a precipice as an “extreme” [edge] and falling off it as a falling off an edge. Here too we can speak of “falling to an extreme” where the apprehension of a position leads to the person’s downfall.[739] Since existence in terms of ultimate reality remains impossible even on the conventional level, the absence of existence in ultimate reality exists conventionally. So to hold everything as nonexistent on the ultimate level does not constitute grasping at the extreme of nihilism; and to repudiate it by saying “things do not exist in such a manner” does not constitute an elimination of the extreme of nihilism. However, if one grasps at the absence — the negation of intrinsic existence — as existing in ultimate reality, this would be falling into the extreme of nihilism. As such the elimination of such a standpoint would constitute elimination of the extreme of nihilism.

The fact that phenomena such as karma and its effects do exist on the conventional level cannot be undermined by any valid cognition. So to conceive them as having no existence or being nonexistent — both the object conceived as well the subject that grasps as such — are, respectively, the extreme of nihilism and grasping at the extreme of nihilism. To say that the Buddha has no faults is not an extreme of nonexistence, nor is the mind apprehending it as such nihilistic. Now the [denial of karma and its effects] is a nihilistic extreme through denigration, while the former [grasping at intrinsic existence of emptiness] is a nihilistic extreme through reification. Therefore, apart from the negations just referred to, in general the “extreme of existence” and “grasping at the extreme of existence” refer, respectively, to the object and the subject associated with grasping at phenomena as ultimately existent or as existing through intrinsic nature. To say that the Buddha has wisdom and compassion is not an extreme of existence, and to apprehend this does not constitute grasping at such an extreme. There are, however, some contexts in Madhyamaka treatises where ultimate existence is characterized as constituting the extreme of existence with respect to all phenomena.[740]

In view of these, the noble Nāgārjuna engaged in such extensive analysis through varieties of reasoning in his treatise on the Middle Way not out of fondness for debate or to outdo others. {290} This is something we should understand. When his Treatise on the Middle Way expounds suchness when engaging in critical analysis through reasoning, it’s aimed at helping people attain freedom with the thought “How I wish sentient beings would realize this suchness without error and attain liberation.”
[Question:] Is it not the case you, Madhyamaka, have cited all the arguments and analyses of those who propound existence of real entities and have refuted them in your treatise? Therefore the activity of the treatise is indeed to engage in disputation; how can you state that the cessation of conceptualizations alone is the fruit [of such analysis]?”
[Reply:] Truly this analysis was not undertaken for the sake of disputation. This said, when suchness is carefully presented, given the weakness of the opponents’ positions, the tenets of the opponents are unable to stand their own ground. So, just like darkness coming into contact with light, the opponents’ positions are undermined. This, however, is not our fault. So, if the postulations of other philosophical systems are undone in the course of expounding suchness, this is not a fault. Also Four Hundred Stanzas says:
This Dharma was not taught by the Tathāgata
for the sake of engaging in disputation;
however, just as fire burns its fuel,
it does burn clean the opponent’s challenges.[741]
For example, the goal of making a fire to boil water for drinking is not to produce ash or charcoal. These come about as a byproduct. Āryadeva thus explains it with this analogy.

If, however, one were to give teachings out of attachment to disputation, then one will undeniably feel hostility toward others’ flawed positions and attachment toward one’s own logically sound standpoint. There will be no end to thought processes involving anger and attachment. Why? Because attachment to one’s own view and likewise the feeling of aversion to others’ views become just thoughts that chain oneself and prevent turning away from such anger and attachment, thus increasing them further. In this way, one will remain trapped in bondage and never become free. Given that this teaching [on emptiness] was not taught for the sake of disputation, it is by eliminating attachment to one’s own standpoint and aversion toward positions and engaging in refined analysis through reasoning that one swiftly gains freedom. The Sixty Verses of Reasoning also states:
For these great beings beyond dispute,
they have no thesis at all; {291}
and for those who have no thesis,
how can there be a counter-thesis?[742]
And Four Hundred Stanzas says:
If you’re attached to your own position
and dislike others’ standpoints,
you’ll not travel to nirvana,
and dissolution of duality will not be.[743]
The King of Meditations Sutra too states:
He who experiences attachment upon hearing this teaching
and engenders anger upon hearing what is contrary to it,
crushed by pride and self-satisfaction, will be led astray;
because of his pride, he will meet with suffering.[744]
It states that how, if we do not analyze with an objective mind forsaking biases born of attachment and hostility to our own positions and those of others, analytic contemplation of philosophical tenets could itself become the basis for chaining ourselves ever more tightly to the cycle of existence. We should view this as extraordinary advice given to us from a compassionate heart.
Candrakīrti states that the text has, from the section on the refutation of self-arising up to this point, presented the selflessness of phenomena.[745] What he means by this is that the selflessness of conditioned phenomena has of course been explained in many different contexts and that the selflessness of unconditioned phenomena has also been presented here and there in the text. {292}

A yogi seeking to enter suchness and eliminate all the faults of afflictions will contemplate, “What lies at the root of this wandering in cycle of existence?” When he examines in this manner, and seeing with his wisdom that all afflictions, such as attachment, and faults — birth, aging, sickness, death, and so on — stem from the identity view grasping at the perishable collection: an afflicted intelligence that apprehends in terms of intrinsically existent “I” and “mine.” All of these [afflictions], without exception, are in fact effects of the identity view grasping at the perishable collection. When one sees this, the wish to eliminate this identity view will emerge. A person with sharp intelligence will at this point come to recognize that elimination of [the identity view] requires seeing how the self as conceived by this identity view has no objective existence, just as stated in the passages quoted above from Praise to the Ultimate Expanse and Four Hundred Stanzas.[746]
And when he examines what is the focus of clinging of this identity view, he will know that self or “I” in the thought “I am” is the focus of this identity view. This is because self is the object of “I”-grasping. This means the person who wishes to eliminate all the woes and faults needs to eliminate the identity view, which can be done by comprehending that the self — the focus of the identity view — has no self-existence or essential reality. Therefore the yogi will examine first, “Does this self, the object of my grasping at selfhood, have essential existence or not?” The yogi then engages in negation of such inherently real selfhood.
Since it’s through eliminating identity view that all the afflictions come to cease, this kind of critical inquiry into the nature of self is a means to attain true liberation.

The Compendium of Training states:
The emptiness of persons is thus thoroughly established. Since the root has been cut off, none of the afflictions will ever reemerge. This is as explained in the Secrets of the Tathāgata Sutra:
Śāntimati, it is thus. When a tree is felled from its roots, all its limbs and leaves as well as all the tiny branches come to dry up. So too, Śāntimati, when the identity view is extinguished, all the afflictions and their derivatives come to be extinguished.[747]
{293} On this statement [that identity view is the root of all afflictions], all the learned masters agree. We should recognize, therefore, that whether according to Mahayana or Hīnayāna, we must proceed as follows. First, we must comprehend well the defects of cyclic existence and contemplate them. We must then identify what is the root of this [cyclic existence], and when the wish to relinquish it has arisen, we must find the view of selflessness — the negation of the object conceived by that root [identity view] — flawlessly and cultivate familiarity with this truth.

and from karmic acts, birth comes to be.[748]
So if the text states that grasping at true existence of the aggregates — grasping at the selfhood of phenomena — is the root of cyclic existence, and here [in Entering the Middle Way], however, it says that the identity view grasping at the perishable collection is the root of cyclic existence, these two statements are contradictory, for it is illogical for there to be two different roots of cyclic existence.

[Reply:] There is no such fault. This system [of Candrakīrti] distinguishes the two forms of self-grasping on the basis of their distinct focal objects, but they do not have two different cognitive aspects with regard to their mode of apprehension. Both forms of self-grasping share the same cognitive aspect with regard to their apprehension — they both grasp [their objects] to exist by virtue of intrinsic characteristics. The illogicality of there being two roots of cyclic existence refers to any assertion that involves positing two roots of cyclic existence with two distinct modes of apprehending their objects. Therefore, when grasping at the selfhood of phenomena is shown to be the cause of identity view, then two subclasses within ignorance are being described as a cause and effect. And when both are portrayed as being the roots of afflictions, they are shown to be at the root of all the afflictions that have modes of apprehension distinct from each other. This characteristic is possessed by both [kinds of ignorance]; there is thus no contradiction [in maintaining that they are both roots of cyclic existence]. This is analogous to the fact it is not contradictory for the preceding and subsequent instances of ignorance to be roots of cyclic existence.

The self is the consumer in that it is the experiencer of happiness, suffering, and so on; it is a permanent entity, and it is a non-creator with respect to the manifestations; it is devoid of the qualities of activity (rajas), darkness (tamas), and purity (sattva), and because it is omnipresent, it is inert.

The primal substance is not a manifestation;

The “primal substance” (prakṛti) is so called because it creates the effects. When does it create them? It does so when it perceives the desire of the person (puruṣa). For instance, when the desire arises to enjoy sense objects such as sound, the primal substance sees the person’s desire and connects with the person. From this connection, sound and its like are brought forth by the primal substance. The process by which this occurs is the following. From primal substance the great [intellect (buddhi)] appears, from this the I-maker (ahaṃkāra), from this the sixteen — eleven faculties and five sense objects — arise; and from the sixteen the five elements appear, in that from the five objects of sound and so on emerge the five elements. This then is the process by which they come into being. The phrase “is not a manifestation” indicates that primal substance is a creator of the effects alone; it is not itself a manifestation, like the great elements and so on. As for the seven such as the great elements, they are both creators as well as manifestations. These seven are substances (pradhāna) with respect to their own manifestations, while they remain manifestations in relation to the primal substance. The sixteen such as the intellect are manifestations alone. The person, on the other hand, is neither a creator {295} nor a manifestation.

It’s through being influenced by thoughts that the five senses such as the ears perceive objects such as sound, which are then latched on to by the intellect. It’s these objects latched on to by the intellect that come into the awareness of the person (puruṣa). In this way, those with desire to experience the objects partake in their experience. With lesser attachment and through reducing attachment by recognizing the defects of sense objects, one becomes free from attachment. At that point the individual will cultivate the meditative absorptions in their proper sequence and, on this basis, attain superior knowledge of divine vision. When he looks at the primal substance with such divine eyes, the primal substance will become embarrassed, like the bashful wife of another man. Because of this, primal substance will not associate with the self (puruṣa)[750] and will part from it. All the manifestations too will totally dissolve into primal substance progressively in exactly the reverse sequence of their origination. When at this point all manifestations have disappeared, person (puruṣa) alone would remain. This, then, is known as true release. Such a self (puruṣa), because it remains utterly alone at all times, it is referred to as being “permanent.”

One might ask, of the twenty-five categories of reality, which ones are agents and which ones are not? Activity, darkness, and purity are the three qualities. Activity has the nature of mobility and activity, darkness the nature of heaviness and blanketing, and purity has the nature of lightness and illumination. Pleasure, pain, and indifference are synonyms for these [three qualities]. The state of their equilibrium is known as primal substance, for in that state the qualities remain dominant, and there is total peace. So the stage where these qualities are not exhibited in manifestations is the primal substance. From this primal substance appears “the great,” with the word “great” being a synonym for intellect, which is something to which both external objects and internal representations appear. From the great intellect appears the I-maker, which has three kinds — that which is manifest, that of activity, and that of darkness. It’s from the manifest I-maker the five “that alone” — the five sense objects of form, sound, smell, taste, and tactility — come into being. From these sense objects emerge the elements — the earth, water, fire, wind, and space elements. From the I-maker of activity emerge the five action faculties, which are speech, hands, legs, anus, and genitals, and the five mental faculties, which are the faculties of eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and tactile sense, as well the faculty of mind, which shares the nature of being both [action faculty and bodily faculty]. {296} Altogether, there are eleven that emerge from this [I-maker of activity]. The darkness I-maker serves as the basis of activity of the other two I-makers. Of these categories, the seven — the great intellect, the I-maker, and the five sense objects — are both substances and manifestations; the ten faculties, mental organ, and the five elements are manifestations alone; while the primal substance is substance alone. This is their basic tenet.

Just as Sāṃkhya accepts [the existence of] self, likewise, on the basis of slight and minor variations [in their conception] of self, the systems of tīrthikas diverge into different positions. For example, the Vaiśeṣikas speak of nine attributes of the self — (1) intellect, (2) pleasure, (3) pain, (4) desire, (5) aversion, (6) effort, (7) merit, (8) demerit, and (9) inhering force. Of these, intellect apprehends objects; pleasure experiences objects that are desirable, while pain is its opposite; desire is the yearning for the objects one desires; aversion is the turning away from objects that are undesirable; effort refers to the mind’s skillfulness in accomplishing its aims; merit is that which gives rise to higher rebirth and the definite goodness [of liberation], while demerit is its opposite; inhering force refers to that which arises from cognition and also serves as the cause of cognition.

So long as these nine qualities of self come together in the self and remain present, one will revolve in the cycle of existence pursuing virtuous and nonvirtuous karmic actions produced by these qualities of the self. When, through an awareness perfectly realizing [the nature of] the person (puruṣa), one is able to terminate these qualities such as intellect and so on from their roots, one will abide in one’s own true nature and attain freedom. Such a self is [according to Vaiśeṣika] permanent, creator of the effects, the consumer that experiences the fruits [of karma], and endowed with qualities. Because the self is omnipresent, they speak of it as being devoid of activity as well. Some Vaiśeṣikas do accept that such a self exhibits the activities of expansion and contraction.

Proponents of the Vedānta school assert that, just as the space in all the separate pots are one, in the same manner, because of the multiplicity of its supports — namely, the bodies [of beings] — one single self (atman) appears as diverse. Because the Commentary states, “On the basis of slight and minor differentiations in [their conceptions of] the self, the systems of the tīrthikas diverge into different positions,”[751] some [commentators] explain that, according to this tradition [of Candrakīrti], the non-Buddhist schools evolved into different schools as subdivisions of the Sāṃkhya school. {297} This represents a failure to understand the meaning of the text.

Such a self described in diverse ways in each one of those texts of the non-Buddhist schools simply does not exist the way they postulate. For it is devoid of arising — that is to say, it is unborn — which is a logical reason or inference the non-Buddhist schools themselves accept as valid. The example is like a barren woman’s son. In this syllogism, the logical reason actually negates the explicitly stated subject, but this does not lead to a problem because, crucially, both the logical reason and the probandum are mere negations.[752] This self postulated by others also cannot be the basis for innate grasping at an “I”; the logical reason and example for this are the same as before.

The phrase “the basis of innate I-grasping” indicates that, with respect to the two aspects [of the grasping mind] — the focal object and the apprehended aspect — this [permanent] self cannot be the focus of innate I-grasping. The focal object [of that innate grasping] is the mere “I,” the person, and so on, and since we accept these to be conditioned entities, it would be contradictory to assert them as being unborn. The apprehended aspect [of that grasping], however, is the selfhood of person, which does not exist even on the conventional level, so there is no contradiction in asserting this as unborn. In view of these points, those who insist that in this system [of Candrakīrti] the self of persons does exist on the conventional level do so without discerning the central tenets of this school and fail to differentiate the focal object from the apprehending aspect of the identity view. Such talk is just whimsy. So negating the existence of self and rejecting it being the object of apprehension of I-grasping must be undertaken on the basis of qualifying what is to be negated. Not only this, we should also understand that these two [self and the apprehended object of self-grasping] are rejected even on the conventional level. The phrase “the self does not exist” in this context must be understood as the nonexistence of a substantially real self. {298}
Not only do these two, the logical reason [of being unborn] and the example [son of a barren woman], negate these two objects of negation, they also indicate how all the attributes of the self postulated by the non-Buddhists do not exist either.

Since all the various attributes of such a self as proposed

This is because this logical proof that “it is unarisen,” which the non-Buddhists themselves accept, has undone all the various attributes of such a self as proposed in one treatise after another by the tīrthikas — Sāṃkhya, Vaiśeṣika, and others. So none of the attributes of their self, asserted by Sāṃkhya and Vaiśeṣika as described above, remain tenable. They should be refuted in this way. When it comes to dealing with all the proponents of self (atman), this reason “being arisen” and the example “son of a barren woman” help eliminate the nature and attributes of the self conceived by these schools.[753]
Thus no self separate from the aggregates exists, for there is no apprehension of self alone by itself apart from grasping at the aggregates. The point here is this: If the self were a different entity from the aggregates, it would then have no relation with the aggregates, since neither form of logical relation would be possible.[754] In that case, just as one can apprehend a piece of cloth on its own without apprehending a vase, self too should be graspable by itself, yet this has never been observed. As Fundamental Wisdom says:
It’s illogical for the self to be different
from the appropriated [aggregates],
for if it’s different, it should be graspable
without the appropriated; this is not so.[755]
And:
If it’s different from the aggregates,
it will lack the attributes of the aggregates.[756]
The phrase “the appropriated” refers here to the aggregates.
There is also the following further objection [against the non-Buddhist views of self]:

It is also unacceptable for this self that is said to be different from the aggregates to be the basis or focus for beings’ “I”-clinging since beginningless time. For even in those sentient beings unaware of such self as conceived by the non-Buddhist schools — that is to say, without grasping at self in such terms — the identity view is present. Through their tendencies toward clinging, they do experience [the world] in terms of “I” and “mine.” This objection is not a repetition of the previous one in the line “It also cannot be the basis for grasping at an ‘I’” (6.122c). Previously, it was the substantially real self that was negated as the focus of the identity view. Here, however, it is [a self that is] a separate entity from the aggregates that is being rejected as the focus of the identity view.
One might think that even beings ignorant about the self characterized by permanence, unarising, and so on {299} will still grasp such [an eternal] self in terms of an “I” because of their past habituation.
[Reply:] This cannot be so. For it is only those whose minds have been influenced by inferior philosophical tenets who grasp at a self that is distinct from the aggregates, who take this as the basis of their “I”-clinging. [So the root text says:]

For example, those sentient beings who have spent many eons in the animal realm and so on in the past and have not turned away from birth in the animal states do not perceive this unborn permanent entity postulated by the non-Buddhist schools. One sees that “I”-clinging operates in those beings as well. Having recognized this fact, what discerning person would cling to the self postulated by the non-Buddhists as the basis of “I”-grasping? There is thus no self that is separate from the aggregates, none at all. The “and so on” includes beings born in the hells and other such realms.

The fellow Buddhist schools assert the following. Since no self that is a different entity from the aggregates exists, the aggregates are the focal object, as opposed to the apprehension aspect, of the identity view grasping at the perishable collection. There are two possible candidates that can be determined to be such a focal object — something distinct from the aggregates or something internal, namely the aggregates themselves — and of these the first is unsuitable. {300} Therefore, they claim, the self is nothing but one’s own aggregates. This is the position of the Saṃmatīya school, which includes such subschools as the Vātsīputrīya and others. Among them, some Saṃmatīyas assert all five aggregates to be the basis or the focus of the identity view and say that clinging to self arises on the basis the five aggregates as well. This is as stated by the Buddha in the following:
O monks, be it a renunciant or a brahman, whosoever views with the thought of “I am” views so only in terms of these five appropriated aggregates.[757]
They say that in order to point out to the non-Buddhists that their view [of self] pertains to a collection that is perishable and not to a [fixed] “self” or “mine,” the Buddha characterized the views that take the forms of “I” and “mine” as the “view of perishable collection.” So on the basis of the Buddha’s statement that one views [self] in term of the five appropriated aggregates, these Buddhist schools assert all five aggregates to be the focal object of the identity view.
Some other Saṃmatīyas hold the mind alone to be the self. They assert this on the basis of passages like this one below, where the mind is referred to by the term “self”:
You are your own savior;
who else can be your savior?
Through taming his self well,
the wise person attains the higher realms.[758]
On what basis do we know this? Because there is no self apart from the aggregates and because another sutra declares the disciplining of mind:
A disciplined mind is excellent;
a disciplined mind leads to happiness.[759]

So they assert that the mind, which is basis of “I”-grasping, constitutes the self. In Blaze of Reasoning too it says:
So we too, on the conventional level, actually apply the term self to consciousness. In that it is consciousness that appropriates rebirth, it is the self. It [self] is thus designated on the body and the collection of faculties.[760]
So some sutras state that a disciplined mind leads to happiness, while others state that one attains higher rebirth by disciplining the self. They point to these as scriptural sources for positing mind as the self. For their logical reason, they argue that it’s the self that appropriates the aggregates and consciousness that takes rebirth, hence consciousness is posited to be the self. Since this master [Bhāviveka] does not accept foundation consciousness, the consciousness that appropriates bodily existence has to be the mental consciousness. {301} This is the same for others who do not accept foundation consciousness. Those who accept foundation consciousness assert this foundation consciousness alone to define the person. Although these [Buddhists schools] do accept that śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas realize the person to be devoid of substantial reality, they do not admit that the two realize the two types of consciousness to have no substantial reality. So, for them, the proposition that the person does not exist as substantially real is from the point of view of person itself; it is not asserted from the perspective of the consciousness that is defined as the person.

Now if the position that one’s five aggregates are the self is true, then since they, the aggregates, are multiple, even in the case of a single person, the self would be multiple. If one’s view is that consciousness alone is the self, since there are multiple classes of consciousness, such as eye consciousness and so on, and numerous instances of consciousness arise and cease in every moment, the self too will become numerous as well. Here, in the Commentary, Candrakīrti levels this consequence of multiple selves ostensibly against the first of these two positions [all five aggregates constitute the self]. But since the fault extends to both positions, [the objection] can be applied in either case.[761]

Such a consequence cannot be raised against someone who accepts mere multiplicity and sameness in nature; the objection is leveled against a view that holds self and aggregates to be identical, with no separateness whatsoever. The opponent, however, does not assert this from the outset. Being one in nature yet conceptually distinct is not a problem within a framework that recognizes these to be unreal. But for the standpoint that accepts self and aggregates to have true existence, two things that have identical natures must be indivisibly identical in all respects. Once this consequence has been forced, one can level the consequence that either there must be multiple selves or the aggregates must be singular. However, the opponent does not actually accept the self to be many, given the scriptural statement, “When a sentient being is born, a person alone is born.”[762]

For you, the self would also be substantial, or real. What you refer to as the aggregates are diverse, such as form, and have evolved into different entities on the basis of their past [and present] substances. {302} So because you refer to these [aggregates] alone as the self, self will be substantially existent in your view.[763] However, given the following statements, the opponent does not assert [self to be substantially existent]:
O monks, these five, for instance, are mere name, mere conventions, and mere designations: “past,” “future,” “space,” “nirvana,” and “person.”[764]

Similarly:
Just as one speaks of a “chariot”
in dependence upon a collection of parts,
we speak conventionally of a “sentient being”
in dependence upon the aggregates.[765]
Furthermore, [if aggregates are the self,] viewing the self in terms of the aggregates by the view grasping the perishable collection would pertain to a substantial reality in that it would take something substantially real as its object. In that case, [this identity view] would be not an error, for it would be just like perceptions of blue and yellow. This means when the identity view is eliminated, it will not be in a way that ceases all subsequent moments in a continuous process. Rather, it will be eliminated only through relinquishing the attachment that is drawn to the identity view, just as [one would abandon attraction to] perceptions of blue and yellow.[766]

Furthermore, if one’s own aggregates are the self, according to you [Buddhist essentialists], the self would also definitely terminate at the moment of attaining nirvana without residue, when all five aggregates come to cease. Your view will therefore become a nihilistic view grasping at an extreme. For you maintain that to apprehend what is held to be the self as eternal or as having an end is to view it in terms of an extreme. Furthermore, during the moments prior to attaining nirvana, just as the aggregates arise and disintegrate moment by moment, the self too would rise and vanish every instant, with each instant essentially distinct from every other. Just as when one recalls a past life, one does not do so with the thought “This body of mine existed in the past,” the Buddha too would not make statements such as “On that occasion and at that time I was the king known as Māndhātṛ.”[767] This is because the self of that time no longer existed in the present, for just like the body, the self too had ceased. You, however, have accepted that a self that is intrinsically different from that past self has arisen in this life.

Fundamental Wisdom too says:
The self is not the appropriated [aggregates],
which come into being and disintegrate.
Otherwise, just like the appropriated [aggregates],
the appropriator [self] would do so as well.[768]
And:
If the self were the aggregates,
it would arise and disintegrate.[769]
Now, if prior and subsequent moments [of self] are distinct by virtue of their essences, in that case, with no [continuous] self as an agent, karma too would not exist, since it would lack any basis to support its perpetuation. This would mean none of its effects could be, and karma would have no relation to its effects. {303} You might think there is no problem because the effects of karma created in preceding moments are experienced in the subsequent moments. In that case, since the fruitional effects of karma acquired by one will be experienced by a different person, acts done by one would bear fruits reaped by others. In other words, the fruits gathered by someone with one mental continuum would be consumed by a person of a different mental continuum. This would mean that a karmic deed already performed will be wasted and that one would experience the effects of karmic deeds done by another.[770]

In Fundamental Wisdom too it says:
For if [the present self] were indeed different from the past,
then it would exist even if the past self [did not exist].
Likewise the past self would continue to persist,
or, without it having died, the present self would be born.
There would be annihilation [of the past self],
karmic acts would become wasted, and the fruits of action
done by one person would be reaped by another.
This and similar consequences would follow.[771]
So if the prior and the subsequent instances [of self] are intrinsically distinct, it would be illogical for [a later instance] to be contingent upon an earlier instance. As such, [the later instance] could come into being even without its preceding instance having taken place. And since the prior moment of self would remain just as it is, this would mean that one could take birth in this life even without the death of that earlier self.

You, the opponent, may say that although the preceding and subsequent instances are distinct from each other, in reality they share the same continuity, so there is no fault. This too is untenable.

Fundamental Wisdom too says:
If the god is different from the human [of this life],
[the self] will then become an impermanent thing.
Furthermore, if the god and the human are different,
there cannot be [a shared] continuum.[772]
Since a single shared continuum is untenable for things that are intrinsically distinct, the following consequences cannot be avoided: (1) a person will encounter [the effects of] karmic acts not done by himself, and (2) karmic deeds done will come to be wasted. Therefore the aggregates and the mind cannot be the self. {304}

Not only is the self, as demonstrated by the reasoning just presented, not the aggregates or the mind as demonstrated by the reasoning just presented, it is also inappropriate for the aggregates to be the self given that all Buddhist schools accept that views such as “The world is finite” and so on pertain to unanswered questions. “And so on” includes these views: “The world is not finite,” “It is both,” and “It is neither”; “The world is eternal,” “It is impermanent,” “It is both,” and “It is neither”; and “The Tathāgata exists after his death,” “He does not exist,” “Both,” and “Neither.” On top of these twelve are the two views “What is body is life force” and “Body is one thing and life force is something different.” All Buddhist schools enumerate these as views to which answers have not been declared.[773]
If the term “world” refers to the aggregates, the Buddha should have answered that the world is impermanent, since your own position maintains that the aggregates arise and disintegrate. Furthermore, since, according to you, the aggregates do not exist in the aftermath of nirvana, the Buddha should have answered that the world is finite and also that the Tathāgata exists after his death. Since the Buddha refused to answer questions like “Is the world finite?” it is therefore inappropriate to assert that the aggregates are the self.
Here “life force” is a synonym for “self,” and the question about the world [being finite or infinite] is asked from the perspective of self. If the question were asked to discover whether there is an inner self that is the agent, since such a thing does not exist, no answers could be given about its attributes. If, on the other hand, the Buddha were to answer the question from the point of view of self as a mere designation, those posing the questions would have no means to realize selflessness. So the question is left unanswered. {305}

[Reply:] It would be difficult to respond effectively here if one fails to appreciate the subtleties of reasoning. So let me explain. When the opponent asserts the aggregates and the mind to be the self, they do so on the basis of searching for the true referents of the terms without understanding that self and person are posited merely by virtue of the power of conventions. Because of this, the assertion that the aggregates or the mind is the self implies that they exist as the self in some essential manner. So when the yogi directly perceives there to be no self, given that he realizes such a self to be utterly nonexistent in any manner, the opponent is vulnerable to the charge that the yogi will perceive the nonexistence of everything alleged to be the self — the aggregates as well as the mind. However, for the system according to which everything is posited in nominal terms of mere designation, where one does not posit things on the basis of searching for the true referents of the terms, this problem [of yogis seeing the nonexistence of the aggregates] does not arise at all.

[Opponent:] Now, when the term self is used in the context of relating karma and its effects, since a self distinct from the aggregates is impossible, this term refers only to the aggregates. However, when the yogi perceives the absence of self, {306} the term [self] in that context refers only to the self as an inner agent as postulated by the non-Buddhists. Therefore, when the yogi sees the self to be nonexistent, he perceives the absence of such an inner agent and sees only mental formations. So there is no fault of the yogi seeing the nonexistence of entities such as the aggregates.

[Reply:] If you say that when the yogi sees no-self, it is the eternal self as an inner agent that has been negated, given that you maintain a particular view, you cannot use the term self to refer to something else in other contexts.

Now perhaps you insist that in the context of relating karma and its effects, it is not the case that the term self refers to the way it is defined by non-Buddhist schools, so there is no danger of undermining your own standpoint. This too is untenable. There is no rationale for you to act so capriciously, saying things like “Here the self is the inner agent” and “In the context of karma and its effects, it is the aggregates.” If you say [further] that in the context of karma and its effects, an inner-agent self that is the agent of karmic acts and the experiencer of their effects is impossible, I have already explained before how the term self cannot be applied to the aggregates.

So if you maintain that in the context of the statement “All phenomena are devoid of selfhood” the term self does not refer to the aggregates, then you must admit that it does not refer to the aggregates in the context of karma and its effects either.

According to you, the yogi who sees no-self directly has not realized the suchness of form and so on; this is because he would have perceived merely the absence of an eternal self as conceived by the non-Buddhists. And so he would continue to engage with form and so on through objectification of their true existence, giving rise to attachment and so on in relation to form and so forth. For, according to you, he knows not form and so forth’s true nature or suchness.
For example, simply saying “A bird is [feeding] on the flower stamen” without actually experiencing the sweetness of the stamen oneself, one does not perceive its sweet taste. {307} Similarly, the yogi may see the aggregates to be devoid of a permanent self, but there is nothing about the true nature of form and so on that the yogi comes to realize subsequently that he had not known already. Also, just because there is no bird feeding does not mean that the person enjoying the sweet taste of the stamen does not perceive that taste or that he lacks the apprehension of that taste being indeed sweet. Similarly, in someone who perceives true existence of form and so on yet sees the absence of a permanent self, what cause is there for such a person to relinquish attachment and so on toward form and so on? There would be none. As for the person who seeks to eliminate attachment to form and so on through seeing the absence of a permanent self too, he does not seek the objects that lead to happiness with the thought that this [permanent] inner agent person is real; nor does he shun encountering undesirable objects out of a fear that this inner permanent [self] might come to suffer. So such a person would have no means to eliminate attachment and so forth, and he will not gain freedom from the cycle of existence. Therefore [the yogi you speak of] will be similar to the non-Buddhists. This, then, is the import of Candrakīrti’s argument here.[774]

{308} The opponent might assert that they are upholding the validity of the scriptures, which show the aggregates to be the self, and so are not vulnerable to the reasoning of the logicians. For example, the Buddha has stated:
O monks, be it a renunciant or a brahman, whosoever views with the thought of “I am” views so only in terms of these five appropriated aggregates.[775]
So because the Buddha has said the aggregates are the self, you assert the aggregates to be the self. But this statement does not present the aggregates to be the self. What does it do then? The intention of the Buddha here is to reject a self that is separate from the aggregates as the focus of the identity view, and this is done by using the modifier, the excluding particle “only.” So this [statement] is made to refute the tenets of the non-Buddhist schools from the point of view of the conventional truth and to present the conventionally existent self in an undistorted manner.

[Reply:] Because in other sutras he, the Buddha, said form is not self and so on, so he spoke about his rejection of form and so on as being the self. You may ask, “How do these other sutras present such a rejection?” In that it has been stated in other sutras that form is not self, and feelings are not self, discrimination too is not, mental formations are not self, and consciousness too is not self as well, so the sutra statement “Whosoever views with the thought of ‘I am’ views so only in terms of these five appropriated aggregates” does not indicate that the Buddha accepts that the aggregates are the self. It is definitely the assertion of a self that is separate from the aggregates that is rejected by the modifier “only.”

[Question:] It may be that the words “views only” in that sutra rejects a self that possesses separate reality. Nevertheless, the aggregates are presented clearly to be the object of focus of the identity view with the phrase “views only in terms of these aggregates,” since the sutra states that one views all five aggregates. So it is the intention of that sutra to declare that the aggregates are the focus of identity view.

[Reply:] If this is so, it will contradict the other sutras that state that the five aggregates are not the self. Because within the two dimensions of that identity view — its focal object and apprehended aspect — anything that is the focus of the identity view must necessarily be [conceived as] a self. Therefore the meaning of what is stated in the second [group of] sutras is not vulnerable to any logical objection. As for the opposite thesis, objections have already been leveled against it, and more will be presented below. Therefore it is not the case that the first sutra shows the aggregates to be the focal object of identity view. It is clear, therefore, the Buddha’s statement “one views the aggregates” indicates the focal object is a self conceived in dependence upon the aggregates. {309} [Both options] — something that is different from the aggregates and the aggregates themselves — have been negated as the focus of our grasping at self.

Furthermore, on the basis of the sutras that reject “aggregates such as form” as being the self and that demonstrate how it’s a dependently designated self that is the focus of the identity view that appropriates the aggregates, we should understand that an intrinsically existent appropriator of the aggregates has also been negated. For the statement that form is not self and so on must be understood as having been made in the context of contemplating suchness of things. Thus if there is no intrinsically existent appropriator, then the aggregates — things to be appropriated by that self — cannot possess intrinsic existence either. In this way it becomes logical for someone to become freed from the attachment grasping at the true existence of phenomena such as form and so on.

So, through carefully comparing the sutras, we should reject that something different from the aggregates or the aggregates themselves are the focal object of grasping at self. On this basis, we should appreciate the unique presentation of the selflessness of persons, with self [or person] defined purely in terms of everyday linguistic conventions in dependence upon the aggregates alone. This understanding, which has been extracted through undistorted scriptural sources as well as logical reasoning, represents the perfect intention of the sutras. This is something that, despite their best efforts, many learned masters of lower or higher schools within our own fold who have interpreted the sutras have failed to elucidate. On the basis of this understanding [of the selflessness of persons], the selflessness of phenomena, whereby other phenomena are also posited as lacking a self, is elucidated in exactly the same manner. In these ways, [Candrakīrti] lays bare the extremely subtle intentions of the blessed Buddha. We should therefore strive to appreciate well all of the uncommon understandings of this most learned master.

[Opponent:] Although this statement that “one views the five aggregates alone” indicates the aggregates to be the self from an affirmative perspective, it does not state each and every aggregate to be individually the self. If asked, “What is it then?” we would say when it’s stated [in the sutra] that the aggregates are the self, this refers to the collection, not the individual aggregates {310} — that is to say, not each and every single aggregate is presented to be the self. For example, when one says, “The trees are the forest,” the sentence does not express each and every single tree to be the forest, otherwise every single tree would be a forest!
In this way, the opponent cites an analogy that is established for the other party in the debate. Thus it is the [aggregates as a] collection that is the self, they say.
[Reply:] The Buddha has stated the self to be the “savior,” the “tamed,” and the “witness,” and for you, the mere collection cannot be the savior, the tamed, or the witness. Furthermore, the collection itself cannot be the self because it does not exist as a substantial reality.
The Buddha spoke of the self to be the savior and so on in the following:
You are your own savior;
you are your own enemy too.
When doing good or evil,
you are your own witness.[776]
In this stanza [the self] is spoken of as the savior and as the witness. He also states:
Through taming his self well,
the wise person attains the higher realms.[777]

[Opponent:] Since the collection does not exist as a different entity from the components of that collection, the effects of being the savior and so on can be seen to belong [in actual fact] to the components of the collection. So it is tenable for [the collection of aggregates] to be the savior, the tamed, and the witness.
[Reply:] As to your applying the term self, sometimes to the collection of the aggregates and sometimes to the aggregates that are the components of the collection, I have already raised objections above against your capricious application of the word self to different things.[778] Still further problems arise. Were the collection of aggregates the self, there is the problem that the mere collection of chariot parts lying together unassembled would constitute the chariot. Insofar as they are posited in terms of a collection of their parts, a chariot and the self are alike. This similarity is presented in the following sutra:
What is called “self” is Māra’s thought,
and this would be your view.
This formation of aggregates is empty;
in this, there is no sentient being.
Just as one speaks of a “chariot”
in dependence upon a collection of parts,
we speak conventionally of a “sentient being”
in dependence upon the aggregates.[779] {311}

As explained above, since the sutra states that the sentient being is designated in dependence upon the collection of aggregates, the mere convergence or the collection of aggregates cannot be the self. To elucidate this by means of a syllogism: “That which is designated in dependence upon a collection cannot be the mere collection of the parts, which are the appropriated, because it’s dependently designated, like the derivatives of elements.” For example, derivative entities like blue color and so on and the eyes and so on are designated through taking the elements as the basis, yet these two [types of entities] are not the mere convergence of the [constitutive] elements. Similarly, that which has the nature of being designated by taking the aggregates as the basis cannot be the mere collection of the aggregates. This would be illogical.
[Opponent:] Granted, if the sutra had stated “in dependence upon the collection aggregates,” the collection could not be the self. However, the sutra only says “in dependence upon the aggregates,” so this sutra cannot be an authoritative source to posit the collection of aggregates to be the basis of the [term] person.
[Response:] This is incorrect. The context of the analogy includes the line “in dependence upon the collection of parts,” which explains how a chariot is posited on the basis of the collection of its parts. So when an analogy is drawn with a chariot, although the word collection is not explicitly mentioned in the line “in dependence upon the aggregates,” it is patently clear that it needs to be brought out [in the meaning]. This is how learned masters [like Candrakīrti] bring out the force of every single word of the sutras, and were we able to understand [the meaning of the sutras] in such a refined manner, it would fill our mind with joy.
If the opponent says, “There is no entailment [to your reasoning], for there are counterexamples, such as a vase,” we would say that no such counterexamples in fact exist. Even such things as a vase do not exist as mere collections of form and so on. They too are equally subject to critical analysis, just like the self. This demonstrates that just as the self cannot be identified with the collection of its parts, vases and so on too cannot be identified merely in terms of the collection of their parts, and that the two cases are analogous. {312}

[Opponent:] The mere collection of wheels and so on are not the chariot. So what is? Wheels and so on acquire the name “chariot” when they come together and acquire a special configuration. Similarly, the self is simply the configuration, the shape, of the aggregates that belong to the continuum of the sentient being, its body and so on.
[Reply:] Since such a shape is a property only of physical things, this would mean, for you then, it is the body alone that would be the self. The self could not be identified with the collection of mind and so on, the “and so on” indicating the mental factors. For they — the mind and its derivative mental factors — possess no shape configuration at all because they are not physical. So the argument goes.

There are other problems as well. That which appropriates a self is defined as the appropriator, and that which is appropriated — the five aggregates — are defined as the appropriated. In that it is illogical for these two things to be one, the collection [of aggregates] cannot be posited as the self. If, on the other hand, the collection of aggregates such as form is the self, this would mean the object of an act and the agent of the act are the same. This, however, cannot be accepted.

If you think, “The agent that appropriates the collected aggregates doesn’t exist, but the object of the act — namely, the mere collection of the aggregates, the appropriated — does,” this too is incorrect. For without a doer, the cause, there is no act done.

In commenting on “remaining entities,” Clear Words says:
The produced and producer, going and goer, viewed and viewer, characteristic and the characterized, that which will come into being and that which brings it about, the parts and the whole, qualities and the bearer of these qualities, valid cognition and the object of cognition — all such entities without exception are negated as having intrinsic existence. Those with discerning mind should understand that they are established through mutual dependence alone.[783]
So [Candrakīrti] accepts act and agent in general, and the act and agency associated with valid cognition and the object of cognition in particular, to be devoid of intrinsic existence and to have [only] contingent reality. We should understand that [this Candrakīrti system] has a unique way of defining contingency in terms of mutual dependence.

As for the term “the appropriated” (upādāna) here, when the lūṭa affix is applied to the root word for an entity upaṭra, it gives the form the “appropriated” because it appropriates. Since the entities do not come into being without the factors that bring them about, so both the act of appropriating as well as that which appropriates are posited as “appropriated.” If you say, “Since the lūṭa affix expresses only the act of appropriating, how does it express the object of the act of appropriation?” As it is stated in the Sanskrit treatises that “krita and lūṭa applies in most instances,” it is true in most cases. However, when a lūṭa affix is used, it is not a contradiction for it to express an object of the act as well.[784]

Thus Nāgārjuna explains how the self is not different from the aggregates; how it is not the appropriated [aggregates] themselves; how it’s also not the case that the self is not dependent on apprehending the appropriated [aggregates]; and how self is not nonexistent as well.

There is, however, the following statement in Ultimate Emptiness Sutra:
An agent is not observed, yet karmic acts exist, and so do fruitional effects.[786]
Here too, we should understand that what the sutra negates is an intrinsically existent agent; we should not understand that it is rejecting [the agent] that is part of everyday convention and designated through dependence. That this is so has been extensively stated [by the Buddha], such as in the following:
This person who follows the pattern of ignorance will engage through volition in the creation of merits as well . . .[787]

In Rules of Exposition, [Vasubandhu] says that the first cited sutra is not compatible with the proponents of identitylessness but is compatible with the Cittamātra standpoint.[788] This said, according to the method for defining the person by this supreme tradition [of Candrakīrti], even on the conventional level no agent exists separate from the aggregates. Yet when karmic cause and effect is accepted on the conventional level, given that one accepts the agent of a karmic act as presented in the second sutra citation, such an agent is not defined by identifying something from among the appropriated aggregates to be such an agent. This indeed is a most excellent approach.

There are further problems with asserting that the mere collection of aggregates is the self. Thus in the Meeting of Father and Son Sutra the Buddha said the self is dependent upon these six elements: earth, water, fire, wind, consciousness, and space, like the space in the nostrils; and also on the six sense faculties of the eyes and so on, which are in turn the bases for contact. {315} “And so on” indicates the inclusion [of the faculties] up to the mental faculty giving rise to contact. He also said definitely, which means “explicitly,” that the self is conceived on the basis of the mind and other phenomena such as the mental factors as its bases of designation. Therefore self is neither identical to any of these factors, such as the earth element — that is to say, none of these can individually be the self — nor is it the case that their mere collection is the self. Thus the thought “I am” — ingrained in us since beginningless time — does not grasp any of these, neither the individual phenomena nor their collection.

In general, individual and person are synonyms. The three — “convergence of six elements,” “having six bases,” and “with eighteen [spheres of experience]” — these are attributes one is endowed with, while person is the basis of these attributes. So these are characterized as being the basis in dependence on which person is imputed. “Eighteen turnings of the mind” refers to the six turnings of feeling pleasure in relation to six desirable objects, six turnings of feeling pain in relation to six undesirable objects, and six turnings of feeling neither pleasure nor pain in relation to six neutral objects. Since it is due to feelings of pleasure, pain, and neutrality that the mind repeatedly turns to form, sound, and so on, these feelings are referred to as “turnings of the mind.”

Therefore the aggregates are not the focal object of innate “I”-grasping — the focal object as opposed to the apprehended aspect — and neither can something different from the aggregates be observed as its focus. And so when the yogi sees the lack of an intrinsically existent self, he also understands that “mine” too is essenceless, with no intrinsic existence. Through cutting the bonds to all aspects of conditioned cyclic existence, the yogi takes no subsequent rebirth and thus definitely attains the liberation of nirvana.
In view of all foregoing, here are some unique features of Candrakīrti’s refined analysis [concerning the selflessness of persons]: Neither the aggregates, individually or collectively, nor something separate from the aggregates is posited to be the focal object of the identity view, and even so, one is able to correctly identify the object of identity view {316} and then define the emptiness of intrinsic existence of person on that basis. Such analysis is indeed most beautiful for those seekers of liberation who are of extremely sharp aptitude. Nothing in other philosophies can steal our heart as this tradition does.

When searching for the true referent of the thought “I am,” some identify it with all five aggregates while others assert it to be mind alone. According to these positions, then, so long as the aggregates come into being, the grasping at the self of persons will also persist. The reason is that as long as one defines [the person] on the basis of searching for the true referent behind the designation, what is found must be the basis or the apprehended object of the grasping at the self of persons.

Say a foolish man sees a snake living in the cracks of his walls {317} and is living with fear. Another person tells him, “Be not afraid, there is no elephant here,” and thus clearing any doubt about the presence of an elephant. Say then that the man, in addition to dispelling his fear of an elephant with this knowledge of the elephant’s absence, were to hope thereby to remove his fear of a snake as well. Alas! He would be an object of ridicule or laughter by other more intelligent people.
So, even though the condition that caused the fear of a snake remains nearby, if owing to some foolish person’s words, a person were to fail to see the danger of the snake and give up his efforts to remove that threat — letting down his guard with the knowledge that there were no elephants around — he might then be seized by that snake. Likewise regarding those who, believing through familiarity with the absence of an elephant-like permanent self that the danger posed by self-grasping ingrained since beginningless time has been averted, let down their guard, they will not be able to remove the identity view that [according to the Buddhist essentialist schools] has the aggregates as its object. Therefore [such an insight] will definitely fail to disrupt the person’s cycle of existence.
This [above argument of Candrakīrti] reveals that the proponents of many schools, fellow Buddhists as well as non-Buddhists, who seek to establish suchness fail to understand how to eradicate the object grasped at by our innate self-grasping. Because of this, they forsake true suchness and seek to present other forms of suchness. The text shows here how all such presentations are pointless endeavors. To appreciate this point is critical.

The self does not exist in the aggregates as intrinsically supported, nor do the aggregates exist in self as intrinsically supporting. The reason is that if they, the aggregates and the self, were to exist as inherently separate, then such notions as intrinsically existent support and supported might be plausible. However, since they are not different, intrinsically separate entities, these notions of the two being inherently established support and the supported are mere distorted concepts. In the everyday world, for example, we do observe a relationship of support and supported between two essentially different things, such as a bowl and the yogurt inside it. We do not see this in the case of the aggregates and the self. Therefore the two do not exist intrinsically as support and supported.

The self cannot be said to own the aggregates of form, for we have already rejected the self being either identical to or different from the aggregates. Since self does not exist as such, self’s ownership of the aggregates is meaningless in terms of intrinsic existence. The relation of ownership either can take the form “Devadatta owns a cow,” which is through difference, or can take the form “Devadatta has a body,” in which case ownership is not through difference but through inherence. But since self is not one with or identical to the body and neither is it different or separate from it, the self’s ownership of the body through an intrinsic nature remains impossible. One should understand that these arguments also reject an intrinsically existent self that owns the four remaining aggregates as well.

(1) The body is not self yet one views it as such; (2) the self does not inherently possess the body yet one views it as doing so; (3) the self does not intrinsically exist in the body, (4) nor does the body intrinsically exist in the self yet one views it in such terms. There are thus four views. Just as explained here in relation to the aggregate of form [the body], we should understand in these four terms how the identity view relates to all the remaining four aggregates, such as feeling. These then are considered the twenty views of self that grasp at the perishable collection.[790]
[Question:] It would be more appropriate to add the viewing of self and aggregates as different and have a fivefold analysis in relation to each of the aggregates. Does not Fundamental Wisdom state the following as well?
Neither identical to nor different from the aggregates,
the Tathāgata is not in the aggregates, nor the aggregates in him;
the Tathāgata does not possess the aggregates;
so what then is the Tathāgata?[791]
Thus the aspects [of identity view] should number twenty-five, so why do you speak of twenty?
[Reply:] The sutras present these twenty aspects of the identity view because the identity view cannot cling to a self without first grasping at the aggregates. So it is in these four terms [possible identity relationship] that one engages with self on the basis of focusing on the aggregates. Since the fifth basis of clinging to self as something separate from the aggregates is something that is found only among the proponents of the non-Buddhist schools and not others, this fifth aspect of identity view is not listed [in the sutra]. Fundamental Wisdom lists the fifth aspect to refute the standpoint of the non-Buddhist schools. This is how we should understand.

In the scriptures, it says:
The fruit of stream entry is realized through demolishing the twenty towering peaks of identity view with the scepter of gnosis.[792]
When the scepter of an ārya’s gnosis has not descended, the mountain of identity view, grasping at intrinsic existence on the basis of focusing on an “I,” sends down boulders of afflictions day after day. This mountain has existed since the beginningless cycle of existence; its slopes pervade every direction and surface, and its peaks, the highest in the three realms, emerged from the ground of fundamental ignorance. However, when the scepter of wisdom directly realizing no-self crushes the mountain of self view, {320} these twenty high peaks belonging to the mighty range of the basic identity view just described will all be demolished together with it as well. These twenty are the ones described above in terms of four in relation to each of the five aggregates.
In the translation of the Commentary, although it reads, “One should understand that those that will be demolished together with the towering peak are peaks [too],” we should understand this, as found in the translation of the root text, as referring to those that emerge together with the basic identity view.
Given that the innate identity view is none of the twenty views described above, in the line “Belonging to the mighty mountain range of identity view,” [Candrakīrti] explains these twenty peaks of identity view as being located within the basic identity view. Thus the twenty views relinquished by the stream enterer together with [basic identity view] are also acquired [views] as well. Such views are therefore not to be identified just with grasping at intrinsic existence of “I” in general; rather they are forms of grasping arising through inferior philosophical tenets that reinforce the validity of the mode of apprehension of such grasping at intrinsic existence. And it is the seed of such [acquired] grasping that is relinquished by the stream enterer.

Some fellow Buddhists, the Saṃmatīya school, assert that because of the argument “for there is no apprehension of self apart from the aggregates” (6.124b), the person is not different from the aggregates; but neither is it something that has the nature of the aggregates, for if it were, the self would have arising and disintegration. Therefore the self or person is inexpressible as one with or different [from the aggregates]. Likewise, they assert the person to be inexpressible as permanent, impermanent, and so on. Nonetheless, they assert such a person to be substantially real for they describe it to be the agent of the two karmic deeds [virtuous and nonvirtuous] as well to be the “consumer” of the happiness and suffering that are the effects of these two karmic deeds. {321} It is also, according to them, what is imprisoned in the cycle of existence and liberated or released at the time of attaining nirvana. Such a self is also claimed to be knowable by six classes of consciousness and is held to be the basis or focus for “I”-grasping as well.

In these two stanzas we have refuted the substantial reality of the person and have demonstrated how the person is found to be a nominal reality. {322} We will now, by explaining how identity and difference are the basis for [conceiving something as] an entity, refute the substantial reality of self because it is devoid of such bases.

Thus, when analyzed in the manner described above, the substantial reality of a person becomes untenable. Therefore the basis or focus of “I”-grasping is not a real or an intrinsically established entity. For when analyzed, the self is not different in nature from the aggregates, nor is it the aggregates themselves — either in terms of their collection or individually; the self is not the support of the aggregates, nor do the aggregates exist as the support for the self;[793] and such a self does not possess the aggregates in an essential manner. {323} So whether it is the fellow Buddhist schools that assert the self to be a nominal reality or those that state it to be devoid of ultimate existence, it’s inappropriate to maintain any notion of self characterized in the above terms [of identity and difference]. So we say, this proves that self exists in dependence on the aggregates.
When one accepts the simple fact “conditioned by that, this comes into being,” so that the framework of conventional truth is not annihilated, one does not do so on the basis of admitting arising through any of the four extremes such as no cause. Likewise, in the context of self, when we assert it to be designated in dependence upon the aggregates, this eliminates the opponent’s flawed standpoint just described. Yet to abide by the conventions of the world, we assert [the self to be] designated in dependence upon the aggregates. This much we do accept. That conventional designation of self exists is something we observe incontrovertibly.
An analogy from the external world elucidates the points just explained so that self is established as a mere designation:

If the mere collection of the chariot’s parts constitutes the chariot, then the chariot would exist even amid the collection of parts of a dismantled chariot, when the parts are not assembled. Although the rejection of the collection of parts as being the whole has already been explained above, this is stated here [again] to reveal a further objection different from the one presented above. The further objection is that since there can be no parts without the existence of the bearer of the parts, the parts would have no existence for these Buddhists. For they maintain that the chariot cannot have a bearer of parts [that takes the chariot as its part].[794]
[Question:] These Buddhist schools assert the collection of parts to be the bearer of parts and the parts to be its constitutive elements. They hold these two to be the parts-bearer and the parts. So it is not the case that these Buddhist schools deny the existence of the bearer of parts.
[Reply:] This is not a problem. In our own [Madhyamaka] system, since both the individual aggregates as well as the collection of aggregates are the appropriated, we do not assert these to be the appropriator. Likewise, we hold both individual parts of the chariot as well as their collection as constitutive elements and not as the whole. These fellow Buddhist schools, however, do not accept the existence of a whole that is not the collection, and it is this [view] that is being rejected as well. The adverbial phrase “as well” signifies the inclusion of collection, which is not explicitly mentioned. It is included to help us understand not only that saying the shape of the parts alone is the chariot is illogical but also for the mere collection [to be the chariot] is untenable as well.

Furthermore, if you assert that the shape alone is the chariot, we would ask: Is this shape that of the individual parts or is it that of the collection? If it is the former, {325} is it that of the parts prior to being assembled, before they have shed their individual characters? Or is it the shape of the parts after they have relinquished this earlier character? If you assert it to be the former, this too is illogical. Why?
For you, just as shapes exist in each of the individual chariot parts such as the wheels previously, before being assembled, if these very shapes that previously existed were to persist later when the chariot is perceived or formed, then, just as there is no chariot in the unassembled parts, in the assembled parts too, there could be no chariot. This is because you define the mere shapes of the individual parts to constitute the chariot, and insofar as their shapes are concerned, there is no difference between those of the earlier and later temporal stages.
Suppose you assert the second option — that the chariot is the subsequent shape that is different from the shapes of [the parts] prior [to the assembled] stage. In that case, if within the chariot that is right here and now, the wheels and so on, which includes the axle, bolts, and so on, have acquired different shapes, such as being square, oblong, circular, and so on, shapes that are different from those present previously when these parts were not assembled, this fact of the different shapes would be perceived with our eyes. This is not the case. Hence the shape of the parts alone cannot the chariot.
If the thought is that the chariot is the unique shape of the collection of its parts such as wheels when they are assembled, this too is illogical:

If there exists something called “collection,” a real entity with substantial reality, one could then conceive of a shape on the basis of such a thing. However, there is not even the slightest degree of something called “collection of parts” that possesses substantial reality. Given that, for you, collection has no reality — that is, it has no substantial reality — the shape you mean cannot be conceived of by taking the collection of parts as its designative base. For you uphold the tenet that nominal realities such as [shape and the like] must have substantial realities as their designative bases, and you assert the collection of parts to be a nominal reality. Thus in this discussion of a chariot, how can, in the context of defining a chariot, a shape that is said to be the chariot be defined on the basis of something utterly unreal, with no substantial reality, as its designative basis? This cannot be so.
Here the opponent accepts that nominally real entities are {326} each conceived as dependent on a substantial real entity as its designative basis; they also maintain that both collection and shape are nominally real entities. Although a contradiction arises here only if the opponent asserts the collection to be the designative basis of shape, we should understand [the argument] along the following lines: Just as it would be illogical to posit that a person’s color is the person, it would be illogical to posit the chariot’s color and shape to be the chariot. This is because both things are among what is appropriated by [the designation] the “chariot.”

Say the opponent asserts that even if one grants that a collection, which is unreal, is a nominal entity, one can still conceive in dependence on it a shape that is unreal and is a nominal reality. In that case, just as you now admit here in the case of a chariot the positing of a nominally existent shape in dependence upon a nominally existent collection, you should know that in dependence on unreal causes, such as ignorance and seeds, that varied effects like karmic acts and sprouts, which are unreal in character or in their nature, can come to be. You should likewise understand the same in all other instances how it is from unreal causes and that unreal effects arise. So what point is there in clinging to what is false as real, to these [imagined] real entities that resemble shadow animals whose meat cannot be consumed no matter how one strives with hundredfold effort?
Now many fellow Buddhist schools claim that the collection, wherein the eight atomic constituents of the vase — its form atom and so on — exist in a cohered manner is what constitutes the vase. And it’s from such an entity that perceptions like that of a vase occurs. Given that this chariot analogy also reveals the untenable nature of such a claim, the assertion remains incorrect. Furthermore, with no intrinsic arising as already explained above, form and so on have no intrinsic existence as well. For this reason too, the assertion that “vase” and so on appropriate substantially real entities remains untenable. {327} Therefore things like vases cannot subsist in specific shapes of forms.

[Opponent:] We will say this: Were one to search for the referent of the term chariot through the seven-point analysis outlined above (6.151), there would be no chariot. And since the chariot would become nonexistent, our everyday conventions about the chariot would be undermined. This would be incorrect, for we see that everyday conventions such as “Fetch the chariot,” “Buy the chariot,” “Repair the chariot,” and so on are necessary. Therefore, as they are known to the world, things like chariots do have an existence.
[Response:] Between the two of us, this fault applies to you alone; I should charge this against you. How so? You posit the reality of a chariot on the basis of analysis, searching for the true referent of the term chariot. You do not accept any alternative method of positing existence other than searching for the true referent of the designated term. And when the referent of the term is searched for through the sevenfold analysis, how can everyday conventions like “Fetch the chariot” remain established for you?
This is how the author of the treatise [Candrakīrti] responds to the above argument. Today’s Tibetans who claim to be Prāsaṅgika, however, say that this argument — if the chariot cannot be found when searched for through sevenfold analysis, its existence cannot be posited — represents the Madhyamaka standpoint. In so doing, they tediously pollute a perfect system with the dirty water of inferior philosophical thinking.
For us [Madhyamaka], however, the fault raised in the argument made above does not apply. So we say:

Yes, although the chariot does not exist when searched for in any of the seven terms, both in suchness or ultimate reality and in terms of everyday conventions of the world, even then, without analysis that seeks the referent behind the term and through everyday convention alone, just like “blue color,” “feelings,” and so on, here too, {328} we impute the chariot in dependence on its parts like wheels and so on. Therefore, just as we accept the dependent origination of sprouts from seeds in terms of mere conditionedness, we assert that the chariot too is conceived in dependence upon its parts. “So for us,” writes Candrakīrti, “everyday conventions like ‘Fetch the chariot’ do not become untenable. And this the opponent too should accept.”[795] Given this statement, we should indicate that in this Madhyamaka system, where one does not posit a chariot on the basis of searching for the referent of the term, one accepts everyday conventions of the world and maintains that even the opponent should accept such everyday conventions. We should not say things such as “I have no position” when the opponent turns the objections leveled against him back on us and we are unable to respond.

Not only is it clearly established that in this Madhyamaka system the term chariot is designated on the basis of everyday conventions of the world, the other terms associated with the chariot are also accepted not through searching for their true referents but within the framework of what is known to the everyday world. For example, in relation to its parts like the wheels and so on, the chariot is the bearer of the parts, and in relation to its constituents like the wheel, it is the constituted.

They extend this [line of thinking] and assert that only the collection of constituents, of actions, and of the appropriated [aggregates] exist. {329} Other than these [individual elements], they claim, no such thing as the constituted, agent, and appropriator exists at all, for nothing different from these [individual elements] is perceived. According to those who speak about everyday established conventions of the world in such distorted terms, the very reasoning they have just presented about the nonexistence of a bearer of parts would make collection of [individual] parts to be nonexistent as well. So undermine not — that is to say, do not destroy — the known everyday conventions of the world such as chariots. This [dismantling of known conventions of the world] deserves only to be rejected.

Now the reason other fellow Buddhist schools, both higher and lower schools of tenets, assert the collection of parts and so on to be the bearer of the parts and so on is this: If these are not posited as the bearer of the parts, since no [bearer of parts] that is different from these [collections] is perceived, they remain incapable of positing a bearer of parts and so on that is capable of effective function. This is why they make such assertions. They do not know how to posit something if the true referent of its term is not found when sought. Therefore, since they do not accept chariots and so on to be mere designations of terms, they accept them as existing through intrinsic characteristics. Because of this, the Commentary speaks of them as “understanding the meaning of the scriptures in a distorted way.” In this excellent system [of Candrakīrti], however, even though nothing whatsoever — the mere collection of parts, the individual parts themselves, and so on — is identified as the thing, one can still accord effective functions to the bearer of parts within nominal framework of mere designation. And this is explained to be the meaning of the scriptures, the unique intention of the Buddha. So those with discerning intelligence should learn this way of interpreting the intention of the scriptures.

This conventional truth of the world will not be found to exist when analyzed, as outlined above, through seeking true referents of the terms. Yet it does exist in terms of unanalyzed worldly convention. Therefore, when the yogi analyzes self and chariot in the manner outlined above, he will swiftly penetrate the truth of their suchness.
How is this so? For if the chariot does exist intrinsically, it should be findable among one of the seven options when sought through the sevenfold analysis; yet yogis find no such existence of a chariot. This being the case, how can that which does not exist in any of the seven terms be said to exist through intrinsic nature at all? It does not. Therefore a certainty will arise in the yogi that this so-called intrinsically existent chariot is something purely imagined by someone whose eyes of awareness are infected by cataracts of ignorance and it has no intrinsic existence. As such they, the yogis, also enter ultimate reality with ease. The term “also” implies how the yogis do not undermine the presentations of conventional truth. So here in the context of the Madhyamaka system, we should accept a thing’s existence, such as that of the chariot, as shown here in terms of unanalyzed existence.
Candrakīrti states that those learned in the Madhyamaka tradition “should recognize that the position outlined above is free of faults and possesses great merit and should definitively be embraced.”[796] Therefore we should accept this flawless position to be our own standpoint; we should not slander it by saying we have no positions at all.

If there is no intrinsically existing chariot, then there could be no bearer of the parts in its own right, and hence there could be no parts that exist in their own right either.
[Question:] Isn’t it the case that even when the chariot is disassembled into individual parts, the collection of parts like wheels is still observed? So why do you say that without the bearer of parts, the parts themselves will have no existence?
[Response:] It is not like this. The reason why we grasp the dismantled individual parts like wheels and so on as chariot parts is because of our prior perception of their association with the chariot. It’s on such a basis alone that we think of things like wheels and so on as parts of a chariot. Someone with no such prior perception will not hold them [to be chariot parts]. Such a person will perceive the wheels and so on to be wholes in themselves in relation to their own constitutive elements. Within the perception of such a person, the wheels and so on are far removed from association with a chariot, and as such they are not cognized as chariot parts.
Furthermore, this fact of how if the chariot has no intrinsic existence, its parts too cannot have intrinsic existence can also be understood from the following analogy.

This self, which is designated in dependence upon the aggregates, does not exist as a real entity, so it is not in any intrinsic manner immutable; nor is it mutable. For if self did exist as something mutable in its own right, given that self and the appropriated aggregates cannot be different entities, the appropriated aggregates themselves would constitute the self. In that case, such a self will undergo inherent arising and disintegration during its discrete temporal moments, with the preceding and the subsequent instances [of self] becoming unrelated to each other. There will also be the consequence that what is appropriated would become the appropriator. So this [option that self exists intrinsically as something mutable] remains untenable. Similarly, the option that self is immutable or permanent is also untenable. For if it is permanent, the very same self that existed in a past life will be the self that came into being in this life; and since the appropriated aggregates associated with self of the past life and this life are different, the self cannot be one. For there is no self that is separate from the appropriated aggregates.

Fundamental Wisdom states:
If the self were the aggregates,
it would arise and disintegrate.[797]
Candrakīrti says that from this above we can discern that citing the two attributes as in the line “it does not arise or disintegrate” accords with the master Nāgārjuna’s intention. The arising and disintegrating referred to here are those that are [conceived to be] established in their own right. Such a self possesses none of the four attributes like permanence and so on.[798] This is similar to what Fundamental Wisdom explains in the following when contemplating the examination of the Tathāgata {333}:
The four of permanence, impermanence, and so on,
how can their pacification exist in it?[799]
This self has no intrinsic existence in terms of identity or difference. The reason for these is that an intrinsically real entity called self simply does not exist.

Self is such that when its true referent is sought through the sevenfold analysis, [attributes like] permanence and impermanence remain impossible. However, those who fail to see that self is devoid of intrinsic existence cling in ignorance to its intrinsic existence. These beings that cling to self as intrinsically existent with an identity view wander in the cycle of existence.
Now when one comes to search for such a self and sees through one’s analysis that it would be illogical for the aggregates themselves to be the self, non-Buddhist tīrthikas, who are mistaken with respect to the nature of the self, apprehend it to be an entity that is separate from the aggregates. Our fellow Buddhist schools, sensing that there cannot be a self that is different from the aggregates, mistakenly assert the aggregates alone to constitute the self. Both assume that one has to adopt one of these two options. Those who interpret the meaning of the scriptures without distortion recognize that self does not exist in either of these two ways. They understand that it is on the basis of this that the thought grasping at an “I” arises constantly in all beings residing in the realms of humans, hungry ghosts, animals, and so on. And with respect to the internal factors of the eyes and so on that are the causal basis for imputing self — upon which such a self exerts control and which are somehow associated with this self — {334} as well as external factors owned by that self, thoughts grasping at “mine” arise. Such a self exists as a convention unanalyzed due to delusion or ignorance; it does not exist in its own right.
Such a self does not exist intrinsically, but it is construed as such an existent because of delusion or ignorance. Nevertheless yogis never perceive such a self. And when the yogi does not perceive such an intrinsically existent self, he also does not perceive [the intrinsic existence of] the eyes and so on that are appropriated by such a self. Thus yogis do not perceive anything that is the causal basis of “self” and “mine” as possessing inherent existence. He will therefore attain freedom from the cycle of existence. Fundamental Wisdom says:
With respect to inner and outer things,
when the thought of “I” and “mine” ceases,
appropriation will come to an end,
and with cessation of this, birth ceases.[801]

yogis will attain total freedom. 6.165

One might ask, “How is it that if self has no intrinsic existence, ‘mine’ too would have no intrinsic existence either?”
[Reply:] Just as, when there is no potter, the agent, the object of his action, the clay pot, is no more, so intrinsically real “mine” too cannot be if there is no intrinsically real “I.” Thus viewing the “I” and mine to be empty and becoming familiar with such a fact, yogis will attain total freedom from cyclic existence.
When one does not view form and so on as intrinsically existent, afflictions like attachment that conceive form and so on as possessing intrinsic existence will cease. So śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas no longer take rebirth and transcend to nirvana. As for bodhisattvas, though they may have already seen the absence of such a self, {335} swayed by the force of their compassion, they continue to assume births in the continuum of cyclic existence until their enlightenment. Hence selflessness really is the most essential point of the path of both for Mahayana and Hīnayāna. Learned ones should therefore thoroughly investigate no-self as explained herein.

When things like vases, woolen cloth, shields, armies, forests, garlands, trees, houses, carts, rest houses, and all such things are subjected to sevenfold chariot analysis searching for the referents behind their terms, none of these exist in any of the seven terms. Yet they exist in another way — unanalyzed and through everyday conventions of the world.[802]
With respect to a “cart,”[803] some Tibetan teachers say that [the Sanskrit term] śakaṭa, which literally means “with wheels,” refers to a mini-chariot capable of carrying about three tea crates and consists of a cabin with wheels and a partition as well. Likewise, we should recognize too all similar conventions that people designate on their bases {336} as existing only on the level of unexamined everyday convention. For this reason it is said [in the sutra] that the Buddha, for one, did not quarrel with the world. The Presenting the Three Vows Sutra in the Heap of Jewels collection states, “It is the world that disputes with me; I do not dispute with the world.”[804] Thus the Buddha states that he too accepts what are posited as existents through unimpaired conventions of the world. Therefore one must not undermine the agreed-on conventions of the world.
How do the people of the world construct conventions and by what means? Just as the vase is the whole and its fired clay and so on are its parts, and just as the vase is the quality-bearer and its dark hue and so on caused by flames are the qualities, the basis of attachment for a sentient being or person who is attached to an attractive object is the object of attachment, while excessive craving fixated on an attractive contaminated object is the attachment. Similarly, the vase is the characterized thing, while “having a bulbous body with an open extended lip and long neck and so on” are its defining characteristics; fire is that which burns, while fuel is that which is being burned, and so on. Thus it is in dependence upon constituents that a “whole” is conceived, and it is in dependence upon a whole that “parts” are designated. The same is true likewise of all the examples up to fire and fuel, all of which are designated by means of mutual dependence. Although the referents for such terms do not exist when sought through the sevenfold analysis, one can posit their existence through everyday conventions of the world; they are not amenable to ultimate analysis probing their true suchness.

If, for example, a thing produces an effect, it is indeed a cause on that account; if no effect is produced, with this absence of an effect, there can be no cause for such an effect. Yet effects too come to arise when there is the cause, so the two, cause and effect, exist through mutual dependence and not through intrinsic existence. If, in contrast, cause and effect are conceived as having intrinsic existence, how then do cause and effect relate to each other and in what manner? Do tell me, between the two — cause and effect — what comes from what, and what precedes what, the cause or the effect? With respect to intrinsic existence, it would be illogical for the cause to be temporally prior, since its correlate, the effect — in relation to which it is defined as cause — must exist [at the time of the cause] as well. It would also be illogical for the effect to be temporally prior, for this would mean that the effect would have no cause. Therefore one should understand that what are conceived as causes and effects are established only through mutual dependence, just as in the case of a chariot; they have no intrinsic existence.
Furthermore, if the cause were to produce its effect intrinsically, would it do so on the basis of coming into contact with the effect?

If you say that a cause produces the effect through contacting it, in that case, they, cause and effect, will share the same potency, like, for example, the waters of a river and ocean coming into contact with each other. Now if the potency of [cause and effect] does exist as one, one would then not be able to distinguish them and say, “This is the cause” and “This is the effect.” And since what is a producer, the cause, and the effect will not be distinct, the question remains as to what produces what? If, in contrast, they are indeed distinct and the cause produces its effect without contacting, then what is asserted to be a cause of an effect will not differ from other noncauses. This is because things that are intrinsically distinct from each other would become random others, with no relation. Yet for those who speak of cause and effect as possessing intrinsic existence, apart from these two possibilities — the producer and the produced coming into contact with each other or not — there is no other third conception or possibility of causal relation. {338} It is definitely the case, therefore, that an intrinsically existent cause does not produce effects.

Since your cause, which you claim exists through intrinsic nature, produces no effects, there cannot be what you call “effects” that possess intrinsic existence. The basis on which a cause is defined as a cause is the arising of an effect. If, however, a cause without or devoid of an effect can be posited as a cause, in that case there would be no reason at all for something to be called a “cause.” This, however, is not the case. Therefore cause and effect lack intrinsic existence.

One might ask, “In that case, how is [causal relation understood] according to you?” For the opponent who asserts that the producer and the produced exist through their intrinsic characteristics, when one inquires whether cause and effect come into contact, both alternatives lead to faults. However, according to us, for whom things come to be produced through false constructions and are posited as mere conventions by conceptual thoughts, both cause and effect are like illusions and have no intrinsic arising. Though devoid of intrinsic existence, just like the mesh of hair seen by someone with an eye disease, things are posited as mere conventions created by conceptualizing thoughts. For such a standpoint, one cannot even contemplate that the faults raised against the assertion of intrinsically existent cause and effect will equally apply. Therefore, for us, we are not vulnerable to these objections just outlined in terms of whether cause and effect come into contact. Yet the things of the everyday world — causes, effects, chariots, and so on — that are acknowledged by the world and are established without analysis would still have existence.

This analysis of whether cause and effect come into contact applies equally to you. How so? For example, does your refutation refute by coming into contact with what is being refuted? Or does it do so without coming into contact with it? So are you not guilty of the same fault? Indeed, you are. Now if the refutation takes place on the basis of coming into contact, then they [what is refuting and what is being refuted] will become one, in which case what is refuting what? On the other hand, if the refutation takes place without coming into contact, then everything else that equally does not come into contact should also effect such a refutation, which is illogical. And apart from these two horns of the inquiry, there exists no third possibility.
In view of the above, your refutation does not possess any capacity to refute what is being refuted. Your own refutation is in fact refuted. This implies that entities such as cause and effect are indeed established as intrinsically existent. To state this the text says:

Indeed when you speak in such a manner, presenting phony refutations, you undermine your own position, and your refutation will not have the power to refute what you are refuting — namely, the opponent’s position. Furthermore, since your objections leveled against your opponent rebound equally to your own words as well, you are committing a logical fallacy.[805] And so with no sound logic, you deny the existence of all phenomena. {340} The sublime ones will never approve or agree with you. How is this so? What logic is there to the argument that “If [the cause] produces [the effect] without coming into contact with it, then everything that equally does not come into contact with the effect would produce it as well?” For example, a magnet attracts metal objects not in actual contact but suitably located but it does not attract everything that is not in contact with it. The eyes too see forms, without coming into contact with them, that are suitably located, but the eyes do not see everything not in contact with them. Similarly, in the case of causation too, although a cause produces an effect without coming into contact with it, this does not mean that it will produce everything not in contact with it. It will produce only those that are suitable to be its effects. Furthermore, you are simply abusing the norms of refutation — for a protagonist who has no positions of his own and indulges only in refuting others’ positions is labeled an abuser of logic. You, for one, seem to be doing just that.

We will say this in response. The objection you have just raised — “Does your refutation refute what is to be refuted without coming into contact or by contacting it?” — will certainly apply to someone who has a thesis: namely, a protagonist who upholds the thesis of intrinsic existence. Since I have no such thesis of intrinsic existence, these consequences revealing faults to both possibilities of coming into contact and not coming into contact do not follow for me. {341} As for us, we maintain that both the refutation as well as what is being refuted have no intrinsic existence.

When stating the reason why the fault stemming from the analysis of whether a cause produces its effect on the basis of coming into contact with it does not equally apply to ourselves, the Commentary points out how the opponent accepts cause and effect to have intrinsic existence while we accept them to be illusion-like with no intrinsic existence. Here too, when giving the reason why the fault charged against the opponent does not rebound on us, it states, “what is being refuted and the refutation have no intrinsic existence.”[806] So we must undoubtedly accept that the reason the fault does not apply to us equally is because we do not assert the intrinsic existence of both positions [of coming into contact or not coming into contact].

This is also stated extensively in the Mother Perfection of Wisdom sutras, such as in the following:
“Subhūti, is unborn attainment attained through an arisen phenomenon, or is unborn attainment attained through an unarisen phenomenon?”
Subhūti replied, “Śāriputra, I do not assert that unborn attainment is attained through an arisen phenomenon; nor do I assert that unborn attainment is attained through an unarisen phenomenon.”
Śāriputra stated, “What? Is there then no attainment and no realization?”
Subhūti replied, “Attainment exists and realization exists, but they do not exist in such dualistic terms. Śāriputra, attainment and realization exist on the level of conventions of the world. [Similarly] stream enterer, once-returner, nonreturner, arhat, pratyekabuddha, and bodhisattva too exist on the level of conventions of the world. On the ultimate level, however, there is no attainment and no realization.”[808]

Here, up to “I do not assert that unborn attainment is attained” explains how if one were to search for the object of attainment as well as the means by which it is attained by seeking the referents of their terms, attainment would become nonexistent. So the sutra negates attainment in terms of both possibilities when subject to such analysis. Since the object of attainment [found] through such binary analysis {342} for entities that have intrinsic existence is untenable for something that is nonexistent, one accepts attainment on the level of unanalyzed worldly convention. This is explained in the section that begins “Attainment exists” up to “they do not exist in such dualistic terms.” “Attainment” here refers to attainment of the object of attainment and to the realizations. So just as these two do not exist on the ultimate level yet are accepted on the conventional level, likewise although the refuting argument does not refute what is to be refuted on the ultimate level, we should understand that it does refute what is to be refuted on the conventional level.

Furthermore, for example, in dependence upon seeing its reflection, the characteristics present in the sun as well one’s face, such as when there is an eclipse, can be seen. Yet if one were to analyze, in the fashion of searching for true referents of the terms, whether the reflection of the sun or one’s face arise on the basis of touching its reflection, one can’t speak of their arising. Nonetheless, things such as reflections do originate as mere conventions through dependence on the sun or one’s face. They in turn help secure the desired aim [of people of the world]. Also, though unreal, a mirror image exists with the capacity to help make up one’s face. In just the same way, here too, understand that through reasoning, such as that of dependent origination or the absence of one and many, which has the power to cleanse the face of wisdom, one can realize the conclusion — namely, the absence of intrinsic existence. Here, with no objective evidence — that is, with intrinsic existence — is the logical reason. The adverb “even” indicates that we should understand that refutations can refute what is to be refuted even without objective intrinsic existence. {343}
It would be inappropriate for us, who speak of existence in name only, to employ such dualistic terms based on searching for the referents behind designations. Therefore those who employ refutations based on dualistic terms and respond [to objections] in such a manner will find no opportunity to refute us Mādhyamikas.

On this basis of explaining the analysis of whether refutation takes place by coming into contact with what is being refuted, we should also understand the argument about causal production by means of analyzing whether cause comes into contact with its effect. On this point, Bhāviveka says that here in [Nāgārjuna’s] Treatise on the Middle Way, the context [when he speaks of causation] is that of a producing cause and not of an explanatory cause. And the analysis of whether [cause and effect] come into contact is relevant in the case of an explanatory cause, not in relation to a producing cause. Therefore there is no possibility at all that our own words suffer from logical fallacy.[811]
This statement that the analysis of whether cause and effect come into contact with each other applies not to a producing cause but only to an explanatory cause, such as a reasoning proof, does not constitute an effective response. For if we respond to the opponent’s objection by allowing the possibility of further objections, the other side will not remain patient. So just as the faults apply to the view that accepts a producing cause to have true existence, the [same] fault would persist in the case of an explanatory cause if one accepts it to have intrinsic existence. So in rebutting the objections raised by the opponent to the reasoning presented in the Treatise on the Middle Way to establish the absence of intrinsic existence, Bhāviveka only offers a response that suffers from logical fallacy. Such a response deserves only to be refuted by the opponent. So in our response, we concede that the faults stemming from the analysis of whether cause and effect come into contact with each other applies equally to both a producing cause and an explanatory cause so long as one accepts intrinsic existence, but we do not accept such a thesis. Such a response is far more elegant.

If our proof inferring the thesis possessed real or essential existence, and if the thesis being proven had real intrinsic existence as well, then the arguments about contact and so on between the reason and the thesis could apply to us. The words “and so on” includes whether they do not come into contact with each other. Since this is not the case — that is to say, since no such intrinsic existence remains — the arguments you are leveling against us are pointless, and you are only frustrating or disappointing yourself.
For example, when one refutes the various standpoints connected with the mesh of hair seen by someone with an eye disease — a single strand of hair, multiple strands of hair, a ball [of hair], black hair, and so on — none of this can undermine [the perception of] someone who does not suffer from such visual impairment. Similarly, when one examines cause and effect devoid of intrinsic existence, the opponent’s arguments analyzing in dualistic terms searching for the true referents of the terms will not cause any harm. In light of this, we should discern how [Candrakīrti’s response here] also rejects the examples cited by the opponent, about the eyes and magnet operating without coming into contact. For if one accepts them to be intrinsically existent, the consequences stemming from [the analysis of] whether they come into contact apply equally to these examples. Having abandoned the correct path that is the absence of intrinsic existence, you take joy in traveling on the twisted path of false conceptualization, paved by the unskilled road builder that is your own fantasizing mind and obstructing the path to perfect truth. What purpose does such hard labor serve for you?[812]

Furthermore, on the basis of examples like an illusion, a mirage, and so on, which are established for the opponents as well, it is easy for us Mādhyamikas to make others realize that all things of the world lack intrinsic existence. {345} But you cannot, in an equal manner, easily make others, the wise Mādhyamikas, apprehend that things have intrinsic existence. This is because there are no examples acknowledged by both parties as having true existence. This suggests that in the case of a logical reasoning such as dependent origination establishing the absence of true existence, so long as the entailment — whatever is dependently originated necessarily lacks true existence — is not established on the basis of a concordant example, there is simply no way to ascertain the absence of true existence on the basis of the subject.[813]
Thus, I, Candrakīrti, am able to avert all the arguments presented by the proponents of real entities. Furthermore, no one [among those proponents of intrinsic existence] will be able to propose any suitable defense. Who is urging or forcing you, the opponent, to cause such injury to the world? So why ensnare the world — in which the beings are already enveloped in a thicket of their own inferior concepts and afflictions, like a silkworm trapped inside a cocoon — in a web woven tightly with threads of flawed logic? Give up this argument of yours based on grasping at true existence. With respect to that which resembles reflections and are false, what kind of individual characteristics or general characteristics as established by direct perception or inference exist by virtue of intrinsic nature? In this sense, there is only one direct perception with respect to the entire realm of knowledge, the Buddha’s omniscient gnosis.[814]

With respect to the refutations presented against the proponents of real entities in the context of defining dependent origination, such as a sprout arising in dependence on its seed, and dependent designation, such as conceiving a person in dependence on the aggregates, there are other remaining refutations, such as the argument about whether a cause produces its effect by coming into contact with it.[815] You should understand these from what has been said above. And rebut too others’ response to our argument about whether a cause contacts its effect and so on, such as when they ask {346} whether the refutation refutes what is to be refuted by coming into contact with it. We should point out how such an analysis does not equally apply to us. What is stated here represents only a single example.

[Candrakīrti’s] intention here is to state that [Nāgārjuna’s] purpose of engaging in refutation and positing [one’s own standpoint] in his treatise Fundamental Wisdom is only to eliminate conceptualization of true existence. This we have already explained above in the section beginning “Ordinary beings are chained by conceptualization” (6.117). So how can there be an abuse of the rules of refutation in [Nāgārjuna’s] treatise? The one who abuses the rules of refutation is the one who, fearing that positing his own standpoint will make him vulnerable to faults, engages only in refuting others’ positions. Here our elimination of the opponent’s positions has no existence on the ultimate level, for on the ultimate level, nothing whatsoever exists. So how can we be abusing the rules of refutation? The correct characterization of someone abusing the rules of refutation is that he does not posit his own standpoint but takes the refutation of other’s standpoints to take place on the ultimate level. As for the Madhyamaka, there is none who meets these two criteria of not positing one’s own positions on the conventional level and of taking refutation of the opponent’s position to take place on the ultimate level. So there is no abuse of the rules of refutation by the Madhyamaka. Such [violation of the rules of refutation] would be inappropriate in all contexts. So, in brief, understand all other remaining refutations from what we have already outlined above.

The Buddha taught no-self, which is the absence of intrinsic existence of phenomena, in twofold terms, the divisions of selflessness of persons and selflessness of phenomena. This twofold classification is not made on the basis of distinguishing two distinct kinds of nonexistent selfhood in relation to two bases, persons and phenomena. As for the selfhood with no existence whatsoever, this is none other than intrinsic existence. Therefore, it is from the point of view of two bases — that of phenomena, the aggregates and so on, and that of persons — that [the two selflessnesses] are distinguished. “Why were these two taught?” one might ask. The Buddha taught the no-self of persons to help free beings such as śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas from the cycle of existence. And the Buddha taught both selflessnesses to benefit bodhisattva beings so that they may attain total freedom through attaining [a buddha’s] omniscience.

As stated above, śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas do possess insight into suchness in terms of the truth of the mere conditionedness of dependent origination. Nonetheless, they lack the realization of the no-self of phenomena presented above in terms of its varied classifications and vast timescale. However, these two do possess adequate means to abandon the seeds of the afflictions of the three realms of existence. Thus we do accept that they possess full meditative realization of the no-self of persons in terms of the absence of intrinsic existence of persons. So although śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas may not generate the wisdom born of limitless varieties of reasoning negating the true existence of persons, they do possess a complete practice of the antidote to eliminate the seeds of the afflictions [i.e., the afflictive obscuration]. What they lack is the meditative cultivation of the antidote to eliminate the cognitive obscurations.

Again, for the sake of diverse trainees, the Buddha expounded these two kinds of no-self in an elaborate way, in other diverse terms through further enumerations. How so? In the Mother of the Conquerors [the Perfection of Wisdom sutras], for example, after teaching sixteen kinds of emptiness, once again the Buddha summarized these into four. And he held or stated these to be the great way as well. Thus the Buddha taught the condensed enumeration of two, the intermediate enumeration of four, and the elaborate enumeration of sixteen.

As the sutra states:
Subhūti, again the great way of the bodhisattvas is thus: {348} emptiness of the inner, emptiness of the outer, emptiness of both inner and outer, emptiness of emptiness, emptiness of great immensity, emptiness of the ultimate, emptiness of the conditioned, emptiness of the unconditioned, emptiness of beyond extremes, emptiness of what is beginningless and endless, emptiness of not to be discarded, emptiness of intrinsic nature, emptiness of all phenomena, emptiness of defining characteristics, emptiness of the unobservable, and the emptiness of essence that is the absence of entity.[816]
Having thus presented the sixteen kinds of emptiness, once again, the sutra presents four kinds of emptiness:
Subhūti, furthermore, entity is devoid of entity, nonentity is devoid of nonentity, intrinsic nature is devoid of intrinsic nature, and other-derived entity is devoid of other-derived entity.[817]
These kinds of emptiness are referred to as the “great way” as well. Whether it is emptiness itself or something other than emptiness, nothing has the slightest degree of intrinsic existence. What are subsumed within these diverse kinds of emptiness are labeled as such because they exist on the conventional level alone.

Fundamental Wisdom states, for example:
If there is something that is nonempty,
there will then be something that is empty.
Since nothing is nonempty,
how can something be empty?[818]
We do not say “It is empty,”
nor do we say “It is nonempty,”
nor that it’s both, nor that it’s neither.
We speak of it for the purpose of indication.[819]
The preceding lines [of the second stanza] have the meaning that we, the Madhyamaka, do not speak in terms of inherent existence, with the final line declaring that what is indicated by the terms does exist on the conventional level.

The absence of intrinsic existence of the six senses such as eyes is held to be inner emptiness. For example, the eyes are devoid of inherently existing eyes since the emptiness of existing in its own right is the very nature of eyes. Just as explained for the eyes, so are the ears, nose, and tongue, and the body and mind too are thus defined.

Here, Patsab translates [the Commentary] as follows:
“Not enduring eternally” should be understood as not discarding its nature. This is because they do not disintegrate through [first] enduring for a little while and then ceasing. So it is taught [in the sutras]. This indicates that without doubt, an entity that possesses intrinsic existence cannot be eternal or unceasing.[820]
This is an erroneous translation. For this reading incurs the consequence that the opposite of the predicate [something possessing no intrinsic existence] must be pervaded by the reason [it is eternal and unceasing].[821] The translation of this passage is better in Naktso’s rendering:
Any entity that exists through its own intrinsic nature will become either something that endures eternally or something subject to destruction.[822]

</d>
<d e="2">
It is clear, therefore, that the first version erred in its reading of the negative particle. Explanation of the Commentary reads the lines as “As they do not endure eternally / and as they do not disintegrate” and explains their meaning in the following:
If eyes and so forth were to possess intrinsic nature, given that intrinsic nature is devoid of manifestations and disintegration, these things [eyes and so forth] too will be devoid of manifestations and disintegration. Since they do not possess these [characteristics], they are thus devoid of intrinsic existence.[823]
This too is incorrect. For if it is correct then, instead of the line “because they do not disintegrate,” one would have to read it as “because they are subject to disintegration.” {350} This contradicts the statement in the sutra that reads, “because they do not disintegrate.”

The meaning of the phrase “they do not endure eternally” too should be understood as rendered in Naktso’s version, where it reads, “‘Eternal’ refers to that which has the nature of not being subject to destruction.” Thus, when permanence is negated [for eyes and so forth] in the sense of enduring eternally, one might conclude that eyes and so forth endure for a short period of time and then undergo truly existent disintegration. To negate this [possibility] the sutra states, “because they do not disintegrate.”[824] In brief, the meaning here is this: the eyes and so forth do not possess true existence either as permanent or as impermanent. There is in Light on Twenty-Five Thousand Lines a presentation [of these two reasons, “they do not abide eternally” and they do no disintegrate”], which is different from what is found here.[825]

[Question:] Now listen. Is there an intrinsic nature that the master himself accepts, such as the one characterized by Nāgārjuna is his treatise [Fundamental Wisdom] as not produced by causes and conditions?
[Reply:] There does exist what is called the ultimate nature of things (dharmatā), which the Buddha refers to when he states, “Whether tathāgatas appear in the world or not, this ultimate nature of phenomena will remain.” What is this ultimate nature of phenomena? It is the intrinsic nature of phenomena such as that of the eyes. What is their intrinsic nature? It is the nature of the eyes and so on that is not fabricated and not dependent on others, such as a producer. This is the reality to be realized by a cognition that is free of ignorance’s impairment.[827]
These lines effectively refute those who assert that this master [Candrakīrti] does not accept the existence of ultimate truth and the ultimate nature of things and that, when the contamination of ignorance comes to an end, no cognitive states remain.[828]

So does the ultimate nature of things exist? Who would say that it does not exist? For if it does not exist, to what end do bodhisattvas practice the path of the six perfections? {351} They would not do so. Were there no ultimate truth, there would be no perfecting of the realization of such a truth; and were this not possible, there would be no point to the meditative cultivation of the path. In that case, why do the bodhisattvas initiate hundredfold effort to realize the ultimate nature of things and attain its final attainment?[829]
This paragraph shows that those who initiate fulsome efforts on the path while maintaining that the ultimate truth is not an object of any cognition are quite deficient in their intelligence.

That there is ultimate truth is stated most clearly in the Cloud of Jewels Sutra:
O child of the lineage, the ultimate truth has no arising, no cessation, no disintegration, no coming, and no going. It cannot be expressed in words, it cannot be defined thoroughly through words, nor can it be realized through conceptual elaboration. O child of the lineage, the ultimate truth is ineffable, it is tranquil, and it is to be realized by the āryas through their own personal experience. O child of the lineage, the ultimate truth is such that whether tathāgatas appear in the world or not, for its sake the bodhisattvas shave their head and beard, clad themselves in saffron robes, and through their perfect faith renounce the householder life and adopt that of the homeless. Following their renunciation, they strive with diligence as if their hair or clothes were on fire to attain this ultimate nature of things, and [this truth] abides without destruction. O child of the lineage, if there is no ultimate truth, engaging in pure conduct would be pointless; the appearance of tathāgatas in the world would also be pointless. Since the ultimate truth does exist, the bodhisattvas are referred to as those who are versed in the ultimate truth.[830]

The phrases “ineffable” and “cannot be realized through conceptual elaboration” should be understood to mean that ultimate truth as it is perceived by the nonconceptual gnosis [of āryas] cannot be experienced as an object of language and conceptual thought. This does not mean that it cannot be cognized at all. And in this sutra, objections have been raised against the nonexistence of ultimate truth, and also, when [unwanted] consequences are revealed to the opposing standpoint, the sutra speaks of the existence of ultimate truth. The sutra declared the ultimate truth to be existent earlier too, so those who attempt to make distinctions between “nonexistent” and “not being existent” only reveal the extreme inferiority of their intellect.[831]
Although Patsab’s translation in numerous instances reads, “whether tathāgatas appear in the world or not, for its sake,” in Naktso’s translation one reads, “Whether tathāgatas appear in the world or not, the ultimate truth remains undestroyed.” This latter version seems better since it accords well with the sutra cited in an earlier context in the commentary, {352} “Whether tathāgatas appear in the world or not, this ultimate nature of phenomena will remain.”[832]

[Reply:] This objection stems from a failure to understand the intention of the Treatise on the Middle Way. The intention of the treatise is this: If the reality of dependently originated things such as eyes and so on that can be perceived by the childish person is itself the intrinsic nature and the ultimate mode of being of these things, then since this nature is something perceived directly by a distorted cognition, the practice of pure conduct will be pointless. However, since the dependent origination of eyes and so forth is not their intrinsic nature and not their true mode of being, the practice of pure conduct for the sake of seeing that [true mode of being] comes to have a purpose.[833] So Candrakīrti responds.
So the negation of intrinsic nature involves the negation of eyes and so forth as constituting their own essential nature. The intrinsic nature that is accepted, on the other hand, relates to the recognition that the very negation of intrinsic existence is the ultimate nature of things like eyes and so forth. There is therefore not the slightest contradiction between rejecting the intrinsic existence of things, on the one hand, and accepting an intrinsic nature that constitutes things’ ultimate nature.

Such an ultimate nature of things is something that we speak of, within the framework of conventional truth or mere nominal existence, as unfabricated and as not dependent on others. This ultimate nature of things not perceivable by the childish is certainly fit to be an intrinsic nature; and the simple acceptance of its existence on the conventional level does not entail its intrinsic existence as something real or unreal on the ultimate level. It’s in fact the pacification of intrinsic existence itself. So this intrinsic nature, the nature of things, is something that is not only accepted by the master Nāgārjuna himself, it is a truth we can enable others to accept as well. So this intrinsic nature is presented as something that would be established, at the end of the debate, for both sides.[834] This [last] statement needs to be appreciated with special emphasis.

If, as some assert, one were to view heat and so forth as the intrinsic nature and ultimate mode of being of fire and so forth, this is wholly untenable. Heat and so forth are dependently arisen, and hence they are solely fabrications. They are also things that have arisen owing to their causes and conditions. {353} It would therefore be illogical to assert that eyes and so forth do not exist as contrivances, that they are not dependent on other causes and conditions. “This is because the phrase ‘they are’ indicates that there exist no entities that can be apprehended as supreme, and that things such as these are revealed on the conventional level.”[835] This is how it appears in Patsab’s translation. In Naktso’s translation, however, this passage reads: “Here, there is no such apprehension of things as supreme, and facts are established as they are on the conventional level.” This latter reading seems better. The meaning of the remaining part [of the passage] is this: the conceived object of clinging at true existence has no reality, and things are revealed on the conventional level to have the character of being fabricated and dependent on others.

On the basis of this demonstration of how the master Nāgārjuna accepts intrinsic nature, we should also understand the following from Praise to the Ultimate Expanse:
The sutras that teach emptiness,
all taught by the Conqueror,
they all help cease the afflictions
but do not undo the natural element.[836]
This text states how the sutras that teach emptiness demolish the objectified focus of the affliction of grasping at true existence. Such teachings do not undermine or indicate the nonexistence of the natural element of the tathāgata — namely, emptiness — which is the very negation of such objectified focus.

In brief, the sutra statement that the eyes and so forth are devoid of eyes and so forth elucidates the fact that eyes and so forth are empty of intrinsic existence. This is not the same as the assertion of the Śrāvaka school that the eyes are devoid of a self that is the inner [eternal] agent; nor is it the same as the Cittamātra statement that the eyes are devoid of subject-object duality, whereby they speak of an emptiness not as the absence of intrinsic existence of the eyes and so forth but an emptiness of one thing being absent in another.

{354} That form and so forth, factors that are not part of a person’s continuum, have no intrinsic existence, this emptiness of intrinsic existence is accepted as outer emptiness. Because such is their nature, these outer forms are devoid of existing through form’s own essence. In this way, the manner in which sound, smell, taste, touch, and mental objects are likewise empty should be understood. In the sutra, the two statements “They do not endure eternally” and “They do not disintegrate” are applied both in this context [of the three remaining emptinesses of the first set of four] and in connection with all remaining enumerations of emptiness. Their significance should be understood just as explained above in the context of inner emptiness.
The physical base of a sense organ, for example, is encompassed within a person’s continuum, yet it is not the actual sense organ itself. Hence it is both inner and outer. And the lack of its intrinsic existence — the fact that it has no intrinsic reality — this is inner and outer emptiness. The meaning of the remaining [part of the stanza] is the same as before.
That all things, both outer and inner, lack intrinsic existence as described above, this alone the wise describe as emptiness. This emptiness of the intrinsic existence of inner and outer phenomena itself is in turn held to be devoid of a truly existing essential emptiness. Hence, this emptiness of what is called emptiness — namely, the emptiness in relation to which emptiness itself is the basis of being emptied — is known as emptiness of emptiness. It was taught in the Mother Perfection of Wisdom sutras to counter the grasping thought that emptiness or ultimate nature is something real, that it has true existence. This point is clearly stated in the following in Hymn to the World Transcendent:
To help dispel all conceptualizations,
you revealed the ambrosia of emptiness.
He who clings to that
you have verily denounced.[837]
These statements indicate that the Conqueror denounced both the following kinds of assertions. In the first, some, taking ultimate truth to be the elimination of essential existence, assert it to possess true existence. In the second, some, taking the ultimate nature of things to be some kind of real autonomous entity — not a mere elimination — conceive it in affirmative terms, like a blue or yellow color, and say that it possesses true existence.[838] {355}

Since no container world and no contained world of sentient beings exists other than in space such as eastern direction and so on, it pervades all the worlds and also the beings these worlds contain. Furthermore, when one cultivates the four immeasurable thoughts such as loving kindness, one does so in relation to the entirety of sentient beings throughout space, and such meditations are defined as “immeasurable” from the point of view of their objects. Just as space exemplifies immeasurability, these meditations also have an immeasurable aspect. In brief, space is a great immensity in all ten directions. That space itself is devoid of inherent existence of all ten directions, such as the east, this is the emptiness of great immensity. It was taught to counteract clinging to space as intrinsically real great immensity. Distorted clinging to space includes, for example, the non-Buddhist Vaiśeṣika view that holds space to constitute a permanent substance.
[In general] the term truth in the context of ultimate truth can refer to (a) a purpose, as in the sentence “There is a purpose to this statement,” or it can refer to (b) a fact or an object of knowledge, as in the expression “five objects of the senses.” Of these two, here [in this context of emptiness of the ultimate] the term truth refers to that which is the ultimate and the transcendence of sorrow — namely, the buddha’s truth body (dharmakāya). And since nirvana is the supreme goal to be attained, emptiness, which is this truth body being devoid of itself existing through an essence, is emptiness of the ultimate. Here too the Buddha, the knower of the ultimate truth, taught this emptiness of the ultimate to counter the grasping thought that nirvana, the dharmakāya, is something truly real. {356}
The three realms, coming from their causes and conditions, are described with certainty to be conditioned. That they are empty of themselves, this emptiness of intrinsic existence of the three realms, was taught as emptiness of the conditioned. That which has no arising and duration and lacks impermanence — namely, cessation or disintegration — such a phenomenon is unconditioned. That it is empty of itself — namely, of intrinsic existence — is taught as emptiness of the unconditioned.

The “extremes” are the positions of eternalism or nihilism, the holding of which leads one to fall into an abyss of error. It does not refer to positions such as maintaining that unconditioned phenomena are permanent or that arhats experience the annihilation of the continuum of birth and death conditioned by karma. So a distinction should be drawn between upholding eternalism or annihilationism on the one hand, which leads to falling into an adverse abyss, and holding something to be permanent or annihilated in general on the other.

That which is free of the extremes of eternalism and nihilism, the holding of which leads to falling into a grasping at an extreme, is referred to as beyond extremes. That this is empty of itself — that is to say, empty of the intrinsic existence of its own being — is referred to as emptiness of beyond extremes. This is as found in the King of Meditations Sutra, {357} where it states that having abandoned the two extremes of existence and nonexistence, of purity and impurity, one must not abide in the middle either.[839] This was taught to counter the clinging to true existence that leads to conceiving the middle, that which is free from the [two] extremes, as possessing real existence. For instance, the Cittamātra school asserts that the mind, taken to be the middle free from the two extremes, is truly existent.

The cycle of existence lacks temporal limits. Since samsara has neither a beginning point, such that one could say, “It did not exist prior to this point,” nor a final end, such that one could say, “It would not exist after this point,” samsara is referred to as beginningless and endless. With no intrinsically existing coming and going, this cycle of existence is dream-like. That this existence is empty of itself, in the sense of intrinsic existence, this emptiness is described with certainty in the treatises — namely, the Perfection Mother of Conquerors sutras — as emptiness of what is beginningless and endless.

“To discard” means to reject and definitely refers to casting aside. “Not to discard” means to not abandon, meaning not to be shunned at all, such as the Great Vehicle. What is not to be discarded is empty of itself — it is devoid of its own being; and this emptiness of inherent existence is therefore called emptiness of not to be discarded.
The essence of things, such as those that are conditioned, is termed their intrinsic nature. This is because the essence or the ultimate nature of conditioned things and so on is not invented by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, nor by bodhisattvas or tathāgatas. They only bring to light such nature; it abides primordially as the essential nature of these things. And this being empty of itself, being devoid of its own being, is emptiness of intrinsic nature.

One might wonder, “Hasn’t this point already been made in the context of the emptiness of emptiness?” Yes, this is indeed true. Nonetheless, the purpose in the prior context was to dispel the doubt that since emptiness of outer and inner phenomena is established by rational cognition perceiving suchness, it might possess true existence. This [emptiness of intrinsic nature] here, however, is presented to help dispel the thought that essential nature might possess true existence because no one has created it. So this is not a redundancy. The grounds for both of these doubts do exist in relation to the ultimate nature of things. If one were to understand how there is no contradiction in nonetheless rejecting its true existence, {358} this would help remove all misconceptions related to holding the view that ultimate truth is not cognizable by any kind of cognition.

Again, one might ask, “What are defining characteristics of form and so on?” Form is defined as capable of materiality, something that is able to assume form. For example, a sutra states:
O monks, because they exist as forms and are suitable for taking on forms, they are called “the appropriated aggregate of form.”[841]
There is no necessity for these specific characteristics to constitute the definitions of the things characterized. They are mentioned here primarily to highlight the principal attributes of these specific phenomena.
Feeling has the nature of an experience, such as of joy, pain or neutrality; discrimination apprehends the signs, such as external signs like blue and yellow colors and inner signs like joy, pain and so on. “Signs” refer to specific attributes of the object. Mental formations construct conditioned phenomena, and it is an aggregate distinct from the other four aggregates. Awareness of specific objects such as forms, sounds, and so on is the defining mark of consciousness. The aggregates are characterized by suffering, while the elements’ nature is to sustain cyclic existence, akin to a venomous snake that seizes others and brings them harm. As for the sense fields, the Buddha said they are the doorways to the arising and emergence of suffering. Here, these three (aggregates, elements, and sense fields) are spoken of from the point of view of things belonging to the cycle of existence. All that is dependently originated is characterized by composition through the coming together of causes and conditions. {360}

Giving, the thought of giving away entirely one’s body, material resources, and roots of virtue, is what defines the perfection of generosity. Discipline is defined as cooling off or the absence of the afflictions’ torment. Forbearance is defined as the absence of anger, the ability to maintain mind’s composure. The defining characteristic of diligence is to have joy in upholding the virtues with the absence of unwholesome action. Meditative absorption is characterized by single-pointed focus of the mind on a virtuous object with the aim of gathering all virtuous factors. Wisdom is defined by the absence of attachment, which refers to negating or bringing attachment or clinging to the true existence of things to an end with the goal of traveling to nirvana. These then, as described above, are stated in the sutras as the defining characteristics of the six perfections.

The four meditative absorptions of the first level and so forth, the four immeasurables of immeasurable loving kindness and so forth, and likewise the four formless states of limitless space and so forth, which are distinct from the first two sets, the Buddha, the knower of perfect truth, said these are characterized by unperturbed serenity — that is, the absence of disequilibrium. For these are attained through abandonment of disequilibrium.

The nature of the thirty-seven factors that lead to enlightenment is to decisively drive forth from samsara. The nature of the liberation door of emptiness is {361} unobjectifiable, and as such it is utter absence in that it is untainted by the stain of objectifying conceptualizations that grasp at true existence. The liberation door of signlessness is defined as peace itself attained through nonobjectification of the signs [or the attributes of things]. The nature of the third liberation door, which is wishlessness, is the absence of suffering and delusion. Through it one correctly views those that have the nature of conditioned suffering as suffering, and viewing the conditioned nature of existence with the wisdom realizing suchness, one does not wish for the excellences of cyclic existence. One also does not wish for the supramundane state on the basis of holding it to possess true existence.

The nature of the eight liberating factors is utterly freeing in that they bring about total freedom from the five hindrances to meditative attainment.[842] Of the eight liberating factors, the first two — (1) viewing external forms while not dismantling the perception of form inside and (2) viewing external forms while dismantling such perception of form inside — are antidotes for the impediments to conjuring emanations. In many copies of the Commentary, the text of the second liberating factor reads, “having the perception of inner as form”; this is an error. (3) The liberating factor [viewing] appealing [forms] and belonging to the fourth level of absorption is defined as the third. This serves as an antidote for such afflictions as enjoying the conjuring of attractive forms and disliking the conjuring of unattractive forms. Within the path that brings about bliss in this very lifetime, there are two kinds: (4–7) the path that accords with liberation, the liberating factors of the four formless absorptions, and (8) the path of abiding in peace, the attainment of cessation wherein discrimination and feeling have ceased — the last two being one liberating factor.[843]

The ten powers, to be explained below,[844] should be perceived as characterized or defined as that which brings utter certainty. In that they engage their domains without any obstruction, they are defined as “powers.” The Buddha made four pronouncements — (1) “I am fully awakened and have perfectly realized without distortion all objects of knowledge,” (2) “I have brought to an end all pollutants together with their residual imprints,” (3) “I say that attachment and so on are factors that obstruct liberation,” and (4) “If one endeavors in these levels and paths [I have shown], suffering will come to an end.” With respect to these four pronouncements, no legitimate opponents can be found who can counter them and assert, “They are not true.” So the Savior’s four fearlessnesses have the nature or characteristic of total firmness. For no opponent can prove these pronouncements to be otherwise.

His perfect knowledge of specific domains — of Dharma, its meaning, etymologies, and confidence — is defined by absence of deficiency or exhaustion of these four of confidence and so on. That which clearly brings about beings’ welfare and happiness is described as his great loving kindness. That which thoroughly protects those sentient beings who suffer defines his great compassion; his great sympathetic joy is defined by utter or supreme joy; while his great equanimity should be understood as unadulterated with being attached to some and averse toward others. It’s free from [such biases].
The unshared attributes of the Buddha, described as eighteen in number, are defined as unremovable by others. The reason is that the Buddha is free from the error that is the opposite of these unique attributes; hence he is not vulnerable to those who might seek to refute him. In other words, these attributes cannot be stolen from the Buddha by others.

The eighteen unshared attributes are the following three sets of six:[845] (1) his body is free of error, (2) his speech is free of senseless chatter, and (3) his mind is free of forgetfulness, (4) free of absence of meditative equipoise, (5) free of conceptualization apprehending samsara and nirvana as different, and (6) free of apathy failing to discriminate natures of phenomena. This is the first set of six. Being free of impairment in the domains of (1) aspiration, (2) diligence, (3) mindfulness, (4) concentration, (5) wisdom, and (6) liberation — this is the second set of six. With respect to the deeds of (1) Buddha’s body, (2) speech, and (3) mind, {363} these are preceded by [the attainment of] wisdom and follow after wisdom; and in relation to the temporal stages of (4) past, (5) future, and (6) present, he engages with them through his wisdom free of attachment and unimpeded. This then is the third set of six. “Unshared” means that these attributes are present only in a buddha and not in other attainments. Thus they remain unshared in terms of their possessor. The explanations of these attributes should be understood on the basis of the Questions of King Dhāraṇīśvara Sutra, which is cited in the Commentary.[846]

{364} This present moment does not endure beyond its own time of existence; the past that has already occurred and the future, which is yet to be and has not arisen at present, have no existence. In that the three — that which has already occurred, that which is yet to be, and the present — are, in their respective order, disintegrated, unarisen, and not enduring — they cannot be perceived anywhere. Hence they are referred to as the “unobservable.” This unobservability is itself empty of its own being, for it does not endure eternally nor disintegrate. So this is emptiness of the unobservable.
Since they, things, originate from their causes and conditions, they lack intrinsic existence as composites. This fact about them is referred to as “nonthing,” and the composite is itself empty of composite’s own essence. This emptiness is emptiness of nonthings.
The presentation of these sixteen kinds of emptiness is not from the point of view of applying diverse avenues of reasoning to help negate true existence. For the same two reasonings — “that it does not endure eternally” and “that it does not disintegrate” — are used in establishing emptiness in all instances. They are also not meant, in general, to help prove the absence of true existence for a single person. For when a person has validly established the absence of true existence with respect to a specific thing, say the eyes for example, the moment he directs his mind to other things, he will be able to terminate all relevant doubts through his own extension of the reasoning, without depending upon someone stating a proof. In view of these, we should understand that this presentation is from both the perspective of a single person as well as from the perspective of specific individuals who may possess stronger clinging to the true existence of particular bases.

In brief the term thing in the phrase “emptiness of things” is used to refer to the five aggregates, and they are indicated here briefly without specifying them individually. They, these five aggregates, are empty of themselves as inherently existent, and this emptiness is called in the sutras the emptiness of things. Again, in brief, nonthing is used to refer to unconditioned phenomena without specifying them, and these include space, nirvana, and so on. That these nonthings are empty of inherent existence as themselves is referred to as the emptiness of nonthings. The word “nature” here refers to the ultimate nature of things. Such a nature is never contrived by śrāvakas and so on [pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, buddhas] but abides as the essential nature of things. That this nature, the ultimate nature of phenomena, is devoid of intrinsic existence is ascribed the name emptiness of intrinsic nature. Whether the buddhas appear in the world or whether they do not appear in the world, all things are empty, and this empty nature is proclaimed to be their transcendent reality.

The Sanskrit term for “transcendent reality” (parabhāva) refers to three things — “supreme,” “other,” and “transcendent.” In the first sense, [emptiness] is the suchness that is most excellent. Being most excellent has the meaning that it exists as never deviating from the defined meaning of what suchness is. In the second sense of the term, “other” here connotes something that is other than of the mundane world; so the term refers to the supramundane wisdom that is most excellent — namely, the nonconceptual wisdom [of the āryas]. And “entity” or “reality” here refers to what is being cognized by that wisdom. In the third sense of the term, what is on the other side is understood to be the “transcendent reality.” The other side of cyclic existence is, because it transcends samsara, the “perfect endpoint.” Here the “endpoint” is nirvana, which is the ending of cyclic existence. Since it never deviates from the defined meaning of what suchness is, such as by turning into something other [this emptiness], this is “suchness.” It is devoid of itself, and this absence of intrinsic existence is called the emptiness of transcendent reality.

Although the emptiness of intrinsic nature and so on {366} were already explained above [among the sixteen kinds of emptiness], there is no fault of redundancy for presenting them again here. They are explained here from the perspective of enumerating emptiness within a medium-scope elaboration. The two last explanations [the emptiness of intrinsic nature and emptiness of transcendent reality] appear repeatedly both in the extensive enumerations as well as in the medium-length enumeration of emptiness. The significance of this is to help remove the doubt that if the ultimate nature is accepted as being the essential nature of things, that it exists at all times, and that it exists as the object of knowledge of nonconceptual wisdom, it must then possess true existence. It is therefore critical to understand that there is no contradiction in accepting these [and at the same time rejecting the true existence of emptiness]. The way we have presented them here [Candrakīrti says] is how these enumerations of emptiness are proclaimed or explained in the Perfection of Wisdom sutras, the Mother of Conquerors.

Though his mind may rest continuously in cessation,

This bodhisattva on the sixth level, though his mind may rest continuously in cessation or clear light, also generates and enhances his compassion for beings bereft of protection. {367} Thus his actions remain within the domain of samsara while his mind remains within the domain of nirvana. Advancing further, this bodhisattva on the sixth level will later also outshine through his wisdom all those born from the Buddha’s speech and the middle buddhas.[847]
And this bodhisattva of the sixth level, who, like a king of swans, will spread wide his two white wings — the right and left wings — of the stages of the path of conventional truth, which is the vast dimension of the path, and the stages of the path of profound ultimate truth, he will soar ahead of other accomplished swans, the excellent swan-like trainees. And propelled by the powerful winds of virtue he had gathered in the past, the bodhisattva would cruise to the excellent far shore, the oceanic qualities of the conquerors, the buddhas.
Thus those of us who aspire to follow in the footsteps of such a bodhisattva, we too must travel with the wings of both aspects of the path. We should not be content with any path that appears to have neither of the two wings, nor should we be content with an incomplete path, which is like having one wing broken. We should instead travel to the stage of buddhahood on the basis of a path where both method and wisdom are complete.

<d e="2">
Here on the seventh ground of Gone Afar, the bodhisattva will enter cessation instantly and within a single moment — that is, all at once in an instant, cessation that he had attained on the sixth level. “Entering the cessation” refers here to entering into absorption of the perfect endpoint [i.e., emptiness]. So thusness (tathatā) is referred to here as “cessation,” the point being that during an ārya’s meditative equipoise [on emptiness], all perceptions of dualistic elaboration come to an end within the sphere of thusness.

The Ten Grounds Sutra, for example, states:
O children of the conquerors, beyond the sixth bodhisattva level one enters into the bodhisattva’s absorption into cessation. So the bodhisattva who abides on the seventh bodhisattva ground enters and exits from cessation even within a single instance of a mind moment. This is not to say, however, that he has actualized cessation.[848]

On this ground he attains as well blazing perfection of skillful means, which means that it has become for him perfectly refined. The manner in which this perfect refinement takes place should be understood on the basis of the reasons explained above in the context of other bodhisattva levels.[849] It’s on the basis of the superiority of specific facets of the perfection of wisdom itself that the last four perfections are defined.[850] It’s the dimension that pertains to the thorough discrimination of phenomena that is the perfection of wisdom itself, not in relation to some other facet.

As for the “skillful means” in what is defined as the perfection of skillful means, the Bodhisattva Grounds speak of two sets of six types of skillful means.[851] The first six skillful means, those that accomplish the qualities of the buddha, are that (1) bodhisattvas view all sentient beings with compassion, (2) they understand the nature of all mental formations exactly as they are, (3) they desire the unexcelled wisdom of enlightenment, {369} (4) seeking the welfare of sentient beings, they do not forsake cyclic existence, (5) they revolve in cyclic existence not through an afflicted mind but through perfectly understanding the conditioning factors exactly as they are, and (6) their diligence is set ablaze because of their wish to attain buddhahood. The six skillful means for maturing the minds of other sentient beings are that (1) bodhisattvas help cultivate the minor roots of virtue of sentient beings so that they may produce immeasurable fruits, (2) they help beings plant great roots of virtue with minimal difficulty, (3) they help dispel the anger of those who are hostile toward the Buddha’s teaching, (4) they help those who remain in a neutral state of mind enter the teaching, (5) they help those who have entered the teaching gain maturity, and (6) they help those who have matured attain the true freedom [of liberation]. These together are the twelve skillful means.

The way in which he attains again and again virtues superior to those compared to the seventh level is explained in the Ten Grounds Sutra:
O child of the conquerors, it is thus. A great sailing ship requires manual propulsion until it reaches the open ocean. However, once it reaches the great ocean, manual propulsion is no longer necessary because the wind would propel it. The distance a ship covers in a single day on the open sea far exceeds what can be covered in a hundred years through that earlier laborious way of moving. It is likewise, O child of the conquerors, with the bodhisattva who has amassed the great collections of roots of virtue and perfectly cultivated the Great Vehicle too; the progress he will make toward omniscient wisdom within a short time by voyaging on the ocean of bodhisattva deeds through spontaneous wisdom, such distance cannot be covered by the prior intentional, laborious activity even in a hundred thousand eons.[852]

Here, “until reaching the open ocean” is the analogy for those on the seventh ground and below; entering and then voyaging on the open ocean is the analogy for traveling the path after attaining the eighth ground.
This bodhisattva on the eighth ground, all of his aspirations become perfectly refined, from the first generation of supramundane aspiration up to the ten great aspirations, all the countless hundred thousand aspirations he has made. Thus, he comes to greatly excel in the perfection of aspiration on this ground.
This level is characterized as the level of the youthful prince, whereas on the ninth one attains the status of a regent and on the tenth one is consecrated by the buddhas in the manner of a universal monarch. When the bodhisattva on this Immovable ground enters cessation, the ultimate nature of things, he’ll be roused from that absorption into cessation by the buddhas.

O child of the conquerors, the bodhisattva who is residing on this Immovable ground — one who has generated the power of aspiration and is abiding within that continuum of the door of Dharma — he will be urged by the blessed buddhas to accomplish the Tathāgata’s wisdom. They will speak to him thus, “O child of lineage, well done! Well done! This [Immovable] indeed constitutes the ultimate forbearance with respect to the realization of the qualities of buddhahood. This said, O child of lineage, you still do not possess the perfect unique attributes of the Buddha, such as my ten powers and four types of fearlessness. {371} So strive in the practices to seek these perfect attributes of the Buddha, apply your perseverance, and do not forsake this door of forbearance.
O child of lineage, although you have attained abiding in the tranquility of liberation, think about the child-like beings who remain bereft of peace, utterly bereft of peace, who are plagued by the emergence of all sorts of afflictions, and whose minds are stupefied by all kinds of conceptualization. O child of the lineage, think also of your past aspirations, the welfare of sentient beings that needs to be accomplished, and the inconceivable nature of the doors of [the Buddha’s] wisdom.
O child of lineage, this is the ultimate nature of all phenomena. Whether tathāgatas appear in the world or not, this ultimate expanse will remain. Thus all phenomena are empty, all phenomena are unobservable. This is not something that defines the tathāgatas only; for śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas too will attain this concept-free ultimate nature.[853]

Also:
If, on the other hand, the blessed buddhas were not to urge this bodhisattva to enter the doors that lead to the attainment of omniscient wisdom, the bodhisattva could enter nirvana on that [Immovable] ground alone. His activity of bringing about of the welfare of all sentient beings could also then come to an end.[854]

These [passages from the sutra] state how on the eighth ground, when the bodhisattva, having mastered nonconceptual wisdom, remains equipoised on that alone, he is roused from this state and is urged to accumulate merit in post-equipoise intervals to gather the accumulations for attaining the buddha’s powers and so on. The sutra speaks also of how śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas also attain concept-free wisdom of direct realization of ultimate nature. In light of these, the assertions that the realization of suchness alone is sufficient and one need not strive in gathering the other accumulations are the mere blather of an unlearned person.

{372} The reason the bodhisattva on this eighth level is roused from cessation by the conquerors is because on this ground, free of attachment, his mind — that is, his wisdom mind — no longer remains with the faults of afflictions such as attachment. Thus on the eight ground, given that the sun of nonconceptual wisdom has risen, all stains, which resemble darkness — all the afflictions that have emerged in the past, which serve as causes for taking birth in the cycle of existence and whose fruits could have been experienced in the three realms — are destroyed along with their roots. In this way, with all the afflictions ceased, he becomes unrivaled in the three realms, or spheres of existence. Yet at this stage when all afflictions have ceased for the bodhisattva, a buddha’s boundless space-like qualities and resources lie beyond his reach. So, to attain these resources, the eighth-level bodhisattva needs to endeavor further.
How is it known that all afflictions have ceased on this ground? The Ten Grounds Sutra states, “At this stage the bodhisattva thoroughly transcends to nirvana.”[855] So one’s mind on this ground is free of attachment to all three realms, for without the freedom from attachment that is the cessation of afflictions, the bodhisattva would not be able to actualize nirvana.

One might ask, if one attains freedom from attachment to the three realms on this level, birth in cyclic existence will come to an end. How then does the bodhisattva complete all the causes for attaining the attributes of the buddha?
[Response:] Though birth in samsara through karma and affliction has ceased for the eighth-ground bodhisattva, he displays himself for samsaric beings though diverse forms on the basis of assuming the mental body gained on this ground through ten controlling powers such as mastery of wisdom, just as explained in the Śrīmālādevī Sutra.[856] It is in such bodies the bodhisattva will complete his accumulations, so there is no contradiction. {373}
The ten controlling powers are described extensively in the Ten Grounds Sutra:
(1) As he has transformed his lifespans across countless incalculable eons, he has gained controlling power over lifespan; (2) as he has engaged in the wisdom of incalculable contemplations of concentration, he has gained controlling power over the mind; (3) as he displays the entirety of world systems as adorned with an incalculable array of ornaments, he has gained controlling power over material resources; (4) as he displays the fruits of karma in perfect accord with time, he has gained controlling power over action; (5) as he displays birth in all world systems, he has controlling power over birth; (6) as he continuously displays total realization of whatever is wished for at any time, he has gained controlling power over aspiration; (7) as he continuously displays the entirety of world systems as filled with the buddhas, he has gained controlling power over intention; (8) as he displays miraculous emanations in all buddha fields, he has gained controlling power over supernatural feats; (9) as he continuously displays [similitudes of] the tathāgatas’ powers, their fearlessness, the unique qualities of the buddhas, the major ārya marks, the minor ārya marks, and the full awakening of buddhahood, he has gained controlling power over wisdom; and (10) as he continuously emanates the light that opens the doors to the Dharma free from the boundaries of center and edges, he has gained controlling power over Dharma.[857]

Ten types of power are described in the context of the perfection of power, as for example in the Ornament of the Sage’s Intent:
(1) The power of intention refers to the total absence of indulgence in the afflictions; (2) the power of altruistic resolve refers to being thoroughly trained in the wisdom of the bodhisattva levels; (3) the power of retention refers to never forgetting the teachings; (4) the power of meditative concentration refers to being always utterly free from distraction; (5) the power of perfect resources refers to being versed in clearly discerning the activities of beings of the limitless and infinite world systems; (6) the power of influence refers to realizing everything his mind hopes; (7) the power of confidence refers to being versed in detailed discernment of the experiences of all attributes of a buddha; (8) the power of aspiration refers to never forsaking the act of engaging in the deeds of all the buddhas; (9) the power of the perfections refers to bringing the attributes of a buddha to maturation, bringing sentient beings to their maturation, and never forsaking activities that are beneficial to all sentient beings; (10) the power of great loving kindness refers to being dedicated to connecting all sentient beings to safety; (11) the power of great compassion refers to dispelling all the sufferings of all sentient beings; (12) the power of the ultimate nature of things refers to directly realizing the ultimate nature of things, such as their illusion-like character; and (13) the power of being blessed by all tathāgatas refers to being face to face with the wisdom of omniscience.

Just as in the case of the perfection of power, the bodhisattva also attains the spotless qualities of four kinds of perfect knowledge of phenomena, their significance, etymologies, and confidence. Here the Commentary states that with the first one knows the specific characteristics of each phenomenon; with the second one knows the differentiations among attributes of all phenomena; with the third one knows how to speak about these phenomena without confusion; and with the fourth one knows, without any gaps, the continuum of the concordant causes of these phenomena.[859] In other texts, these are explained in terms of the knowledge of (1) the Dharma, (2) its subject matter, (3) the etymological meaning of the terms, and (4) limitless confidence [to speak].

On the tenth ground he, the bodhisattva, will receive the supreme empowerment of great light from all the buddhas of all directions. The way in which this empowerment is received is as stated in the Ten Grounds Sutra:
At the end of having attained a millionfold countless concentrations, this bodhisattva will actualize a concentration known as “conferring the empowerment,” which is no different from [buddha’s] omniscient wisdom. Immediately afterward, a great lotus of jewels will appear, equal in size to a quadrillionfold world system known as Endowed with All Supreme Aspects . . . surrounded by countless smaller lotuses equal to the number of atoms that exist in a million billionfold world systems. The bodhisattva’s body too remains commensurate with such a size. The instant the bodhisattva attains that concentration, he will appear seated upon this lotus. As he sits on it, light rays would emerge from the mid brows of the buddhas that have converged from all the buddhafields, and they will confer empowerment upon him.[860]
For this bodhisattva, among the ten perfections, his superior gnosis will reach here its perfection as well — that is to say, his gnosis will become perfectly refined. As for the nature of this gnosis and how it differs from the perfection of wisdom, Bodhisattva Grounds says:
The knowledge of the presentations of all phenomena as they are represents the perfection of gnosis. Regarding this, the gnosis that penetrates ultimate truth is the perfection of wisdom, while the gnosis that penetrates conventional truth constitutes the perfection of gnosis. This then is the difference between these two perfections.[861]
Just as heavy downpour descends from water-laden clouds to help nurture the crops of worldly people, so from him, {377} this son of conquerors on the tenth ground, the Dharma rain will fall freely to water the crop of beings’ virtues. This ground is therefore called Cloud of Dharma.

On the first ground of the ultimate awakening mind, the bodhisattva who has attained the first ground (1) sees instantly — that is, in a single moment — a hundred buddhas and (2) knows as well that he is being blessed by all those hundred buddhas. At that point, (3) the lifespan of the one abiding on the first ground will endure for a hundred eons; and during these hundred eons (4) he will know perfectly what came before and what will follow. This means that the vision of his gnosis will penetrate the bounds of past and future for up to a hundred eons. (5) This wise one, the bodhisattva, will enter into a hundred meditative absorptions and will exit out of these. (6) This bodhisattva can cause a hundred world systems to tremble, and (7) he will be able to illuminate hundred world systems. (8) Likewise, through his supernatural feats, this bodhisattva can ripen hundred sentient beings to maturity. (9) He will journey to a hundred buddhafields, one buddhafield for each buddha. (10) This bodhisattva will open a hundred Dharma doors, {379} and (11) this offspring of the Sage will display within his body a hundred other forms as well.

The one abiding on the eighth ground, The Immovable, one who is devoid of conceptualization of self-grasping at both persons and phenomena, attains such a magnitude of qualities they equal the number of atoms that exist in a hundred thousand billionfold worlds — namely, in all three realms of the entire trichiliocosm.
The bodhisattva who is residing on the ninth ground, Perfect Intellect, attains these twelve qualities thus described above, increased to the count of all the atoms in ten times a hundred thousand countless worlds — namely, one million countless trichiliocosms.
On the tenth ground, the qualities of this ground are such that the number of the twelve qualities lies beyond the bounds of speech. Such a total is a countless quantity indeed, and the qualities he attains equal the count of all atoms that exist in the buddhafields even beyond what is inexpressible. The phrase “to say the least” indicates that the qualities on the tenth ground are not exhausted by what has been stated here. These are the ones “to say the least,” and they signal the sequence for speaking about other qualities that will appear later [in the text]. {381}
Furthermore, such a bodhisattva can, without conscious thoughtful intention, display within every bodily pore countless bodhisattvas and forms of fully awakened buddhas, each with a retinue of incalculable bodhisattvas, even changing forms into different aspects within a single instant. Likewise, in every pore of his body, he can display within every single instant other forms as well, namely those of the beings of five realms of existence[863] — celestial beings, demigods, humans, and so on — each in their distinctness and without mixing with each other. The words “and so on” indicate those that are not mentioned. What are those unmentioned ones included here? They are Indra, Brahmā, worldly guardians, kings of the human world, śrāvakas, and pratyekabuddhas. So the words “and so on” underline the point made in the statement “For the sake of sentient beings who are ready to be tamed by the Tathāgata, he is capable of assuming the physical forms of Indra and others and teach the Dharma spontaneously.”[864] For an extensive explanation of this point, consult the Ten Grounds Sutra.

{382} Just as, for example, moonlight in a cloudless sky can shine bright for all those traveling [at night], so too the one who has found that tenth ground of awakening mind, which clears away the darkness obstructing the attainment of the buddha’s qualities, knows that he can attain the qualities of the buddha by himself. So he strives once again — that is, he initiates further efforts on that tenth ground, the very ground that will give rise to the buddha’s ground endowed with ten powers — so that he attains the buddha’s ground. The supreme state of peace, the object of his striving — namely, the unexcelled gnosis — the Blessed One will find in Akaniṣṭha and in that realm alone. This gnosis is the ultimate culmination of all qualities: here all the qualities, such as the establishings of mindfulness, have reached their culmination and are most sublime. It is unrivaled as well because nothing is like it and nothing surpasses it.
To be consistent with the text of the commentary, the translation of the first line should read as I have explained above.[865] As for the second line, Naktso renders it as “Once again, having striven on that ground that precedes the arising of the ten powers.” This translation actually seems better. The expression “in Akaniṣṭha alone” indicates that someone who is not yet enlightened will necessarily first attain the state of complete enlightenment is Akaniṣṭha. [In contrast] the display of attaining complete enlightenment by someone who was awakened previously takes place in the desire realm. This is the position of the Perfection Vehicle.[866]
To show that when one first attains full awakening in Akaniṣṭha, that blessed one attains the gnosis that knows everything in a single instant, the text says:

For example, there may be many different types of vessels, such as vases, bowls, and so on, but the space that exists within, or pervades, these different containers remains the same, in that space is the mere negation of obstruction. Other than that, it is indistinguishable. Likewise, although differentiations of phenomena exist — such as form, feelings, and so on — created by causes and conditions, no such differentiations exist in terms of their suchness, their absence of arising through an intrinsic nature. Thus one should recognize that the ultimate realities of all things share the same or a single taste. {383} Since he has perfectly realized this sameness of taste with his enlightened mind in a single instant, the buddha, the excellent mind, has found the gnosis that perceives all the knowables in a single instant.

[Objection:] You say that the absence of intrinsic arising is the suchness of form and so on, but then you also assert that this is cognized by the mind. Now if you posit that pacification of intrinsic arising is ultimate reality, you will then have to admit that the mind, or wisdom, will never perceive it. For were the mind to focus on ultimate reality — which is the absence of intrinsic arising — what kind of aspect would this mind assume? No such thing is possible. Therefore, with no aspect [of an object] to be perceived, the mind could not perceive ultimate reality. And without a cognizing subject, the mind as a knowing subject, there can no knowledge of an object. So how can this truth of ultimate reality be known at all? And in the absence of a knowing mind, what knowledge can there be? This is a contradiction in terms. Also, if there is no possibility for a mind that engages ultimate reality, with no knower, how can you say, “I have realized such ultimate reality,” and teach it to others by saying, “It is thus”? This is untenable.

so in dependence on convention, we say the mind can know suchness. 11.13

{384} In the conventions of the world, when consciousness holds an aspect that resembles the form of the object, that consciousness is said to perceive that object. Just as for you, for example, when the mind arises taking the aspect of some blue object, you say that such a mind perceives it, the blue object. Likewise, when the knowing subject assumes the aspect that resembles suchness, then in dependence on worldly convention, we say that the mind can know suchness. Thus the manner in which the mind takes on the aspect of suchness is this: When no-arising through intrinsic nature is suchness of the object, and that mind too has likewise no arising through intrinsic nature, one fuses with the other in the manner of water poured into water, and it is in this manner the mind takes on the aspect of such an object. It is in this manner we define how the mind realizes suchness. So the problem you have raised in your objection above does not apply.

Here, the Commentary states:
Therefore one speaks of realizing suchness on the basis of designation, though in fact, it is not that something is known by something. Both the cognizer and the cognized are unborn.[868]
The meaning of the phrase “on the basis of designation” is as found in the line “mind knows . . . in dependence on convention.” The mind perceives [suchness] not in some intrinsically real manner but on the basis of mere designation. The meaning is not that it is an instance of ersatz knowing of suchness. The expression “in fact” and so forth indicates that there is no knowing [of suchness] other than the mere arising of the aspect of the absence of conceptual elaboration. Suchness is not known in the manner of perceiving colors like yellow or blue, where there is the appearance of their forms to the mind. This is because just as the object suchness is unarisen, the subject [the mind] too possesses the aspect of being unarisen through intrinsic nature. This is what the Commentary is saying.

This being so, when the opponent objects that the mind perceiving suchness is impossible based on the following arguments — the mind cannot engage with an object if its aspect cannot appear to that subject; if the mind does not engage, then it would not know that object; and it is contradictory to assert something to be a knowing subject if it does not know anything — given that Candrakīrti himself agrees with the arguments, he responds to this by rejecting the assertion that ultimate truth cannot be perceived. He furthermore explains, with the help of an example, how the aspect of suchness can appear to the mind and how {385} one can speak of the mind perceiving such an object on that basis. Given this, those who say that in this system there is no nonconceptual gnosis realizing the ultimate truth simply denigrate the supreme realization of the āryas.

Here, the line “[the buddha, the excellent mind,] perceives all knowledge objects in a single instant” (11.11d) states that it is within a single instant that a buddha attains omniscient wisdom, and there is also the statement that the gnosis pertaining to the way things really are does not know in the manner of perceiving the cognizer and cognized to be separate. With respect to these statements, it seems necessary to properly understand how a buddha knows the way things really are as well as things in their diversity. So let me offer here a brief explanation.

Until one attains buddhahood, it is not possible for a single instant of cognition to perceive multiple specific phenomena and to have direct perception of their ultimate reality at the same time. The knowledge of these two will occur in an alternating manner. However, from the point when all the residual impressions of grasping at true existence are gone and one has become fully awakened, one then abides at all times in meditative equipoise on ultimate truth. At such a stage, then, there is no alternating between equipoise and post-equipoise states on the basis of exiting or arising from that equipoise.

This is as described in the autocommentary on the Two Truths:
Within a single instant of wisdom,
it pervades the entire expanse of knowledge.[869]
Therefore, since there is no post-equipoise gnosis that knows things in their diversity that is a different entity from the gnosis of meditative equipoise, you have to accept that every object of knowledge encompassed by the two truths is known by a single gnosis. So, in relation to knowing ultimate reality as a gnosis knowing the way things really are, all dualistic appearances are thoroughly calmed and gnosis rests in a single taste, like water poured into water. In relation to the buddha’s gnosis knowing things in their diversity, however, the dualistic appearances of object and subject appear in all their specificity. This said, since all residual imprints of deluded dualistic perceptions have been eradicated, this dualistic perception is not erroneous with respect to what is being perceived. It is thus not an erroneous type of dualistic perception. How this is not erroneous has already been explained well elsewhere.[870]

That both equipoise and post-equipoise stages do exist on the level of the buddhahood is stated in the commentary on the following lines of the Sublime Continuum:
Wisdom, gnosis, and thorough freedom,
are [respectively] luminous, radiating, and pure.
Devoid of differentiation, they resemble
the light, rays, and orb of the sun.[871]
Its commentary states:
The nonconceptual supramundane wisdom that exists in the mind of a buddha, {386} since it abides dispelling the darkness that obscures the sublime ultimate reality of objects of knowledge, it resembles a luminous light. The gnosis attained in its aftermath that knows all objects of knowledge, since it engages with every aspect of things that are objects of knowledge, resembles the radiating network of light rays.[872]

<d e="2">
The “nonconceptual supramundane wisdom” refers here to the mind in equipoise; and how this is defined in relation to the ultimate truth is indicated by the phrase “the sublime ultimate reality.” The “after” in the phrase “attained in its aftermath” should not be understood in any temporal sense of sequence, such as that it was attained after rising out of that equipoise. Its meaning is that it is attained or that it emerges through the power of that meditative equipoise. The line “objects of knowledge” and so on indicates that such post-equipoise gnosis is defined on the basis of its engagement with the entire expanse of knowledge. So the buddha’s gnosis, from the point of view of the phenomena that are the bases, is not a wisdom knowing the way things really are, and from the point of view of their ultimate reality, it is not a wisdom knowing things in their diversity.

If one understands this point well, one will then comprehend the significance of the following from the Two Truths:
Absent of the imputed essence,
all things arisen in mere dependence
in a way that corresponds to appearances:
these the omniscient sees directly.[873]
And:
Signs no longer appear
for him who does not perceive in terms
of the knower and the known.
With his abiding firm, he does not rise.[874]
In these lines, it is stated that a buddha directly knows all the appearances of things in their diversity and that he does so without perceiving in dualistic terms of the knower and the known. Other great ones have made similar statements. With respect to these, some assert that not perceiving any dichotomy of the knower and known is from the point of view of a buddha himself, while direct knowing of all objects of knowledge [by a buddha’s mind] is a mode of knowing relevant to the perspective of other trainees. When it comes to the state of buddhahood, there is actually no gnosis at all.[875] One does not have to say such things. For [if you follow our line of explanation] you will know that there is not the slightest contradiction in the fact that a single gnosis can have two distinct modes of knowing defined from the perspectives of its two distinct objects.

There is no contradiction. The definition of the two truths presented earlier is to be understood in general. The mode of knowing of a buddha’s gnosis, however, is indeed a special case, unique in comparison to the mode of knowing on the tenth level and the stages below it. Therefore, were one to formulate a definition of the ultimate truth that includes even a buddha’s mode of knowing, {387} it should read: “that which is found by a valid rational cognition seeing the perfect truth and with respect to which its cognition constitutes such valid rational cognition.”[876] Through this one should understand the definition of conventional truth as well. In this manner, you should understand how the ultimate truth is found by the buddha’s gnosis knowing the way things really are and how it is in relation to this that such gnosis is defined as knowing the way things really are. Likewise, you should understand how conventional truth is found by the buddha’s gnosis knowing things in their diversity and how it is in relation to it that such gnosis is defined as gnosis knowing things in their diversity. Here you should also recall our position presented above in the context of analyzing whether reflexive awareness is tenable.[877]

Now we will present our response to the objection raised above (in 11.12d), “According to you, with no knower, who would teach suchness to other trainees, saying, ‘It’s thus’?”
It is true that the consciousness that realizes ultimate reality on the level of buddhahood is fused in a single taste with its object — namely, ultimate truth, which is the absence of intrinsic arising. However, this does not eliminate all possibility for the world to realize ultimate reality. How so? The heart of the opponent’s objection is that if a buddha abides at all times within the single taste of ultimate reality, there would then be no teacher with any intention or thought to teach the Dharma. And if there is no such intention, there can be no teaching of the Dharma. Thus the text, after raising the objection, presents the following response explaining how teaching the Dharma can be tenable even in the absence of conceptualization. Thus the root text says:

The buddha’s form body — the embodiment in which the buddha actualizes the dharmakāya, which is the ultimate expanse — is sustained or created by the manifold accumulations of merit. It is the perfect enjoyment body endowed with a profusion of inconceivable forms. It is the cause for bodhisattvas’ enjoyment of the wealth of the Dharma. The sounds that reverberate from this buddha body declare the truth of the ultimate reality of phenomena. From these {388} the world — that is, spiritual trainees who are suitable vessels for hearing about the way things really are — comes to understand suchness without distortion. Not only will such sounds emerge from the buddha body that was produced by hundredfold merits, emanations will also appear through the power of such an enjoyment body, and through the force of those emanations, sounds will issue forth even from inanimate things like space, and others such as grasses, trees, walls, and rocky cliffs, revealing the truth of reality.

Like [the fruits of] a wish-granting jewel and a wish-fulfilling tree, the buddha’s enlightened deeds will flow from the force of the maturation of the merit accumulated by the trainees for hearing the Dharma from the buddha as well as the extraordinary aspirations made by the buddha when he was a bodhisattva in the past. This is inconceivable indeed.
What types of aspirations are these? They are those such as the following: “May I too become one who is dedicated to securing the welfare of sentient beings, never wavering from the ultimate expanse for even an instant and yet never missing a timely opportunity to tame sentient beings.” {389} This citation from a sutra is found in Naktso’s translation.

Now we will describe [the buddha body] from the point of view of the dharmakāya. The buddha body, which is or has the nature of gnosis, is the fire-like gnosis that has burned away the tinder of all objects of knowledge that appear in dualistic terms. Since it is immersed in the absence of intrinsic arising, which is in fact the very nature of the objects of knowledge, it is endowed with an awareness bearing this aspect of the absence of intrinsic arising. This state of peace, the ultimate reality, is the buddhas’ perfect dharmakāya.

It is from this perspective the Diamond Cutter Sutra states:
The buddhas view ultimate nature,
the saviors the dharmakāya.
Ultimate nature is not an object of knowledge
because it cannot be known.[878]
This states that buddhas remain in equipoise on ultimate reality at all times, and that although the saviors know the dharmakāya and the ultimate nature, they do not view them in terms of dualistic appearances.
As for this ultimate reality, there is neither arising nor cessation in such a state, and it is from this point of view that the following has been stated in the sutras: “O Mañjuśrī, that which is known as no-arising and no-cessation is designated the Tathāgata.”[879] Thus, on the level of buddhahood, the conceptual processes of mind and mental factors have ceased and do not operate with respect to the truth of ultimate reality. As such the two — nonconceptual gnosis and ultimate reality — remain indivisibly fused like water poured into water. Therefore, on the conventional level, this state is said to be first actualized, or obtained, by the enjoyment body. {390} To substantiate this point, Naktso’s translation appears to cite here from the Irreversible Wheel Sutra.[880]

With respect to the meaning of “with mind ceased,” Clear Words says:
The following statement appears in the sutras: “What is this ultimate truth? If, with respect to it, there is not even the turnings of thought, what need is there to speak of words?” Therefore it is the absence of conceptualization.[881]
So the text explains the meaning in terms of the absence of the turnings of thought — that is, conceptualization. Here in the autocommentary too, after explaining the meaning of the state of peace in terms of being free of the mind and mental factors, the analogy of wish-fulfilling tree and wish-granting jewel are provided to illustrate how although such is the state of that peace, it is capable of bringing about others’ welfare. And at the end of this, the autocommentary says, “So even though there is no conceptualization, like a wish-fulfilling tree and a wish-granting jewel . . .”[882] Thus Candrakīrti clearly states that it is the conceptualizing mind and mental factors that a buddha is free from. So to cite this passage as a source for the claim that there is no gnosis at the level of buddhahood is a failure to understand the meaning of the text and constitutes a grave denigration.

This enjoyment body, the buddha body in which the dharmakāya is actualized, is the body of peace for it is free of conceptualizing mind and mental factors. Although it does not conceptualize, it is capable of accomplishing the welfare of sentient beings. Therefore, radiant like the wish-fulfilling tree, it resembles the wish-granting jewel that without any forethought serves as the cause for the realization of the aims of spiritual trainees. This body remains present constantly — that is, for a long time — granting riches of the world to beings, the spiritual trainees, until they gain freedom. In this way the buddhas engage only in the welfare of sentient beings and remain as long as the world exists and as long as space endures. This enjoyment body will be perceived only by those bodhisattvas whose minds are free of conceptual elaboration, only those who have attained, through their twofold accumulation, the ground on which they have found the stainless mirror of wisdom. It will not be visible to those on the ordinary stage who possess conceptual elaboration. {391} Also, Seventy Stanzas on Going for Refuge to the Three states:
The form body of the buddha
blazes with major and minor marks;
owing to the aspirations of beings,
it assumes varied forms.
The body that is born from
stores of merit immeasurable
is seen by the Conqueror’s children
who abide on the ten grounds.
This resource body of dharmakāya
is indeed an enlightened act of the buddhas.[883]

Within a single form body that is causally concordant with the dharmakāya and the enjoyment body, the buddha displays all the circumstances of his previous births in cyclic existence that have now ceased, from time without beginning. He spontaneously displays within a single instant all these past occurrences, in vividness and clear without error — that is to say, without conflating them, like a reflection in an utterly unblemished mirror. {392}
For example, a blessed one displays the following: how, when he was engaged in the perfection of generosity in the past, he made offerings to and honored such and such buddhas; how the sage took birth in whatever buddhafields there were, such as with lakes that have the nature of lapis lazuli adorned with sentient beings living therein; the specifics of the bodies, deeds, strengths, and powers of those buddhas; the size of the retinue of their assembled disciples; the many [ārya] sanghas who had become such as a result of their dedicated practice of Dharma; whatsoever physical forms the bodhisattvas assumed adorned with the noble and exemplary marks of whatever buddhafields; the many living there enjoying requisites like monastic robes, food, and shelter; whatsoever teachings he gave such as those pertaining to the single vehicle or the three vehicles; the ways of life he had assumed — whether as intelligent lay members of different castes like the brahmans or as a monastic — who, having listened to the Dharma and having taken the precepts partially or in their entirety, engaged in whatsoever bodhisattva deeds; and the length of time and the quantities of offerings he made of precious jeweled ornaments, monastic robes, and foodstuffs to these buddhas, bodhisattvas, and śrāvakas. All this, without omission, the buddha displays within a single body.
Just as he displays all the circumstances that occurred pertaining to his perfection of generosity, likewise he displays within a single body whatever practices he had engaged in in the past, such as the perfections of discipline, forbearance, diligence, meditative absorption, and wisdom. The explanation given in the context of generosity [such as the length of time and the extent] should be applied to these other perfections as well. Not only does the buddha simultaneously display all his past activities within a single body, all of this he displays without any omission and in clearest detail within a single pore as well.

He shows how the buddhas of the past and those yet to come in the future, as well as those buddhas now present residing throughout the expanse of space teach the Dharma in a resounding and clear voice, and how they remain in the world to relieve beings who are seized or tormented by pain. In short, he displays, as his own activities, all the deeds of the buddhas of the three times from first embracing the awakening mind up to the attainment of the essence of enlightenment. He is in fact capable of displaying all this within a single pore of his body and within a single instant of time. Now some ordinary magicians can, through the power of incantations and substances, display various appearances of habitats and the creatures living in them on their own bodies. If that is so, how could the buddhas and bodhisattvas who understand the character of things as indistinguishable from that of optical illusions insofar as their truth or falsity is concerned, and who have been familiar with this truth for numerous eons, not be capable of displaying such conjurations? Therefore what learned person would not understand this or would harbor doubt even though he comprehends this? There cannot be. So on the basis of this analogy [of a magician], we should develop even greater conviction.
Just as he displays all of his own past activities, the Buddha is capable likewise of displaying within a single pore in a single moment of time all the deeds of the bodhisattvas of the three times, the ārya pratyekabuddhas and śrāvakas of the three times, all these without omission as well as those of others — namely, the deeds during their period as ordinary beings.

This pure enlightened activity of a buddha, which is free from all stains, engages as if through merely wishing, and in such a way, a buddha is capable of displaying within the space of a single atom an entire world system stretching to the ends of space itself. And when he displays a single atom that pervades the space of countless or the entire world systems, he does so without that single atom expanding — in other words, becoming larger — and without the world contracting — that is, becoming smaller.

The text says that although śrāvaka arhats and pratyekabuddha arhats have eliminated the afflictions, they do not have the capacity to eliminate their residual imprints. And the text goes on to state, “As for the residual imprints of ignorance, they are obstacles to total knowledge of all phenomena.”[890] So the imprints of afflictions are described as being obscurations to knowledge as well. Since grasping at self-existence of phenomena is understood to be an affliction in this system [of Candrakīrti], the principal obscuration to knowledge must be taken to be the habitual propensities for deluded dualistic perception. Given that the noble Nāgārjuna and his son Āryadeva do not provide any explicit identification of what an obscuration to knowledge is, we should rely entirely on the explanation found here in the Commentary.

Again, the Commentary states:
These residual imprints of attachment and so on, in turn, will cease for someone who is omniscient and fully awakened alone, not for others.[891]
In light of this, the “seed” referred to in the context of the statement that the seed of afflictions will cease for śrāvaka arhats and pratyekabuddha arhats as well from the eighth ground cannot be the same as the residual imprints of the afflictions referred to in the above citation. As for the extremely subtle form of these residual imprints, the point when they are about to cease is the exactly the same point when the uninterrupted path of the last stage of the tenth ground is about to arise. And the path of release that marks the first elimination of these extremely subtle imprints is simultaneous with the first instant of a buddha’s gnosis. Candrakīrti, therefore, speaks of these [residual imprints] being destroyed through the power of omniscience.[892]

The statement that the powers [of a buddha] know all phenomena has to be understood in terms of direct perception. Since it is impossible to attribute implicit cognition to a buddha’s perception, this means that a buddha must know these phenomena on the basis of directly perceiving them. It is clearly explained in Candrakīrti’s Commentary on Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning that it is not the position of this system to accept knowing without the appearance of aspects [of the objects].[893] This means also that a buddha knows the past and future not somehow implicitly on the basis of directly perceiving the present. To be specific, with respect to the present such as this very day, for example, since the past and future defined in relation to it do not exist at this time, they are not perceived right now at this very time. There is, however, no contradiction in maintaining that a gnosis that perceives the present time also perceives all the pasts and futures as well. For example, although a sprout that exists at the time of a specific seed was not produced by that particular seed, there is no contradiction in stating that seeds do produce sprouts. {400}

As for the entirety of a fully enlightened buddha’s qualities, even if the Buddha himself were to transform his lifespan to endure for countless eons to keep declaring these qualities, putting aside other enlightened activities to do so, he would not come to the end of the qualities. So what need is there to speak of bodhisattvas being able to do so? What need is there to speak at all of pratyekabuddhas and śrāvakas being able to know or express these qualities exhaustively?

For example, when birds with wide wingspans capable of reaching the far shores cruise the sky on the power of the wind, they do not stop flying because there is no more sky, because the sky has reached its end. Rather, they do so when they have, as a result of flying on and on, exhausted their strength. Likewise, śrāvakas and the like — namely, pratyekabuddhas — as well as bodhisattvas on the great bodhisattva grounds, will cease declaring the buddha’s qualities, which are infinite as space. This is not because the qualities have been exhausted; they cease to do so because their power of mind has been defeated. Given that the qualities of a buddha cannot be expressed in their entirety, the question arises, how could someone like me, the author of this commentary, know and speak of the buddha’s qualities? I cannot. So I admit that I do not possess any knowledge of my own, even partial, about the qualities of a buddha. Nonetheless, since the noble Nāgārjuna has described them, relying on his explanations and setting hesitation or doubts aside, I have spoken briefly about them. {401}

In brief, the twin qualities of a buddha presented in this treatise are the profound and the vast. Emptiness is the profound — namely, the dharmakāya and the emptiness of the ground and of the path. Qualities other than emptiness — such as the powers and so forth of the eleven grounds,[894] which have been described — are the vast. By understanding the nature of these qualities of the profound and the vast — by, say, understanding these two essential factors by cultivating them in meditative practice — these twin qualities of the buddha are obtained.

And through emanations you show the deeds of coming to the human world from Tuṣita, taking birth, and so on, which involve a relationship with parents and a son. You also display the deed of turning the wheel of Dharma in accord with others’ mental faculties to help them enter enlightenment, the state of peace that is the city of nirvana. In this way, without any desire for fame or reward and with great compassion you lead to or place in the state beyond sorrow all beings indulging in devious behavior and ensnared in a network of expectations or cravings. {402} With respect to the phrase “indulging in devious behavior,” Explanation of the Commentary has “indulging in varied behavior.”[895] This latter reading seems to be more in tune with Candrakīrti’s Commentary.

Apart from the knowledge of the suchness of all phenomena there exist no other principal means to dispel all the stains belonging to the two obscurations — that is to say, no other principal methods. Furthermore, since the suchness of phenomena admits of no differentiation based on distinct features, the subject mind — namely, the wisdom that knows it [suchness] — is likewise undifferentiated. This is to say, it does not disclose different aspects of cognizing its object. Thus you, the Buddha, taught to us beings who are the trainees a single undifferentiated vehicle that is unmatched by any other vehicles. For example, we find the following:
Kāśyapa, if all phenomena are cognized in terms of perfect equanimity, you have transcended to nirvana. This in turn is singular — not two or three.[896]
Along lines similar to Entering the Middle Way, the noble Nāgārjuna too says:
With no differentiation in ultimate expanse, {403}
no differentiation exists in your vehicle.
The presentation of three vehicles
is thus to help sentient beings with their entry.[897]
Given that the cessation of all afflictions is not possible without the realization of suchness, and since there is no major differentiation when it comes to the ultimate reality of phenomena, Candrakīrti explains here that such presentations as the following were taught to help guide some trainees in the immediate term: those that speak about differences among causal vehicles with respect to the need for or lack thereof of the realization of suchness for transcendence to nirvana, and those that speak about vehicles wherein after having attained nirvana that consists in the mere cessation of afflictions, one does not move onto another fruit. If we understand this properly, we will comprehend the intention behind statements that those on the Hīnayāna path do not realize the selflessness of phenomena.
One might ask, “If there is only one nirvana, after attaining which one does not need to enter another vehicle, how is it that the vehicles of śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha too have been stated to lead to nirvana?” To show that such statements are for an intended purpose, the root text says:

Sentient beings face so many barriers to entering the Great Vehicle, yet it is vital they are definitely led to nirvana. Therefore, as stated in the Sublime Dharma of the White Lotus, just as a wise captain, to relieve the frustrations of a host of travelers on a long voyage across the ocean journeying to an isle of gems, conjures or emanates images of beautiful towns until they reach the land of gems, {404} so you, the Blessed One, set forth vehicles before the shore of the Mahayana as means to attain this Great Vehicle.[898] You have done this to help soothe the minds of your disciples and offer them relief; thus you taught the two vehicles of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas (who are included here as well). Then you spoke differently, in a distinct manner, to those whose minds are trained in the utter absence of afflictions of cyclic existence; for them you taught the Great Vehicle alone. And just like the buddhas [of the past], they will without doubt attain buddhahood after completing their accumulations. This establishment of the singularity of vehicle should be understood on the basis of statements such as the following from the Compendium of Sutras: “That the vehicle is limited to only one is taught in a multitude of sutras.”[899]

The atoms in all the worlds of all ten directions — however many there might be — that are within the sphere of the sugatas, for that many eons you have entered the enlightened state. Though this is so, it is difficult for those who have not already gathered the roots of virtue to be convinced, and so this secret of yours should not be divulged in words. I have spoken about them here, however, to help gather merit by those who have extraordinary admirations for these [enlightened deeds].
Here, the author of the Explanation of the Commentary says, “It is stated thus because the dharmakāya of all the buddhas is one; otherwise, no other buddhas could emerge.”[900] This is incorrect because the Commentary explains this [stanza] from the point of view of emergence of the emanation body.[901] {405} It is also incorrect to interpret the [Commentary’s] phrase “the cause for the emergence of the emanation body” as referring to the dharmakāya, for if one accepts this to be the extent of the time for entering the dharmakāya, the fault of there being no opportunity for others to attain buddhahood would still stand for us as well. Furthermore, if the dharmakāya of all the buddhas is one, the dharmakāya of those who have not previously attained buddhahood and those who are attaining buddhahood would all have already been attained, thus entailing such extreme contradictions. This passage, therefore, indicates the measure of having departed to the essence of awakening; and with respect to this too, it is not presenting the length of time since the Buddha attained full awakening in the past. Rather, it is showing the extent of the number of times the Buddha displayed the deed of attaining full awakening as the emanation body after having already attained buddhahood. The following rendering, Naktso’s translation, seems better:
The number of atoms in all the realms,
which are within the spheres of the buddhas of all ten directions,
that many times you, the supreme Sugata, will come forth
to enlightenment . . .
If we explain this stanza as is done by the Explanation of the Commentary, we ourselves would become the ones to whom, as the root text says, this secret should not be divulged.

Through their unskillfulness with respect to suchness, there are beings who cling to the notions of the true existence of things and, on that basis, owing to their conviction in the law of karma and its effects, view existence in terms of births as celestial gods or as humans. This in turn definitely gives rise to the pains of birth and destruction — namely, death — as well as the suffering that arises from the loss of the wanted, such as a loved one, and gain of what is unwanted. There are beings also who cling to the notion of nonthings, such as the nonexistence of causality, and thus fall to evil destinies, such as unfortunate births like those in the hell realms. Given that sentient beings meet with sufferings described previously, this world of beings finds itself within the sphere of your great heart’s tenderness. Through your great compassion, Blessed One, you turn away from one-sided peace, and forsaking such one-sided peace of nirvana, you remain in the world.

For it is illogical to speak of the world-transcending truth as equivalent to worldly truths.[902]

All presentations of everyday conventions in this system are made solely on the basis of the absence of existing through intrinsic characteristics. As such, the tenets of essentialist schools such as the Sautrāntika and Vaibhāṣika, which are postulated entirely on the assumption that things exist through their intrinsic characteristics, cannot be said to exist even on the conventional level, let alone on the level of the ultimate truth. Such is the standpoint of this tradition [of Candrakīrti]. Thus Candrakīrti urges us to understand that not only is his system distinct from Cittamātra, it is unique even among other Mādhyamikas who interpret the intent of savior Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva. Since our master accepts Buddhapālita’s commentary to be authoritative, he is not expressing disapproval of him here. It appears that the position of bodhisattva Śāntideva is also highly compatible with the system our master Candrakīrti. {408}

Some say that the phrase “world-transcending” refers to the opponent’s position, interpreting it as going beyond the conventions of the world, and that the phrase “worldly truths” refers to one’s own standpoint. This reading, however, would contradict the statement in the Commentary where it reads, “since you would be abandoning this world-transcending truth . . .”[904] In fact, the meaning has to be understood in the exact opposite way. So the meaning of the phrases “world-transcending” and “worldly” must be understood in terms of having realized suchness exactly as it is or not.

If this is so, were the elders Vasubandhu, Dignāga, Dharmapāla, and so on — authors of treatises who appeared in the past — terrified of merely hearing the sound of the words prompting them to completely abandon this undistorted presentation of the truth of dependent origination? Yes indeed, I would say.[905]
With respect to this statement of Candrakīrti, it is true that in their undisputed treatises, Vasubandhu and Dignāga have interpreted the meaning of the scriptures in accordance with the consciousness-only standpoint. Nonetheless, it is extremely difficult for someone like us to determine what exactly these masters’ own personal views were. {409}

This truth of suchness most profound and terrifying, which has already been explained, will certainly be realized by those people who in other lifetimes in the past gained propensities of habituation to extraordinary admiration for emptiness. Here, in Naktso’s translation it reads, “Even from among those who view the inferior non-Buddhist treatises as true, some realize emptiness owing to the power of causation.” This rendering seems better than Patsab’s translation.
One might find among non-Buddhists, who fail to imprint propensities for extraordinary admiration of emptiness in their mind, that some temporarily relinquish the manifest levels of affliction as defined in the Abhidharma texts, afflictions associated with the three realms of existence except the peak of existence. They may also be able to engage with diverse philosophical tenets. Even so, they are incapable of generating extraordinary admiration for the teaching of emptiness — the ultimate truth of emptiness as taught by the Buddha. Thus these other masters, despite their vast learning from having studied many scriptures, will fail to comprehend this profound truth. Thus, since the traditions besides the Madhyamaka that present ultimate truth do not reach the Buddha’s enlightened intention, seeing those other traditions as constructed by the author’s own minds, as akin to the way in which you would relate to the treatises that elucidate or set forth propositions of self-existence of persons, forsake admiration for treatises and systems of other masters that are contrary to this one tradition of Madhyamaka. Do not be amazed by systems that are fabrications of their own minds; rather, feel only a sense of wonder at our own view of emptiness, and engender profound admiration for it.

May the vast merit of speaking about the excellent tradition of the master Nāgārjuna, extremely clearly on the basis of scriptures and reasoning — merit that extends to the edges of space itself — {410} may such merits shine bright as autumn stars amid the mind’s sky turned indigo or darkened by masses of afflictions. And through the force of the author’s mind having obtained merits resembling a shining gem on a serpent’s hood, may every sentient being in the entire world realize suchness exactly as it is and swiftly travel to the Sugata’s ground known as Constant Light. Naktso’s translation [in the first line of the stanza] reads, “Through merit obtained from commenting on the beautiful system of Nāgārjuna renowned in all directions . . .”

This text was translated in accordance with the Kashmir edition by the Indian abbot Tilaka Kalaśa and the Tibetan translator Venerable Patsab Nyima Drak at Ratnagupta Monastery located in the center of the Kashmiri town Ānuparna during the reign of King Śrī Āryadeva. Later, the Indian abbot Kanakavarma and the same Tibetan translator compared the translation with the eastern, Bengal edition and made comprehensive corrections with a final version established on the basis of teaching and study.

The supreme essence of all the scriptures of the buddhas
is the path of dependent origination, the profound middle way free of extremes.
It is the excellent Nāgārjuna who was prophesized
to reveal this truth that is free of the two extremes.
Though there exist numerous traditions of learned ones
interpreting his sublime way and the thought of Āryadeva,
it is the tradition of Buddhapālita, Candrakīrti,
and Śāntideva that expound this in its fullness.
Integrating into one the avenues of thought of these three
most accomplished masters, and by explaining well
the essential points with decisive analyses penetrating their words,
I have made this supreme Prāsaṅgika tradition stainless.
In this northern region, even those who admire this system
do not engage with the highly refined paths of reasoning.
And those who are unfortunate in regard to the profound truth
disparage it because of their failure to comprehend.
Seeing so many such people, I have endeavored to write this work
to help remove their stains, to elucidate the profound path
to those who are fortunate, and so that I too may never be separated
from this excellent path throughout all lives.
Through the virtue from striving in this task,
may all beings realize all the essential points of the profound truth.
And through their dedication to practice every day and every night,
may they always please the buddhas and their children.

This exposition of Entering the Middle Way titled Illuminating the Intent was composed by the yogi of the great Middle Way, Losang Drakpai Pal, a monk of wide learning. It was written at the strong urging of spiritual mentor Lhula Lekpa Pal, someone versed in the ten treatises, who offered a mandala of forty silver coins, and also in response to requests made by many spiritual mentors who deeply admire this teaching and possess no small capacity of intellect to comprehend its meaning. They emphatically urged me to write an exposition that is comprehensive in its explanation of the difficult points of Candrakīrti’s Commentary, in a manner that is lucid in its explanation of the meaning of the words yet detailed in its decisive analyses of the general points. It was composed at the great mountain retreat of victorious Geden.
