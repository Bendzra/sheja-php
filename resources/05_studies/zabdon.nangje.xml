Homage to the glorious Vajradhara.• 1
Homage to the glorious gurus: 2
all-knowing and all-seeing,
they teach about the external, internal, “other,” and suchness, and dispel the delusions present during the four states.
Homage to the single connate entity, to the twofold presence, 6
to the three kāyas of the channels, winds, and bindus, to the four kāyas of the four states, and to the presence of five kāyas.
Homage to the Goddess: 10
the single entity containing the nature of all phenomena.
She is the essence of the middle, the one bliss, whose nature arises at the end.
What is secret in the tantras, 14
the Victor revealed in the niruttara.
Bound within the six parameters, the inner principles are not objects of experience for non-Buddhist or Buddhist shrāvakas.
They are kept very secret from those of the Pāramitā[yāna].
I will explain the inner natures of body and mind.
The stainless heart of the victors 20
has impure, impure-pure,
and utterly pure [phases], which are taught to correspond to
sentient beings, those abiding on the path, and tathāgatas.
This is the principle we must comprehend.
First I will present the causes and conditions, 26
then the development of the womb-born body.
I will describe its channels,
the locations and movements of its winds,
how its bindus circulate,
and the principles of the connections with the consciousnesses and so forth.
I will explain the correlation of those [inner principles] to the environment,
what the generated deities are,
and the bases for the purification of phenomena.
I will teach the stages of the path,
and the way those [channels, winds, and bindus] disintegrate and dissolve.
All of these will be explained according to the teachings of the Victor.

The cause is beginningless mind-itself. 1.1
Although neither limited nor partial,
this [mind] displays freely: 1.3
it is empty in essence yet clear in nature,
and its manifestations appear unimpededly as anything at all.
This [mind] is itself ignorant of itself 1.6
and is stirred by the motions of formative mentation, just as water is by waves.
Referents and perceivers appear as two: 1.9
[mind] itself projects to itself and perceives that.
Because there are appearing aspects—mentation moving outward—
the consciousnesses that perceive objects as referents arise.
Feelings arise from embracing or rejecting [objects]. 1.13
Discriminations are the apprehension of those [objects’] characteristics.
Formative processes label the appearances of objects as other, and through fixating [upon them], the skandha of forms is established.
“The causes are the five dhātus and consciousness as the sixth” 1.17
is stated as a convention by conceptual [mind].
The ālaya, in which such latent tendencies 1.19
are stored, is called the causal condition.
The dominant conditions are the sense faculties— 1.21
the visual and the others—which appear as intermediaries.
The object conditions are what is cognized, 1.23
that is, what appear as objects: forms and so forth.
What are called “immediate conditions” 1.25
are immediate to whatever has [just] ceased, including the sixth mentation.
Thus it is that the phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvana appear 1.28
because of dependently originated causes and conditions.
Craving and grasping form a link, producing existence. 1.30
[The beings in] the formless, form, and desire realms 1.31
apprehend the characteristics of objects
to lesser, middling, or greater degrees, respectively.
All [realms are created] by thoughts of adopting or rejecting: 1.34
the conditions of the three types of formative forces—
virtuous, unvirtuous, or unspecified—
give rise to results of happiness, suffering, and absorption,
[all of which] involve mental afflictions.
That is the phase of impure mind-itself. 1.39
Those who know such stains to be adventitious 1.40
and purify them using the methods
are said by the Victor to be “those on the path.”
To be stainless and purified is to be buddha. 1.43
Thus all beings are buddhas.

I will explain the way the body develops. 2.1
When the ālaya, with the life-force wind, prepares to take birth in the three realms,
the consciousness, with its formative forces, 2.4
may take as its object
[one of] the four: Limitless Space and the others.
Birth there is called “formless,” [and yet] there is a mental body.
[A consciousness] relying on [one of] the four concentrations 2.8
takes birth in the form realm, where coarse sensuality is overcome and birth is spontaneous.
Space, wind, fire, water, and earth 2. 11
are divided into the lesser elements.
Birth in each of these twenty other places
is [caused by] having the outflows of those [elements]— from one dhātu up to five sequentially.
Ignorance and birth are also involved,
as explained in [the Treatise Summarizing the] “Foundations of Mindfulness.”
The six classes [of beings] in the desire realm 2.18
have six dhātus, [range in size] from small to large, and have four birthplaces.
[Among those] some are set apart: 2.20
those in the three negative states, which are places without leisure,
and the gods, demigods, and those in Kuru, who,
because they live off their results, are deficient in terms of causes.
Those with six dhātus born on the three continents 2.24
are the best; the ones wellborn in Jambudvīpa [live in a land] renowned for being a place of action.
The way birth occurs in this place is as follows. 2.27
At first birth is spontaneous, as it is in the form realm.
Then gradually, swayed by their cravings,
[people] become attached to a fragrant tasty substance.
Their consciousnesses, appearing as objects, engage in adopting or rejecting; the dhātus of their bodies become coarse; and there come to be males and females, lightness and darkness, happiness and suffering, and full-blown sensuality.
When [humans] take womb birth, 2.35
the entire collection of dhātus in their bodies develops from food and drink of the six tastes.
The four elements serve as conditions for development.
The six tastes derive from the five elements.
When space and bliss-wisdom unite, the support is produced.
The seed that has entered the lotus is held by the earth dhātu’s nature.
It is developed by water, and matured by fire.
Wind causes its growth; space creates the room.

As for what causes those to arise: 2.47
“When the bola and kakkola unite,
contact [causes] the latent tendencies for solidity to give rise to earth.
“Bodhichitta, being the nature of semen, gives rise to the dhātu of water.
Rubbing produces heat.
Movements are called wind.
“Bliss is the dhātu of space.
The five surround the consciousness.”[93]
The cause is the bardo consciousness. 2.57
“Afflictive mentation, with its latent tendencies and
wind-nature, sees the other forms
[but] does not cognize its referents with certainty.
It is simply wind, alone and confused.
“Formative forces lead the ālaya consciousness;
and its latent tendency for entering a womb becomes operative.
That latent tendency holds the consciousness.
“Then [the consciousness] fuses with the melted droplet of semen and blood.
[The experience of] the causal ālaya consciousness is like that of being intoxicated by alcohol ”[94]
“Afflictive mentation, the life-force wind, 2.69
develops instantly.”[95]
For four weeks, karmic winds 2.71
agitate and coalesce, [forming]
the kalala, arbuda, peshī, and ghana.
On the first day of prashākha, 2.74
the madhyamā containing the life-force wind forms, measuring twelve and a half of its own finger-widths.
From that, the heart and navel chakras, the supports for the ten winds, form.
This is like the fish manifestation.
Since the navel is connected to the mothers channel,
[her] winds and blood cause growth.
Then, from the second month on, two hundred channels form each day.
The downward-expelling [wind] radiates from the life-force 2.84
[wind],
creating the tortoise-like manifestation. 2.85
During the third month, the upward-moving wind generates the upper sections.
During the fourth, the pervading wind 2.88
causes the channels of the limbs to appear.
During the fifth, the [fire-] coinciding wind radiates, 2.90
transforming the internal areas.
This is the wild boar-lion state.
The powers of the fully formed [fire-] coinciding and pervading [winds]
cause the fetus to quiver and shake.
This is when the 360
bones and joints form.

<d e="2">
In that way, the five skandhas are complete; following that, 2.97
upon reaching the sixth month, 2.98
the power of the nāga wind develops, generating the eyes, the earth dhātu.
Next, during the seventh, the tortoise wind radiates, forming the auditory canals, the water dhātu.
In the eighth, the fire dhātu creates the nostril openings.
This occurs when the lizard wind radiates.
In the ninth, the devadatta wind arises, generating the tongue, which tastes.
During the tenth, the dhanaṃjaya wind is generated.
The energies of the ten winds are complete.
Thus, the dhātus and āyatanas are complete. 2.109
Since six thousand channels develop each month, fifty-four thousand [channels] form [while the fetus is] in the womb.
In the third postnatal month,
the seventy-two thousand are complete.
During the ninth [month], impurities are consumed, and dreg-dhātus are produced.
The feelings of the wind of hunger and thirst create experiences of intense suffering.
When the discharging wind 2.118
reverses [the fetus] and initiates birth, that is the man-lion state.
All that is produced by the channels, winds, and bindus, 2.121
the skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas, manifest from the very mind with stains.
[Birth] is taught to be the nirmāṇakāya with stains.

Next, I will explain the way the channels are. 3.1
I will discuss the madhyamā, rasanā, and lalanā,
the principal ones, chakras, illness-producing channels,
the seventy-two thousand, and also those that are even more subtle.
In the beginning, the basis for the body’s development 3.6
is the madhyamā with the life-force wind.
It goes through the middle of the six chakras,
which are spaced twelve and one-half of one’s own finger-widths apart.
It extends from the secret [place] to the crown of the head.
Its upper end is blocked by the quintessence of the white element, which is of the nature of HAṂ.
At the navel is the red element, blood
received from one’s mother, described as “the short A.”
Between those two lies the support for the ālaya: the life-force wind, like space.
Below the navel, this [channel] is called “shaṅkhinī” since it causes the white elements to descend.
It is described by the Saṃvarodaya: 3.19
“Going through the middle of the water-born one at the heart, it is empty, like plantain tree flowers.
A HAṂ is suspended and faces downward.
“Its lower end is adorned with what resembles fire.
Below, bodhichittas flow together.
It is called ‘avadhūti’
and confers the connate state.”[96]

In brief, it is the life-force channel of corporeal beings. 3.27
The right rasanā and left lalanā 3.28
diverge at the navel and connect at the kidneys.
Then they converge briefly at the heart.
They continue through the armpits to the throat.
Passing by “minor extremities,” they meet at the crown.
Their upper ends arrive at the nostrils.
Below, the three come together, then split.
It is taught that the rasanā on the right performs
the functions of expelling and retaining menstrual blood and feces.
The lalanā on the left expels and retains urine.
Above and at the navel, winds move;
through the navels sixty-four channels,
the external and internal winds are generated and renewed.
The Ādibuddha describes these [three] as follows: 3.42
“They have three ends below, and, similarly, three ends above.
Rāhu’s end is in the middle.
The suns end is on the right.
The moon’s end is on the left.
Water, fire, and space move within them.”[97]
Through their right, left, and middle lower ends, feces, urine, and semen pass.
These channels, which are like iron chain links,
are the three paths for the life-force and things expelled downward.
Twenty-four major channels split off from those [three]. 3.53
Adding the five channels that support
the secondary winds at the heart
and the three principal ones
makes thirty-two.
Including the channels supporting the root winds makes thirty-seven.
Those originating as parts of the left one are the following. 3.59
“Indivisible” resides at the bregma.
“Subtle form” connects to the crown.
“Charming” is in the right ear.
“Left” is the channel at the nape of the neck.
“Dwarf” is in the left ear.
“Turtle born” is in the middle of the eyebrows.
Outside the eyes are “meditation.”
“Empowering” are the channels in the shoulders.
“Defects” are the channels in the armpits.
“Engaging” are the channels in the breasts.
“Mother” is the channel at the navel.
“Shavarī” enters the tip of the nose.
“Cooling” is located at the mouth.
“Hot” resides in the middle of the throat.
They are based on the lalanā
and are of the nature of prajñā.

The ones based on the rasanā are part of method. 3.76
“Descending” resides at the sternum.
“Delight” connects to the bladder.
“Well formed” is located at the genitals.
“Common” connects to the lower door.
“Cause granting” are the major channels in the thighs.
“Yoga-free” are located in the calves.
“Beautiful” connect to the toes.
“Siddhā” are the channels in the insteps.
“Boiling” are the channels at the little hairs on the big toes.
“Excellent mind” reside above the vulnerable points of the kneecaps.
Those are said to be the sacred places in the body. 3.87
The four channels called “threefold,” “desire,” 3.88
“house-mistress,” and “chaṇḍikā”
are channels through which winds move.
They connect the center of the heart to the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue. “Mara-free” goes to the middle of the uvula.
“Here, in the center of the body’s heart, five channels are perfectly situated.”[98] The avadhūti is where the life-force [abides].
The others are where the root winds move.
Next, the chakras are classified 3.97
as four, six, eighteen, and more.
The nirmāṇachakra at the navel 3.99
has four channels that diverge from the madhyamā.
[They divide into] the sequence of the twelve saṃkrāntis, each of which splits into five.
Those sixty are the supports for the right and left [minor] saṃkrāntis. The four are the saṃkrāntis of the madhyamā.
Their names are stated in the Vajra Garland: 3.105
“‘Truly energetic,’ ‘very energetic,’
‘excellent,’ ‘proceeds well,’
‘great strength,’ ‘great inexhaustibility,’
‘great beauty,’ ‘great frontal birth,’
“‘provision-sign,’ ‘provision-part,’
‘provision-water,’ ‘provision-intoxication,’
‘provisions,’ ‘concordant causes of provisions,’
‘provision-moisture,’ ‘provision-holder,’
“‘rough,’ ‘saliva,’ ‘elephant,’

The names of the eight channels of the heart chakra are 3.136
“‘ratna crown,’ ‘great padma,’ 3.137
‘great vajra,’ ‘great strength,’
‘great protector,’ ‘great sound,’
‘great joy,’ and ‘great intoxication.’”[100]
This chakra pervades the entire body.
At the throat there are sixteen petals. 3.142.
“‘Enjoyment,’ ‘enjoyment,’ ‘bestower,’ ‘secret,’ 3.143
‘solar movement,’ ‘clarity,’ ‘fortune,’
‘meditation,’ ‘ashen face,’
‘bestowed-food consumer,’ ‘hunger,’
“‘rasāyana,’ taste honored,’
‘taste destroyer,’ ‘taste,’
and ‘crane’ reside in the saṃbhogachakra ”[101]
At the head, in the mahāsukhachakra are 3.150
“gradual type,’ passionate one,’ 3.151
passionate lady,’ ‘life-force body,’
‘short moon,’ ‘moon bestower,’ ‘gorgeous,’
‘passionate,’ ‘silent,’ ‘kusha,’
“‘death rejecting,’ ‘pure,’
‘fire,’ ‘fiery taste,’ ‘parrot,’
‘full,’ ‘sun [possessor],’ ‘tasty,’
‘long chin,’ ‘beer bestower,’ ‘amṛita,’
‘“conch holder,’ ‘conch ear,’
‘conch eye,’ ‘conch nose,’
‘provisions,’ ‘powerful provisions,’ ‘desirous,’
‘victorious-over-provisions,’ ‘marvelous provisions,’
‘smooth,’ and ‘joint supporting.’
Those are taught to be the thirty-two [petals].”[102]
Thus it is that 120 3.165
are described as the “principal ones.”
The uṣhṇīṣha is wind, its throat is fire. 3.167
The channels residing there are nine.
“Between the eyebrows is the wind chakra with 3.169
‘ten million,’ ‘swirling,’ ‘inexhaustible,’
‘good name,’ ‘support,’ and ‘qualified.’
‘Holder,’ ‘nonconceptual,’ and ‘full’
are the three channels endowed with fire.”[103]
The Kālachakra’s teaching is that 3.174
seven are at the secret place.
As in the head, the secret chakra has thirty-two petals.
In the center of those [six chakras] 3.178
reside the channels of the six emptinesses.
They are “the doors of speech.”
In the three joints of the right arm, 3.181
there are thirty channels each, generated by the wind dhātu.
Each finger joint 3.184
has six channels;
their [total] number is the same as the above.
Similarly, the left arm has [chakras] from the fire dhātu. 3.187
The right leg has [chakras] from the water dhātu, and the left has [chakras] from the earth dhātu.
These twelve chakras have 360 channels.
The number of channels in the finger and toe joints equals those. 3.192

The following channels produce illnesses. 3.193
The uṣhṇīṣha’s four channels
and the forehead’s sixteen create phlegm [disorders].
The throat’s thirty-two channels
and the hearts eight produce bile [disorders].
The navels sixty-four and the secrets outer sixteen disturb the wind dhātus.
The secrets inner layer of sixteen produces the complex [illnesses].
Those are 156.
They are outside the chakras. 3.203
Others say they are the chakras themselves.
The classification of seventy-two thousand [channels] 3.205
is found in the Vajra Garland.
Twenty-four thousand are 3.207
the lalanā type [where] the moon descends.
Twenty-four thousand are
the rasanā type [where] the sun descends.
Twenty-four thousand are
the madhyamā type [where] the winds move.
Since those [seventy-two thousand] are located in the body, 3.213
they are also [classified as follows].
The twenty-four channels—
from “indivisible” through “excellent mind”—
“are characterized as the absorbed, enjoyment, and dominant [types].
[Multiplied] by those three [functions], there are seventy-two; and each of those has one thousand surrounding [channels].”[104]
They resemble branches, leaves, and petals emerging from one trunk.
There are even more subtle channels, 3.221
[numbering] thirty-five million, which generate the body hairs.
The order of these [channels’] dhātus is as follows. 3.2.24
The navel is earth, the heart is wind.
The throat is fire, the head is water.
The uṣhṇīṣha is space,
the secret is the wisdom-bliss type.
Those that reach the body hairs are produced by the six dhātus.
The classifications of right, left, and center yield three types: body, speech, and mind.
Once we know the characteristics of the channels, 3.233
we understand the abiding state of the body.

Next, I will explain 4.1
the natures of the winds, their locations and functions, how they move, the order of their forces and lack of force, their entry [points], the methods for retaining them, their problems and virtues.
Winds give rise to speech, lagnas, 4.6
and all letters.
The life-force wind is first, supported by consciousness. 4.8
It has the form of A
and is of the nature of the space dhātu.
The downward-expelling is the earth dhātu and the syllable ḶI.
The upward-moving is the fire dhātu and ṚI.
The fire-coinciding is the wind dhātu and I.
The pervading is water and U.
Next, there are the five secondary winds. 4.15
Nāga is produced by earth, is A and space.
Tortoise is wind and E.
Lizard is fire and ĀR.
Devadatta is the water dhātu and O.
Dhanaṃjaya is ĀL and the earth dhātu.
First, [the winds] develop sequentially every month. 4.2.1
Now, they are responsible for all actions.
Their dissolution is said to occur every ten years.
The Vajra Wisdom teaches that 4.24
mind-itself, luminosity, is the wisdom wind;
the ālaya, accompanied by afflictive mentation, is space;
formative forces are wind; feelings are fire;
discriminations are water; and forms are earth.
That explains the progression of what are produced and their producers.
Now, [the winds] reside in the body and perform their 4.30
functions.
Broadly speaking, the life-force wind pervades the entire body, 4.31
but it is [based] in the madhyamā, the root.
Residing in the middle, it supports the ālaya.
"Called ‘the protector of space,’ it moves at the time of death.”[105]
Now, it fosters the sense of self and recollections.
If it deviates, unconsciousness, insanity, or death result.
It abides as a mixture of karma and wisdom.
Its color is described as space-like.
Downward-expelling descends from the juncture of the three 4.40
below.
It retains and expels the quintessences and dregs.
Residing in the shaṅkhinī, it is the dhātu of bliss.
If it deviates, it causes illnesses in the lower [parts].

Fire-coinciding rises within the front channel 4.44
and enters the stomach, where it separates the quintessences from the dregs.
It distributes [the quintessences] throughout the body.
If it deviates, the unpleasantness of bloating, flatulence, or diarrhea results.
Upward-moving rises within the channel in Agni’s direction. 4.48
It performs all functions related with the throat and [animates] the body and speech during songs, dance, and the like.
If it deviates, it will probably cause illnesses in the upper [parts].
Pervading connects with the rasanā on the right 4.52
and is found in all the body’s joints.
It provides physical strength; if it deviates, it causes illnesses that cripple or paralyze the limbs.
The five secondary winds, such as nāga, 4.56
[reside] in Nairṛitya’s direction, to the rear, in Vāyu’s, on the left, and in Ishāna’s, in that order.
Nāga facilitates visual perceptions and physical grace.
Tortoise creates auditory perceptions and movements in the arms and legs.
Lizard causes olfactory perceptions, aggression, and agitation. Devadatta produces gustatory perceptions and yawns.
Dhanaṃjaya creates the perceptions of tangible objects; after death, it remains in the body until it decomposes.
Now, [these ten winds] are the natures of the eight periods. 4.65
They are taught to be the main ones.
Movements occur in two ways: externally and internally. 4.67
The life-force wind, whose nature is Rāhu, 4.68
resides in the madhyamā, like a king.
Just as it is in the heart, so it is in the other chakras.
There are thirty-two [petals] at the head chakra. 4.72
Since winds resembling the lunar padas flow there,
[the petals] are [also] said to be sixteen.
Two [channels] are of the nature of emptiness. 4.75
The [wind] movements in the fourteen others
follow the pattern of
three with five, one with four,
and ones with three, two, and one.
In the last seven channels that order is reversed.
These follow the sequence of the guṇas.
The twenty-eight daṇḍas and the four empty ones 4.81
are roughly the thirty-two [movements occurring] in one day.
They are said to be of the nature of the muhūrtas.

The throat has sixteen channels. 4.84
When divided into method and prajñā, there are thirty-two.
Among those, emptiness moves within four. 4.86
In the others—the seven sets in the four main directions—
[winds] move according to the passages of the lunar mansions.
Others explain [the wind movements as being] the sixteen 4.89
saṃkrāntis.
The navel has sixty-four channels. 4.90
Divided by their classification as the houses, there are twelve sets of five, making sixty.
They are of the natures of the sixty daṇḍas. 4.93
Four are where emptiness moves into the madhyamā.
Overall, all front [channels] are wind, 4.95
right ones are fire, left ones are water, and rear ones are earth.
This generalization also applies to the ones in the intermediate directions.
Similarly, in the chakras of the twelve major joints 4.98
there are thirty movements.
Collectively, there are 360 life-force [winds].
[The movements in] the minor limbs are the same.
Next, it is taught that in twenty-four thousand [channels] 4.102
proceed [winds of] the nature of the madhyamā.
Those classified as white or red equal that [number].
In the seventy-two thousand, there are 21,600 winds
that are the corresponding internal movements.
When winds cease in one channel, such as Aries, 4.108
they do so in all areas.
These [wind movements] can be classified endlessly; 4.110
nevertheless,
[simply put] they are similar to what is [described] in astrology for the external.
Next, I will explain the external movements. 4.112
[Winds] move through the doors of the body hairs and faculties. Specifically, however, their entrances are the nostrils, which connect to two major channels.
The poisonous winds of the sun are on the right; 4.116
the amṛita ones of the moon are on the left.
They are of the natures of method and prajñā.
Each day those winds [number] 10,462½.
They are called the solar and lunar winds.

Six hundred seventy-five winds 4.122
move through the center of the two [nostrils].
They are Rāhu, space, wisdom winds, and nondual mind.
Classified in terms of their essence,
they are of the natures of the five: earth and so forth.
At birth, the winds connecting us to our mother are terminated. 4.128
It is taught that next, [wind] moves through our nostrils in the house of Cancer.
Now I will explain the lagnas. 4.131
The root and secondary winds
pass sequentially through the body’s chakras.
At the navel, they generate the life-force’s energy.
They emerge on the right or left,
alternating between the twelve even and odd houses.
The sun takes the southern passage first. 4.137
The winds emerging through the right nostril
follow the sequence of earth, water, fire, wind, and space, with 360 of each.
Altogether there are 1,800.
Then, through the left, the lunar winds 4.142.
follow the sequence of space, wind, fire, water, and earth.
Their numbers are the same as above.
Thus, in twelve saṃkrāntis 4.145
there are 21,600 [winds].
In those [21,600], there are wisdom winds, 4.147
which are taught to be 675.
In a saṃkrānti, there are fifty-six and one-quarter, 4.149
and in a daṇḍa, eleven and one-quarter.
In brief, those are the results of
grouping the thirty-second part of each breath.

Half of those [wisdom winds] move externally, 4.153
and half cause increase by moving in the madhyamā.
They [create] the padas of the planets.
When their external movements increase, there are death omens.
If they are held internally, immortality is achieved.
Added together, the [wisdom-wind] movements during one 4.158
hundred years
equal three years and one and a half months.
By understanding the topics of increases and obscurations, and the intercalation of days and so forth, there will be no errors.
[Next, I will explain] the sequence of movements, the colors, 4.162
forces, and qualities.
First, the nasal septum 4.163
is the north and water for both.
Both outsides are said to be fire.
Both tops are wind, both bottoms are earth.
The centers are space and wisdom.
The colors of earth, water, fire, wind, and space 4.168
are said to be yellow, white, red, black, and blue.
As for their forces: Those on the right 4.170
are Saturn, Jupiter, Maṅgala, the sun, and Agni; they follow the sequence of earth and so forth.
Those on the left are Rāhu, the moon, Mercury,
Venus, and Ketu; they follow the sequence [that starts with] space.
Because those [winds function] like the skandhas, dhātus, 4.175
and so forth,
space succeeds in the activities of killing and reviving;
wind expels and kills;
fire controls and summons;
water pacifies and increases;
earth’s activities are to paralyze and stupefy;
and wisdoms activities are all of those
when it flows equally during an interval.
Externally, earth [travels] twelve finger-widths; 4.183
[followed by] water, fire, wind, and space, [which reaches] sixteen.
Their qualities determine their distances.
I explain the astrological connections with dependent 4.186
origination
and the vowels in the Compendium of Astrological Texts.
Regarding this [topic of movement], the Vajra Garland says: 4.188
“Emerging from the nostrils, 4.189
the five winds ascend.
They have four modes:
moving through the left, the right, both, and slowly.
“The dhātus emerging from the right 4.193
are fire maṇḍalas.
These red excellences
are the movements of the Padma Protector.
“The dhātus emerging from the left are mixed with wind maṇḍalas.
Appearing as yellowish green,
they are the movements of the Karma Protector.
“The dhātus coming through both
are a golden color, maṇḍalas of Maheshvara.
They are the movements of the Ratna Protector.
“The slow and unmoving dhātus look like pure crystals.
They are water maṇḍalas,
the movements of the Vajra Protector.

“What arises from the dhātus 4.208
and is joined with the support and supported is of the nature of Vairochana.
It will depart in the end, at death.
“Repeat those four maṇḍalas 4.212
continuously while resting in equipoise.”[106]
The purpose of those statements is to prevent 4.214
any doubts that the teachings on the purities of the repetitions are in conflict with earlier [explanations].
“Meditate on the winds 4.217
as five colors at the tips.
Perform the repetitions throughout the day and night by counting mantra repetitions.”[107] Thus it is taught.
There are four entrances: 4.221
the nostrils and mouth above, the three paths below, and everywhere on the body.
The retention methods are as follows. 4.224
Exhalations, inhalations, and the rests are reversed, purified, and counted.
It is taught that shamatha is engendered by binding with nonconceptuality in unfettered ways.
Training with colors and shapes
causes the supercognitive abilities and totalities to manifest.
Vase breathing—threefold with upper, lower, and between— combined with “the liberation” performs all activities.
There are eight benefits. 4.232
The sun, moon, and Rāhu—the three principal ones— destroy thoughts involving the three poisons and bring the attainment of the three vajras.
Those are said to be the excellent qualities of the sun.
The lunar wind controls the five objects: forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangible objects.
Thus, percepts and perceivers are purified.
Firmness, shininess, clarity, swiftness, 4.240
purity, and the possession of great wisdom
are explained as the body’s excellent qualities [derived from] earth and the others.

In brief, winds are thoughts: 4.243
they move, are subtle, and cause movements elsewhere.
Mind-itself is clear yet nonconceptual. 4.245
Its essence is the great wisdom wind.
Remedies are said to be the great wisdom winds, the formative forces that are correct imagination.
Afflictive mentation, abiding within the ālaya, is said to be the wind that creates bewilderment.
Formative forces are an appearing quality of wisdom—
yet they are conceived of as “other” and are called “winds of desire.”
Consciousnesses are winds that determine what to adopt or reject;
they are winds that generate aggression.
It is said that the three realms are formed by winds. 4.255
Those who know how it is
that all faults and virtues depend on the winds
are “those who know the wind yogas and go beyond.
The winds keep us circling in saṃsāra.
They also are successful in severing it.”[108]
The names and functions of the external and internal winds 4.261
were taught by the Victor in the sūtras and tantras.
Here I have presented them in a condensed manner.

Next, [I will explain] the locations and movements of the bindus, 5.1
which are supported by the channels and winds.
There are three: the root bindu free from elaborations, the bindus of deluded ignorance, and the remedial bindus.
First, the connate state of our own mind is 5.6
in its essence emptiness, free from elaborations,
in its nature, the luminous saṃbhogakāya,
and in its unimpeded compassion, present as anything.
Signs of those three are found even now: everything appears as empty; the ten signs of space-awareness arise; the potentials of appearing objects manifest.
Those three are the infallible objective signs.
On the subjective side, the cognition linked to those [objects]
is nonconceptual and nonmistaken,
the root bindu free from elaborations,
which is taught extensively in the sūtras and tantras.
The bindus of deluded ignorance include 5.19
the imagined mantra bindus, which transform the imagined four names that follow from ignorance, formative forces, and consciousnesses.
Dependent mentation’s potential is called the “wind bindu.”
The skandha of forms, what appear as objects, is the “material bindus of the five dhātus.”
These were taught by the Victor in the yoga tantras.
Among those, the material bindus 5.28
are twofold: external and internal.
As for the inner principles: first, when about to take rebirth, the nature of a bardo [beings] consciousness is to have fixations on the basis of conditions related to his or her parents.
The dhātus develop as taught above.
Now, while we are alive, we have both quintessences and dregs. 5.34
The quintessences of wind and mind were presented previously.
The bindu quintessences are twofold: white and red.
The white element is at the upper end of the madhyamā. 5.37
It is the nature of HAṂ, the size of a mustard seed, white and shiny, like a crystal.
Received from ones father, it is the best of all.
The red element is at the junction of the three channels. 5.41
Red and clear, like the mare-fires, it is a short A, of the nature of Vārāhī.
They are called “spring” and “bindu.” 5.44
Both support the ālaya and the life-force wind.
The Saṃvarodaya and Vajraḍāka refer to them as the “essence of the heart of awakening.”
The supported dregs are also of two types: quintessences and dregs. 5.48
Generated by fire, the red elements ascend.
The white ones descend from the head.

First, [quintessences] are produced by the burnt-offering ingredients. 5.51
All external edible things are burnt substances
that the hands, as shruva and pātrī,
present through the mouth to the deities of the skandhas.
The three[-faced] god, functioning as the stomach, is the three: fire-coinciding wind, decomposition-causing phlegm, and digestive bile.
Those burn, digest, and purify.
Those quintessences 5.58
flow through major channels to the liver,
become the great blood, and continue to all the channels.
Blood produces flesh, from which comes fat, bones, bone marrow, and semen.
These are known as the “seven quintessential physical constituents.”
The dregs in the stomach [divide into] solids and liquids. 5.64
The solids pass through the intestines and move on.
The liquids go through the intestinal links to the bladder and are excreted.
The bloods dregs produce bile in the liver.
The [biles] dregs descend and produce the sediment in urine and the odor and yellow of feces.
The dregs of the flesh are skin and its smells.
The dregs of fat are the lymph nodes.
The bones’ dregs are the teeth and nails.
The marrows dregs are the saliva and nasal mucus found in the cavities.
The dregs of semen are excreted below; 5.76
its quintessences create strength and color.
That is simply a general explanation. 5.78
The detailed explanation is that there are thirty-six dhātus. 5.79
The four connected to the visual consciousness and the others are called “the four offerings.”
The dhātu originating in “māra-free” ascends and goes to the center of the uvula.
It is said to resemble the dark phase.
It also perceives tangible objects.
The ones connected to the five root winds were explained before; here also the madhyamā has parts: above with three winds and below as support for feces, urine, and semen.
Specifically, its lower end, the shaṅkhinī, fills with the bindus of the fifteen digits.
It is the channel that gives birth to bliss.
The rasanā retains the blood dhātus.
That is a difference between men and women.
[The shaṅkhinī] generates the supreme faculties.

Regarding this, the Sampuṭa says: 5.96
“Present in the channel petals of the four main directions,
the major elements are candle-flame entities.
In the channels of the intermediate directions,
where the five amṛitas flow,
‘the four offerings’ are supported.
“Here, in the center of the body’s heart, five channels are perfectly situated.
“The specific instances of body, speech, and mind 5.103
are said to be twenty-four.
Based on the specifics of being abodes and so forth, they are called abodes and places.”[109]
Next, the twenty-four dhātus
appearing within those [abodes]
are combined with the previously explained channels.
“It is said that ‘indivisible’ is Pullīramalaya; 5.110
it discharges teeth and nails.
‘Subtle’ is Jālandhara;
it gives out hair on the head and body.
“‘Charming’ is Oḍḍiyāna;
it is based in the right ear and releases skin.
‘Left’ is Arbuda;
it discharges flesh on the back and elsewhere.”[110]
They are the abodes since white elements always abide there.
“‘Dwarf’ is Godāvarī; 5.119
it releases the dhātus that produce the tendons.
‘Turtle born’ is Rāmeshvara; it discharges the garlands of bones.
“‘Meditation’ are Devīkoṭa; they generate the flesh of the liver.
‘Empowering’ are Mālava;
they produce the flesh of the heart.”[111]
Those are always referred to as the nearby abodes.
“‘Defects' are Kāmarūpa; 5.128
they give out the flesh of the eyeballs.
‘Engaging’ are Oḍra;
they pass along the sides of the breasts and produce bile.
“‘Mother is Trishakuni; it generates the lungs.
‘Shavarī’ is Koshala; it discharges the intestines.”[112]
Those are called the enjoyment-fields and nearby fields.
“‘Cooling’ are Kaliṅga; 5.137
They connect to the hips and produce the abdomen.
‘Hot’ is Lampāka;
it generates the bowels and colon.
“‘Descending’ is Kāñchi;
it acts as the dominant condition for excreting feces.
‘Delight’ is Himālaya;
it discharges spinal fluid, filling the middle between the points.”[113]
Since those are where quintessences and dregs intermingle, they are the chandohas and nearby chandohas.
“‘Well formed’ is Pretapurī; 5.147
it continuously discharges pus.
‘Shared’ is Gṛihadevatā; it releases phlegm.
“‘Cause granting’ are Saurāṣhṭra; they create the blood’s energy.
‘Yoga-free’ are Suvarṇadvīpa; they always discharge sweat.”[114]
Those are the gathering places and nearby gathering places for the quintessences and dregs.

“‘Beautiful’ are Nagara; 5.156
they discharge fat.
‘Siddhā’ are Sindhu; they create tears.
“‘Boiling’ are Maru;
they produce and discharge sputum and saliva.
‘Excellent mind’ are Kulutā;
they always discharge nasal mucus.”[115]
Lacking bliss, those are the charnel grounds and the nearby ones.
As for the twenty-four dhātus: 5.165
the absorbed ones have become dregs;
the enjoyment ones are quintessences, white-element ones;
the dominant ones are roots, a mixture of winds and blood.
There are three thousand of each. 5.169
As embodiments of the winds, the white, and the red, they extend as far as the body hairs.
Specifically, the lunar quintessences 5.172
descend from the head—from its sixteen channels of the four dhātus—to the throat.
They are sixteen; then halved, and halved [again].
These bindus fall as one into the fire.
After the shaṅkhinī, they are released.
The intense joy of embodied beings arouses desire, 5.178
which creates confusion, then aggression.
[Release] is the basis that creates saṃsāra.
When those who possess the methods taught by the Victor 5.181
use the fires of the three mudrās
to bind the mercury-like with no outflows,
[their bindus] are purified in the four victory-banner channels. 5.184
Cessation brings union with the actuality of seeing the truth.
The sixteen recollections 5.186
bring stability and ascension.
The twelve bhūmis are attained sequentially.
The sixteen joys reach the end; 5.189
the twelve links of dependent origination are purified.
The body is a flower blooming with the major and 5.191
minor marks.
Within his vision of suchness, the Bhagavat said,
“Instantly, there is true awakening.”[116]
The dregs mainly create illnesses. 5.194
Phlegm [illnesses are related to] the white elements 5.195
and the brain; they reside above,
but, being of the natures of earth and water, they appear below.
[Wind illnesses are] at the navel and secret place; being of the nature of wind, they abide below but rise up.
Bile and blood [illnesses] are based at the liver and reside in between.
When associated with wind, they blaze up, like fire; when associated with phlegm, they move below, like water.
Phlegm is linked to bewilderment,
bile comes with aggression,
and, with desire, wind aids them all.
Water, fire, and wind are illnesses. 5.206

Those three [flaws] create illnesses in the body. 5.207
In the mind, they cause flaws in meditative concentration: bliss, examination and analysis, and moving thoughts.
They are the reasons that worlds disintegrate.
Space and earth serve as supports 5.211
for those two [body and mind] and are without flaws.
The wise, knowing the vital points of these two, conquer the flaws of the three.
Since the material, mantra, and wind bindus 5.215
are linked to ignorance,
they are said to produce saṃsāra.
It is taught that, when they are embraced by methods, they become remedies.
As for the reasons to practice meditation, 5.219
“the bhagavat Vajrasattva [said],
“‘For the sake of freeing those 5.221
whose long-standing great passion impels them to be born in the three states of cyclic existence,
I taught the material bindus.
“‘For the sake of quickly freeing people whose great aggression forces them to have evil bodies,
I taught the mantra bindus.
“‘To protect those deluded by great bewilderment from cyclic existence and enable them to attain the eight resultant siddhis and resultant wisdom,
I taught the wind bindus.’”[117]
The channels, winds, and bindus 5.233
are dependent appearances.
Being supports, they are called “vajra body.”

Next, I will explain briefly and in a general way 6.1
the connections with the consciousnesses and so forth.
The way [the body] develops in the beginning was explained above. 6.3
The period of abiding is composed of four states.
These four—sleep, dream, sexual union,
and the ordinary period—
are the states of the four unpurified kāyas.
Although the classifications can be explained in many ways, 6.8
[I will describe them as follows].
During sleep the ālaya is primary.
It abides in the dharmachakra at the heart.
The six modes of consciousness are not lucid and have dissolved.
When purified, [deep sleep] is the fruition of luminosity.
Also called “mirror-like,”
this is the dharmakāya, the nature free from elaborations.

[The ālaya] is the support for latent tendencies; yet it is unclear 6.15
and contains the conditions for the movements of formative forces. Therefore, it is said to be “stained by ignorance.”
The graduated remedial cognitions 6.18
of the lack of self-entities of persons and phenomena— whether they be of one, one and a half, or two— are what purify.
It is taught that at the end of each yāna’s continuum,
the vajra-like destroys stains and achieves [one of] three purities.
Therefore, meditate on the clear yet nonconceptual 6.24
luminosities of the day and night.
Savor mahāmudrā: emptiness
endowed with the most sublime of manifestations.
The second is the dreaming mind. 6.28
From the life-force wind—afflictive mentation
and latent tendencies—it surfaces with the formative forces.
Moving through the channels, it creates the delusion of the dualistic appearances of percepts and perceivers.
When purified, it is the saṃbhogakāya: clear, discrete, and empty.
It has impure, delusive appearances. 6.35
[When our mentation] goes above, in our head, 6.36
[we experience] images of the gods’ lands, moving through the sky, or ascending.
Forms, sounds, and so forth manifest distinctly.
[When our mentation] moves below, the hells and so forth appear, as do images of descending, rocky ravines, dense places, darkness, and the like.
[When it moves] in middle areas, [we dream of] the four continents and the terrestrial realms.
[When it moves] to the front, right, rear, or left, images of the east, south, west, or north arise.
[When it moves] through wide channels, wide-open [spaces] appear. [When it moves] through narrow ones, [we experience] images of narrow [places].
In the same way, the circumstances 6.46
of the dhātus in those locations [give rise to the following kinds of dreams].

During wind[-related dreams, we experience] 6.48
various blue and black substances and clothes,
black birds, flying, riding horses,
blue jewels, clear awareness, or instability.
[When our mind] goes to the locations of bile and blood,
[we experience] fire, red clothing, earth,
golden appearances, monastics, and similar appearances.
When [our mind] contacts the phlegm and white-element locations, [we experience] water, snow, pearls, white clothing, girls, elephants, silver, and other such appearances;
similarly, in the Mañjushrī Root Tantra, the Victor explained 6.59
how [dream] appearances are based on
latent tendencies and the channels, winds, and dhātus.
Therefore, when yogins and yoginīs meditate, 6.62
they know, on the basis of what [arises] in their [dreams], whether the latent tendencies of their channels and dhātus have been purified or not,
and are able to test [themselves on how they will fare] with the bardo and the appearances of transferring to the next [world].
For those reasons, bind [dreams] using jñānamudrās. 6.67
Here I will not present the details of such topics with their many causes and results.
Deluded dreams are saṃsāra.
Undeluded dreams are remedies. 6.71
The Sūtra Presenting Dreams describes those of bodhisattvas on the ten bhūmis.
Their causes are taking on undefiled dhātus.
The bhagavats do not have dreams 6.75
because they are undefiled and freed from the conditions of formative forces.

For those of us with desire, during sexual union 6.77
our consciousness follows the sequence of the four joys.
With passion, first it is at the head; second, at the throat; and third, our consciousness gathers at the navel.
This causes fire and moon to mix, at which point the connate is experienced within the shaṅkhinī.
That is an instantaneous cognition:
its eight modes of consciousness are unimpeded and lucid; it is blissful, nonconceptual, and not afflicted.
It is called the “wisdom kāya.”
When purified, everything is just that.
Thus: unimpeded, without outflows, and empty.
Penetrate the vital points of what is present in all and the identity of all.
As impure sentient beings, who are mistaken, 6.91
we do not recognize instantaneous great bliss.
We take what abides within ourselves to be other.
Our bliss fades, and our three poisons are aroused.
Against our wishes, we roam around saṃsāra.
First, feeling joy is desire.
In between, our lack of understanding is bewilderment.
Afterward, our lack of desire is aggression.
Desiring bliss and being attached to our own, we feel miserly and jealous; having roused them all, we behave badly.
That creates all negative states.
Once we turn away from that, even slightly, 6.102
and wish to benefit ourselves and others,
we will cast aside miserliness, jealousy, and attachment.
We will be generous and eschew aggression.
Ethically, we wish for happiness, [thereby ensuring] higher states.
Cutting off our desires, in the concentrations we find happiness, and take up the form or formless.
Nevertheless, like before, our experience involves attachment, and our three poisons keep us circling.
When those are known to be mind, seeing and meditating 6.111
will destroy the three realms’ attachment and the rest.
Longing for nirvana, it is achieved.
Those who abide there are called shrāvakas or pratyekabuddhas.
Longing for both existence and peace 6.115
is to be abandoned.
[The ways] to achieve the mastery of no outflows 6.116
are taught in the Vajrayāna.
The natures of the four joys, their order, 6.118
their divisions, the problems with outflows,
the methods for binding, the benefits, their purification,
causes and results, and forward and reverse sequences
are all presented by the Victor in the niruttara tantras.
Here I will not write extensively about binding with karmamudrās.

As for cognition during the ordinary period: 6.125
The ālaya is conditioned by afflictive mentation, as described above.
Through the interplay of the four conditions, the six consciousnesses (such as the visual one) connect with the six faculties, and the six objects (such as forms) appear.
The three feelings—happiness, suffering, and indifference— produce desire, aggression, and bewilderment.
Those are carried by the immediate mentation and deposited in the ālaya to formulate again.
When purified, it is three wisdoms: 6.135
mentation is the one of unwavering equality, purified imagination is the discriminating one, and the five door[-consciousnesses] and their objects are the one that accomplishes activities.
Obscurations are the factors abandoned through seeing and 6.139
meditation.
Their remedies are four:
conviction, the absences of self-entity, samādhis, and compassion.
Once those purify, the results are
the nirmāṇakāya, which acts for the welfare of beings,
and the saṃbhogakāya, since mentation is the same as in dreams.
Because this is taught extensively in the dharma, here I have provided a summary.
Bind using dharmamudrās. 6.147
The four states, delusions, 6.148
undeluded wisdoms, the stages of the path,
the four mudrās, and the four kāyas
are interconnected supports and supported.

Next, as it is with the internal body, 7.1
so it is externally.
The three realms are identified with the internal.
From the crown of our head down 7.4
are four finger-widths of the formless area.
Below that are sixteen finger-widths of the form realm.
Below that are the desirous gods and humans.
It is taught that from the navel to the soles of the feet 7.8
are the places of the demigods, nāgas, hungry ghosts, and eight hells, in that order.
The three joints in the legs and arms are, sequentially, 7.11
maṇḍalas of wind, fire, and water.
The chest is earth.
The spine is Mount Meru. 7.13
As for the seven mountains:
the bones in the thighs, shins, and below,
in the shoulders, forearms, hands,
and the nails are, respectively,
the Blue, Mandara, Night,
Jewel-Creator, Vessel,
Snowy, and Vajra mountains.
When the six continents are internal, 7.21
phlegm, intestines, fat, heart, liver, and flesh are the continents of Moon,
White, Kusha, Kiṃnara,
Crane, and Wrathful, in that order.
The twelve parts of the legs and arms
are Jambudvīpa and the others with their subcontinents.
Hardness, moisture, warmth, and breath 7.28
are the four dhātus; the orifices are space.
Semen, fat, brain, 7.30
phlegm or milk, saliva, sweat,
and urine are the seven internal oceans,
with their natures of honey, butter,
yogurt, milk, water, beer, and salt.
The faculties are of the natures of the nine planets; 7.35
the teeth are the lunar mansions; the channels are rivers; the intestines are clouds; winds are internal;
the sounds of the heart are thunderbolts; stomach rumblings are thunder.
The heart, throat, and navel 7.40
are lightning, the suns heat, and burning fire.
Skin, warmth, and body hairs 7.42
are of the natures of fire and wind.
Microorganisms born within the body have four modes of birth.
Rain is the uvulas amṛita.
All the lagnas—and everything from the periods to an instant—
are the channels, winds, bindus, and mind, as taught before.
When the life-force wind unites with the white and red, lunar and solar eclipses appear.
The various explanations, such as those, 7.51
are said to be limitless
because the external, internal, and “other” correspond to wisdom.
When we understand such interdependent relationships, 7.54
we will know the correspondences between method and prajñā and develop various excellent qualities.
Here I have provided a brief summary.

Next, despite being sentient beings’ concepts, 8.1
meditations on imagined deities are valuable because they are mental concentration, bring an understanding of external and internal referents, and, with mastery, enable the display of forms for the benefit of others.
The principles of the teachings on a single hero to infinite ones are as follows.
The madhyamā, ālaya, authentic reality, 8.7
wisdom wind, and bindu are the single hero heruka.
The two kāyas, method and prajñā,
above and below, white and red, the two truths, and the like are pairs of male and female consorts.
Since there are [triads of] bindus and channels; body, speech, and mind;
above, below, and between; three syllables; three winds, and so forth; there are three deities.
There are what come [in fours], such as the four dhātus, the pervaded four.
The five wisdoms, five skandhas,
chakras, winds, and [dhātus that] include the pervader
are presented as five deities, as taught in many places.
[The dhātus that include] space and wisdom, and six consciousnesses are six deities; with afflictive mentation, there are seven.
Because of the eight modes [of consciousness], there are eight.
The heart channels, winds, ten bhūmis, strengths, and the like are either nine or ten.
The skandhas and dhātus are ten, as are the faculties and 8.25
their objects.
There are six with six, and six faculties of action.
Thus, maṇḍalas of deities have
five, nine, thirteen,
twenty-five, thirty-two, thirty-four,
thirty-seven, up to one hundred families and more.

The channels, winds, and bindus [correspond to] the number of chakras. 8.31
In keeping with the numbers of concepts, there are matching faces and emblems.
As for the maṇḍala in the body: 8.34
like external ones, it is composed of the earth, lines, and shapes.
I have explained this in the Illumination of Maṇḍalas.
It is said that mutually related method and prajñā, 8.38
right and left, body and mind,
white and red, support and supported—
everything—are of the natures of method and prajñā.
Those primarily teaching prajñā are prajñā tantras. 8.42
Those primarily teaching method are father tantras.
All are of the nature of nonduality.
The eyes are method; visual forms are prajñā. 8.45
Visual forms are method; the eyes are prajñā.
Rasanā is method; its winds are prajñā.
Lalanā is prajñā; its winds are method.
Men are method; their minds are prajñā.
Women are prajñā; their minds are method.
The middle is prajñā; the directions are method.
The ultimate is method; the conventional is prajñā.
The opposites are also the case.
Be aware of those and other limitless [pairings].
The sequences of colors and qualities are as discussed in the “Wind” [chapter].
Shapes are body; winds and verbal expressions are mantras. 8.57
Mind is referred to as the bindu-perfection process.
Birth is taught to be the generation process.
Death is the perfection process.
The imagined is called the generation process.
The dependent connects with the perfection process.
Conventional truth is the generation process.
Ultimate truth is the perfection process.
The methods of the two truths are the generation process.
The prajñā of their inseparability is the perfection process.
All that and more, 8.67
with their external, internal, and “other” processes, are united with the one wisdom.
That is the root that sums up [all], just as do the explanations of E VAṂ.
Knowable objects are purified within a state free from fixations.

Next, I will present the principles 9.1
for the teachings on the bases of purification
and means of purification involving all phenomena.
The dhātu of sentient beings is the buddha heart: 9.4
devoid of stains, possessing two truths.
The Vajra Wisdom says that conventionalities are the appearances of percepts and perceivers, and their reality is like the moon [reflected in] water.
The ultimate is the eighteen emptinesses; its reality is wisdom free of duality.
The conceptual process of examining that generates the remedy, which is taught to be the means of purification.
Phenomena are described as corresponding to the numbers of bases of purification.
The philosophical tenets of Brāhmaṇas and others 9.14
are knowable objects created by thoughts.
They include [beliefs about] the conjunction of causes and conditions and an adherence to nonexistence.
Their various views are said to arise in dependence upon the percepts and perceivers of body and mind.
[Those who assert that] external things are particles or hidden 9.19
phenomena
are under the sway of not understanding
that the ālaya and mentation [contain] the potentials for objects to appear.
Nevertheless, the Victor taught [about external things] to refute that a self or the like is a creator.
“Self” and “person” refer to things imputed— 9.14
they do not have even an atom’s worth of existence as real substances.
It is said, “If they existed, there would be the dilemma of effortless liberation or no liberation at all.”
Those and the other factors to be abandoned and their remedies, 9.28
which appear to the mind, accord with what the masters have taught.
Here, using the principles of the channels, winds, and bindus 9.30
in this body, an appearing object,
the Tathāgata taught the factors to be abandoned and their remedies.
To be more specific: in beings with vajra bodies, 9.33
one hundred years’ worth of winds add up to 777,600,000.
The doors of dharma that purify those bases of purification are the same; eighty-four thousand is [simply] a rough calculation.
Every wisdom wind moving during those [one hundred years] 9.40
contains the path to nirvana.
They are the supreme of remedies, the niruttara tantras.

The wisdom winds of one hundred years 9.43
add up to three years and three half months.
In three years, there are 1,080 days.
Classifying three years as body, speech, and mind yields the three tantras of body, speech, and mind.
The passages explain the tantras of the six families.
The divisions of the months explain the families belonging to the thirty-six tantras.
Splitting right and left into method and prajñā makes the method and prajñā tantras, the seventy-two root tantras.
The Ḍākārṇava teaches that
they are the purities of the number of hands.
There are thirty-six vowels: A and the others. 9.55
The consonants, KA and the rest, equal those.
They are the main letters, the means of expression.
Each is said to be thirty minor tantras,
[making] 1,800.
[Those letters] contain the branches of tantras,
21,600.
The divisions of anusvāra, visarga, and curved knife [correspond to] long, extra long, and short.
The thirty consonants modified by six vowels 9.64
[make] 360 root vowels.
There are sixty vowels of the daytime and the nighttime.
Therefore, the vowels counted during the breaths in one day and those of the ghaṭikās in one year are consistent; the consonants are the same.
For details, consult the svarodaya [system].
Those classifications are given as summaries 9.71
of what is found in the collections of niruttara tantras.
Now, I will mention the principal [deities] 9.73
of the method, prajñā, and nondual tantras.
Three years of days divided by seven makes 154,
the number of deities in the Laghukālachakra.
The two remainders are said to be the embodiments of method and prajñā.
Dividing [1,080 days] by the fifteen lunar digits 9.79
makes the seventy-two
explained to be the deities of the Avadāna-stotra-tantra: its yoginīs and coupled lord.
Those can be condensed into the thirty-seven heroines and one method residing in the body.

The days in the three half months 9.85
are, specifically, the method tantras.
Classifying them as twelve lagna movements yields 540.
In regard to those, in the Māyājāla there are three forms: a maṇḍala of forty-nine, one of forty-five, and one of forty-three, all in pairs, making 274.
The six forms of the glorious Guhyasamāja are nine, thirteen, nineteen, twenty-five, thirty-two, and thirty-four.
Classifying those as method and prajñā makes 264.
Including method and prajñā yields the total number.
Buddhakapāla, Vajrāmṛita, 9.99
Hevajra, and others are said to be contained within the Saṃvara mother tantras.
Those such as Yamāri are included within the Guhyasamāja.
Vāgishvara and others of the Kālachakra
are within the glorious [maṇḍala of] constellations.
[The father and mother tantras] also include all yoga tantras; kriyā and cbaryā are their branches.
Those explain the wisdom winds. 9.107
[Now for] the teachings that the channels are the same. 9.108
The life-force at the heart is Kālachakra. 9.109
Rasanā and lalanā are the natures of his feet.
The buddhas and eight goddesses are in the heart.
Wisdom is referred to as Vishvamātā.
The vases are feces, urine, flesh, marrow, semen, and blood.
The uṣhṇīṣha is a jewel, gaṇḍi, tree, and conch.
The skandhas and dhātus are the buddhas and their consorts.
The six (the visual one and so forth) and their objects are the bodhisattvas and goddesses.
The faculties of action (the legs and so forth) are the ten krodhas.
The channels in the navel are of the natures of the speech maṇḍala: Bhīmā and the others.
The channel chakras in the twelve major joints are those who abide in the body maṇḍala.
The finger and toe joints are nāgas and chaṇḍās.
The body hairs are of the natures of the bhūtas.
Concepts involving desire or its absence are the offering goddesses.
Classifying the channel dhātus as method and prajñā results in 1,080.
The glorious Chakrasaṃvara 9.130
is the three channels and “māra-free.”
At the heart are the four female consorts and four offerings.
The twenty-four major channels
are the yoginīs, Prachaṇḍā and the others.
The dhātus there are the heroes, Khaṇḍakapāla and the rest.
Kākāsyā and the others are similar to the ten krodhas.
Since there are absorbed, enjoyment, and dominant [types],
[the dhātus] are of the natures of seventy-two deities.
The Vajraḍāka teaches that the 120 petals of the chakras are deities.

I will now present the glorious Guhyasamāja. 9.141
The skandhas are the five buddhas.
The four dhātus and tangible objects are the five goddesses.
The eyes are Kṣhitigarbha; the ears, Vajrapāṇi; the nostrils, Akāshagarbha; and the tongue, Lokeshvara.
The mind is Mañjushrī;
its dhātus are Nīvaraṇaviṣhkambhin.
The body is Samantabhadra;
its channels and muscles are Maitreya.
The limb joints, mouth, and privates are of the natures of the ten krodhas.
In the navel are the sixty-four goddesses of the karma family:
Vedhani, Chandika, and the others.
In the heart are the nine of the vajra family:
Vajradhātvīshvarī and the others.
In the throat are the sixteen of the padma nature:
Padmatārā and the rest.
In the head are the thirty-two of the chakra family:
*Prabodhikā and the others.
Their details are found in the Vajra Garland.
Everything said about the many maṇḍalas, such as those— 9.164
from single-figure ones to multifeatured ones— is contained here.
For example, the nine-deity Hevajra [maṇḍala] is just for the heart chakra.
Accordingly, all [deities] are the body’s channels and winds.
In brief, the channels are body; 9.170
winds are mantras and letters;
bindus are the subtle perfection process.
All activities, including burnt offerings,
are means of purification for internal bases of purification.
Here I simply mention them.
Similarly, the All-Seeing One presented
the bhūmis, paths, dhāraṇīs,
and infinite samādhis as deities and mantras
in relationship to internal classifications of body and mind.

Channels, winds, and bindus 10.1
manifest as properties of mind.
Binding the vital points of those principles is superior to all [other] graduated paths.
Mere peace, the absence of a self of persons, is [realized] 10.5
by the swift [after taking birth] three times in cyclic existence, and by those who linger as stream-enterers seven times.
Their [awakening] is a mere peace benefiting themselves alone.
Pratyekabuddhas achieve [awakening] after twenty kalpas, 10.9
or within the one hundred kalpas of the rhinoceros ones.
Bodhisattvas spend three incalculable kalpas 10.11
working for the welfare of sentient beings.
Here it is its special methods that 10.13
[distinguish the Mantrayāna] from the Pāramitā path.
Using only the methods of the kriyā and charyā modes, 10.15
[bodhisattvas achieve buddhahood after] sixty human lifetimes. Through yoga, [they achieve it after] sixteen human lifetimes.
With the niruttara, diligent ones
will definitely achieve it in a single lifetime.
First, on the path of accumulation, [bodhisattvas] receive 10.20
empowerments,
learn well the generation and perfection processes, develop conviction, and practice.
Once they learn the vital points of the channels, winds, 10.22
and bindus,
[bodhisattvas] maintain excellent conduct, attain heat, and dwell on the path of preparation.
At that time, their conduct of discipline moves them along the path of preparation and prepares them for seeing.
This is the path of withdrawal
and fourfold meditative concentration.
It is described as “what purifies the channels.”
It is taught that perfecting the branches of meditative concentration brings the attainment of the five supercognitive abilities.
This is the entrance to the maṇḍala of body.

Following that, through the yoga of life-force control, 10.33
they are prepared for the path of seeing.
“The force of constant retention truly brings Vajrasattva.”[118] This is called the yoga of winds.
With unelaborate and very unelaborate [conducts], 10.38
[bodhisattvas] train in the branches of recollection and the wisdom yoga of samādhi.
[Practicing] the victorious [conduct], they become accomplished.
With group conduct, they benefit others.
The purification of the first 1,800 winds, 10.43
with their associated concepts, occurs on the worldly paths.
When the second [set], along with the bindus, ceases in the secret place, that is the path of seeing.
It stops ignorance, birth, and death.
The third [set] is purified in the same place; the fourth and fifth at the navel; the sixth and seventh at the heart; the eighth and ninth at the throat; and the tenth and eleventh at the head.
Then, the winds cease in the uṣhṇīṣha. 10.34
It is said buddhahood is attained at that time.
The twelve links of dependent origination cease.
The sixteen ascending joys and
indivisible emptiness-compassion are present.
When three years and three half months are pure, the wisdom kāya is attained.
The result is the perfection of the six[-branched] yoga 10.61
involving the channels, winds, and bindus.
I will not discuss the infinite divisions here.
All stages of wisdom are achieved 10.64
in keeping with the previous bases of purification.

Now, I will set out the stages of 11.1
the dissolution of the channels, winds, and bindus.
For those accomplished in the wisdom yoga,
[death] is not predictable because they have mastered their minds.
In the vajra body of ordinary beings, 11.5
all [channels] are generated within one year of their beginning.
It is explained that next
the energies of two channels atrophy each day.
The overall process is that the seventy-two thousand dissolve in one hundred years.
Specifically, all the subtle channels dissolve during ninety-six years and ten and a half months.
Each solar day, 2 of 69,750 dissolve.
After that, 2,250 11.17
[dissolve] during three years and three half months.
Every three days, one of the 360 channels 11.19
in the major joints atrophies.
It is the same for the channels in the fingers and toes.
The navels sixty house channels dissolve with the energies of the winds.
The ones in the head take fifteen days,
those in the throat one month, and the same for the secret channels. The heart ones are gone in eight days.
Thus, in the chakras, there are 160, 11.27
plus the four uṣhṇīṣha channels.
The twenty-four channels 11.29
have sixty major channels,
which dissolve in three years, the same as those in the navel.
The seventy-two absorbed, enjoyment, and dominant channels dissolve during three half months.
Once all the major channels in the chakras atrophy, 11.35
the winds do not move.
Then departure will occur after one day.
[Now] I will present the dissolution stages of the winds. 11.38
The ten winds are complete in ten months.
After birth and until the time of death, they [dissolve] sequentially every ten years.
The strengths of the dhanaṃjaya, devadatta, lizard, tortoise, nāga, pervading, fire-coinciding,
upward-moving, downward-expelling, and life-force winds “are absorbed one by one into each other,”[119] the Vajra Garland states.

The details are found in the Kālachakra. 11.47
In the one hundred years of a human life, 11.48
during the first year after arising,
the lagnas of winds move as even numbers.
Next, during the third course, 11.51
the wind movements increase by one as space.
During the fourth course, there are no fluctuations.
In the second year, the winds increase to two as earth winds through the right.
In that way, the increases occur in alternation every [year].
By the seventh year less three half months,
[the death-omen winds] have become one pāṇīpala.
Then, following the left and right sequencing, they increase by a pāṇīpala every year.
By the sixty-seventh year,
they have become one ghaṭikā, moving through the left.
Next, during every course for thirty years, they increase by daṇḍas,
alternating between those space- and earth-wind locations, following the sequence of left and right.
After ninety-six years and eleven months,
[the death-omen winds] move for one day as the nature of space through the left.
After that, in three years and three half months, 11.69
departure will take place at one hundred years.
Now [I will present] the verity of the madhyamā death omens 11.71
during three years and three half months.
In thirty-seven and a half months,
the [death-omen] days increase to thirty-three.
By thirty-four and a half [months], the number of their days has increased to thirty.
At the navel, there are sixty house channels. 11.77
On the left, [starting] from space,
six channels atrophy with every three [day’s increase].
Moving in the odd ones, [death omens] increase.
On the right, the order of dissolution starts with the earth wind.
[Death-omen movements] in the even ones (two, four, and so on) cause cessation and six houses to empty.
Following that, during three months, 11.84
[the death omens move] for a thirty-first [day] on the left, after which lightness terminates, and for a thirty-second on the right, after which motility terminates.
The two sets of six major root channels cease.
Next, [they move] for a thirty-third [day], and the winds terminate.
The winds of great darkness bringing termination move for one day and cause departure.
Dividing by thirty-two and a half 11.92
[establishes] the verity of the death omens in the madhyamā.

The principles of the untimely 11.94
solar death omens are as follows.
[Death omens] moving for one day on the right 11.96
mean death will come in three years and three half months.
[Death omens] moving for five [days] indicate three years of life; moving for ten indicate two years of life.
When they move for fifteen, there is one year of life.
When they move for twenty, there are six months to live; when they move for twenty-five, there are three months.
Those increases in multiples of five cause five houses to become empty.
Then, with each [day], one house is vacated.
[Death omens] moving for twenty-six indicate two months of life, moving for twenty-seven mean one month is possible.
Once the seventh house has gone, [death omens] expand 11.108
to the point that no one can reverse them.
Death will come in thirty-three days.
[Death omens increasing for] fifteen, ten, five, and three [days] cause four houses to be vacated.
Once the eleventh has become empty, the sun’s strength terminates.
After that, the wind that terminates the moon
moves for two days on the left,
and the twelfth house becomes empty.
Then, [wind] moves for one day in the madhyamā, and the consciousness goes elsewhere.
Now I will explain the signs of the moon on the left. 11.119
[Death omens] moving for one day on the left 11.120
are a sign that departure will occur in three years and three half months.
At six months, [death omens] move for three days, having increased by a day [every two months].
Now there are thirty months of life.
One house at the navel has become empty.
Following that, the death-omen days increase each month by one.
Every three months, one house is vacated.
As the number of days of winds on the left increases, the months of life decrease.
When [death omens] move for thirty-three days, death is certain to come in three days, and the eleventh house has become empty.
Next, the terminator of the solar dhātus moves for two days on the right.
Then, after one day [of wind moving] in the madhyamā, the consciousness goes somewhere else.
The signs of the sun and moon occur accordingly. 11.138
When the winds move first through the odd houses at the navel (Aries and the others), the lunar death omens are the principal ones.
When the winds arise in the even houses (Taurus and the others),
the solar [death omens] are the principal ones.

Whether we live to one hundred (as discussed above) 11.144
or only for one day after birth is said to depend on whether [the winds] move in all the channels or only in the madhyamā.
When poisons, weapons, or serious illnesses 11.148
cause the channels to cease all at once, that is said to be sudden death.
In the same way that cessation occurs in the navel, it does so in the other chakras
with their respective periods, lunar mansions, and lunar padas.
Once twelve daṇḍas move for six days in each of the five chakras and the joints, there is termination.
That is the presentation of the wind’s death omens.
Next, [I will discuss the way] the bindus cease. 11.158
In the first year, the internal dhātus increase.
Then, since the winds’ energies disperse externally,
the white and black channels decrease, as described earlier.
After that, bindus increase 11.162
until the sixteenth year;
then the white elements decline and fade.
Next, blood increases.
At thirty-two that fades.
The strengths of wind, fire, water, and earth decline every sixteen [years].
As a generalization, we should be aware 11.169
that all strength fades by the ninety-seventh year, and death is certain to follow in three years.
The severance of one channel in the navel 11.172
is simultaneous with that of one day of right or left lagnas.
When our urine changes, we have six months left.
When our auditory [winds] depart from sounds, we have six days. When our gustatory [winds] separate from tastes, we have five days.
When patterns appear in the centers of our eyes, we have four days of life.
When our olfactory [winds] deteriorate and depart from smells, we have three days.
When tactile sensations are gone, we have two days.
When the dhātus of phenomena, semen, degenerate, after one day we will go somewhere else.
Our white elements will descend, our red elements ascend,
and our winds will depart through the doors of our nostrils.

If our ālaya consciousness [departs] through our opening of Brahma, 11.186
we will be born in the formless [realm].
If it does so through our bindu, we will be born with the Great Goddess;
through our navel, we become a desire realm god; through our eyes, we become a powerful human in the desire [realm];
through our nostrils, we are born in the land of yakṣhas; through our ears, we become a deity of accomplishment.
It is said that if we depart through our paths of existence, we become a hungry ghost.
If we depart through our urethra, we become an animal.
If we go through our lower door, we end up in the eight hells.
Next, the bardo manifests.
The vanishing of illumination, radiance, and attainment 11.197
is not recognized to be of the nature of the three kāyas.
Not realizing the emptiness and great emptiness of luminosity’s illumination and darkness, we wander in the cycles of saṃsāra.
With refinement, there is wisdom.
With purification, that is nirvana.

In all the tantras, the Victor taught 1
about shared external appearances,
the internal channels, winds, and bindus,
the “other” imagined deities and mantras,
stained conceptuality,
and twofold stainless wisdom.
He taught that all those are conventional and ultimate, involving elaborations and devoid of elaborations.
External abhidharma teaches 9
that the external has no separate creator,
that dependently arisen appearances are reflexive appearances,
and about conceptual, nonassociated formative forces,
which include the environment and its inhabitants,
the subtle and the gross, names, words, and letters,
directions, and time.
As it is externally, so it is internally. 15
The body’s shape and channels are the world.
Its winds produce speech, time, and letters.
Its bindus are the planets and lunar mansions.
These principles apply to rivers, fires, and so forth.
Closed eyes cannot see forms, 20
but, when the eyes are open, appearances are present; when pressed, two moons are seen.
Accordingly, those who do not know how to bind the vital points of the supports
cannot see the masterful wisdom.
Those who bind the supports see path wisdom.
Although not external, the imaginary deities
and maṇḍalas are displayed as appearances for others.
That is the abhidharma of the inner principles.
The deities and maṇḍalas, which are described as “other,” 29
are [means for] achieving the bhūmis, paths, pāramitās, the factors for awakening using dhāraṇīs and mantras, the totalities, overpowerings, and so forth.
They are profound and vast.
Therefore, [the Vajrayāna] is said to be the sūtras and pāramitās.
External [vinaya provides] physical and verbal protections 35
and vows
and the controls [for avoiding] natural and proscribed [misdeeds].
Internal [vinaya] changes the mental afflictions into wisdoms by means of its special skillful methods.
It is [practiced by] those not confused about how to benefit themselves and others.
[The Mantrayāna] teaches the internal vinaya.

Those who understand the external vinaya, abhidharma, and sūtras 41
achieve the results of shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.
Those who undertake the practices of the profound sūtras, vinaya, and abhidharma are bodhisattvas.
Those who fully understand the inner principles of the skillful methods
and realize the mode of the heart of the buddhas
take fruitional realization as their path
and quickly achieve unsurpassable buddhahood.
All is of the nature of wisdom, and yet that is obscured— 49
cognition involved with delusive concepts of percepts and perceivers arises adventitiously.
When formative forces manifest fully, what exists is not seen, and what does not, is.
Mired in their conceptual mud, the childish sink in saṃsāra.
The external, internal, and “other” are realized to be wisdom: 56
of the nature of buddhas.
Conventionally, all dualistic appearances are seen to be referents that resemble the moon reflected in water.
The ultimate is to see the eighteen emptinesses as reality, inseparable and singular.
Reflexive awareness, free from afflictive obscurations, 62
cognitive obscurations, and obscurations to absorption, is said to be the qualitative and quantitative wisdoms.
In order that the abiding state 65
taught in the Vajrayāna may be realized,
here I have simply provided a generalized summation.
Although there are countless detailed presentations, 68
we can refer to the commentaries on the tantras
provided by the bodhisattvas.
This is a door to enter those.

This explanation of the profound inner principles 72
is not a personal fabrication.
What the Victor, the all-knowing Bhagavat, taught is all I wrote.
Relying on the powerful commentaries by the lords of the secrets and scholars,
I truly discovered
the Vajrayāna’s inner principles.
Endowed with the kāya of space, the Victor displays, from his 80
maṇḍala of wisdom sun,
rūpakāyas in the worlds of the ten directions for as long as saṃsāra lasts.
Like the sounds of the gods’ drums, [the Buddha’s] speech 82
is not created,
and yet it is heard effortlessly by all beings throughout the realm of space.
[The Buddha’s] mind, like a wish-fulfilling jewel, is wisdom 84
beyond exertion.
While not accompanied by elaborations, it fulfills the hopes of those with elaborations, just as they desire.
Despite engaging with afflicted sentient beings, you are unsullied. 86
To you, the self-arisen Victor, I respectfully pay homage.
Through the power of whatever virtue there may be 88
in this explanation of the profound inner principles, may all beings, who are coextensive with space, attain the wisdom kāya.
If there are any breaches, however slight, 92
may the gatherings of ḍākinīs be patient.

He transcends existence with his great wisdom, pure as space, free from obscuring dust.
Not basking in peace, his hand is adorned with a blooming lotus of nonreferential compassion.

Nowadays, people are weak, both in intellect and perseverance. Moreover, they are dominated by those of inferior fortune.
Using the excuse that it is slightly difficult, they utterly[120] discard the excellent path of exposition and practice.
Although there are many marvelous detailed commentaries from earlier times,
for the most part only their reading transmissions remain.
Those with a deep understanding of the key points are daylight stars.
My undertaking [to compose this text] is not without purpose.
From the time of Rangjung Dorje, the second victor,

What is secret in the unsurpassable Vajrayāna—which was expounded by the Bhagavat, great Vajradhara, to those fully matured and of the highest abilities—is profound since it cannot be realized by anyone other than those possessing the gotra of the noble bodhisattvas. Truly Valid Words states:
There are the abiding state of entities, the path, and the process that gives rise to the result.[121]
The abiding state of ground entities is twofold: that of body and that of mind. The inner nature of mind is sugatagarbha, or connate wisdom. The inner nature of body is what arises as the reflexive light of that [inner nature of mind]: it is known as the “other”’ vajra body endowed with the major and minor marks. As a means for understanding those supported elements [that is, the abiding states of mind and body], the principles connected with the supporting consciousnesses, the channels, winds, and bindus are discussed extensively in terms of their development, abiding, and dissolution. These are the inner principles.• For disciples of sublime fortune, they are presented here as special instructions that combine [the following elements]. [3] In terms of the provisional meaning, this text is based on the Commentaries by Bodhisattvas and the key instructions of the great charioteers. In terms of the definitive meaning, it is [the result of Rangjung Dorje’s] correctly beholding the secrets of the Vajrayāna through the force of his vision and supercognitive abilities, without depending on anyone else. This presentation is referred to as a treatise.

The Autocommentary states:
Since authors of treatises begin with a statement of their objective, [I will now] state mine.[122]
The objective has three [aspects: its subject of discussion, its purpose, and its primary purpose]. The heart of what is taught in the niruttara tantras, their commentaries, and the key instructions is the suchness of body, speech, and mind and the sugatagarbha of ground, path, and fruition. The inner natures of body and mind, which are connected to that ground, path, and fruition, are the subject of discussion here.
These profound principles are kept in the chest of the six parameters and the four modes. In the same way that placing a key and lamp in a persons hand gives them access to a chest of jewels in a dark storeroom, this distinguished scriptural system enables all of us—regardless of our level of intelligence—to understand [these profound principles] clearly. This is the purpose [of this text].
Once someone knows that their poor home contains a great treasure, they want to find that treasure and will exert themselves accordingly. Similarly, first we must know that the inner natures of body and mind are present in our mindstream and that of others. Then, in order to purify our stains and directly realize this nature, we should cultivate faith and conviction. Through listening, we will develop an understanding of the abiding state. Through reflection, we will become certain about it. Through meditation, we will experience it, concordantly to begin with, and, in the end, directly by steeping in realization. We will gradually traverse the paths and bhūmis and achieve the state of great Vajradhara. This is the primary purpose [of this text].

The latter has eleven sections. It begins with a general presentation of the causes and conditions for saṃsāra and nirvana. Next, there are descriptions of

► the supported bindus;
► the connections with the consciousnesses of the four states;

The Continuation of the Guhyasamāja Tantra states:
“Tantra” has the meaning of “connection.”
Connection has three modes:
it is characterized as ground, nature,
and fruition that is impervious. [5]
Ground and nature are the causes.
What is impervious is the result.
The ground is called the method.
These three summarize the meaning of tantra.[123]
The three tantras are connected in terms of their nature. The ground is the abiding state of the entities of body and mind. When, on the basis of correctly understanding those principles, we bind the vital points that are the gradual path of method (which includes the maturing empowerments and the liberating generation and perfection processes), the delusions we have during the four states will be purified. Then, the excellent qualities of the heart of the buddhas, which are impervious to stains, will actually appear, and we will achieve the result. Thus, there is a continuous connection between the ground, the path, and the result.

To begin with, if we do not have an understanding of the systematic presentation of causes and conditions, we may entertain doubts [thinking that what is presented here] resembles certain assertions of non-Buddhists, such as that there is no cause, that there is an intrinsic nature that is a cause, or that discordant types are causes. Therefore, the section presenting the general causes and conditions will be explained first.
Following that, since we gain access to the ultimate on the basis of conventionalities, the second section, the way the body develops, is presented from the perspective of recognizing [that the womb-born body is] the basis of purification during the generation process. The third section is [on channels] because the body is based on the channels, and, to penetrate their vital points, we must understand the abiding modes of the channels. The fourth section [on winds] is given since the winds produce the channels, and we need to understand the abiding modes of the winds to penetrate their vital points. The fifth section is [on bindus] because the bindus move in the channels, and, to penetrate their vital points, we need to understand the abiding state of the bindus.

The sixth section [on the four states] is taught from the perspective of the four states arising in dependence upon the totality of the channels, winds, and bindus. The seventh section [on the external and internal correspondences] is presented because we need to recognize that all delusive appearances are based upon the body, and that the body is the appearing quality of mind. The eighth section [on the imagined deities] is provided from the perspective of three purposes: that we must concentrate our mind as a method for binding delusion, that we must understand the outer and inner principles, and that we must master the rūpakāyas for the welfare of others. The ninth section [on the bases and means of purification] is presented from the perspective that the coarse generation process is not the only method for binding delusion: there are means of purification equal in number to bases of purification. [6]
The tenth section is [on the stages of the path] since the five paths gradually develop in our mindstream in reliance upon our practice of the generation and perfection processes. The eleventh section [on dissolution] is presented from the perspective that, in the end, all those [channels, winds, and bindus] enter emptiness since the abiding mode of all phenomena is suchness. Finally, the summary of those sections is the discussion of the rationale for the Vidyādhara piṭakas.
Thus, the subjects of discussion, the purposes, and the primary purpose [are connected]: the later rely on the previous and could not occur without the previous. Their connections are of one thing arising from something else, like the relationship between fire and smoke.

The word “shrī,” or “glorious” signifies either “nonduality” or “the one to be worshipped,” as is explained by the following quotations. The Hevajra Tantra says:
Shrī signifies nondual wisdom.[124] The Roots of Language states:
Shriñ is to worship.[125]
[Shrī expresses] the distinctive feature of [the buddhas’] excellent qualities: to be the glory of existence and peace. Since this glory signifies the nonduality of appearances and emptiness, of method and prajñā, and of the kāyas and wisdom, it is also “vajra.” [7] It is said:
Vajra is what is indivisible.[126]
Given the definitiveness of that statement, Vajradhara is glorious because he holds (dhara) those [nondualities] indivisibly [or uninterruptedly]. Alternatively, Vajradhara is glorious because he is the one to be worshipped for those nondualities. It is to him that we respectfully pay homage.

In the correlation [of the glorious Vajradhara] with ground, path, and result, “paying homage” serves as the basis for the discussion in all the three contexts [that is, it remains the same in each context]. To whom [do we pay homage]?
In the context of the ground, [we pay homage] to mind-itself, natural luminosity: it is the glory of both saṃsāra and nirvana, and it holds, in a connate manner, the vajra of appearance and emptiness not being divisible as separable things. In the context of the path, [we pay homage] to mind-itself: It possesses the glory of the nonduality of great, nonreferential compassion and emptiness endowed with the most sublime of manifestations. It holds, in a personally experienced manner, the vajra of method and prajñā not being divisible as a duality. In the context of the result, [we pay homage] to mind-itself: It is the glory worthy of worship[127] in all regions of existence and peace. It holds, as a unification, the vajra of the dharmakāya and rūpa-kāyas not being divisible as discrete things. The indestructible, ultimate dharmakāya and the conventional rūpakāyas, which appear for others, are like the sun and its light.•
The occasion [for this line of homage] is the beginning of the composition of the treatise. Its purpose is [to ensure] the completion of the exposition [of this text]. The individual paying homage is the victor Rangjung Dorje, and the way he does so is to pay respect with his three doors. [This line of homage] is also advice for us to begin any teaching or studying [of this text] with the paying of homage.

Gurus have the virtue of knowledge. They possess the excellence of realization since they know by themselves all phenomena, or knowable objects, qualitatively and quantitatively, without needing to rely on the communications or symbolic gestures of others. They also have achieved the excellence of relinquishment since, being all-knowing, they see the abiding state, or characteristic, of all phenomena directly, without obscuration.
Gurus exhibit the virtue of affection. In accordance with their own direct visions, they teach their disciples about the external realms of the world, the internal vajra body, the “other” maṇḍala chakras, and the suchness of those, which is mahāmudrā, the wisdom of nondual bliss-emptiness.• Gurus are endowed with the virtue of power. Gurus teach that the appearances of the external, internal, and “other” do not exist in the ways that they seem to; they also teach that suchness is the abiding mode of appearances. Knowing the bases for purification, objects of purification, means of purification, and results of purification, gurus are skilled in the methods that are to be pursued as the path. Thus, they are able to dispel the stains of the delusions present in the mindstreams of their disciples during the four states (sleep, dream, sexual union, and waking). This enables their disciples to attain the four kāyas, the results.
In brief, gurus possess the virtues of the excellences that benefit themselves and others.• It is said in the Kālachakra, King of Tantras:
The glorious gurus are those in whose minds or faces the Buddha’s face is present.[128]
Those in whose minds connate wisdom, the meaning of the fourth empowerment—which is symbolized by the fourth face of Kālachakra—is present through the force of their meditation, and who, by means of their faces, teach disciples are glorious ones. Since no one is higher than them, they are called “gurus” from the word uttara.• To these embodiments of the buddhas, we respectfully pay homage.

The Autocommentary states that it is not redundant to speak of “seeing” as something separate from “knowing.”[129] Using the additional term [“all-seeing”] excludes those such as the pretentious Brahma or Vishnu, who are referred to as “all-knowing,” and, as a [positive] determination, it signifies possessing the virtue of relinquishing obscurations.

Here the scholar-siddha Dak Rampa[130] and the notes on the oral teachings of the all-knowing Dharmākara [Chökyi Jung-ne][131] are in agreement in explaining that [these two terms] show that [gurus] possess twofold knowledge. All-knowing means to know conventionalities: to know clearly and distinctly all know-able objects quantitatively. All-seeing means to see the ultimate: to see nakedly and without obscurations the suchness of every phenomenon, that is, to see the abiding state, just as things are. Dak Rampa’s commentary gives extensive logical proofs dispelling [seeming] contradictions such as that [the buddhas] know conventionalities but do not see them.•

Additionally, the statement in the Autocommentary “because they are the glory of the entire world, including the gods, [we pay homage to the glorious gurus]”[132] expresses the general meaning of “glorious.” To connect “glorious” with the term “what is to be worshipped” is its word-meaning. The explanation that great bliss is what is glorious is the hidden meaning, and that nondual wisdom is what is glorious is the ultimate meaning. We should be aware that these [four modes] can be applied to other terms as well.

When the glorious gurus arise as the buddha kāyas with manifestation, they may be the embodiment of one kāya or up to five kāyas, or they may have a sixfold [manifestation] as the natural outcome of their mode of being numerous families, [10]
First there is the connate entity, mind-itself, at the time of the ground. Through purifying this of stains through the path, it manifests as the kāya of the single family of the great secret, the result.•
The twofold presence is that ground mind-itself, the connate state, abides as the unification of appearances and emptiness. It is purified by the paths unification of method and prajñā and, as the result, manifests as the unification of the two kāyas.•
The threefold presence is that, as the ground, the channels are awakened body, the winds are awakened speech, and the bindus are awakened mind. They are purified by the threefold path of the generation process, perfection process, and unification. In terms of results, they manifest as three kāyas (dharmakāya, saṃbhogakāya, and nirmāṇakāya) or the three vajras.•
The fourfold presence means that the four ground states of [deep] sleep, dream, sexual union, and waking are purified by the four mudrās of the path,[133] and manifest as the four resultant kāyas (dharmakāya, sambhogakāya, nirmāṇakāya, and jñānakāya).†

The fivefold presence is that fivefold phenomena at the time of the ground—the five skandhas, five dhātus, five mental afflictions, and so forth—are purified by the path’s generation and perfection processes related to the five families, and, as results, manifest as five kāyas and five wisdoms (such as the dharmadhātu wisdom, Vairochana).
From the perspective of correlations with the six dhātus, the twelvefold truth, the sixteen types of suchness, the five sets of five, the twenty-five, and so forth, [gurus may appear] as one hundred families, a thousand, and so on, up to an infinite number. The Hevajra Tantra says:
From those five families, many thousands emerge.
Therefore, their nature is the same: great bliss, the supreme benefit.[134]
The single all-pervading entity—the jñānakāya of connate bliss-emptiness—is the basis for the divisions and is then split into method and prajñā, giving rise to two [families and kāyas]; it [can be further divided] up to a countless number. Nevertheless, all its manifestations are the expression of the single mood of great bliss, [11] The Conduct of Yoginīs states:
That which is called “the sixth buddha” is a single mood, danced by many.[135]
As is taught extensively throughout the tantras, we pay homage to the presence of all the manifestations of great bliss, non referential compassion, Vajrasattva, the syllable VAṂ.

The explanation according to the common yānas is as follows. The single entity of emptiness is the very nature of all dependently arisen phenomena. Since this is beyond the extremes of conceptual elaborations, it is the essence of what is called “the middle.” In the Vajrayāna, it is referred to by the terms “madhyamā channel,” “wisdom wind,” and “the one bindu of great bliss.” When realized, [it is the nature that arises at the end]. The single phrase “at the end” (gang mthar) has numerous meanings. The nature that arises, or is realized, at the termination (ma mtha’) of obscurations (which were relinquished gradually) and at the culmination (ya mtha’) of wisdom (which developed gradually) is referred to by the term “the Goddess,” who is Prajñāpāramitā, the mother who gives birth to all buddhas. Since she is indivisible from the dharmakāya of the glorious gurus, we pay homage to her.
The uncommon explanation is as follows. [The Goddess] is not an inanimate emptiness—she is endowed with the most sublime of manifestations. [12] She is the single entity, connate with mind, containing the nature that pervades all phenomena.• Synonyms are “the essence of the middle” and “the kāya of the one great bliss.” Alternatively, it is fitting to explain that, in terms of the vajra body, the inner lady is the essence of the madhyamā channel, and that the one instant of unchanging bliss is the nature that arises clearly at the end when wind-mind has entered there [that is, the madhyamā channel].
The time when this connate state manifests is presented in the following ways. At the end, when the vajra-like samādhi (which occurs at the end of the path of meditations continuum and is its consummation) has destroyed all obscurations, the nature that arises (free from all characteristics) is the first instant of the final all-knowing wisdom.† That is what is taught in this treatise.
In a concordant manner, in the context of the path, at the end of the seventh bhūmi, the wisdom that is the mastery of nonconceptuality arises on the eighth bhūmi.

Concordant with that, at the end of the path of preparation, the samādhi illuminating nonconceptual wisdom arises on the path of seeing.
Those [path wisdoms] are revealed in the following manner. Through the power of the empowerments or the power of meditation, the nature that is nondual bliss-emptiness dawns at the end (ya mtha’) of supreme joy and the beginning (ma mtha’) of without-joy. This is nondegenerative bliss, free from mental states involving the three poisons, beyond existence and nonexistence; it is like [the images seen during] prasena divinations. It is connate joy, described in the Two-Part [Hevajra Tantra]:
[I am the nature of connate joy,
arising] at supreme’s end and before without-joy,
like a candle in the darkness.
Children, have confidence: that is the way it is.[136]
As for [the term] “goddess” (devī), it is said:
Dīvya: radiant and brilliant.[137]
Looked at in connection with the meaning of its linguistic roots, [the term goddess indicates] a form of emptiness that [embodies] all manifestations. Being beyond minute particles, conceptual objects, and terms, it is not an entity. [13] Nevertheless, since it appears directly to yogins and yoginīs, it is not a nonentity. The conventional being empty and emptiness being conventional forms transcend all worldly examples. [The Goddess] displays many forms and has various names: the great bliss mother, the definitive-meaning goddess, Vishavamāta, Vajravārāhī, Nairātmyā, and so on. We pay homage to the mother who gives birth to the buddhas: great bliss, emptiness endowed with the most sublime of manifestations, the syllable E.

What follows the homages? It is the statement of intent [for the composition of the text], as [the Autocommentary] says, “[Now] I will give the explanation.”[138] What will be explained? The inner principles and the methods, which are what is secret in the kriyā, charyā, and yoga tantras. The victor Vajradhara fully revealed these in the father and mother niruttara tantras.
If they are taught there, why should they be repeated here? In those tantras, these subjects are bound within vajra statements that make use of the six parameters (intentional ambiguity, intentional unambiguity, the provisional meaning, the definitive meaning, standard terminology, and nonstandard terminology) and the four modes (the word-, general, hidden, and ultimate [meanings]). The profound inner principles of body and mind are not objects of experience for dogmatic philosophers, such as the non-Buddhist shrāvakas (the Parivrājakas, followers of Charaka, and others) or the Buddhist shrāvakas (which include the Vaibhāṣhikas). Moreover, they are also kept very secret from beginners who have just entered the Pāramitā[yāna] and from those who are only interested in emptiness. Since such persons do not understand [these profound inner principles], they remain self-secret. [14]
It is not, however, that the Buddha was stingy with the dharma. All his teachings were given in accordance with the natures, capacities, and fortunes of his disciples. He concealed the profound principles of the tantras in the casket of vajra statements in order to make them self-secret for those of inferior capacity, to prevent those of inferior abilities from abandoning the dharma, and to stop those affected by māras and arrogant scholars from doing whatever they please.
What exactly are the principles that form the subject of discussion? The inner nature of mind is connate wisdom, and the inner nature of body is [the kāyas endowed with] the major and minor marks, which arise as the reflexive light of that [wisdom]. They are taught here so that we will understand clearly that body and mind contain causes that are of the same category as the two kāyas.•
These verses reveal the profound inner principles to those disciples who have the fortune to be of the highest ability; others will not understand them.†

An instance of this is the intentionally ambiguous statement in which continuously enjoying the mother of the buddhas, Prajñāpāramitā—emptiness endowed with the most sublime of manifestations, which is like the nature of [the images seen during] prasena divinations—is compared to the way that some men enjoy the woman born from the Supreme God, the powerful Indra, such as the when the Mahāmayā Tantra says:
Having snatched [her] from the buddhas, enjoy the woman born from the Supreme God.[140] [15]

(2) Intentional unambiguity is of two types:
(a) Intentional unambiguity about what is temporary, and
(b) Intentional unambiguity about the final ultimate.
(2a) [Intentional Unambiguity about What Is Temporary]
Since, on a temporary level, unvirtuous actions lead to rebirth in the lower states, [the All-Secret Tantra] says:
You should not kill living beings.
You should also not lie.[142]
(2b) [Intentional Unambiguity about the Final Ultimate]
This includes statements from the perspective of the final ultimate, such as is found in the [Hevajra Tantra]:
The connate cannot be described by others; it cannot be discovered anywhere.
Follow your gurus timing and his methods: you will recognize it with your merit.[143]

Such statements use the secret language of the tathāgatas, not the expressions found in worldly treatises.
Tantras are either actual tantras (the subjects of discussion) or word-tantras (the means of discussion). The subjects of discussion are conventional reality and ultimate reality. Statements about conventional reality are either about the provisional meaning or are intentionally ambiguous. Statements about ultimate reality are either about the definitive meaning or are intentionally unambiguous. The word-tantras, as the means of discussion, employ both standard terminology and nonstandard terminology.

What are the inner natures of body and mind spoken of in the statement of intent for the exposition [of this text]? Their own natures are beyond conceptual elaborations that involve the apprehension of characteristics, and, in that regard, they are primordially without even the slightest removable, adventitious stains. Being the nature, or essence, of the victors, they are the heart. This [buddha heart] is present continuously throughout both saṃsāra and nirvana. It has three phases:
► when stains have not been purified at all;
► when the subtle stains have not been purified, but the coarse ones have been purified through the remedial force of the two processes [of generation and perfection]; and
► when all obscurations have been utterly purified.
These phases are taught to correspond, respectively, to sentient beings who possess sugatagarbha that has not been purified; to those abiding on the path who possess sugatagarbha that has not been purified [completely] but has been purified [partially]; and to tathāgatas, who possess sugatagarbha that has been utterly purified.
Where is this taught? While this exposition is indeed similar to the extensive descriptions of how the [buddha] heart is embraced by the four inconceivable aspects—found in the Highest Continuum[148] and other texts of the common [yānas]—what is presented here, however, is the subject of discussion found in the uncommon, great, secret Vajrayāna. It is the actual continuum. This is explained in terms of the three phases of ground continuum, method continuum, and resultant continuum. It is also taught in other places, as this quotation from the key instructions demonstrates:
There is the abiding state of the ground entities, the stages of the path, and the stages during which the result arises. [18]
The Continuation of the Guhyasamāja Tantra states:
Tantra is understood to be a continuity.
Tantra has three modes.[149]
There are an infinite number of such quotations. This principle [of the three continua or tantras], which is what is presented as the core subject of this treatise, should be understood through the explanations that will follow.•

At this point, some might think, “The former and latter phases can be designated in that way, but it is not suitable to do so for the middle phase.”• [That is wrong.] For instance, when we learn the alphabet or how to draw deities, those serve as paths. Similarly, when we train in vajra yoga or the prajñāpāramitā, those serve as paths.† [The Name-Chanting of Mañjushrī] says:
This pure and excellent path
is taught to be the way of the illusory net.[150]
Furthermore, we should understand that [this path] is referred to by the term “Vajrayāna” because “vajra” signifies unchanging buddhahood and “yana,” proceeding along the path to that [state].‡

Now, since it is not fitting for us not to understand this crucial key point, I will elaborate a bit. The three continua are the ground continuum, the inseparability of body and mind; the path continuum, the inseparability of the generation and perfection processes; and the resultant continuum, the inseparability of the two kāyas.
The purities, or wisdoms, of body and mind are causes because they belong to the same category as complete buddhahood. They are continua because they are the continuous unchanging connection from [the state of] sentient beings through that of buddhas. The generation and perfection processes are methods because they reveal, either directly or indirectly, final buddhahood. They are continua because the empowerments, samayas, and vows are connected, and those are connected to the two processes of the path, which in turn are connected to the two kāyas. Regarding these two continua, the first are substantial causes, and the latter are the cooperative conditions. Both make evident that which was [previously] not evident; however, it is not that they newly produce something that previously did not exist. [19]
Once the causal continuum is purified by the method continuum, what becomes manifest without obscuration is the resultant continuum. That is impervious to circumstances for as long as space [endures] because it is a stable continuity. The causal continuum taught in the Mantra[yāna] is the “gotra” described in the Pāramitā[yāna]. The glorious Rangjung Dorje explains this as follows:[151]
The gotra is the qualities of sentient beings’ body, speech, and mind that are similar to the tathāgatas’ body, speech, and mind.
This is explained extensively in the Glorious Two-Part [Hevajra Tantra]:
[Buddhas have] forms with faces and arms.•
It continues:
Right at birth, [beings] have those qualities.
But they still have their usual tendencies.†
It also states:
All beings are lords of the ten bhūmis.•

This [gotra] is the same as the sugatagarbha taught here. The proponents of the [various] philosophical tenet systems have their own assertions regarding [the former], hence there are many different expositions.† The sugatagarbha taught in the Vajrayāna is [explained by Tibetan masters] as follows.
In the [Systematic Presentation] Endowed with Purity, Jeweled Tree [for Clear Realization],[152] and elsewhere, the early masters of the glorious Sakya explain that [sugatagarbha] is mind-itself, which is pure by nature. They teach that, although the excellent qualities [of buddhahood] are not actually manifest within that [mind], they are intrinsically present as causes. When the conditions of the two accumulations or the practices of the two processes bring about the manifestation of the result, those causes undergo a fundamental change and the excellent qualities [of buddhahood] are achieved. [20]
The great omniscient one of Jomo-nang [Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen] discusses [sugatagarbha in terms of the naturally abiding gotra and the evolving gotra in the following manner]. The naturally abiding gotra with the thirty-two excellent qualities of the dharmakāya is present innately in all sentient beings from the beginning. It is the actual buddha. The evolving gotra arises newly, produced by the conditions of the latent tendencies for listening and so forth.
The great Tibetan āchārya Sangwe Jin [Bodong Panchen Chokle Nam-gyal] states that [sugatagarbha] is the quintessence of body, speech, and mind, called “the indestructible quintessence with three features.”‡ Some Tibetans• explain that [sugatagarbha] is confined to being a nonimplicative negation. They say, “It is the emptiness that is mind empty of true existence.” The glorious Rangjung Dorje explains that sugatagarbha is ordinary mind, whose nature is the inseparability of the dhātu and wisdom. Like the moon reflected in water, it is free from being real or false, beyond identification and characteristics. In his Treatise That Reveals the Tathāgata Heart, he says:
The wise state that, like the moon’s reflection in water, all things are neither real nor false.
This ordinary mind is called “dharmadhātu” and “the heart of the victors.”[153]

Here the scholar-siddha Dak Rampa Chögyal Tenpa comments:
The Stainless Light states:
The immutable heart of those following the Shrāvaka, Pāramitā, and Mantra approaches is the Bhagavat Vajra Holder, which the Tathāgata presented in The Name- Chanting of Mañjushrī. In the future there will appear counterfeit gurus who have strayed from immutable wisdom by not understanding this point. Those who have strayed will cause sentient beings to stray.[154] [21]
The meaning of that statement is that those who assert that tathāgatagarbha is the provisional meaning have strayed from the correct view. Those who have greatly strayed say that, since buddhahood arises from the path, buddhahood is conditioned.[155] They say sugatagarbha[156] is not present innately in sentient beings. They maintain that, since all cognitions are necessarily conditioned, it is impossible that prajñāpāramitā, omniscience, wisdom, and valid cognition are unconditioned. By spreading a degenerate view that deprecates the ultimate, they cause sentient beings to stray from the correct path.
Those who assert that the ultimate continuum, the ultimate deity, and the ultimate buddha are conditioned and [Mantra and Pāramitā followers][157] who assert that the svabhāvikakāya is not buddhahood are no different from those who spend their lives as shepherds but cannot recognize their sheep.[158]

How many topics are there in the explanation of sugatagarbha, which is continuous throughout ground, path, and result? [22] [There are eleven, which are] covered in the following eleven chapters, or sections. The first of those chapters will be a general presentation of causes and conditions. That is then followed by the details. There will be a chapter that discusses the development of the body born from a womb. Since that body exists in the form of channels, there will be a chapter describing its channels. The following chapter will discuss the natures, locations, and movements of its winds, which flow through those channels. The next chapter will present how its bindus, which engage with those channels and winds, abide and circulate. There will be a chapter that discusses the ground, path, and fruition principles of the connections between the consciousnesses, the wisdoms, and so forth, and the four states, the four mudrās, and other elements. The next chapter will explain the correlation of those inner principles to the external world, the environment. That is followed by a chapter on the process of generating the “other” imagined deities. The subsequent chapter will present the means of purification and the bases for the purification of phenomena. Then there will be a chapter that teaches how the stages of the bhūmis and paths are traversed by means of binding the inner vital points. The final chapter will discuss the way those channels, winds, and bindus disintegrate and dissolve.
Having gathered [these topics] from the tantras where they were taught by the victor Vajradhara [in various ways]—partially, intermingled [with other subjects], or completely—I will now explain them accordingly.•

What is the cause, or ground, of saṃsāra and nirvana? What are the conditions for saṃsāra and nirvana to appear from that [ground]? The cause, or ground, of saṃsāra and nirvana is mind-itself, which has no beginning or end. Because it is liberated from the conceptual elaborations of unity or separateness, it is not limited. It is not partial in the sense of being something permanent or being an annihilation, being something to be abandoned or being a remedy, and so forth.• Saying that identifies the dharmadhātu, suchness, and sugatagarbha as the ground without which nothing would arise.

Here the Autocommentary says that the term “ālaya” is used for thusness, or dharmatā, which is the ground for saṃsāra and nirvāṇa.[159] Its subdivisions are presented by referring to its pure state as ālaya wisdom and by calling it the ālaya consciousness in terms of it [containing] all seeds.† With [references to] the particularities of the higher and lower yānas, [the Autocommentary] teaches that categorizing mind as pure and impure establishes how saṃsāra appears from the ālaya consciousness and nirvāṇa appears from the ālaya wisdom.
Thusness, or dharmatā, the ground for saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, is discussed using numerous terms: “the great, primordial indestructible bindu,” “pra-jñāpāramitā,” “mahāmudrā,” “intrinsic wisdom,” “ordinary mind,” and so forth. When it is animated by the wind that moves mentation, it engages with the concepts of other. From the perspective of the appearances of dualistic phenomena, the conventional terms “ālaya wisdom” and “ālaya consciousness” are used.

Ālaya wisdom is the aforementioned sugatagarbha. The Prajñāpāramitā [sūtras]• and the Highest Continuum teach that this is the nature of mind. The Dohā [for the People][160] speaks of mind that is like a wish-fulfilling jewel.† The Abhidharma Sūtra says:
The dhātu of beginningless time is the source of all phenomena.[161]
The referent of those statements is this very [ālaya wisdom]. It is explained to be wisdom since The Name-Chanting of Mañjushrī proclaims;
Transcending the nature of consciousness [he] holds wisdom in a nondual manner.[162] [15]
This [ālaya wisdom] is a cause of the same category as nirvāṇa, and it is the empowering or dominant cause for saṃsāra.[163] [Ālaya wisdom] is present in the sense of being mixed with ālaya consciousness, like milk mixed with water. Those who are ignorant of the definitive meaning and who do not recognize ālaya wisdom assert that there are only six modes of consciousness, or if they assert eight modes of consciousness, they take ālaya to be only consciousness. Nevertheless, it is said in the Compendium of the Mahāyāna:
As for what are the latent tendencies for listening ([which] are contingent upon the awakening of the buddhas), what source they enter, and that they enter the maturational consciousness in the sense of coexisting with it, [we should know that] they are like milk [mixed] with water.[164]
Accordingly, it is explained that consciousness operates in the sense of being the support and wisdom as being the supported.

Nowadays, the ālaya consciousness is well known among abhidharma [scholars]. It is the direct cause for saṃsāra, not the cause for nirvāṇa. For an extensive presentation of this we should refer to the Autocommentary and other texts.[165]

Here [the Autocommentary] explains the meaning of without beginning or end.[166] From the perspective of consciousness, what appear as delusion and as liberation do indeed have a beginning and end; nevertheless, temporal beginnings and ends are conceptual superimpositions. In essence, neither delusion nor liberation has ever existed. The natures of the stained mind and the unstained mind, which are dependently arisen, cannot be said to be the same or different. Since there is no other beginning than that [of dependent origination], they are said to be “of a time without beginning.” Alternatively, since they are free from arising, abiding, or ceasing, they are said to be “without beginning or end.”

<d e="2">
[The Autocommentary also says that this mind] cannot be said to be the same as or different from that of the buddhas or of sentient beings and, therefore, it is not limited [in the sense of being one or the other].[167] Since it does not assume any position—such as being permanent or an annihilation, something to be abandoned or a remedy—it is not partial. That is a description of the nature of the abiding state [of mind].

Here [Dak Rampa remarks that] those who explain the causal continuum to be the ālaya consciousness, and those who maintain that the noble father and son [Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva] do not assert an ālaya consciousness, have simply made the mistake of not studying such texts as the Compendium of the Mahāyāna and the Commentary on Bodhichitta.• [26]

If mind-itself is the ground of everything in saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, how is it that saṃsāra and nirvāṇa appear individually from that [one ground]? This mind-itself displays its brilliance freely—that is the expressive power of wisdom, mind-itself. While [mind-itself] never moves from its essence, emptiness, its nature manifests clearly: it is the inseparability of emptiness and clarity. Its manifestations, or modes of apprehension, appear unimpededly as anything at all.• As names for those three, the terms “mind,” “mentation,” and “consciousness” are used in the context of saṃsāra, and, in the context of nirvāṇa, the terms “dharmakāya,” “saṃbhogakāya,” and the “nirmāṇakāya arising as anything” are used.•

Regardless of whether the mind is pure or impure, since its essence is unborn emptiness and its nature is luminous clarity, it is the ground of everything. A distinctive feature of the Mantra tradition is its statement that everything is one in being great bliss. In either case, with its display that is an unimpeded manifestation [of emptiness-clarity, or great bliss], anything at all can appear. An additional sense derived from the previously mentioned “although” is that the various manifestations that appear seem to assume positions as the specific phenomena of percepts and perceivers in saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. From the ālaya, afflictive mentation arises unimpededly; from that, the six modes of consciousness; from those, the fifty-one mental factors and so forth; and from those, the appearances of the environment and its inhabitants. The Mantra tradition explains that the various appearances of the winds and channels and external and internal forms arise unimpededly from luminosity or the connate state.

As for [the relationship between mind-itself’s] essence and its manifestations, the exalted Gampopa said, “Connate mind-itself is the dharmakāya. Connate appearances are the light of the dharmakāya.”
The explanation in the Treasury of Abhidharma that mind, mentation, and consciousness are the same represents the Hīnayāna tradition. [27] Here in the Mahāyāna tradition, the understanding is that mind refers to the ālaya consciousness, mentation to the seventh mentation, and consciousness to the six operative consciousnesses.†

With its unimpeded display seeming to appear as [discrete] objects and perceiving subjects, this naturally pure, unborn mind is ignorant of itself, of its own essence. Just as water is [stirred] by waves, [the ālaya] is stirred by the motions of the seventh mentation, which causes mind to form objects.•
On the basis of that, [mind] becomes afflicted with [the dualistic notions of] percepts and perceivers, and, being deluded by that condition [that is, by afflictive mentation], the imagination of what is unreal experiences the appearances of saṃsāra.

Of what is [mind] ignorant? It is ignorant of mind-itself, the heart of the buddhas, the display of the three kāyas. Why is it ignorant? Mind-itself is itself ignorant because its unceasing expressive power appears to be objects and perceiving subjects. It is ignorant because, even though its essence does not exist as anything, it conceives of its unified qualities—its unborn basic nature and its unceasing brilliance—as self and other, respectively.
How is it ignorant? The seventh mentation, which causes mind to form objects, stirs the ālaya. Like the movement of waves on water, its motions produce the afflictive mentation, which is constantly embraced by four afflictions: the associated apprehension of “me”; attachment to a self; the belief in the perishing collection [that is, the skandhas, as being a self]; and ignorance.• Furthermore, when mind-itself—uncontrived ordinary mind beyond identification—is connected to [the delusion of] sentient beings and under the power of dependent origination, it is stimulated by the wind of mentation (the creator of movement). With that [movement], the seventh mentation surfaces and conceives of self and other. Focusing on the unborn basic nature of mind-itself and taking it to be “me” and a self, afflictive mentation is produced. [28] [Afflictive mentation] and the ālaya continue to animate each other: like waves and water, they move and condition each other. This is the imagination of the unreal. Because of that, even though saṃsāric phenomena do not exist inherently, they become established as seemingly real appearances. This is the way mind is ignorant.

Here, connate ignorance is identified by referring to mind-itself s quality of clarity with the term “the seventh mentation” and explaining that the quality of not recognizing its own essence is ignorance.
The formation of positive karma by the movements of the seventh mentation is correct imagination. The essence of that [mentation] itself being without stains is the stainless mentation, which is included within the evolving gotra and, in the context of the ground, is the wisdom of equality. We should understand that this [presentation] is identical to what is explained in chapter 6.

The discussion here of the seventh mentation (which causes mind to form objects) is of a mentation in which no distinction is made between afflictive mentation and stainless mentation. Because [the Autocommentary presents mentation as] that which places within the ālaya the potentials [created] when the six modes of consciousness arise and cease, it explains, drawing from the Ascertainment of Valid Cognition,[169] that [mentation] is the mental consciousness: it is the mentation that is the immediate condition for the six modes of consciousness, as will be explained below.• For these reasons, the Autocommentary repeatedly uses “immediate mentation” as an alternative term [for the seventh mentation].
The exalted seventh [Karmapa, Chödrak Gyatso,] asserts that [mentation] has the following three aspects.
► From the perspective of being immediate, it is regarded as the seventh mentation.
► From the perspective of being embraced by four afflictions, it is designated as the afflictive mentation.
► From the perspective of being embraced by positive qualities, it is considered to be the stainless mentation.

In brief: Within the ocean of the ālaya, the wavelike mentation moves and creates, thereby producing saṃsāra. The ālaya consciousness is the ground or cause of saṃsāra, and mentation is the condition.
The Compendium of the Mahāyāna, presents [mentation] as twofold: first, it is the immediate mentation, the locus for the development of the consciousnesses; second, it is the afflictive mentation, which afflicts those [consciousnesses].• Dak Rampa summarizes the meaning of that detailed explanation, in which mentation is divided into two, [with the following explanation].[170] [29] The first mentation is the base from which the six modes of consciousness arise from the ālaya, and, through association with positive qualities, it becomes the cause for a buddha’s excellent qualities of separation. The latter mentation is not a valid form of cognition since it produces all mental states involving noncomprehension, wrong conception, and doubt, and is the root of delusion in saṃsāra. We should be aware that when the consciousnesses are classified as eight, these two [aspects of mentation] are counted as one.

Ground luminosity, the great, primordial indestructible bindu, is stimulated by wind (the creator of movement), and mind and mentation stir [each other], like water and waves. Because of that, even though referents (apprehended objects) and perceivers (apprehenders) are not, in fact, discrete [entities], the force of our beginningless latent tendencies causes them to appear as two. The mind itself expressly projects images to itself, and perceives that as self and other. Illumination occurs, then radiance, and then the imminent attainment of objects. Because there are appearing aspects—which are mentation moving outward—perceptions of external objects as referents occur, from which the six modes of consciousness arise. That is the way mind is deluded.
What are deluded? Ordinary beings’ six modes of consciousness, which fixate on appearing objects, are deluded. About what are they deluded? They are deluded about the myriad objects that appear. How are they deluded? Being ignorant of their own basic mistake of apprehending themselves dualistically, [the consciousnesses] are deluded in that they conceive of themselves as referents that are other, that is, as perceived objects.

<d e="2">
What are the causes and conditions of delusion? [Delusion is created] by the movements of mentation. [To elaborate] on this: Because, as just described, mind and mentation stir each other, there is confusion about the unification [of appearances and emptiness]. The appearing aspects are taken to be the perceived referents, the six types of objects, such as forms. The empty aspect is taken to be the perceiving mind, the six consciousnesses, such as the visual consciousness. There are no percepts that are other than [mind] itself—[mind] itself (the perceiver) expressly projects to itself and conceives and perceives [referents] to be other, thereby becoming involved with dualistic appearances. That is the delusion of conceiving of nondual appearance-emptiness as a duality.
From the interdependence of the triad of objects, sense faculties, and consciousnesses (whose relationship develops because of that [delusion]), there arises cognition that is illumination, such as forms. Next, the illumination of objects (forms and so forth) becomes radiant. Once conceptual mentation becomes involved, since that causes referents (such as forms) to be seen, it is called “the attainment of illumination.” For that reason, the instantaneous appearances of the six modes of consciousness, in terms of their very nature, are not deluded. Nevertheless, since those [moments of consciousness] continue to occur, mentation mistakenly takes its own appearing aspects to be external referents. Because there are appearing aspects (which are the movements of the various deluded thoughts), the six objects (such as forms) are perceived to be outer referents, and the consciousnesses perceiving them arise. That is delusion with respect to the myriad causes and conditions.

The way in which the dharmakāya manifests following the absorption of illumination, radiance, and attainment into luminosity, and the way the delusive appearances of saṃsāra arise following the rising of illumination, radiance, and attainment from ground luminosity are profound key points within the Vajrayāna.
The way the six consciousnesses arise with delusion is described from the perspective of the inner potentials manifesting as the twelvefold dependent origination.• This is the reason that the Autocommentary speaks of “the dependent origination that is the differentiation of the nature [into phenomena].”[171] On the basis of that dependent origination, there occurs the twelvefold dependent origination of the happy states—which are distinguished as pleasant—and the twelvefold dependent origination of the negative states—which are distinguished as unpleasant. [To state this] again, the power of movement causes the defiled karmic formative forces to arise from ignorance, like waves within water. Those formative forces, as conditions, cause the consciousnesses that see the six types of objects (such as forms) as referents to arise. Because they occur solely on the basis of the condition of fundamental ignorance, all the appearances of the consciousnesses are delusive appearances. [31]

The consciousnesses are the starting point for the production of coarse delusive appearances from the heightened appearances of latent tendencies. Therefore, in this context, the first of the five skandhas to be presented is that of the consciousnesses.
The force of objects appearing to the consciousnesses as either pleasing, displeasing, or neutral causes us to think that they are either to be embraced, rejected, or treated with indifference. Thus, there are three types of feelings that arise. Then, based on the skandha of feelings and the apprehension of those objects in terms of their characteristics (which pertain either to their natures or to their attributes), the skandha of discriminations is produced. Following that, along with those discriminations, we distinguish objects individually and variously as pleasing or displeasing, thereby subjecting appearances to the formative processes, and labeling the assorted appearances of objects as something other than our own [mind]. That establishes the collection of mental factors appearing in that way. Next, because of the formative forces and their stabilization of the latent tendencies for labeling objects as other, we fixate on the natures and characteristics of forms, thereby establishing the skandha of forms.• [In this presentation] that is the last skandha. This sequence [of the skandhas] is one of arising [in which resultant skandhas arise from causal ones]; it is referred to as “the actual sequence of causes and results.”•

The dominant conditions for the consciousnesses of the five sense doors are the five transparent physical sense faculties, the visual faculty, which is [shaped] like a flax flower, and the others. They appear as the intermediaries between objects and consciousnesses. The dominant condition for the mental consciousness is a faculty that is a consciousness.
[The five sense faculties] are said to have transparent physical forms. They have physical forms because, having been created by the four elements, they consist of particles. They are transparent because, through their connection with the consciousnesses, objects appear clearly [to their respective consciousnesses]. [33]

What are called the “immediate conditions” for the six modes of consciousness, including the sixth mentation [or mental consciousness], are as follows. Whatever one of the previous [moments of] the six modes of consciousness has [just] ceased is immediately followed by a potential that gives rise to a subsequent [moment of] consciousness. This potential is a powerful latent tendency within the ālaya. The consciousness described as being the same as the dhātu of mentation is the immediate condition for a subsequent moment [of consciousness]. This is because it is the condition that produces a subsequent [moment of one of] the six modes of consciousness upon the cessation of that specific [consciousness] without any other [kind of] cognition interrupting. [34] Therefore, it is taught that the immediate condition is the potential that gives rise to any one of the consciousnesses and is mentation that is based on the ālaya.•

At this point the scholar-siddha Dak Rampa provides explanations of the skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas in terms of the four modes, the pith of which can be summarized as follows.[172]
The amassment of many phenomena is called “skandhas” (“aggregates”). That which have no other creator and bear their own characteristics are referred to as “dhātus” (“constituents”). The doors for the arising of the consciousnesses are known as “āyatanas” (“sense spheres”). What are observed, or perceived, by the six modes of consciousness are “objects.” Such explanations are of word-meanings.

</d>
<d e="2">
The skandhas are five: forms, feelings, discriminations, formative forces, and consciousnesses. There are eighteen dhātus, which consist of [the six] objects, [the six] faculties, and [the six consciousnesses] arising [from those]. There are twelve āyatanas [that is, six sense faculties and their six objects], which arise from contact and feelings. Forms are categorized in terms of color, shape, and so forth. Sounds have eight divisions, such as [sounds arisen from elements] conjoined [with consciousness]. There are four kinds of smells, such as fragrant. There are six types of tastes: sweet, sour, and so forth. Tangible objects are of eleven types: softness, roughness, and so on.[173] There are two kinds of phenomena: conditioned and unconditioned. Those explanations are of general meanings.

<d e="2">
All the phenomena of the skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas have a quintessence (or wisdom) quality and a dreg (or consciousness) quality. The collection of the quintessences and dregs is considered the basis of purification, and the dregs are what are to be purified. The means of purification—maturation and liberation—correspond to the gradations of the bases of purification. The results of purification are the manifestations of the three kāyas. Those explanations are of hidden meanings.

</d>
<d e="2">
There is no external or internal phenomenon that is part of the skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas that is not included within the eight modes of consciousness. The eight consciousnesses, in turn, are contained within the ālaya consciousness. Since the ālaya consciousness is the expressive power of ālaya wisdom, all phenomena come down to, or merge with, ālaya wisdom, the dharmadhātu, suchness. Such explanations are of ultimate meanings.
It is important to be aware, as those explanations of the four modes demonstrate, that other [topics] can be extensively correlated [to the four modes].

Thus, having been produced by the six causes and four conditions, the phenomena of saṃsāra appear on the basis of the twelve links of dependent origination arising in their forward sequence (when ignorance is followed by formative forces and so on), and in their reverse sequence (when the presence of aging and death [results in] the presence of birth, and so on). The phenomena of nirvāṇa appear when the six causes and four conditions are purified and the natures of the twelve links of dependent origination are realized. [At that point] both the forward and reverse sequences [of the twelve links] have ceased: once ignorance ceases, mental formations cease, and so on, and once aging and death are absent, birth is absent, and so forth.•

<d e="2">
What are the stages through which saṃsāra (which is to be deluded within the three realms) arises from the twelvefold dependent origination? The thought of the Autocommentary can be expressed [in verse] as follows:
Ignorance, formative forces, consciousness, names-and-forms, āyatanas, contact, and feelings [arise].
Craving and grasping form a link, producing existence.
From birth and change come aging and death.[174]
I will explain [this line] with the following supplemental information. Since ignorance is [the state of minds] being confused about its own objects, it creates the compelling force for karma.• [36] Formative forces are the defiled virtuous and unvirtuous [actions] that, compelled by that [ignorance, propel us into] subsequent existences.† The ālaya consciousness is tainted by the latent tendencies of those [actions]. Those three are called “the three projecting links.”
Next, there are names-and-forms, which consist of [the skandha of] forms and the four [skandhas of] names that are produced immediately with the subsequent existence. Then the āyatanas (that is, the six sense faculties) form. Contact, which distinguishes objects, occurs from the gathering of the three [object, faculty, and consciousness]. Those are followed by feelings: the various types of experiences, which may be pleasing, displeasing, neutral, satiating, or agonizing. Those four are known as “the four projected links.”
There is the craving and desire to connect with those objects and not to separate from them. The wish and longing to obtain desired objects causes grasping, which pursues the causes of [pleasurable] feelings. When those two [craving and grasping] form a link, there is the powerful karma that produces the subsequent existence, which is [the link called] existence [or becoming]. Those three are known as “the three producing links.”
Birth, which immediately connects us with our next existence, is produced by the projecting and producing [links]. Aging and death are the change and disintegration of the continuum of those skandhas. Those two are called “the produced links.”
To summarize: Ignorance causes the accumulated karma of the formative forces to be deposited in the ālaya. That is followed by the development of the consciousnesses up through feelings. Then craving (which generally produces birth) and grasping (which specifically produces it) form a link, producing saṃsāric existence.

Since existence is composed of three realms, I will explain it by correlating those [three realms of] existence with their respective discriminations. [Beings in] the four formless states of existence apprehend the characteristics of objects to a lesser degree because the appearances and obstructiveness of the desire and form [realms] are blocked. [Beings in] the sixteen states of existence within the form realm apprehend characteristics to a middling degree because they are free from the desires present in the desire [realm] and [only experience] the appearances of forms that are generated by the force of their samādhi, [one of] four meditative concentrations. [37] [Beings in] the eleven states of existence within the desire realm apprehend the characteristics of objects to a greater degree because they are attached to sense pleasures and have all concepts.

In all three realms, because we do not realize the abiding state of our own minds, we take pleasing objects as things to be adopted. When we see displeasing objects, we reject them and feel aggression, and we have no specific thoughts about what is neutral. Thus we create three types of karma: virtuous actions, which are suitable to be adopted by the worthy and are meritorious karma; unvirtuous actions, which are suitable to be rejected by the worthy and are unmeritorious karma; and the karma of meditative absorption, which is any [action] not specified as either of those two and which is stable karma. We should know that those are the karmic formative forces that cause us to take birth in the three realms.•
Those conditions give rise to the three realms. Meritorious karma, in its three degrees (greater, middling, and lesser), creates results of happiness for those in the three higher states of the desire [realm]. Unmeritorious karma, in its three degrees (greater, middling, and lesser), causes results of suffering for those in the three lower states. Stable karma gives rise to the results of samādhi absorptions† for those in the formless [realm] and those in the meditative concentrations [that is, the form realm]. All those results, however, involve mental afflictions because they are aggregations that have arisen due to the power of karma and mental afflictions. [38]

Sugatagarbha is veiled by afflictive obscurations, cognitive obscurations, and obscurations to absorption (which are general terms common to all yānas) and by the latent tendencies for release, which are explained in [Secret] Mantra. Nevertheless, those who know such stains to be adventitious—which [means that stains] do not infiltrate the abiding mode and can be separated from the mind—and who are in the phase of purifying [those stains] by applying the purificatory methods of the generation and perfection processes are said by the victor Vajradhara to be “those on the path.”• [This phase begins with] the path of accumulation and continues until the end of the continuum of the ten bhūmis.† This [section on the dual phase] emphasizes the continuum of method, the path.

When the dharmadhātu, which is stainless by nature, is purified of adventitious stains (that is, the three obscurations), and thus has twofold purity, it is called a “truly complete buddha” since it is [the state when] one has awakened from all three obscurations without exception and one’s maturation has fully developed.
Thus for such reasons, it is said that all sentient beings are referred to as “buddhas with stains.” The Hevajra Tantra states:
Sentient beings are buddhas.
Nevertheless, they are obscured by adventitious stains.
When those are removed, they are buddhas.[176]
The sūtras also teach this:
Sugatagarbha pervades all beings.[177]
This [section on the utterly pure phase] focuses on the resultant continuum.

Now I will explain a bit about the important supplementary topics that we should be aware of throughout [our study] of this treatise.
The ground, or root, of all of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is the great, primordial indestructible bindu. It is primordial because there is no point at which it begins. It is indestructible in that it is indivisible. It is a bindu because it permeates the multitude of appearances. It is great since there is no phenomenon it does not pervade. That explains the term “the great indestructible bindu.” This treatise states:
The cause is beginningless mind-itself.
[Although neither limited nor partial,... ][178]
The essence of mind, which does not differ during [the state of] sentient beings through that of buddhas, is without beginning or end. It is not limited by being something permanent or being an annihilation, by having a middle or an end. [40] It is not partial in the sense of being something to be abandoned, a remedy, or something that can be fixated upon.[179] It is the uncontrived, unconditioned, spontaneously present basic state, untainted by characterizations or concepts.

An infinite number of synonyms are used for this, which include: “mahāmudrā,” “great bliss,” “nāda,” “the space-pervading vajra of space,” “ordinary mind,” “wisdom channels and winds,” “the invincible HAṂ and bindu,” “sugatagarbha,” and “prajñāpāramitā.”
From it, all possible appearances—all the phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—manifest. The great root indestructible state abides under the influence of the dhātus, or elements, of sentient beings. The movements of mentation are caused by the wind that seems to be mixed with [that indestructible state] itself and are the appearances of connate ignorance, [mind] not recognizing its own nature. Under the influence of the red element, the appearances of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are conceived of as other. The influence of the white element causes the notion of a self to arise. This accords with what is stated here:
This [mind] is itself ignorant of itself
[and is stirred by the motions of formative mentation,
just as water is by waves].[180]

The movements of the red and white winds cause the bifurcation into dual-istic phenomena, which are conceived of as percepts and perceivers, appearances and mind, self and other, objects and perceiving subjects, and so on. In fact, all that is thought of as other—percepts, appearances, something other, or objects—are the reflexive light, or appearing quality, of that mind. Whatever is thought of as a self—a perceiver, mind, self, or perceiving subject—is the essence, or empty quality, of that mind. In that way, we conceive of mind’s unborn basic nature and its unceasing radiance as separate things.
In terms of the abiding mode, the inseparability of appearances and mind is established as the basic state of entities, in the same way that a candle flame and its light [are inseparable]. The assertion that appearances are mind is the innermost heart of the thought of the sūtras and tantras. (This [view] is not the same as the tenet posited by the Proponents of Mere Cognition.)

Consequently, by applying the concept of other to mind-itself’s own appearances, we set forth the phenomena of ground, path, and result, which are included within whatever can be known and expressed. When, through the power of the root white and red [bindus], the ground is conceived of as self and other, there is the duality of percepts and perceivers. The inclusion of wind creates a threefold model. When wisdom is distinguished from the red element, there is a fourfold model, which is the meaning of E VAṂ[181] maya, the opening to all tantras.

The Appearing Mode of Saṃsāra
The indestructible bindu is accompanied by the movements of connate ignorance. The manifestations of the three illuminations, swayed by the white element, are conceived of as a self.• The principles of the white element, red element, and wind appear as objects and manifest as the appearances of the three realms: the desire, form, and formless.† When the manifestations are classified in a fourfold model, the hells must be explained as the reflexive appearances of wisdom.
[The manifestations of saṃsāra] also arise in a fivefold model and so forth. Since the indestructible bindu is the embodiment of the five dhātus, from it appear the five skandhas and so forth (which are conceived of as other). Within fourfold phenomena, wisdom can be considered to be a separate category from earth, and space to be separate from wind, yielding six phenomena. By dividing the five phenomena [of the elements] into the lesser elements, twenty-five [lesser elements] are distinguished. It is possible to continue [dividing phenomena] into many more such [categories].
The Way the Appearances of Nirvana Manifest This treatise says:
This [mind] displays freely:
[it is empty in essence yet clear in nature,
and its manifestations arise unimpededly as anything at all.][182]
When we recognize the indestructible bindu to be our own nature, from the manifestations of the three illuminations that are connate wisdom, the very essences of the white element, red element, and wind appear as objects. Those give rise to the appearances of the three kāyas, the dharma-kāya, saṃbhogakāya, and nirmāṇakāya. When manifestations are classified in a fourfold model, the svabhāvikakāya must be asserted to be the reflexive appearance of wisdom. We should know that from those an infinite number of modes are possible: five kāyas, six families, twenty-five minor families, one hundred sacred families, and more.

The Way the Appearances of the Path Arise
The path is considered part of nirvāṇa. The path that brings about the attainment of those kāyas is categorized as twofold, threefold, fourfold, and so forth. Also, the path of maturation and liberation can be a threefold model, a fourfold model, and so forth up to an infinite number.
The great, primordial indestructible state is the ground for all saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—but it is not the ground that is part of the threefold ground, path, and result because it is not partial in the sense of being the ground, the path, or the result. The manifestations of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa—for which the great indestructible bindu serves as the ground for arising—are inconceivable because although [the indestructible bindu] arises as each and every thing in saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, it is itself not any of the phenomena included within saṃsāra or nirvāṇa. [42]
The great indestructible bindu is channels from the perspective of being a support. It is a bindu from the perspective of being the supported excellent qualities. It is wind in that it is movement. It is letters in the sense that it is a cause or dhātu. It is the cognitive states of the three illuminations in the sense that it is manifestation.
It is a faculty in terms of being that which governs objects. It is a skandha in terms of being the amassment of the latent tendencies for all phenomena. It is a dhātu from the perspective of having no other creator and bearing its own characteristics. It is an āyatana in that it gives rise to and increases all external and internal phenomena. From the perspective of being various appearances, it is objects. Even though it appears variously, it is also the perceiving subject in the sense that it is nothing other than the agent for appearances.
It is saṃsāra in the sense that it appears dualistically. It is nirvāṇa in that it is actually not a duality. It is the paths and bhūmis in that it is the methods that reveal the result to be spontaneously present right within the ground. It is the kāyas and wisdoms from the perspective of being the perfection of the excellent qualities of a buddha, the result. Although it is the totality [of those things], it is also each one [individually] in that within each one all [others] are complete.

In brief, we speak of winds from the perspective of the unborn basic state; channels from the perspective of the unimpeded brilliance; and bin-dus from the perspective of the varied expressive power. From the point of view of this triad of basic state, brilliance, and expressive power, we speak of the phenomena of saṃsāra [in sets of three]: winds, semen, and menses; motility, darkness, and lightness; three principal gods; the three poisons; or the three realms. We also speak of the path [in terms of three]: the experiences of bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality, and the realizations of clarity, emptiness, and no fixation. The result is also described [as threefold]: the three vajras, the three kāyas, and so forth.
If we understand these conclusive key points, we will be able to easily comprehend the secret key points concerning the ground, path, and result of the Vajrayāna. Therefore, I have presented here the teachings of the exalted Karma Tinle without abbreviating his words.[183] [43]

[Chapter 1] established the abiding state of the mind entity by distinguishing between dharmatā and phenomena, nature and manifestation, wisdom and consciousness. Chapter 2 discusses the way the saṃsāric body develops. Mind-itself in association with a threefold dependent nature—that is, the white bindus, red bindus, and winds—is called the subtle body. That is referred to as the “indestructible bindu of consciousness”[184] because it cannot be destroyed by anything but the vajra samādhi at the end of the continuum [of the bhūmis]. Since the subtle body is based upon the coarse body, it follows that, after the discussion of the causes and conditions for saṃsāra, the way the saṃsāric body develops is presented. A special feature of the Vajrayāna is that the suchness of mind (the supported) is made manifest by binding the functions of the body (the support). To practice the generation process (the means of purification), we must understand the abiding mode of the body (the basis of purification). All those depend upon first knowing [how the body] develops.

I will explain the way the saṃsāric body develops. As the ālaya, with the great life-force wind, prepares to take birth in the three realms, a body develops. (The word “when” [in the root verse] is the conjunction that connects [these lines] to the following ones.)
What takes birth? The ālaya consciousness, which possesses the seeds of various latent tendencies, takes birth. What makes that happen? The movements of formative mentation, with its characteristic of craving, cause that to happen. In the Vajrayāna, that [formative mentation] is referred to as the “life-force wind” because it sustains the life-force of beings and stirs the mind.• Where is birth taken? It takes place in [one of] the three realms through one of four modes of birth. How does it take place? It occurs according to the way that the consciousness, along with the mind’s formation of objects, is tainted by delusion.

The ālaya consciousness, with its formative forces (which cause mind to form objects and are projecting and producing actions), may take as its object one of the four samādhis (Limitless Space, Limitless Consciousness, Nothingness, or Neither Discrimination nor Nondiscrimination).• Having achieved the clear appearance of the actual absorptions [of one of those four samādhis, the consciousness] takes birth there as a god in the sphere of Limitless Space and so forth. [46] Although those are called the “formless realm” the beings there have a mental body with latent tendencies. That means the ordinary beings born there (though not the noble ones) have a mental body that involves afflictive mentation.
Here [Dak Rampa] says that both the sūtras and [Secret] Mantra explain “formless” as meaning not having a coarse body (which is a collection of particles) and yet still having a subtle body.[185] When the beings there emerge from their samādhi and transfer to another realm, they start to have different concepts [that is, ones that relate to other realms]. The conventional expression “death” is used [to describe their experience, even though no coarse body has died]. Although noble beings are born in this realm, such births are not intentional.†

The [ālaya] consciousness, with [its formative forces that] cause mind to form objects, may take as its object one of the four defiled actual absorptions of the concentrations. Relying on those, that consciousness takes birth in the higher realm known as the “form realm.” It is called that because [the beings there] are proud of their forms. This realm is superior to the desire realm, and is one where manifest coarse sensuality is overcome. The beings there have fully formed bodies with clothes, and take birth spontaneously.•
The causes for being born in those two higher realms are the two types of formative forces: the manifest formative forces that are projecting actions and those that are producing actions. The former are the individual preparatory stages, and the latter are the actual absorptions. Those [preparatory stages and actual absorptions] are differentiated from the point of view of one being coarse and the other subtle.

Furthermore, [the formless and form realms] each have four levels: [the four spheres of the formless realm and the four concentrations of the form realm]. The four concentrations each have three subdivisions [lesser, intermediate, and greater], making twelve. [47]
► Beings who achieve the lesser degree of the clear appearance of the preparatory stage and actual practice of the first concentration are born in Brahmas Group; those who achieve the intermediate degree are born in Brahmā’s Attendants; and those who achieve the greater degree are born in Great Brahma.
► Beings who achieve the lesser, intermediate, and greater degrees of the second concentration are born, respectively, in Lesser Light, Immeasurable Light, and Clear Light.
► Beings who achieve the lesser, intermediate, and greater degrees of the third concentration are born, respectively, in Lesser Virtue, Immeasurable Virtue,[186] and Flourishing Virtue.

Since [in this presentation] there are a total of sixteen levels in the form realm, four remain. They are the four pure states.• The causes for being born there are the formative forces that are the fourth samādhi that involve undefiled prajñā. This is similar to the teaching in the [Explanation of the “Treasury of] Abhidharma” that birth is taken in the five pure states by those who meditate on combinations of the [fourth] concentration.†
The Pāramitā[yāna] says that there are seventeen levels [in the form realm], and others assert that there are eighteen.‡ Here the following reasons are given for the explanation that there are sixteen levels in the form realm. The cause for being born as a long-lived god without [operative] cognitive discriminations is meditating in an absorption without cognitive discrimination under the influence of taking the cessation of discriminations and feelings during the third worldly concentration to be nirvāṇa.§ Since those [long-lived] gods reside with the gods of Great Result (but in areas isolated from the [gods’] cities), they are not counted as a separate level.
Also, Superior Vision and Excellent Appearance are asserted to be the same despite having different names [and thus are not counted as two separate levels].

[48] Which supporting dhātus cause birth in the form and formless realms? According to the thought of the Kālachakra, King of Tantras, they are the five major elements of space, wind, fire, water, and earth divided into the lesser elements (wind-space and the others).• These constitute the outflows of body (that is, the discarding of the bodhichitta dhātus) and the outflows of mind (that is, being obscured by afflictive conceptuality).† They cause beings to be born in these twenty places that are other than the desire realm: the sixteen levels of the form realm and the four formless spheres.
The cause of birth in each level [is explained] by relating the sequence of the twenty outflows to the twenty places—from one dhātu (space) up to five ([from space] through the earth dhātu)—as follows.
► Those who have [from one to] four outflows of wind, fire, water, and earth within the samādhi of the totality of space are born in [one of] the four levels of the formless [realm].•
► Those who, in addition to those, have [from one to] four outflows of wind, fire, water, and earth within the samādhi of the totality of wind are born in [one of] the four states of noble beings.†
► Those who, additionally, have [from one to] four outflows of wind, fire, water, and earth within the samādhi of the totality of fire are born from Great Result to Flourishing Virtue.‡
► Those who, additionally, have [from one to] four outflows of wind, fire, water, and earth within the samādhi of the totality of water are born from Immeasurable Virtue to Immeasurable Light.§
► Those who, additionally, have [from one to] four outflows of wind, fire, water, and earth within the samādhi of the totality of earth are born from Lesser Light to Brahmā’s Group.•

Thus, we should know that those who have one outflow are born in the Pinnacle of Existence and those who have twenty outflows are born in Brahma s Group. We should also be aware of the details of how the twenty outflows correspond to these twenty other places.
[Birth in these twenty places] also involves [the links of] dependent origination from ignorance (the cause of those outflows) up through the resulting birth. Since this is explained extensively in the lord [Rangjung Dorje’s] Treatise Summarizing the “Foundations of Mindfulness we are
advised to look there.
Ignorance is of two types: fundamental ignorance and compelled ignorance. As for the first: although in the two higher realms there are no actual outflows of body, there are outflows of mind. For instance, in the formless realm the triad of semen, menses, and winds is contained within [the element of] space. Since wind divides semen and menses, there are outflows, such as the outflows of percepts and perceivers. [49] The Stainless Light refers to all those with the phrase “outflows of bindus.” The second [type of ignorance] is the arising of desire, aggression, and confusion from such outflows.†

[50] Although all six [classes of] beings have six dhātus, some—the beings in the negative states, gods, and others—are set apart from [the humans of] three continents in that they are inferior supports for [the practice of] Vajrayāna. The three negative states are places without leisure. The gods, demigods, and those on the northern [continent of] Kuru are also inferior supports for the Vajrayāna. Although in this life they live off [or enjoy] happiness that is the result of virtue done in previous lives, they are deficient in terms of causes, that is, they do not undertake the great remedial powers or engage in causal virtues in this life. Therefore, they are not suitable supports for the prātimokṣha vows.
Furthermore, it is taught that in the three negative states it is rare for beings to give rise to a virtuous state of mind, that they experience only suffering (which is the result of their unvirtuous actions), and that they have no sense of shame or embarrassment. Thus, they are said to be without leisure. The three—the gods and the others—live off [or enjoy] the results of their merit; however, since their minds are distracted by their happiness, they are deficient in terms of causes, [which means that they do not] give rise to the antidotes [for their distraction or negative karma]. It is taught that [the beings in those three higher states] do not have the good fortune [to encounter or practice] the Vajrayāna since the buddhas do not display their twelve deeds there.

Humans with six dhātus who have been born on the three continents (that is, the eastern, southern, and western continents) are the best individuals (supports) because they are suitable candidates [to practice] the Vajrayāna and [keep] the prātimokṣha [vows]. Among those, the ones wellborn in Jambudvīpa are the most excellent individuals (supports) for [the practice of] Vajrayāna because [they live in a land] renowned for being a place of action, meaning that the results of the actions they perform in their present lives will mature in the same lifetime. Therefore, they are capable of being recipients for the instructions that make it possible to become a buddha in one lifetime and in one body. It is in this continent that the buddhas display their twelve deeds.
In the three realms there are thirty-one states of existence: the four formless states, the sixteen levels of the form realm, the six classes of desirous gods, the demigod [state], human [state], and three lower realms. [51] In this regard the Stainless Light says:
The King of Tantras bestows the result of buddhahood on those born as humans. It is not [given] to those born as the five [other] types of beings: gods and others. Why? Because they are not born in places of action.[190]
The seed syllables for each of the three realms, the samādhis of the totalities of the five dhātus, and the specific life spans [in each realm] are taught clearly in the [Kālachakra] King of Tantras and its commentary [the Stainless Light].[191]

This topic concerns a basis of purification [by means] of conviction that is [explained] in the Guhyasamāja.† First, during [the kalpa of] formation, there are twenty intermediate kalpas when the physical worlds evolve. Following that, sentient beings (the inhabitants) begin to devolve, and the way human birth occurs in this place is as follows. At first, all humans take birth spontaneously because they have the latent tendencies of the first kalpa present within their ālaya. Just like the form realm gods of Clear Light, they are endowed with excellences that include physical luminosity, longevity, merit, [52] massive size,[192] and strengths. That is called the “era of completeness.”
Then, during the threefold [era] and the others, [those qualities] gradually decline. The force of being in a land of desire causes internal cravings to develop. Under the sway of those, people develop sense faculties that perceive smells and tastes. The dominant results of those faculties manifest externally as a deliciously fragrant and tasty substance called “creamy earth.” People become attached to that and [continue] to smell and experience it. Their consciousnesses, appearing as objects (the faculties’ dominant results), engage in adopting or rejecting, taking excellent smells and tastes as things to be welcomed and bad ones as things to be avoided. The dhātus of their bodies become coarse and heavy; on the basis of which, they develop male or female organs. Those cause the red and white [dhātus] to develop internally, which in turn produce the sun and moon externally, from which come lightness and darkness. Next, come attachment and aversion: attachment to happiness and aversion to suffering. Those give rise to quarreling, which becomes a fundamental feeling. All those arise from the full-blown power of sensuality alone.•

The four eras are categorized in two ways.• One way is by dividing the enjoyments into four parts:† the complete presence of all [the enjoyments] is designated as [the era of] completeness; when one vanishes, that is the threefold [era]; when two vanish, that is the twofold [era]; and when only one is left, that is [the era of] conflict. The other categorization is that the complete presence of the feet of the ten virtues is [the era of] completeness; when one foot vanishes, that is the threefold [era], and so forth. It is explained that both these modes are bases of purification in the Vajrayāna and that the first set are the four major eras and the latter are the four minor eras.

During the threefold and following eras, [humans] have bodies that are born from a womb. In general, although the body and speech are mental appearances, the power of the full-blown [tendency] to conceive of things as other [makes it necessary to explain that conception begins when] the white and red [dhātus] of the father and mother (which are referents other than oneself) and the gandharva’s mind [join] as appropriated and appropria-tor.† Their bodies, thus conceived in wombs, are a collection of thirty-six quintessence-dhātus and dreg-dhātus, such as the bones.‡ Those [dhātus] develop from the food and drink of the six tastes consumed by one’s mother, ones progenitor. [Her] body’s four elements (earth, water, fire, and wind) serve as conditions for development and increase.§
The six tastes derive from the five elements. Bitterness is produced by the wind dhātu, heat by fire, sweetness by water, and saltiness by earth. Astringency comes from the space dhātu, and sourness from wisdom.• When, along with the four tastes—bitterness and the others, which possess the characteristics of the four elements—the dhātus of space and bliss-wisdom (astringency and sourness) unite in the unification of method and prajñā, the support, the vajra body, is produced. [54]
What are the dhātus that hold [the embryo] in the womb? They are determined to be the following four or five, [described] in terms of their functionalities.† The consciousness that has entered the mothers lotus and mixed with the semen and blood is the seed. It does not fall from that [womb because] the nature [or dynamic quality] of the earth dhātu in the mothers womb holds the consciousness there. The nature of the water dhātu develops its size. The nature of the fire dhātu matures it. The nature of the wind dhātu causes it to grow, and the space dhātu creates the room for each [stage] of growth. Since wisdom empowers [or dominates] all of those, it causes the resultant form, the element-originated body, to appear.‡

There are three sets of five dhātus with those functions. The five connate dhātus are said to be primordially present within the great indestructible bindu as the essences of the five dhātus. In the context of the Pāramitā[yāna], these are the five mental factors that are characterized as being omnipresent. In the early translations, they are the presence of the essences of the five[-colored] lights within the mind, which are taught to be the five families of victorious ones. The perspective of many tantras is that they appear as “winds with five[-colored] light rays.” The lord himself [Rangjung Dorje] teaches that it is justified to refer to these as wisdom embodying the five quintessences. All those [express] the meaning of this point.
The five dhātus of the womb are that the qualities of hardness and solidity, which prevent the semen and blood from falling out, is earth; the quality of wetness is water; the blood is fire; movement is wind; and the cavity is space. The five dhātus of what resides in the womb are the same as the five dhātus of the womb since what resides in the womb is a mixture of semen, blood, and mind.

[As for what causes those to arise:] Because the solidity and hardness of the contact—the union of the father’s bola with the mother’s kakkola— are taken to be “I” and “me,” the latent tendencies for solidity give rise to and increase the earth dhātu of the body.• Since bodhichitta, which is the nature of semen, is taken to be “I” and “me,” the body’s dhātu of water arises. By regarding the rubbing of the pair to be “I” and “me,” the blood increases and heat is produced, giving rise to the fire dhātu. The pair’s movements are taken to be “I” and “me,” thereby giving rise to what is called the wind dhātu.† Since the pair’s bliss is conceived of as “I” and “me,” the space dhātu emerges. By surrounding the consciousness in that way, the five dhātus expand it.‡ Thus, the mind-body collection is produced through the force of the dependent origination in which the condition of ignorance gives rise to the mental formations. That is the dependent relationship [of the five dhātus] with mind.
Those bases of purification, their natures, and [their correspondences with] the purities of the deities are described in detail in the Two-Part [Hevajra Tantra].§ It is said there:
The single great mind is displayed as forms of those five.[196]
The force of the one primary mind being surrounded by the five [sets of] associated mental factors gives rise to the modes of the five elements, both on a grosser level during sexual union and on a subtler level when [mind] engages objects. Those influences also bring about, in the context of the ground, the five supporting skandhas, the five dhātu-elements, the five poisons, and so forth; in the context of the path, the five wisdoms; and in the context of the result, the five kāyas and so on.

The principal cause for entering a womb [that is, for conception] is the ālaya consciousness of the bardo being, known as a gandharva sentient being. It has afflictive mentation with its various latent tendencies. Being of the nature of wind, it is also referred to as the “subtle wind with five[-colored] light rays.”• This [mentation] sees from afar the other forms, meaning its parents in union, but it does not cognize with certainty those referent objects, that is, the specific causes and conditions and the good or bad [qualities of] the womb. It is simply the great life-force wind. It is alone, or what is primary, and its nature is to be confused.
That afflictive mentation—which causes mind to. form objects and is accompanied by its previous latent tendencies—draws the ālaya consciousness along, leading it into the womb.† Among the various latent tendencies within the ālaya, its latent tendency for entering a womb becomes operative. It is that latent tendency that holds the consciousness in the womb. [57] The functions of the five dhātus, which were explained above, aid the fusing of the semen and blood with the consciousness, causing them to change from one [state] to another.
Then, immediately after the womb is entered,[198] the semen and blood of the parents and the bardo consciousness, melted by the fire of great passion, [become] a droplet[199]—they fuse as one, becoming inseparable. There is just the ālaya consciousness with its causal latent tendencies; mentation and the other consciousnesses are unclear and dazed. An example [of this experience] is that it is like being intoxicated by alcohol.

At this point, I will explain a bit about the most important points, which will give us certainty about the bases of purification and the means of purification. In the womb, the amalgamation of the collection of the parents’ semen and blood and the bardo consciousness with its wind is causal Vajra-dhara, who is well known generally throughout the tantras and is the original protector spoken of in the Guhyasamāja [system]. The three faces of Guhyasamāja are the purities of the white, the red, and wind. His six hands manifest by dividing those three—the white, the red, and wind—into two each: method and prajñā, moon and sun.
There are three ways for that collection to become the complete form of the ground-state deity: the extensive way, the intermediate, and the abbreviated.
The extensive way is to generate [ourselves as the deity] by means of the fivefold awakening.

► Awakening occurs through [transforming] the fathers semen into a moon seat, which is of the nature of mirror-like wisdom.
► Awakening occurs through [transforming] the mothers blood into a sun seat, which is of the nature of the wisdom of equality.
► Awakening occurs through [transforming] the bardo consciousness into a seed syllable and emblem, which are of the nature of discriminating wisdom.
► Awakening occurs through [transforming] the white, the red, and consciousness into a fusion in which they are of one taste, which is of the nature of the wisdom that accomplishes all activities.
► Awakening occurs through [transforming] the complete formation of the body into the fully formed kāya [of the deity], which is of the nature of the wisdom of the dharmadhātu.
The intermediate mode is to generate [ourselves as the deity] by means of the four vajras.
► Death and the bardo of becoming are emptiness and awakening.
► When the bardo consciousness has entered into the middle of the white and the red, those become support and supported. They are [transformed into] the coalesced seed syllable.
► The subsequent gradual development of the body is the complete formation of the [deity’s] body.
► When, after taking birth in the outside [world], our faculties engage their objects, that is [the stage when] the letters are placed.
The abbreviated way is to generate [ourselves as the deity through] the threefold vajra ritual. [58]
► The bardo consciousness is the seed syllable.
► [When] it has entered into the middle of the parents’ white and red elements, it is the emblem.
► The subsequent formation of the body is the complete formation of the [deity’s] kāya.

Those topics are clearly described in the Two-Part Hevajra [Tantra].[200] In particular, the Great Commentary, the Stainless Light, states:
The moon, or semen, accompanied by the vowels, is mirror-like wisdom and Vairochana, who generates the skandha of forms.
The sun, or menses, accompanied by the consonants, is the wisdom of equality and Ratnasambhava, who generates the skandha of feelings. The gandharva sentient being with the letter hum is discriminating wisdom and Amitābha, who generates the skandha of discriminations. The unity of those, the life-force wind, with the letter hi, is the wisdom that accomplishes all activities and Amoghasiddhi, who generates the skandha of formative forces. The consciousness with the complete development of all parts of the limbs, accompanied by the letter HAṂ, is the wisdom of the very pure dharmadhātu and Akṣhobhya, who generates the skandha of consciousnesses. That [consciousness] is the embodiment of the five wisdoms externally and internally. The fusion of those is the seed: the anusvāra of the vowels, the visarga of the consonants, the indestructibility of consciousness, and the letter A of the life-force. As thus taught, meditate on the bhagavat Kālachakra as emitting five[-colored] light rays, radiating stainless light. That is the principle of the complete formation of the kāya in the womb and externally.[201]
The Autocommentary discusses [the four ways beings enter the womb] as a supplementary topic.[202]
► Ordinary sentient beings neither remember nor recognize entering the womb, abiding there, or taking birth.
► Worldly chakravartins and transcendent stream-enterers remember and recognize entering the womb, but they are befuddled while abiding there and taking birth. [59]
► Beginning bodhisattvas and pratyekabuddhas remember and recognize entering the womb and taking birth, but they are confused while abiding there.
► Bodhisattvas abiding on the three pure bhūmis remember and recognize all three phases of birth.

As soon as the womb is entered, the afflictive mentation, or great life-force wind, instantly develops, becoming increasingly coarse. The triad of the white, the red, and wind, with their accompanying four elements, and the karmic winds increase moment by moment. Like milk becoming yogurt, the kalala is stirred, coalesces, increases,[204] is preserved, and develops. The phases [of embryonic development] change from one to another.•
[This development of the embryo correlates] in the context of the ground, to afflictive formative mentation arising from the ālaya consciousness. In the context of the phases of the path and result, it is the significance of the Guhyasamāja’s statement:
The Original Protector becomes Dveṣhavajra with three faces.[205]

During the first week following conception, the life-force wind agitates and coalesces [the mixture of white dhātu, red dhātu, and mind], causing the kalala to form. During the second week, the wind called “all-gathering” agitates and coalesces, causing the arbuda to form. During the third week, the wind called “treasury” agitates and coalesces, causing the peshī to form. During the fourth week, the wind called “fully dividing” agitates and gathers, causing the ghana to form. In that way, for four weeks, four karmic winds agitate what abides in the womb [the embryo], causing the expulsion of its dregs and the coalescence of its quintessences.

During the fifth week, the wind called “coalescing” expels and coalesces, causing the prashākha to form. On the first day of prashākha (which is the twenty-ninth day in the womb), the life-force wind drives the white upward and the red downward. This forms the madhyamā channel containing the great life-force wind, with the white bindu at its upper end and the red bindu at its lower end. It measures twelve and a half of its own finger-widths, that is, of [the fingerless embryo] abiding in the womb. One end connects to the mothers rasanā channel.
Following the formation of the madhyamā channel (the support for the life-force wind), during this second month, two hundred channels form each day. The first—[the heart and navel channels]—are generated from that madhyamā with its life-force wind. The heart chakra develops as the support for the ten winds (the five root and five secondary). The navel chakra forms as the support for the sixty-four daṇḍas, as well as the lagnas and so forth. These channels are very subtle, just a hair’s width in size.• This is like the fish manifestation.†
As for what facilitates growth: since one channel at the navel is connected to the mother’s rasanā channel,[206] the potencies of the mothers winds and blood cause [the embryo] to grow and develop. Then, following the formation of the madhyamā, starting in the second month [when] the subtle channels of those two chakras develop, two hundred channels form each day for twelve months.

When that [fetus] abiding in the womb reaches its sixth month, the power of the nāga wind (which is of the nature of wisdom) develops. On the basis of that, the eyes (which are of the nature of the earth dhātu) are generated as the essence of Mohavajra. This is from the perspective of wisdom as method and earth as prajñā.†
Next, when the seventh month is reached, the tortoise wind (which is of the nature of the wind dhātu) radiates. On the basis of that, the ears (which are of the nature of the water dhātu) are generated as the essence of Dveṣhavajra, and the auditory canals are formed. Here wind is method and water is prajñā.[212]
When the eighth month is reached, the lizard wind (which is of the nature of the fire dhātu) radiates, causing the nostril openings (which are of the nature of the wind dhātu) to be generated as the essence of Mātsaryavajra. Here fire is method, wind is prajñā.
When the ninth month is reached, the devadatta wind (which is of the nature of the water dhātu) arises and radiates, which causes the tongue (which perceives tastes and is of the nature of the fire dhātu) to be generated as the essence of Rāgavajra. Here water is method, fire is prajñā.[213]
When the tenth month is reached, the power of the dhanaṃjaya wind (which is of the nature of the earth dhātu) is generated and radiates, which causes the bodily faculty (which is of the nature of the wind dhātu) to be generated as the essence of Īrṣhyāvajra. Here earth is method, wind is prajñā.
Since this presentation accords with the Guhyasamāja [system], it is slightly different from that of the Kālachakra.• Nevertheless, their meaning is the same. The Stainless Light teaches how those [faculties] apprehend their objects.[214] The eyes apprehend forms, which have the property of water. The ears apprehend sounds, which have the property of space. The nose apprehends smells, which have the property of earth. The tongue apprehends tastes, which have the property of fire. The body apprehends tangible objects, which have the property of wind.
Since the ten winds are generated and increase in each month, by the tenth month the energies of the ten winds are complete. [65]

Thus, the five skandhas, eighteen dhātus, and twelve āyatanas are complete. When the two hundred channels that form each day are added together, there are six thousand channels that develop each month, making fifty-four thousand channels that form during the nine months that the fetus is in the womb. Since the channels continue to form during the following three postnatal months, the seventy-two thousand channels are complete by the end of twelve months.
It is taught that as soon as the channels finish developing, two atrophy each day. The intended meaning of that statement is that their functionality deteriorates, not that they completely atrophy, because it is also taught that as long as the body is developing its physical strength, some subtle channels continue to form, and that the thirty-five million channels connected to the body hairs continue to develop.
Since the fetus’s tongue has not formed during the eighth month, up to that point the fetus receives the quintessences of his or her mother’s food from her rasanā channel.• When the tongue develops during the ninth month, the fetus consumes the womb’s impurities as food. Eating such impurities produces the internal dreg-dhātus (such as urine). [66] Physical and mental feelings, which are of the nature of wind, cause the fetus to be aware of his or her hunger and thirst, which in turn create physical and mental experiences of being tormented by intense suffering.

From this point on, the fetus’s perception of the experience of being [in the womb] changes. During the ninth month, seeing [the womb as] unpleasant, suffering, unclean, foul-smelling, dark, and narrow, the fetus wishes to take birth. When that happens, the wind that will discharge the fetus from the womb reverses the head and feet and initiates the process of birth through the door of the womb. It is said that the strength of the discharging wind determines whether birth is easy or difficult.
Here the explanations accord with the teachings found in the profound tantras.† The common explanation can be understood by referring to such texts as the Sūtra That Teaches Nanda about Entering the Womb.‡
Following the complete formation of the body in the womb, the tearing of the womb’s enclosure and birth outside is the man-lion state, or avatāra.

As for the ten avatāras of Vishnu, the Abridged [Kālachakra] Tantra states:
Fish, tortoise, boar, man-lion, dwarf, the two Rāmas,
Kṛiṣhṇa, Buddha, and Narendra are the ten manifestations.[216]
As is extensively explained there and elsewhere, [Vishnu’s ten avatāras] are found in the stories of the Vedas. Here, in order to lead non-Buddhists [to the Buddhist path], the vajra of mind is labeled “Vishnu” and is taught to be the creator of the environment and beings. [Vishnu’s] ten avatāras are correlated to the body in the following way.
1. The period from conception through the second month is the fish state since the fetus has the manifestation of a rohita fish. [67]
2. The next two months [that is, the third and fourth] are the tortoise state since the development of the protrusions of the head and four limbs cause the fetus to look like a tortoise.
3. [The remaining months] prior to birth are the boar state since the fetus’s consumption of the mother’s quintessences creates feces and urine.
4. The day of birth is the man-lion state since the fetus “tears open the belly” with its hands.
5. The period after birth until the growth of teeth is the dwarf state since [the child resembles] a cripple.[217]
6. From then until the [baby] teeth fall out is the state of Rama of the Axe since the teeth resemble axes.
7. The time from when the teeth fall out to the age of sixteen is the flowering Rama state since it is when the body’s quintessences are flowering.
8. From then to when white hairs appear is the Kṛiṣhṇa state since it is a period of wickedness and deceit.
9. The time remaining until death is the state of Buddha since it is when one gives moral advice to one’s family (children, grandchildren, and others).
10. The day of death is the kalki state since it is when the dhātus merge together.

To summarize, “body” is a word denoting a collection. It is composed of what are called the “six treasures”: marrow, bones, and tendons and ligaments, or body hairs, originating from semen; and skin, flesh, and blood originating from menses.[218] And it is the thirty-sixfold collection of skan-dhas and dhātus. That is the vajra body. The thirty-six are as follows.
► The six skandhas: forms, feelings, discriminations, formative forces, consciousnesses, and wisdom.
► The six dhātus: earth, water, fire, wind, space, and consciousness.
► The six faculties: visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, bodily, and mental.
► The six objects: forms, sounds, smells, tastes, tangible objects, and phenomena.
► The six faculties of action: the mouth, arms, legs, anal tract, urinary tract, and the faculty where semen [that is, sexual fluid] descends.
► The six functions of the faculties of action: speaking, taking, walking, releasing feces, releasing urine, and releasing semen.

[68] Beings’ coarse skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas, and everything produced by their subtle channels, winds, and bindus, manifest from the stained mind’s very thusness, the luminosity of its causal continuum—they do not manifest from external particles or the like because everything is an appearance of mind.•
Once the body develops, birth occurs. In the Vajrayāna, one of the principles taught is that birth is the nirmāṇakāya; therefore, birth is the ground-state nirmāṇakāya with stains. Since the nirmāṇakāya arises from the dharmadhātu, the mother’s bhaga, or source of dharmas, is the dharmadhatu. The ten months are the ten bhūmis. The mother is [her child’s] preceptor. The amnion is the dharma robe. The sound of A-HAṂ is mantra recitation. The bath given after birth and so forth are the seven empowerments in the pattern of childhood. The nature of mind during the four states is the four kāyas. That nature is continuous and unchanging throughout the phases of the ground, path, and fruition. It is said [in the Vajra Peak]:
Tantra is a “continuity.”
Saṃsāra is said to be a tantra.[219]
For the scriptural sources of such statements, we should refer to the Abridged [Kālachakra] Tantra,[220]Two-Part [Hevajra Tantra],† and Vajra Garland.[221]
Now, since we have not realized the abiding mode and are confused about the appearing mode, we have a saṃsāric body. Once we know that [our body] is the rūpakāya of the stained mind, we can understand how the mere absence of stains allows supreme nirmāṇa[kāyas] to radiate.

This chapter will discuss the abiding state of the subtle body’s channels, which are present within the coarse body. [This topic] is presented next for the following reasons. As [chapter 2] just explained, the body is produced from the channels, winds, and bindus. To be able to use the channels as a path, we must understand the systematic presentation of the channels. If we do not understand how the channels abide in the body, we will not understand the locations of the winds and bindus. The realization of the dhātu, or potential, of the vajra body depends upon understanding the suchness of its channels. The tantras of method and prajñā teach that the dawning of wisdom in the mind depends upon the activities of the body’s channels.

It is the next explanation, that is, it follows the discussion of the way the body develops. What will be taught? The way the channels are in the body is what will be explained. [70] How will this be presented? I will discuss the madhyamā channel and its scriptural source; the rasanā and lalanā, also with their scriptural source; the specific [enumerations] of twenty-four, thirty-two, and thirty-seven principal channels; the four, six, and eighteen chakras; the chakras of the minor joints; and the channels that produce illnesses. I will present the seventy-two thousand channels, with reference to the Vajra Garland, and discuss the way the even more subtle thirty-five million channels spread throughout [the body] reaching the body hairs. The word “also” means this will include other presentations, such as which dhātus produce which channels. Thus it is said.[222]

In the beginning, the basis for the body’s development 3.6
is the madhyamā with the life-force wind.
It goes through the middle of the six chakras,
which are spaced twelve and one-half of one’s own finger-widths apart.
It extends from the secret [place] to the crown of the head.
Its upper end is blocked by the quintessence of the white element,
which is of the nature of HAṂ.
At the navel is the red element, blood
received from one’s mother, described as “the short A.”
Between those two lies the support for the ālaya:
the life-force wind, like space. [71]
Below the navel, this [channel] is called “shaṅkhinī”
since it causes the white elements to descend.

In the beginning, the basis for the development of the vajra body—which comprises the coarse skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas, and the subtle channels and so forth—is the madhyamā channel. The madhyamā (which was described in the previous chapter on the development of the body), with the life-force wind, goes straight through the middle of the six chakras, from the chakra in the uṣhṇīṣha to the one in the secret place. The six chakras are spaced twelve and one-half (which is to say, thirteen less one-half) of one’s own finger-widths apart.
The bottom end of the madhyamā channel lies at the secret place, and its upper end reaches the crown of the head. Its upper end is blocked by the quintessence of the white element, which is received from one’s father, is of the nature of HAṂ, has the shape of an upside-down HAṂ, and is the size of a white mustard seed. At its lower end below the navel, there is the quintessence of the red element, which is the nature of blood, and is the bindu received from one’s mother, and is described as “having the shape of the short A.” Between those two—that is, between A and HAṂ—lies the support for the ālaya [consciousness]: the great life-force wind, which fills [the madhyamā channel] and is like space in that its color is the absence of color.
Below the navel—that is, below the juncture of the three channels—the madhyamā is called “shankhinī” because it causes the streams of the white elements throughout the channels to flow together and descend, arousing connate bliss. The Hevajra Tantra says:
The one described as where prajñā-moons descend is renowned as “avadhūti.”[224]

The Saṃvarodaya, Sampuṭa,[226] and Kṛiṣhṇa’s Vasantatilaka[227] describe the madhyamā channel as follows. It goes through the middle of the channels at the heart, which are like the petals of the water-born one [that is, a lotus flower]. Like the flower-clusters of plantain trees, it is transparent and empty inside since the white and red [bindus] do not move [within it].• At its upper end a HAṂ is suspended and faces downward. Its lower end is adorned with a short A, which resembles a sesame-oil fire. Below that, this channel, where bodhichittas from all the channels flow together, is called “avadhūti.” It confers connate joy.†

To summarize briefly, it is inseparable from the life-force channel of corporeal beings.• Here, in the context of identifying the madhyamā channel, some assert that there are two: a madhyamā of meditation and the residing madhyamā. The former is within the sphere of experience of yogins’ and yoginīs’ samādhi. The latter resides within the body from birth until death, when it vanishes. Others say that the madhyamā is the spinal cord, or that it lies within the spinal cord with the diameter of a horses tail hair. There are those who say that, in fact, it does not exist. Since such assertions do not accord with the scriptural tantras that are deemed immaculate through the three analyses, they are personal fabrications, according to the exalted seventh [Karmapa, Chödrak Gyatso,] and his followers. [73]
The heart of the omniscient Rangjung Dorje’s assertions regarding the madhyamā is as follows.[228] The madhyamā abides in the center of the body, and, being devoid of the duality of percept and perceiver, it is the inseparability of method and prajñā. It is adorned by six chakras of channels. In the center of the head, it is graced by a HAṂ and, at the juncture of the three channels below the navel, by an A stroke. Above, it is symbolized by the opening of Brahma and the middle eye of wrathful ones. Below, it rests at the tip of the vajra’s jewel in men and the lotus’s pistils in women.
Above the navel, the madhyamā is filled with winds. Below the navel, from the juncture of the three channels down, it is filled with moon-bodhi-chittas, which are of the nature of prajñā consorts. Therefore, when the Kālachakra says, “Above it is Rāhu and below Kālāgni,”[229] it is referring to its beginning and end. As for the madhyamā s functions: Since its lower end causes the bodhichittas to descend and bestows connate bliss, it is known as avadhūti. Above, between the A and HAṂ, there abides the Rāhu wind, or life-force wind, of corporeal beings. Because, in actuality, all the karmic and wisdom winds are based on this madhyamā channel, it is the life-force channel, which enables corporeal beings to abide [or be alive].

The ālaya wisdom is the root of all wisdoms, and the ālaya consciousness is the root of all consciousnesses. Thus, ordinary mind (in which those two are not separate) is referred to as sugatagarbha from the perspective that ordinary mind serves as the cause for buddhahood. In the same way, since the madhyamā is the root of all wisdom channels, and the life-force channel is the root of all saṃsāric channels, it is suitable to refer to the Rāhu channel (which is the inseparability of those two) as the life-force channel from the perspective that the Rāhu channel supports the life-force. Since the indestructible wind is the root of all wisdom winds, and the great life-force wind is the root of all karmic winds, it is reasonable to refer to the Rāhu wind (in which those two are mixed, like water and milk) as the life-force wind from the perspective that the Rāhu wind sustains the life-force.
At the time of the ground, the madhyamā channel and the life-force channel are indivisible. By meditating on the path that penetrates the vital points, at the time of the result, the channels are purified, and there is only the madhyamā. [This description] is like the life-force and heart of the dharma terminology of the definitive meaning.[230] [74]
The madhyamā has numerous synonyms, such as “avadhūti” or “allshaking,” “subtle form,” “sumanā,”[231] “single inner tree,” and “Brahmā’s staff.”• The eighth lord, Mikyö Dorje, and his followers present the madhyamā in terms of ground, path, and result.[232]
► The ground madhyamā channel: it is taught that the madhyamā channel, or life-force channel, in the impure body is pervaded by the potentiality, cause, or dhātu of the pure, fruitional madhyamā.
► The path madhyamā channel: By meditating on withdrawal and so forth, wind-mind enters the door of the inner madhyamā to some degree, resulting in external manifestations resembling forms of emptiness. It is called “the channel of time” and “rekhā” (which in Tibetan means ri mo, “line”), [the latter] being a black line that radiates stainless light and is about the thickness of a hair.•
► The resultant madhyamā channel abides within the supreme vajra body, which is “other” and whose nature is free from obscurations.

The rasanā on the right and the lalanā on the left diverge four finger-widths below the navel; that is, they split off from where they were joined below the navel. They connect with the major channels at the kidneys. Then they converge again briefly at the heart, connecting with piṅgalā on the right and iḍā on the left.• They continue past the major channels at the armpits, the heart channels called “sweat gatherers,”[234] and converge at the throat. Passing by “minor extremities,” they go below the ears and arrive at the brain, called the “channel of the tree.” They meet at the crown (the opening of Brahma), thereby pervading all the doors of the sense faculties. Separately, their upper ends arrive at the nostrils.
Below [the navel], the three channels come together, then split. It is taught that the lower end of the rasanā on the right performs the functions of expelling and retaining menstrual blood in women and feces in both men and women. The lower end of the lalanā on the left expels and retains urine in both men and women. This is stated in the Hevajra Tantra:
Akṣhobhya passes through lalanā.
Blood flows through rasanā.[235]
Above and at the navel, the solar and lunar winds move through the rasanā and lalanā [respectively]. At the navel, the three channels are fused internally. Then, they branch into the sixty-four lagna channels. Alternatively, [these are enumerated as] seventy-two channels of the surrounding lagnas, which are the thirty-six related to the skandhas and thirty-six related to the dhātus.• The winds moving within those generate and renew other winds, from those that move through the external upper and lower doors to the internal great life-force wind.

Tht Ādibuddha describes these [three] as follows: 3.42
“They have three ends below, and, similarly, three ends above.
Rāhu’s end is in the middle.
The sun’s end is on the right.
The moon’s end is on the left.
Water, fire, and space move within them.”[236]
Through their right, left, and middle lower ends,
feces, urine, and semen pass.
These channels, which are like iron chain links,
are the three paths for the life-force and things expelled downward.

The three principal channels have three [separate] channel ends below through which feces, urine, and semen descend. Similarly, they have three [separate] ends above. As for their three ends: the end of Rāhu (the madhyamā) is in the middle. The end of the sun (the rasanā) is on the right. The end of the moon (the lalanā) is on the left. Water winds move within the lalanā, fire winds within the rasanā, and space winds within the madhyamā.
Through their right, left, and middle lower ends, feces, urine, and semen pass, respectively. At the center of each chakra, the channels knot and diverge, like iron chain links. Above the navel, the three channels are the paths for the three life-forces: the sun, moon, and Rāhu. Below the navel, they are the paths for the three things that are expelled downward: feces, urine, and semen.

The twenty-four major channels, which are the twenty-four sacred places, split off from those three principal channels. Externally, they are the twenty-four major sacred places. As “other,” they are of the natures of the yoginīs of the body, speech, and mind chakras. Adding to those the five heart channels that support the secondary winds• and the three principal channels makes thirty-two channels. Those are taught in the Sampuṭa,[237] Among those thirty-two, [two are related to] the sixteenth lunar digit with its two phases of waxing and waning. Since the shaṅkhinī (the lower end of the madhyamā) increases bliss, it accords with the waxing phase. Since the white elements are drawn upward through “māra-free,”† it accords with the waning phase. Excluding those two leaves thirty, which are divided into [the ones related to] the fifteen lunar digits of the waxing lunar days and [those related to] the fifteen lunar digits of the waning lunar days. Their purities are the natures of the fifteen goddesses of Nairātmyā. In addition to the thirty-two channels, there are the five channels supporting the five root winds. Including them makes thirty-seven. Those are the thirty-seven principal channels.
The natures of the supports for the five root winds are as follows.‡
► Below the navel, the shaṅkhinī channel is where the downward-expelling wind, the wisdom dhātu, settles.
► Above the navel, the sumanā channel is the support for the life-force wind, the space dhātu.•
► In the heart, the rohiṇī channel at the front [the east] is where the fire-coinciding wind moves.
► In the heart, hastijihvā in Agni’s direction [the southeast] is the support for the upward-moving wind.
► In the heart, piṅgalā to the south [the right] is the support for the pervading wind.
[These thirty-seven channels correspond] in terms of the ground, to the thirty-six skandha-dhātus,† and to the thirty-seventh: vajra mind, the inconceivable pervader. In terms of the path, they are the thirty-seven qualities concordant with awakening. In terms of the result, they are the thirty-seven resultant qualities concordant with awakening. [78]

Fourteen channels originate as parts of the lalanā, which is the left one of the three [principal] channels.
1. “Indivisible,”[239] thus called because it is the indivisibility of the three vajras, is the channel that resides at the bregma. [79]
2. “Subtle form”—referred to as such because it produces subtle thoughts, because it gives rise to what is very subtle, or because its divisions, such as the tips of the hair, are included within matter— is the channel connected to the crown of the head.
3. “Charming,” or “joy,” known that way because it creates joy or because it is pleasing, is the channel located in the right ear.
4. “Left,” called that because it supports the left side, is the channel at the nape of the neck.
5. “Dwarf,” referred to as such because it is round, is the channel residing in the left ear.
6. “Turtle born”—known as turtle born because it resembles the shape of a turtle—is the channel located in the middle of the eyebrows.
7. “Meditation,” thus called because they meditate on [or habituate one to] existence, are the channels residing outside the eyes.
8. “Empowering,” referred to in that way because they bestow empowerments, are the channels in the shoulders.
9. “Defects,” or “night-possessing,” thus called because they eliminate the mental afflictions, are the channels in the armpits.
10. “Engaging,” or “great excrement,” known as such because they protect the body, are the channels in the breasts.
11. “Mother,” thus called because it serves to produce, is the channel at the navel.
12. “Shavari,” called that because it goes everywhere, is the channel that enters the tip of the nose.
13. “Cooling,” referred to as such because it pacifies, is the channel that is located around the edges of the mouth.
14. “Hot,” or “heat,” known that way because it promotes warmth, is the channel that resides in the middle of the throat.
These channels cause the descent of the lunar dhātus, which are of the nature of prajñā. They are based on the lalanā. In terms of mind, they are of the nature of prajñā, and, in terms of body, they are method. They are the purities of the waxing phase of the moon.•

1. “Threefold,” referred to as such because it engages with three aspects, connects the center of the heart to the eyes. It is the channel through which forms flow and winds move.†
2. “Desire,” thus called because it possesses all desirable qualities, connects the center of the heart to the ears. It is the channel through which sounds flow and winds move.
3. “House-mistress,” known as such because it is ruler of the house, connects the center of the heart to the nose. It is the channel through which smells flow and winds moves.
4. “Chaṇḍikā,” referred to in that way because it engages in fierce activity, connects the center of the heart to the tongue. It is the channel through which tastes flow and winds move.
The faculties appear from those channels, the winds moving within those channels, and the bindus accompanying those channels and winds.•
5. “Māra-free is called that because it destroys māras. One of its ends goes from the heart center to the middle of the uvula, which causes white dhātus to flow upward. Its other end pervades the upper and lower parts of the body, causing tactile sensations to flow as another of its functions.†
Here, in the context of discussing the five hidden channels, it is taught that the five hidden channels are perfectly situated in the center of the body’s heart. The upper end [or section] of the avadhūti is where the life-force wind moves. The other [channels] are where the four root winds move.[242] [82] The lower end [or section] of the avadhūti is the location of the downward-expelling wind. Hastijihvā is the location of the upward-moving wind. Piṇgalā is the location of the pervading wind. Rohiṇī is the location for the fire-coinciding wind.

The hidden channels are identified and explained in a variety of ways. The explanation according to the seventh omniscient one [Chödrak Gyatso], following the exalted [fifth Karmapa] Deshin Shekpa, is as follows. Only the five channels through which the five root winds move are the five hidden channels. The meaning of “hidden” is twofold: these five channels are hidden in both the Chakrasaṃvara and Hevajra [systems], although they are elucidated in the Kālachakra;[243] and their activities are hidden. Thus, they are described as hidden from two perspectives. Although the Hevajra [system] states that there are thirty-seven principal channels,[244] it does not clearly identify the five channel petals through which the root winds move. Since they are taught in a hidden fashion in the Hevajra [system], the phrase “five hidden channels” occurs in many Hevajra commentaries.

Here, the root text—beginning “The four channels called ‘threefold’...” and ending “The others are places where the root winds move”—combines the ten channel petals and presents them as the five hidden channels. This is not delineated in a clear manner. Later [in chapter 5], the explanation that begins “specifically [the five channels of the heart] ...” is a statement with a specific meaning.[245] Thus [Chödrak Gyatso] taught.
[The presentation of the five hidden channels in this section] accords with the explanations found in the Sakyapa’s commentaries on the [Immaculate Ornament::] Eulogy to Nairātmyā[246] and with [the writings of] Gyalwa Yang Gönpa.[247] Dak Rampa remarks:[248]
To refer to the supports for the secondary winds as hidden channels is a categorization made from the perspective of excellent qualities. To refer to the supports for the five root winds as hidden channels is a categorization made from the perspective of the five dhātus.•
The exalted Könchok Yenlak states:
The ten channels connected to the madhyamā are said to be hidden channels. The meaning is that they arise from the indestructible luminosity at the heart and engage objects, such as forms.
In the context of the path, when their functions are bound, they are the channels through which the ten signs manifest. Thus, “hidden” means to be like a hidden seed or treasure. [83] The presentation of them as five, even though they are ten, is similar to [the way that a tree whose leaves grow in whorls of seven is] called a “seven-leaved tree.”[249]
Such explanations accord with the teachings of Tsurphu Jamyang Chenpo and others.

Next, following the explanation of the principal channels, the channels in the chakras are described. There are the four chakras: navel, heart, throat, and head. When, in addition to those, the secret and uṣhṇīṣha chakras are included, there are six. When the twelve chakras at the major joints are added, there are eighteen. “And more” refers to the sixty chakras in the minor joints. The classifications of the channel chakras will be explained below according to the tantras and their commentaries.
Here, [other commentaries] explain the meaning of the term “chakras of channels.”[250] Chakras are called that because the overall shape of the petals resembles a chakra [that is, a wheel]. Alternatively, they are referred to as “chakras” since they have qualities similar to that of the function of chakras [that is, circular weapons], which is to annihilate negative circumstances. When the chakras’ vital points have been penetrated by binding them, the delusions present in the four states are annihilated.•

[The configuration of the navel channels is called nirmāṇachakra, or emanation chakra,] because, being located at the navel, it emanates (nirmāṇa), or produces, the body, and because the [overall] shape [formed by] its channels resembles a chakra. Alternatively, [this configuration is so called] because, when the vital points of those channels are penetrated, the waking state manifests as the realization of the nirmāṇakāya, and the discordant aspects (the factors to be abandoned) are destroyed [which is their chakra-as-weapon-like quality].
[The nirmāṇachakra] has four channel petals that diverge from the madhyamā; they are empty and are the wisdom dhātu.• Each of those divides into three, forming the twelve channels where the twelve major saṃkrāntis flow in sequence. Each of those twelve splits into five, which are where the minor saṃkrāntis flow in sequence. Among those sixty, the thirty channels on the right are connected to the rasanā and are the supports for the [minor] saṃkrāntis of the even lagnas, Taurus and the others.
The thirty channels on the left are connected to the lalanā and are the supports for the saṃkrāntis of the odd lagnas, Aries and the others. The four empty channels are the supports for the saṃkrāntis of the madhyamā.

Here my guru Lhalungpa taught that the even houses are on the right and the odd are on the left from the perspective of grouping every two [of the twelve] channels into pairs. For example, the channel directly in front is the channel of the odd house of Aries, and to its right is the channel of the even house of Taurus. He said that this arrangement is convenient during the dissolution process and so forth.

The sixty terminal petals are supported on [or by] the twelve major saṃkrāntis, or lagnas. Their names are as follows.
► As for the names of the five petals that are the supports for the saṃkrāntis of the Aries lagnas, since they possess true strength, they are called “great strength,” “great inexhaustibility,” “great beauty,” “great frontal birth,” and “provision-sign.”
► The names of the five channels of the Taurus lagna are “provision-part,” “provision-water,” “provision-intoxication,” “provisions,” and “concordant causes of provisions.”
► The names of the five channels of the Gemini lagna are “provision-moisture,” “provision-holder,” “rough,” “saliva,” and “elephant.”
► The names of the five channels of the Cancer lagna are “uneasy breath,” “rusted,” “bird limb,” “raptor face,”[252] and “potbelly.”
► The names of the five channels of the Leo lagna are “forceful,” “resounding,” “scented,” “striking,” and “discipline.”
► The names of the five channels of the Virgo lagna are “melody,” “melodious,” “cloud,” “higher tendons,” and “sealed dedication.” [87]
► The names of the five channels of the Libra lagna are “primary trice,” “trice born,” “back facing,” “staff,” and “smooth staff.”
► The names of the five channels of the Scorpio lagna are “ancient,” “joint-god,” “joint of joints,” “joint-measure,” and “discipline.”
► The names of the five channels of the Sagittarius lagna are “joint-abode,” “joint-face,” “joint-light,” “joint-chains,” and “tamer.”
► The names of the five channels of the Capricorn lagna are “tamed,” “majestic,” “stainless taming,” “conceited,” and “edible tassel.”
► The names of the five channels of the Aquarius lagna are “passionate passion,” “tassel,” “half tassel,” “bee,” and “children bestower.”
► The names of the five channels of the Pisces lagna are “migrator,” “leaf,” “leaf throat,” “supreme,” and “pellucid.”
The navel chakra has sixty-four petals: sixty terminal petals and four root petals.
Another way that [the petals] are correlated [to the twelve houses] is that the thirty petals from “great strength” to “sealed dedication” are the six odd lagnas (Aries and the others). [The thirty channels] from “[primary] trice” to “pellucid” are the six even lagnas (Taurus and the others).• However, the first presentation is considered to be better because it portrays the arising of the internal [twelve lagnas] according to the unerring arising of the twelve external lagnas.

The names of the eight petals are as follows. “Ratna crown,” “great padma,” “great vajra,” and “great strength” are known as such because they belong, respectively, to the ratna, padma, vajra, and karma families. Since [their names] mean that they have the powers of those [families], they are aspects of method and prajñā. “Great protector” is called that since, by apprehending forms, it sees their appearances. “Great sound” is referred to in that way because it apprehends sounds. “Great joy” is so called because it enjoys smells. “Great intoxication” is known as such since, by apprehending tastes, it is intoxicated with them. These [names] are presented in the Vajra Garland.•
The parts of this chakra—with its eight petals and upper and lower ends—pervade the entire body, that is, both its upper and lower areas.†

There are thirty-two petals at the head. The names of the inner sixteen are as follows.

The names of the outer sixteen are as follows. The [first] fifteen are “sun” possessor; “tasty”;[257] “long chin”; “beer bestower”; “amṛita”; “conch holder”; “conch ear”; “conch eye”; “conch nose”; “provisions”; “powerful provisions”; [91] “desirous”; “victorious-over-provisions”; “marvelous provisions”; and “smooth.” They are the [fifteen] digits of the dark phase when the moon wanes. “Joint supporting” is the sixteenth digit, the digit of the madhyamā.
In the Guhyasamāja, Chakrasaṃvara, and other systems, it is taught that the head chakra has thirty-two petals. Therefore, this treatise presents the petals in the head as being thirty-two in accordance with the teachings given in the Vajra Garland. It is a presentation in which method and prajñā are classified [or counted] separately.•

This tantra presents the six chakras as the following: the four chakras (presented above), to which are added a wind-dhātu chakra with six petals in the uṣhṇīṣha and a fire-dhātu chakra with three petals in the uṣhṇīṣha’s throat. Because its nature is that which produces a buddha’s uṣhṇīṣha, the wind chakra is referred to as the “uṣhṇīṣha [chakra],” even though now it resides at the point between the eyebrows. In those two chakras—the one called “uṣhṇīṣha” and the one called “the chakra at its throat”—there are a total of nine channel petals since they have, respectively, six petals and three.• [92]

The way the underlying thoughts of the Kālachakra’s teaching and the preceding explanation are compatible is as follows. The Kālachakra teaches that there are four channels in the secrets jewel [or pistils] and that at its base are the three channels that expel and retain feces, urine, and semen. These seven channels are at the secret place. The madhyamā is [counted as] two in that its retention of winds and retention of semen are classified separately.• [93] Those are the nine channels delineated by the Kālachakra. Thus, the aforementioned explanation [in the Vajra Garland] of nine petals in the two [uṣhṇīṣha] chakras is compatible with this explanation in the Kālachakra. [The latter also] states that at the base of those [nine], there are thirty-two petals in the chakra at the secret place, which is the same number of [petals] as are found in the head chakra.
Accordingly, the thoughts of these two tantras are not contradictory. The Vajra Garland'’s teaching that the seven channels are above [reflects the fact that] its underlying thought is concerned with their body facet, which is method and the space dhātu. The Kālachakra’s teaching that they are below [reflects the fact that] its underlying thought is concerned with their mind facet, which is prajñā and the wisdom dhātu.•

Generally speaking, the Kālachakra teaches that the number [of petals] in the chakras are as follows.†
► The four petals in the uṣhṇīṣha [chakra] are of the natures of the four major periods.
► The sixteen petals in the head [chakra] are of the natures of the sixteen lunar days.
► [The thirty-two petals] in the throat [chakra] are of the natures of the twenty-eight lunar mansions.•
► The eight [petals] in the heart [chakra] are of the natures of the eight planets.
► The sixty-four [petals] in the navel [chakra] are of the natures of the [sixty-four] daṇḍas.
► The thirty-two [petals] in the secret [chakra] are of the natures of the thirty-two dhātus [such as] semen and menses.

Alternatively, being [a summation of] the statements with specific intentions found in all the tantras,† the Commentaries by Bodhisattvas discuss the six—“ten million,” “swirling,” “inexhaustible,” “good name,” “support,” and “qualified”—with the thought that they are six channels residing in the center of those six chakras.‡ “Ten million” is between the eyebrows; “swirling” is at the head; “inexhaustible” is in the center of the throat; “good name” is in the center of the heart; “support” is in the center of the navel; and “qualified” is at the secret place. They are considered to be “the channels of the six emptinesses” taught in the Kālachakra.
[Among] the channels of the six emptinesses, [those of] the four root chakras are also taught to be the purities of the four doors of the speech maṇḍala because these chakras are the locations for the life-force and the other winds.•

[The configuration of the major joint chakras in the left arm] is similar to the right arm: in the left arm’s three major joints, which are the water dhātu, there are three chakras [generated by] the fire dhātu.[259] In the right leg’s three major joints (hip, knee, and ankle), which are the fire dhātu, there are three chakras [generated by] the water dhātu.

How many channels produce physical illnesses? The four channels outside the uṣhṇīṣha chakra and the sixteen outside the forehead (or head) chakra (totaling twenty) create phlegm-related illnesses. Because phlegm is of the nature of water, although it resides in the upper part of the body, it falls to the lower parts, where it causes illnesses in the waist and related areas.
The thirty-two channels in the throat and the eight in the heart (forty altogether) produce bile-related illnesses. Bile resides in the middle [section of the body]. However, when combined with the sun, it assists burning, and, when combined with the moon, it assists cooling. It, therefore, causes illnesses throughout the upper and lower areas of the body.•
The sixty-four channels in the navel and the sixteen outer channels of the secret [chakras] two layers (which combined make eighty) cause the illnesses that are disturbances of the wind dhātus. Wind abides in the lower parts of the body, but because its nature is wind, it gives rise to illnesses in the upper areas.
The secret [chakra’s] inner layer of sixteen channels produces the complex illnesses. Although the complexes [of humors] are located in the lower parts of the body, because they combine all three, and these channels’ ends pervade [the whole body], they produce illnesses throughout the upper, lower, and middle sections of the body. Those are the 156 illness-producing petals.

The channels that produce illnesses are outside the 156 petals of the six chakras; they are another [set of] channel petals through which dhātus move.
There are others—some Kālachakra practitioners and skilled exorcists— who say that the illness-producing channels are the channel petals of the chakras themselves. [97] However, [that cannot be the case]. Since the quintessences abide in the actual chakras, when the vital points of those [chakras] are penetrated, wisdom increases and hindrances are prevented. Such people are not aware of the differences between the illness-producing channels of the outer sections and the chakras [themselves]. The glorious Rangjung Dorje’s explanation [that the illness-producing channels are not part of the actual chakras] is excellent.[261]

They resemble branches, leaves, and petals emerging from one trunk.
Since those seventy-two thousand channels belonging to one of the aforementioned three types are located in the body (which is a basis for their categorization), they are also [classified as follows]. The twenty-four channels—from “indivisible” through “excellent mind”—are the channels where the twenty-four sacred places are found in the body.• These [twenty-four] are characterized by the three [ways they function].
► “Absorbed” refers to places in the body [that is, to channels] where the activities of the winds and bindus have already occurred.
► “Enjoyment” refers to where those activities are currently taking place.
► “Dominant” ones are where activities will occur.
Characterized in those three ways, the twenty-four are multiplied by three, yielding seventy-two, which [here] are the principal ones. By classifying each of those seventy-two in terms of the skandhas and dhātus, each is increased one hundredfold. Multiplying those by the ten winds gives the one thousand surrounding minor channels. Those are the seventy-two thousand channels. The principal ones and their surrounding ones resemble the way thousands of branches, leaves, and petals emerge from one trunk.
Here we should be aware that, in terms of their natures, the absorbed [channels] are where winds move; the enjoyment ones are where [white] bindus descend; and the dominant ones are where blood descends.•

There are other channels that are even more subtle than those seventy-two thousand channels, which correspond to the purities of the seventy-two Yoginī Tantras. What are these [most subtle channels]? The presentation found in the Sūtra That Teaches Nanda about Abiding in the Womb[266] is summarized in the Autocommentary:
In the four major directions of the body, there are five channels with forty branches each.
All have one hundred branches.
In total, there are eighty thousand channels, with eighty thousand microorganisms within them, filled with numerous unclean substances.[267]
The Kālachakra teaches that the thirty-five million subtle channels that extend to the skin generate the dregs of the hair [on the head] and body hairs.[268] The thirty-five million bhūtas that are the purities of those are the retinue of the maṇḍala. Vajragarbha’s Commentary [That Summarizes “The Hevajra Tantra”] says:
The channels equaling the number of hair pores are thirty-five million.[269] [100]

The order of these channels’ dhātus is as follows. Since the navel is the earth dhātu and the heart is the wind dhātu, earth and wind are method and prajñā. The throat is the fire dhātu, and the head is the water dhātu; therefore fire and water are method and prajñā. Because the uṣhṇīṣha is space and the secret is the wisdom-bliss type, space and wisdom are method and prajha.[270] Given that each pair is method and prajñā, during meditation, we visualize the chakras like [pairs of] open umbrellas. This is an important point of the key instructions.
Even those channels that reach the body hairs are produced by the six dhātus. According to the Ocean of Samādhis Recollecting the Buddha Sūtra,[271] the dhātus cause all the hair pores to appear as six-sided jewels at buddhahood.
Since there are three [ways of correlating] method and prajñā,• all channels are classified as being either the right (rasanā), left (lalanā), or center (madhyamā) type. Thus, the channels are of three types: body, speech, and mind. In brief, we should know that all channels—from the madhyamā out to the body hairs—are the embodiment of six, five, four, three, or two dhātus. [101]

Once we know the characteristics, or the abiding state, of the channels, we will recognize that the abiding state of the body is that [the body] is neither a whole nor something singular, and we will know the characteristics of the body on a conventional level. This is because we understand that the manifestations of the channels—which are empty of being real entities with a permanent, single, and independent self—are the stained nirmāṇakāya.•

The wind that is the basis for all saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is the great, primordial indestructible state. When referred to as wind, it is the life-force [wind]. Since it is the nature of the short A, it is the source of all speech, or verbal expression. The breaths, pāṇīpalas, daṇḍas, lagnas, and so forth, arise from it.• It also gives rise to all letters, the vowels and consonants. Therefore, although it is inexpressible, it is the basis for all expression. The Name- Chanting of Mañjushrī says:
A is the supreme of all syllables: the sacred letter of great meaning.
Arising from within, it is unborn.
Not something expressed in words,
it is the sublime cause of all expressions, [104]
the clarifier of all words.[272]
In the context of letters, the root of the vowels and consonants is a. In the context of the winds, the root of the ten winds is the life-force wind with the quality of A. In the context of wisdom, unchanging great bliss is referred to as A. The wind that is the root, or basis, of all phenomena is itself A, the “life-force wind,” and thus all phenomena of both saṃsāra and nirvāṇa appear from it.

When the vajra body is developing, the great life-force wind is first. Supported by the ālaya consciousness, which has entered into the midst of the red and white [dhātus], it [rises] with the movements of formative mentation. The life-force wind produces what is commonly called sentient beings’ “life span,” which supports their bodies, consciousnesses, and [physical] warmth. Among the five syllables, it has the form, or shape, of the short A. Among the five dhātus, it is of the nature of the space dhātu.
Radiating from that [life-force wind], the downward-expelling wind is the earth dhātu (among the five dhātus), and it has the form of the syllable
ḶI (among the five syllables). The upward-moving wind is the fire dhātu (among the five dhātus), and it has the quality of the syllable ṚI (among the five syllables). [105] The wind that coincides with fire is the wind dhātu (among the five dhātus), and is the syllable I (among the five syllables). The pervading wind is the water dhātu (among the five dhātus), and is U (among the five syllables).
The reason the winds are presented in that order is because the great life-force wind, which is the root of everything, is of the nature of the five syllables of great emptiness. The other [winds] radiate from its excellent qualities.

When the vajra body is forming in the womb, the first wind to develop is the life-force wind, which has the quality of A. In the second month, the downward-expelling wind radiates from the life-force wind. Accordingly, the winds emanate one by one every month, up through the tenth month. In that way, the energies and strengths of the ten winds develop sequentially.
Now, the winds are responsible for all actions. The five root winds serve as the bases for the five skandhas, and the five secondary winds serve as the bases for the five faculties. The winds cause the body to remain and to move, enable verbal expression, expel and retain feces and urine, and so forth.
In the end, they dissolve in the following way from the perspective of someone with a life span of one hundred years: the energy of one of the ten winds dissolves every ten years, starting in the tenth year after birth when the energy of the dhanaṃjaya wind dissolves into the devadatta wind.

Here some commentators explain that in the beginning, during the development [of the winds], the latter ones radiate from the previous ones; that is, the downward-expelling wind radiates from the life-force wind, the upward-moving wind from the downward-expelling wind, and so on. They also say that during dissolution the dhanaṃjaya wind dissolves into the devadatta wind in the tenth year. Such explanations contradict the Autocommentary and are not supported by the scriptures or reasoning.• We should refer to the excellent explanations given by Dak Rampa and Karma Tinle[275] (even though it seems that there are wording problems in this section of Karma Tinle’s commentary).

[107] The development and dissolution of winds are taught in the Vajra Wisdom Compendium Tantra[276] by correlating the five skandhas with the winds. The meaning of what is stated there is as follows.
Mind-itself, natural luminosity, is the wisdom wind. It is also called “great emptiness.” From that arises the ālaya consciousness, which has the characteristic of darkened illumination and is accompanied by afflictive mentation. It is the space wind. From darkened illumination arise the formative forces (afflictive mentation), which are radiance. Since they have the characteristics of movement, they are the wind wind. From radiance manifests imminent attainment: the six modes of consciousness and their associated factors. Feelings burn the mindstream and, therefore, are the fire wind. Discriminations are the water wind since they apprehend objects in terms of their characteristics and cause cohesion. Forms are the earth wind since they are solid and hard. In that progression of the five dhātus and five skandhas, it is explained that the five skandhas are what are produced and the five dhātus are the producers.•
Development and dissolution occur in a single engagement of a consciousness as follows. From luminosity (total emptiness) arises imminent attainment, which is darkened illumination, radiance,[277] and the wind dhātu. Then there is radiance, which is the illumination of objects and the fire dhātu. Next, occurs the attainment of illumination, which is the apprehension of objects in terms of their characteristics and is the water dhātu. From that manifest the coarse appearances of the skandhas,[278] dhātus, and so forth, which are the earth dhātu.
During dissolution the process of absorption follows the same order, proceeding from coarse appearances to total emptiness, luminosity. This is supported by the statement in the Root Tantra:
The four—earth and so forth— and the four emptinesses are known as the eight entities that cause arising and destruction.[279]

When speaking about the life-force wind simply in broad terms, it is said to pervade the entire body, from its upper and lower parts out to its body hairs; but the great life-force wind (the root of the ten winds) is based in the madhyamā, the root of all channels. It primarily resides directly in the middle of the body and supports the ālaya in the sense that they are related as support and supported.•
As for the way [the life-force wind] moves: [109] Some parts move mixed with the lagna winds. The main movements occur at the time of death when it moves for one day as 21,600.† This accords with the statement found in the [Guhya]samāja [Tantra]:
The wind called “the protector of space,” which is of the nature of Vairochana, moves outside from the madhyamā at the time of death.[281]
The relationship between support and supported is explained as being the connection between conditions and what has conditions; it is not the same as the way the earth supports Devadatta. The seventh lord [Chödrak Gyatso] taught that it is necessary to specify that the protector of space and the space wind are different.‡
Now, when the body is alive, the function of this wind is to foster the sense of self and all conceptual recollections because this wind is afflictive mentation.• If it deviates by moving from the madhyamā to another location, unconsciousness, insanity, or death result. At the time of the ground, moving to the heart in stages of dissolution will bring on death.† This karmic wind abides mixed with the clear yet nonconceptual wisdom winds.‡ Its color is described in the tantras and their commentaries as a colorless color, like space.

The nāga wind moves through puṣhā, the channel petal pointing toward the right shoulder blade, and through one of its channel ends enters the eyes. [112] Its function is to facilitate visual perceptions, physical grace, and so forth.
The tortoise wind moves through jayā, the rear channel petal at the heart, and through one of its ends enters the ears. Its function is to create auditory perceptions, movements in the arms, legs, and so forth.
The lizard wind moves through alambuṣhā, the channel petal pointing toward the left shoulder blade, and through one of its ends enters to the nose. Its function is to cause olfactory perceptions, aggression, agitation, and the like.
The devadatta wind moves through iḍā, the channel on the left side of the heart, and through one of its ends enters the tongue. Its function is to produce gustatory perceptions, yawns, and so forth.
The dhanaṃjaya wind moves through kuhā, the channel pointing toward the left breast, and through its ends enters the middle of the uvula and reaches all the hairs of the body. One of its functions is to draw up the white dhātus. Another function is to create the perceptions of tangible objects, such as of those that are soft or rough.

Now, these ten winds are the natures of the eight major periods that occur during the day and night. These ten winds are the main ones because it is on the basis of their movements and numbers that the periods, lagnas, and so forth, are taught. Thus it is said.[283]
An alternative [explanation] is that since these winds are the source of the dhātus, each one of them embodies the five or six dhātus. When they are exhaled, the dissolution process occurs, and when they are inhaled, the generation process takes place. Therefore, these winds are taught to be the main ones. Thus it is said.[284]

Movements occur in the heart chakra as follows. The great life-force wind—whose nature is that of the Rāhu dhātu—resides, like a king, in the madhyamā from when it first forms in the womb until death. The other winds (the root and the secondary winds that emanate from it), like ministers, perform their functions throughout the body in its upper and lower parts, externally and internally. [114]
Each of the root and the secondary winds in the heart chakra is classified as [one of] the four elements, making eight winds. These eight move through the channels in the four main directions and four intermediate directions at the heart. We should know that just as the winds in the heart chakra move as a set of eight, winds in the other [five] chakras (such as at the navel) move as sets of eight, making forty-eight movements.•

The way the winds move through the channel petals of the mahāsukha chakra at the head is as follows. The Chakrasaṃvara, Guhyasamāja, and related [systems] teach that there are thirty-two channel petals at the head corresponding to the union of method and prajñā. Alternatively, during the time of abiding in the body, there are sixteen outer channel petals through which blood primarily moves. There are sixteen inner channel petals through which flow bodhichittas endowed with five guṇas and the winds resembling the waxing and waning of the lunar padas. For that reason, the Kālachakra says that there are sixteen channel petals at the head.

How does movement actually occur according to the Kālachakra system? The lunar padas consist of seven earlier padas and seven later padas, making fourteen.

The channel at the center of the forehead and the one at the nape of the neck are the two that are of the nature of emptiness where the wisdom parts [of the winds] move. The movements in the fourteen channels that are other than those two follow a pattern described from the clockwise direction.
► In the first three channel petals to the right [of the central petal at the forehead], an earth wind with the nature of motility, darkness, or lightness moves.• [Each of] these [three winds] has the five guṇas of forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangible objects. Thus, they are the three with five.
► In the next one, the water wind with four guṇas (smells are excluded) moves. It is the one with four.
► In the next one, the fire wind with three guṇas (forms and smells are excluded) moves.
► In the next one, the wind wind with the two guṇas of sounds and tangible objects moves.
► In the next one, the space wind with the one guṇa of sound moves. Those accord with the earlier lunar padas.
► The eighth channel, the channel at the nape of the neck, is empty since it has no guṇas at all. This is the juncture of the padas.
Then, that order is reversed in the last seven channels.
► In the ninth channel (which is in the clockwise direction from the nape of the neck), [the space wind] endowed with the one guṇa of sounds moves.
► In the tenth, [the wind wind with] the two [guṇas of] sounds and tangible objects moves.
► In the eleventh, [the fire wind with] the three [guṇas of] sounds, tangible objects, and tastes moves.
► In the twelfth, [the water wind] with the four [guṇas of] forms, sounds, tastes, and tangible objects[289] moves.
► In the next three—[the thirteenth] through the fifteenth—[earth winds] with five guṇas [move].
► The sixteenth—which is the bindu [or channel, in the middle] of the forehead—is completely filled with the life-force and is of the nature of wisdom. It is the juncture of the completed padas.
These [channels] through which the winds move following the sequence of the guṇas are presented in the Kālachakra.[290] The guṇas are greater when more guṇas of forms, sounds, and so forth move, and the guṇas are fewer when less guṇas move. This is referred to by the line, “the sequence of the guṇas.”

The sequence of the dhātus related to those channels is as follows. Overall, all the channels in the front direction are the wind dhātu. All the right ones are the fire dhātu. The left ones are the water dhātu. The ones in the rear direction are the earth dhātu. [This pattern] applies to the ones in the intermediate directions. The ones in Agni’s direction [the southeast] are the wind dhātu. The ones in Nairṛitya’s direction [the southwest] are the fire dhātu. The ones in Vāyu’s direction [the northwest] are the earth dhātu. The ones in Ishāna’s direction [the northeast] are the water dhātu. This is a generalized presentation that accords with the purities of the maṇḍala deities.
Movements through the middle can occur in three ways [through the rasanā, the lalanā, or both]. Movement through the center of either [the rasanā or lalanā] is the space dhātu.• Movement through the center of both [simultaneously] is the wisdom dhātu.
In general, since a single channel is divided into main and intermediate directions, [the dhātus of each of its directions] are as explained above. In particular, the Autocommentary teaches that each of the five sets of channel petals of the minor saṃkrāntis at the navel are one of the five dhātus as explained above.[294]

In ways that are similar to the movements of the winds through the four chakras, winds move in the chakras of the twelve major joints of the legs and arms. Because winds move through the thirty channel petals in each [major joint] chakra, there are thirty wind movements in each chakra. [119] When added together, collectively there are 360 life-force [winds] in the twelve chakras; that is, the number of winds is the number of movements: 360.
The number of wind movements in the channels of the minor limbs (that is, the joints in the fingers and toes) is the same as those just mentioned: 360. This is because there are six channel petals in each of the sixty chakras of the finger and toe joints, and the number of wind movements corresponds to the number of channel petals.•

Alternatively, it is taught that the 21,600 winds that move in the individual channels during one day are internal movements corresponding to the lagnas that occur externally during one year, and that even a single inhalation and exhalation of the breath finally goes to and moves through the body hairs.

These internal wind movements are the basis for an endless number of classifications that systematize the arising of various interdependent connections. Nevertheless, for the most part, [internal movements] are similar to what is [described] in astrology for the external.
► One external year is equivalent to one internal day.
► The external twelve months correspond to the internal twelve major saṃkrāntis.•
► The external sixty daṇḍas are equivalent to the internal sixty minor saṃkrāntis.
► The 21,600 ghaṭikās of one external year correlate to the 21,600 winds of one internal day.
► The eleven and one-quarter extra days in one external year correspond to the wrathful† [eleven] and one-quarter wisdom winds that occur in one minor saṃkrānti.

Where do the twelve lagna winds start? When we are born from our mother’s womb, the winds flowing from her through the channel connected to our navel are terminated. It is taught that next, the first [wind] that moves through our nostrils is in the house of Cancer. This corresponds to the explanation that externally the sun was born in the house of Cancer,• three-quarters [of the way through] Punarvasu.[297]
When the era of completeness diminished, the light from [human beings’] own [bodies] faded, and the sun and moon rose from the shared merit of sentient beings. As soon as the house of Cancer, three-quarters [of the way through] Punarvasu, was seen at the peak of the eastern mountain, the sun was first sighted in that house. That first sighting of the sun is referred to conventionally with the expression “[the sun] was born there.” [123]

Having identified the first lagna, now I will explain the way the winds of the lagnas move. The ten root and secondary winds (which were discussed above), along with their associated subtle winds, gather in the body, and pass sequentially through its chakras as
► the winds of the eight periods in the heart chakra,
► the winds of the lunar mansions in the throat,
► the winds of the lunar padas in the head,
► the winds of the twenty-four regions,
► and the winds in the chakras of the major and minor joints.
They pass through the locations of the twelve houses at the navel, and generate the life-force’s energy. Then, moving to the nostrils, they emerge through either the right or the left nostril, alternating between the twelve houses: the six even ones (Taurus and the others) and the six odd ones (Aries and the others). These twelve internal major saṃkrāntis have qualities similar to the twelve external lagnas.

Then, after the movement of one major saṃkrānti through the right nostril, the lunar winds move through the left nostril as follows. First, there is one minor saṃkrānti of 360 space winds, followed by ones of wind, fire, water, and earth. That order is in keeping with the [elemental] sequence of the formation of the environment and beings. Their numbers are the same as above: each [minor saṃkrānti] has 360 movements. Added together, there are 1,800, which, as before, are one major saṃkrānti.
Here [the Oral Teaching of the Great Lotsāwa states that] externally the southern passage of the sun begins when it rises in the house of Cancer.[298] For six months the suns strength decreases and the moon’s strength increases. [125] The six [months of the sun’s] northern course, which [begins] in Capricorn, is the opposite [that is, the sun’s strength increases and the moon’s strength decreases]. Therefore, it should be that the northern passage and the right nostril have similar qualities. We should be aware, however, that here the right nostril is correlated with the southern passage in keeping with the thought of the Stainless Light.[299] The winds that emerge from the right [nostril] are of the nature of the sun and poison, and—among the two [movements of] emerging and entering—they have the qualities of external emergence and absorption. Thus, the sun’s strength, or energy, is diminishing. For that reason, [the winds that emerge from the right nostril] have qualities that are similar to the southern passage. [The winds on] the left are the opposite.

Each major saṃkrānti has 1,800 [wind movements]. Thus, the number of winds during twelve saṃkrāntis is 21,600.
The way the sun moves through the twelve houses externally is similar to the way internally the winds move through the channel petals of the twelve houses at the navel because when the sun moves to the next house [every] 1,800 ghaṭikās, internally there is a shift to the petal of the next house [every] 1,800 breaths.

Half of those wisdom winds move externally with the lagna winds, causing the deterioration of the life-force and the diminishment of the energy of life. Half move internally within the madhyamā, causing the increase of the life-force and wisdom, and the expansion of the energy of life. Thus, external, internal, and “other” arise from the unceasing play of these wisdom winds. The primary function of these winds is to create the padas of the ten planets by being the internal source of the waxing and waning of the strengths of the ten planets. Externally, the padas whose functions [are described] in astrology—the slow and fast padas of the five planets, the padas of the sun and moon, Ketu, and so forth—are based on the wisdom winds. Internally, all winds—the winds that emerge through the nostrils, the winds of the five sense doors, of the crown of the head, of that which arises below,• and so forth—arise from [the wisdom winds, which are] parts of the madhyamā. [127]
When the external movements of these winds increase, the death omens in the madhyamā increase. If, through the force of yoga, [the wisdom winds] are held internally in a state of no-release, an immortal life is achieved.

When the total number of wisdom-wind movements that occur during one hundred years are added together, they amount to three years and one and a half months. The Kālachakra teaches that if the total number of karmic winds occurring during a human beings hundred-year lifetime is purified into wisdom winds, [that person] is considered to be awakened. Thus, in three years and three [fifteen-day lunar] phases, [the state of] Vajradhara can be achieved. That is the point.
This [presentation] is simply a generalization. To understand the intercalary months, we need detailed calculations.
► One part of [every] thirty-two and a half [winds] is a wisdom wind. Thus, in [every] thirty-two and a half breaths, there is one wisdom wind, which reduces the [total] number of karmic winds [by one].
► By adding those [wisdom winds] together, one day is eliminated every thirty-two and a half lunar days, making thirty-one and a half zodiacal days.
► Therefore, there is an intercalary [or extra] month [every] thirty-two and a half zodiacal months.
By understanding, through the force of yoga [practice, how] the increases of intercalary months—which include the increase of days (that is, extra days)—and the obscurations—which are the loss of days and so forth— [relate to] the topics of wisdom winds, there will be no errors.•

The correspondences between those winds and their planetary forces are as follows. The winds that move through the right [nostril] follow the order of the wrathful planets and the long vowels. Earth winds are Saturn and the syllable ḶĪ. Water winds are Jupiter and Ū. Fire winds are Maṅgala (that is, Mars) and the syllable Ṛī. Wind winds are the sun and the syllable Ī. Space winds are Kālāgni and Ā. The five elemental winds that emerge through the right nostril, following the sequence of earth and so forth, move in harmony with the forces of the wrathful planets. Since their movements are in keeping with the absorption process of the elements, they are unvirtuous.
[The winds that] move through the left [nostril] follow the sequence of the peaceful planets and the short syllables [or vowels]. Space winds are Rāhu and A. Wind winds are the moon and I. Fire winds are Mercury and ṚI. Water winds are Venus and U. Earth winds are Ketu and ḶI.

All external and internal phenomena—the skandhas, dhātus, āyatanas, and so forth—function alike, and their specific capabilities are inconceivable. Through the power of interdependent connections, those aforementioned ten winds and planetary forces are like magnets, which can attract distant pieces of iron. Because [all phenomena have] such similar [functions and capabilities], the space winds and their planet succeed in the activities of killing, or black magic, and subsequent reviving. The wind winds and their planet can expel their target and kill. The fire winds and their planet control and summon their target. The water winds and their planet pacify illnesses, demons, and so forth, and increase longevity and merit. The activities of the earth winds and their planet are to paralyze and stupefy their target’s three doors. The Kālachakra states that the wisdom winds perform all activities except killing. As for when the wisdom winds move: the interval between two major saṃkrāntis is when [the wisdom] winds flow equally [in both nostrils].

► the eight great activities of pacifying, increasing, controlling, summoning, killing, expelling, paralyzing, and stupefying;
► the twelve great activities, which, in addition to those eight, include neutralizing poison, separating, causing plagues, and striking with kīlas;
► and the fourteen great activities, which include the additional two of reviving and becoming invisible.

When the [elemental] winds go out through the nostrils, the earth winds travel twelve finger-widths; the water winds, thirteen finger-widths; the fire winds, fourteen finger-widths; the wind winds, fifteen finger-widths; and space winds reach sixteen finger-widths. They return from those distances. As for why [they travel those distances]: Since earth has five qualities, it is heavier; the others have less. The weights of the elements’ qualities determine their distances. The latter ones [travel] farther than the earlier ones; that is [in the sequence] earth, water, fire, wind, and space, the earlier ones are heavier than the latter, which [reduces] the distance they travel. This accords with the thought of the Kālachakra.[301]

The winds (or five maṇḍalas of the lesser [fire] elements) emerging from the right nostril are fire maṇḍalas since they are primarily solar dhātus. They are red and, because they accomplish activities such as controlling and summoning, they are excellent. Their movements are of the nature of vajra speech or are those of the Padma Protectors, who belong to Amitābha’s family, such as the krodha Padmāntaka. The practice is to recite the syllable
ĀḤ with the deities who are sealed as that [family].
The winds (or five maṇḍalas of the lesser [wind] elements) emerging from the left nostril are lunar dhātus and of the nature of prajñā. Nevertheless, because they perform harmonious activities, they are mixed with wind maṇḍalas and, therefore, appear as yellowish green. They accomplish [the activities of] pacifying and so forth. Their movements are of a nature that combines vajra body and the Karma Protector, Amoghasiddhi. The practice is to join the deities who are sealed by that [family] with the repetition of the syllable OṂ.
The winds (or five maṇḍalas of the lesser [earth] elements) coming forcefully through both nostrils, both above and below, are Maheshvara. They are of the nature of earth dhātus, and since they achieve the activity of enriching, they appear as a golden color. Their movements are of the nature of the Ratna Protector, Ratnasambhava, who joins the downward-expelling [wind] abiding at the navel and the white and red wisdom dhātus. The practice is to bind [two winds and the bindus] at the tip with the deity who is sealed by that family and with a spherical form, and to join [that] with the vajra repetition of wisdom, the equal taste of great bliss.• [134]
The winds (or five maṇḍalas of the lesser [water] elements) are of the nature of wisdom, are slow, and do not move distortedly in [only] one direction. They look like pure crystals: flawless and radiant. They are the maṇḍalas of water dhātus. Since they are wisdom and accomplish the activity of pacifying, their movements are of the nature of the Vajra Protector, who is vajra mind and belongs to Akṣhobhya’s family. The practice is to join the deity who is sealed by that [family] with the repetition of the syllable HÜṂ.†

[135] If yogins or yoginīs resting in equipoise continuously perform the vajra repetition with those four maṇḍalas of winds (which are the objects of repetition), they will achieve the immortal vajra body.
Thus it is taught that we should meditate on the five lesser elements of the winds as five colors at the tips of the four chakras (that is, at the centers of each chakra) and perform the repetitions throughout the day and night by counting the mantra repetitions of the three—the emerging, entering, and abiding of the winds—and the equal taste of great bliss.•

Here [the four chakras] are correlated with the repetitions of the four vajras.

According to the thoughts of other commentaries,[310] the earlier explanation that relates the 21,600 breaths taken each day to the twelve lagnas belongs to the system of the Kālachakra and the Commentaries by Bodhi-sattvas. Here the description of [those 21,600 as] the movements of the four protectors is from the system of the Vajra Garland and [the Guhyasamāja commentaries by] the noble father and son [Nāgārjuna and Aryadeva].[311] We should not entertain any doubts about whether the meaning of these [two systems] are the same or not: the former has in mind the ground state, whereas the latter presents the corresponding purities of the vajra repetition during the time of the path.

The Explanation of the “Treasury of Abhidharma” states:
There are six ways [to practice mindfulness of the breath]:
counting, following, placing,
examining, changing, and purifying.[312]
1. The training in counting: Assume the vital points for the body [that is, the correct posture], and expel the stale wind [or breath]. Place your mind in its natural state. Concentrate one-pointedly on your breath as it is exhaled, inhaled, and rests [between breaths]. At first you should train in short [sessions], then gradually extend them.•
2. Following: Next, meditate by focusing on the circulation [of your breath]. Does the wind [or breath] go everywhere in your body? Or does it go just to one area?†
3. Placing: After that, concentrate on [your breath] pervading your whole [body] and yet be without conceptuality. Place [your mind] without contrivance.
4. Examining: By concentrating on the winds [or breaths], you recognize that they lack any nature. Thus, you come to understand the abiding mode of the ultimate.‡
5. Changing: Your mind that is focused on the winds should change [its object] from those to other things. Practice other key instructions for shamatha.•
6. Purifying: Practicing in that way purifies the [dualistic] thoughts of percepts and perceivers. Since thoughts are winds, controlling the winds makes thoughts transparent. That is the view of both the sūtras and tantras.†
Those six branches [or techniques] are also a way of performing the vajra repetition, [as Nāgārjuna’s Five Stages] says:
[This can be done using] a verbal expression, a focus, a symbol, or the ultimate.[313]
The first two modes are conventional [means of] repetition that primarily give rise to shamatha. The latter two are ultimate [modes of] repetition that primarily produce vipashyanā. [138] The natures of shamatha and vipash-yanā are described in the Tantra Prophesying the Thought:
To see inner phenomena, such as forms, is called “vipashyanā.”
To purify thoughts, while counting Akṣhobhya and the others, is shamatha.[314]

The Third Retention Method
When we train with the colors and shapes of the five winds, they become causes for the five supercognitive abilities and the ten samādhis of the totalities to manifest.
The methods for producing the totalities are as follows. The Pāramitā-[yāna] teaches that meditating on all objects of knowledge as being pervaded by earth perfects the samādhi of the totality of earth. That, however, is a long path. Here, in Mantrayāna, since the result itself is taken as the path, we rest our mind on the earth wind, whose color is yellow and shape is square. When, by penetrating the vital points of that wind, we achieve a slight degree of stability, the clear appearance of earth arises. At that point we perfect the samādhi of the totality of earth. (That [explanation of the practice of the totality of earth] can be applied to the other [totalities].)†
The way to produce the supercognitive abilities should be learned from the explanations of Āchārya Ānandagarbha and others.‡

The Fourth Retention Method
[The practice of] vase breathing [is as follows]. Since the navel is the location where the control of the life-force (which is above) is bound, the upper wind is pressed down. Since the secret place is the location for binding the downward-expelling wind (which is below), the lower wind is drawn up. Since the fire below the navel is the place in between where the tastes of the two winds are equalized, these winds fill in between.• When we meditate using that threefold [vase breathing] combined with “the libera-tion-of-a-lion mudrā,” all the activities of the winds become workable.†
The benefits of meditating on vase breathing with its fourfold yoga are taught extensively in the tantras.‡ That retention method holds the root winds, and “the liberation of a lion” binds the secondary winds. [139] On the basis of those, we master the winds, which brings success in all activities (such as pacifying) and the development of the eight excellent qualities.

The roots of all winds are the method and prajñā of the moon and sun. Therefore, the benefits of wind [or breath] retention are the eight excellent qualities of the moon and sun. Since it is fire’s nature to blaze upward, the solar [winds give rise to] three excellent qualities related to holding the upper winds. Since it is waters nature to flow down, the lunar wind gives rise to five excellent qualities related to holding the lower winds.
Because the solar winds, whose natures are fire, rise up, they are the upper winds of the sun, moon, and Rāhu, the principal winds. The benefits of holding those three are that thoughts involving the three poisons (motility, darkness, and lightness)• are destroyed, and the three vajras of body, speech, and mind are attained. Those three excellent qualities are said to be the excellent qualities related to holding the solar winds.
The downward-expelling [wind], whose nature is the moon, arises below. The benefits of its retention are that the five objects—forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangible objects—are controlled and that ultimately the five wisdoms are attained. Therefore, pressing down the upper winds purifies the three types of thoughts related to perceivers, and binding the lower wind purifies the five types of thoughts that are percepts.[315] [140] The benefits of holding those winds in union are, in brief, that the eight kinds of thoughts involving percepts and perceivers are conquered.†

The short-term excellent qualities of wind retention are as follows. Retaining the earth winds makes our bodies solid and firm. Holding the water winds causes our body to be shiny. Holding the fire winds makes our body brilliantly clear. Retaining the wind winds causes our body to become light and swift. The benefits of holding the space winds are that our body is pure and possesses great wisdom. Tipupa explained that these are the excellent qualities of retaining the five elemental winds that arise in the body.

To summarize the winds in brief, they are all included within two types: wisdom winds and consciousness winds. Of those, the consciousness winds are the same as thoughts in that they [share] three qualities: they move, they engage with what is subtle, and they cause movements to occur elsewhere.
Winds move external things. They engage with very subtle entities. They cause external things to shift from one [place] to another. Thoughts also move toward objects. They engage with subtle objects. They do not remain in one location, or they cause a shift from one thing to another in terms of the things to be abandoned and their remedies. [141]
All phenomena of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, whatever they may be, are imputed by the imagination of the unreal. They are simply the appearing aspect of mind. Therefore, by establishing that winds are thoughts, we know that all of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa is of their nature.

Mind-itself, which is the ground for saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, is clear yet nonconceptual, the dharmadhātu, pure by nature. When its essence is described as wind, it is called the “great wisdom wind.” Thus, the ground for purification is referred to as wind.
Path-cognitions—remedies that are the concordances of causes and their results—are the great winds that are the natural outflow of wisdom. [Such remedies] are said to be the path of formative forces (and their associated elements) that are the imagination that is correct in that it concords with the qualities for awakening. The means of purification are also described as winds.•
The ālaya is the support for the latent tendencies. Afflictive mentation, which abides as what is supported by that [ālaya], takes what is not a self to be a self and causes mind to form objects. It, therefore, is said to be the wind that creates bewilderment. Formative forces, which are connected to the six modes of consciousness, are nothing other than an appearing quality of wisdom, the mind’s own light—and yet they are conceived of as “other.” Since they produce the desire of craving and grasping, and they move constantly, they are called “winds of desire.” [142]
The six modes of consciousness do not recognize the abiding mode of objects to be their own nature. Since they determine what to adopt or reject, they are winds that provoke anger toward unpleasant objects. Thus, they are winds that generate aggression. Once the three poisons are generated by those [winds], we are deluded and circle within the three realms. The mind and mental factors of the three realms are referred to as winds in that they involve the three poisons. What are to be purified are labeled as winds.

It is said that the appearances of the three realms are formed by winds. Those who know just how it is that all faults—desire, aggression, [the dualism of] percepts and perceivers, and so forth—and all the virtues leading to nirvāṇa depend on the winds (since even remedial wisdom is taught to be wind) will bind the vital points that are stages of the true path. The Vajra Garland Tantra teaches that those who know the wind [or breath] yogas go beyond saṃsāra and reach buddhahood. If winds and thoughts are let loose and pursued, they will keep us circling in saṃsāra and suffering. If we know how to bind their vital points, the winds themselves will succeed in being the remedy that severs saṃsāra because karmic winds will be purified into wisdom. [143]

The explanation of the bindus follows the chapters on the channels and winds because the thirty-six quintessence and dreg bindus, which reside in the channels, are like jewels controlled by the winds. Since saṃsāra is produced from the latent tendency to release [bindus], that instant [of release] is to be bound. If the vital points of the bindus are not penetrated, vajra mind will not be achieved. To penetrate their vital points and use them as the path, we must understand their abiding state.•

Next, following the presentation of the winds, I will explain the locations and movements of the quintessence-bindus and dreg-bindus, which are supported by the house-like channels and the owner-like winds. [145] I will also discuss the bindus by grouping them into three categories:
1. the root bindu free from conceptual elaborations, which is mind-itself;
2. the bindus of deluded ignorance, which, because that [root bindu] is not realized, are what binds, and include the material, mantra, and wind bindus; and
3. the stages of binding the bindus that are the remedies for that delusion.•
The Vajra Garland,[317] a Guhyasamāja explanatory tantra, provides a threefold presentation of the bindus in some detail.†

The first among the three bindus is the root bindu free from elaborations. It is described as being our own mind, connate wisdom, which is of the nature of the three kāyas. The empty essence of mind is itself the dharma-kāya free from conceptual elaborations. Minds luminous nature is the saṃbhogakāya, and its unimpeded manifestation is compassion, present as anything—the nirmāṇakāya.•
The signs that those three kāyas are found in all sentient beings can be experienced through the force of meditation even now, during this period as ordinary beings.
► The signs of the dharmakāya are that, because the essence of phenomena can never pass beyond emptiness, experiences of emptiness arise and everything—all phenomena—appears as empty. Those are not the only [signs]: when we analyze, our rational mind, which is an inferential [valid cognizer],[318] understands [phenomena] to be empty.
► The signs of the saṃbhogakāya are that the ten signs of expanse-awareness (the four daytime signs and six nighttime signs) arise as direct [experience]. They manifest because it is the nature of all phenomena to never be beyond luminosity.†
► The signs of the nirmāṇakāya are that the functional potentials of the objects appearing to the six modes of consciousness manifest individually; for instance, the eyes see forms. These [potentials] occur because the manifestations of phenomena arise unimpededly.
Those three are infallible signs that appear as objects during meditation. On the subjective side, wisdom is the essence of the cognitions (or consciousnesses) linked to those [objects]. That wisdom, in which objects and subjects are inseparable, is yogic direct perception, nonconceptual and nonmistaken. It is the bindu free from conceptual elaborations, the root of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, which the Bhagavat gave extensive descriptions of in the sūtras and tantras.•

The bindus of deluded ignorance include 5.19
the imagined mantra bindus, which transform
the imagined four names that follow from
ignorance, formative forces, and consciousnesses.
Dependent mentations potential [147] is called the “wind bindu.”
The skandha of forms, what appear as objects,
is the “material bindus of the five dhātus.”
These were taught by the Victor in the yoga tantras.

The root bindu free from elaborations is accompanied by wind, and it simultaneously becomes the white and red [bindus]. The white element produces [the sense of] a perceiver, and the red element gives rise to [the sense of] percepts. That situation is called ignorance because, although it is nondual in its very nature and has no partiality, it is ignorant of that’s being the case. That state is referred to as “bindu” because it cannot be destroyed by anything as long as saṃsāra endures.

Generally speaking, the bindus of deluded ignorance are categorized as three: (1) mantra bindus, (2) wind bindus, and (3) material bindus. Specifically, each of those three has two aspects—a basis to be purified and a means of purification—resulting in six divisions.•

1. The imagined four [skandhas of] names—feelings, discriminations, formative forces, and consciousnesses—follow from ignorance, formative forces, and consciousnesses.

Among those three bindus, the material bindus are twofold: the external bindus, which are included within the world of the external environment, and the internal bindus, which are part of the inner vajra body. As for the bindus that become the inner principles: first, when about to take rebirth in a womb, the nature of a bardo [beings] consciousness is to have fixations. This means, in the case of taking a male birth, that [the consciousness] is attracted to the woman and feels aversion toward the man; in the case of a female birth, the opposite occurs. These fixations arise on the basis of the condition of taking the white and red [bindus] of his or her parents’ coupling to be a self. With [such fixations, the bardo being’s consciousness] enters the womb. The [embryo’s] dhātus gradually develop, growing into the kalala and so forth during a thirty-eight-week period. This developmental process is as taught above in chapter 2.•

The quintessence of the red elements resides at the junction of the three channels, which is below the navel. Its color is red; it is very hot and is a clear light. It is like the mare-mouths’ fires. (The mare-fires are very red, hot fires that blaze from the mouths [or volcanoes] of rock mountains that resemble mares’ faces.[320] [These volcanic mountains] are outside the oceans and, by encircling them, they prevent the oceans passing beyond their borders. Their fires are known as “mare-mouths’ fires,” or “horse-faces’ fires.”)
This bindu’s shape is described as being a short A; since that is also called an “A stroke,” it looks like an upside-down Lañtsa stroke mark. It is “of the nature of Vajravārāhī” means that [the red bindu] is of the nature of prajñā, emptiness. Additionally, the exalted seventh [Karmapa, Chödrak Gyatso,] explains that an upside-down Lañtsa stroke mark with three curves is the shape that is referred to in that way [that is, as a short A].

The Chakrasaṃvara tantras and their perfection-process [commentary] by Kṛiṣhṇa• call the quintessence of the white elements “spring” because it provides bliss, and the quintessence of the red elements “bindu” because it stabilizes bliss. Both the white and red support the ālaya and the great life-force wind.[321] Therefore, when the Saṃvarodaya Tantra and Vajraḍāka[322] represent them as an external place, they refer to them as the “essence of the heart of awakening,” Vajrāsana.† Vajrāsana—the place where all suns of the sages [that is, buddhas] awaken—is called the ground for the heart of awakening. [151] In a similar way, the white and red [bindus are called “the heart of awakening”] because they are the ground from which the inner awakening of unification manifests.

The quintessences of the dregs are the following two: The red elements—which are the solar dhātus of the nature of blood—are generated by the fire of the short A and ascend, flowing through the rasanā. The white bindus fall from the HAṂ at the head and descend, flowing through the lalanā. The dregs of the dregs are expelled in coarse ways, which will be discussed below.

In the first of the seven births, quintessences are produced by the ingredients used in the internal burnt offerings. How [does this occur]? All external edible and potable things are the burnt substances. The two hands (which arise from the rasanā and lalanā) are the shruva and pātrī. They present [that food and drink] to the skandhas, dhātus, and āyata-nas—which, from the outset, are the natural deities—through the mouth, a hollow HOṂ. [Those offerings] refresh [the deities].
The three that function in the stomach—fire-coinciding wind, decomposition-causing phlegm, and color-changing bile[323]—are the natures of the three faces of the god Agni.• The first burns, the second digests, and the third purifies, thereby separating the quintessences from the dregs during the course of a day. In this way, the quintessences develop gradually.

The quintessences of that food and drink in the stomach (where the quintessences have been separated from the dregs) flow through four major channels—“copper,” “blue bird,” “long divide,” and “faulty”—to the liver. They become the great blood, and continue to spread to all the channel places. During the course of one day, the quintessences of that blood (which have been separated from its dregs) produce flesh.
In one day, the quintessences of the flesh (which have been separated from its dregs) become fat. During one day, the quintessences of fat (which have been separated from its dregs)[324] become bones. In one day, the quintessences of the bones (which have been separated from its dregs) become bone marrow. In one day, the quintessences of bone marrow (which have been separated from its dregs) become semen. [153]
Thus, starting with quintessences of food and drink and ending with semen, the quintessences separate from the dregs over seven days, thereby becoming a sevenfold quintessence. In [Vāgbhaṭa’s Heart of the] Eight Branches of Medical Treatment,[325] these are known as the “seven quintessential physical constituents.”• They are also referred to as the “seven internal rebirths” in tantras, such as the Kālachakra.†

The dregs in the stomach—which are from the food and drink that have been burned, digested, and purified during one day—go to the intestines, where they divide into solids and liquids. The solids pass gradually through the intestines and move through the anal tract. The liquids go through the channels that are the intestinal links, accumulate in the bladder, and are excreted through the urethra.
Each day one [of the seven] quintessences is processed, its corresponding dreg is produced. The blood’s dregs produce bile in the liver. The bile’s quintessence is the body’s lymph. [154] The bile’s dregs descend and produce the sediment in urine and the odor and yellow color of feces.
The dregs of the flesh are skin and its smells. The dregs of fat are lymph nodes and tumors. The bones’ dregs are the teeth and nails. The marrow’s dregs are the smells, saliva, nasal mucus, and phlegm found in the cavities.

<d e="2">
The slightly detailed explanation of the material bindus, or dhātus, is that there are thirty-six quintessence-dhātus and dreg-dhātus. A more detailed presentation states that there are as many dhātus as there are channels. (That is the overview.)
[The twelve quintessence-dhātus are as follows.] Within the heart channels where the secondary winds move, there are the four quintessences connected to the visual consciousness and the others, that is, the auditory, olfactory, and gustatory consciousnesses. These quintessences serve as the dominant conditions for the apprehension of objects (such as forms) and are, therefore, called “the four dhātus that offer those four sense objects to their perceiving subjects [the sense consciousnesses].”
The white dhātu originating in the “māra-free” channel ascends and goes to the center of the uvula. This reversal of the dhātu causes the white elements to wane. It is said to resemble the waning of the white elements of the moon on the sixteenth lunar day, which is the beginning of the [moon’s] dark phase. Since another function of this channel and its bindus is to create the perception of the dhātus of tangible objects (that is, element-derivatives), it also is suitable to say that they offer tangible objects to the body. [156]
The functions of the five quintessences connected to the five root winds were explained before in the sections describing the way the body develops, the channels, and the winds.• We, therefore, are aware of the functions of the five quintessences connected to the five channels and the five [root] winds.
Here, in the context of the twelve quintessences, the madhyamā is divided into two parts: one where the winds move and the other where the bindus move. Since there are two quintessences supported by those [two sections], there are a total of twelve [quintessences].

How is the madhyamā divided into two? Since three winds—solar, lunar, and Rāhu—move above, one section is where winds move. Below it is the support for feces, urine, and semen. Specifically, the lower end of the madhyamā channel, the shaṅkhinī, fills with the white bindus that are the full fifteen digits, similar to the [full] moon. It is the channel that gives birth to connate bliss.
In men, this channel connects to the tip of their vajra’s jewel, and in women it connects to their rasanā since the lower end of the rasanā retains the blood dhātus. That is a difference between men and women. [The shaṅkhinī] generates the two supreme faculties [that is, the male and female sexual organs], which are the main faculties of the body. In brief, since the bindus move in the lower end of the madhyamā, one section is where bindus move. To summarize, the madhyamā is divided into two parts: one where winds move and one where bindus move.
In keeping with the detailed explanation given in the earlier section on the channels, the twelve quintessence-dhātus are enumerated in relation to the eight channel petals of the dharmachakra at the heart, the two upper and lower channels, and the division of the madhyamā into two parts where winds and bindus move. Dak Rampa explains:
Since the upper [quintessences] have the qualities of the life-force wind and the sun, the three upper [bindus] are considered to be one and are called solar bindus.[327] Since the lower three [quintessences] have the qualities of the downward-expelling wind and the moon, they are considered one and are called lunar bindus.[328]

The scriptural source for this presentation of how the twelve quintessences move is the Sampuṭa Tantra.• The channel petals in the four main directions of the heart chakra (through which secondary winds and rakta move) are of the natures of the four ḍākinīs. The dhātus present there and the bin-dus in the area above the heart are the major elements. Being candle-flame entities, they are referred to by the term “the five lamps” and are the quintessences of the five meats.
The channel petals in the four intermediate directions [of the heart chakra] (through which root winds and bodhichittas move) are of the natures of the tathāgatas. The dhātus supported there and the bindus in the area below the heart are the flowing quintessences, the five amṛitas. In the mother tantras, the natures of the vases are called “the four channels that present offerings of the five sense pleasures to the consciousnesses.” It can be inferred [from these statements] that the madhyamā is divided into two parts.†
Here, in this context of presenting the way the twelve quintessences move, [the Autocommentary] says specifically that the five channels perfectly situated in the center of the body’s heart are “threefold” through “māra-free” because it considers this to be difficult to know.[330]

Since twenty-four dreg-dhātus (what are supported) [reside] within the twenty-four major channels (the supports), these supports and their supported will be explained together. As for the supports: the specific instances of the eight abodes of body (the subterranean places), the eight abodes of speech (the terrestrial places), and the eight abodes of mind (the celestial places) are said to be the twenty-four principal channels. Based on their specific [qualities] of being the continuous abodes of the bindus or ḍākinīs, occasional abodes, and so forth, they are called external abodes, internal places, and so forth.
Next, the heroes and yoginīs who appear within those external abodes and the twenty-four dreg-dhātus appearing within those internal abodes are combined with the twenty-four channels that were explained previously in the section presenting the principal channels.• This explanation will correlate the external and internal, the supports and their supported.†

It is said that the “indivisible” channel is located at the head and is the great external region of Pullīramalaya, where the hero Khaṇḍakapāla and the heroine Prachaṇḍā reside.[334] In that channel, wind-mind resides as ḍāka and ḍākinī, male and female consorts, and the dreg-dhātus of the teeth and nails are formed and discharged. The “subtle form” channel is located at the crown of the head and is Jālandhara, where Mahākaṅkāla and Chaṇḍākṣhī abide. It generates and gives out the hair on the head and body.
The “charming” channel is based, or resides, in the right ear and is Oḍḍiyana, where Kaṅkāla and Prabhāvatī abide. It produces and releases skin and its odors. The “left” channel is at the nape of the neck and is Arbuda, where Vikaṭadaṃṣhṭrī and Mahānāsā reside. It generates and discharges the rear-surface flesh found on the back and elsewhere.
Since ḍākinīs always abide in those four external regions (Pullīramalaya and the others), and the white elements, or dhātus, always abide in those four channels (“indivisible” and the others), they are known as the external and internal abodes.•

The “dwarf” channel is located in the left ear and is the external region of Godavari, where Surāvairī and Vīramatī abide. It releases the dhātus that produce the tendons. The “turtle born” channel is Rāmeshvara, where Amitābha and Kharvarī reside. It is at the point between the eyebrows and discharges the dhātus that produce the garlands of bones.
The “meditation” channels are Devīkoṭa, where Vajraprabha and Laṅkeshvarī are found. Those channels are outside the eyes and generate the flesh of the liver. The “empowering” channels are Mālava, where Vajra-deha and Drumacchāyā reside. They are connected to the channels in the shoulders and upper arms; and they produce and discharge the flesh of the heart.
Since ḍākinīs occasionally reside in the four external regions (Godavari and the others), and the white elements occasionally reside in the four internal channels (“dwarf” and the others), those [places] are always referred to as the abodes and nearby abodes.•
When the eight [heroes and yoginīs of the abodes and nearby abodes] are correlated to the “other” maṇḍala chakras, they are the heroes and yoginīs of the mind chakra of Chakrasaṃvara.

The channels known as “defects” are the external region of Kāmarūpa, where Aṅkuraka and Airāvatī reside. These channels connect to the armpits, and generate and give out the flesh of the eyeballs by way of the liver.[337] The “engaging” channels are the region of Odra, where Vajrajaṭila and Mahābhairavā manifest. They pass along, and are located at, the sides of the breasts and produce, or discharge, the bile dhātus and large intestines.
The “mother” channel is the region of Trishakuni, where Mahāvīra and Vāyuvegā appear. It abides at the navel and generates the lungs. The “shavarī” channel is the region of Koshala, where Vajrahūṃkāra and Surābhakṣhī reside. It stretches from the intestines to the tip of the nose and discharges, or generates, the intestines and bowels.
In Kāmarūpa and Odra the heroes and yoginīs enjoy gaṇachakras continuously, and in “defects” and “engaging” the dhātus are enjoyed continuously. Therefore, those two [pairs] are called the external and internal fields. In Trishakuni and Koshala the karma ḍākinīs and wisdom ḍākinīs enjoy gaṇachakras occasionally, and in “mother” and “shavarī” the dhātus are enjoyed occasionally. Thus, those two [pairs] are the external and internal nearby fields.†

The “cooling” channels are externally Kaliṅga, where Subhadra and Shyāmādevī appear. They connect to the hips, as well as the sides of the mouth, the ribs, and so forth, and they produce the abdomen. The “hot,” or “warm,” channel is Lampāka, where Vajrabhadra and Subhadrā are found. Stretching from the middle of the throat to the navel, it generates the bowels and colon.
In those two regions, karma ḍākinīs and wisdom ḍākinīs intermingle and bathe continuously. In those two channels, the quintessence-dhātus and dreg-dhātus that wash thoughts intermingle. They are, therefore, the external and internal chandohas. Those fourteen channels are on the left, are part of the lalanā, and are of the nature of prajñā.†
The following ten channels are derived from the rasanā and are method.§ The “descending” channel is the region of Kāñchi, where Mahābhairava and Hayakarṇī reside. It links the heart to the anus and acts as the dominant condition for the excretion of feces. The “delight” channel is externally Himalaya, where Virūpākṣha and Khagānanā are located. It connects the bregma to the bladder, and it discharges, or produces, spinal fluid that fills the middle between those two end points.•
Since the quintessences and dregs intermingle occasionally and bathing takes place occasionally in those two external and internal regions, they are the nearby chandohas.†
The eight [heroes and yoginīs of the fields, nearby fields, chandohas, and nearby chandohas] are the heroes and yoginīs of the “other” speech chakra.

The “well formed” channel is externally Pretapurī, where Mahābala and Chakravegā appear. It abides at the genitals and continuously discharges pus. The “shared,” or “common,” channel is Gṛihadevatā, where Ratna-vajra and Khaṇḍarohā reside. It is located at the anus and releases phlegm. Since ḍākinīs gather for gaṇachakras in those two external regions, and the quintessence-dhātus and dreg-dhātus gather in those two internal channels, those are the external and internal gathering places.
The “cause granting” channels are Saurāṣhṭra, where Hayagrīva[340] and Shauṇḍinī abide. They lie on the sides of the thighs and create the blood’s energy. The “yoga-free” channels are the region of Suvarṇadvīpa, where Akāshagarbha and Chakravarmiṇī reside. They are located in the calves and always discharge sweat. [164] Since ḍākinīs occasionally gather for gaṇachakras in those two regions, and the quintessence-dhātus and dreg-dhātus occasionally gather in those two channels, those are the external and internal nearby gathering places.§

The “beautiful” channels are the region of Nagara, where Heruka and Suvīrā reside. They abide in the toes and discharge fat. The “siddha” channels are the region of Sindhu, where Padmanarteshvara and Mahābalā are located. Those channels are found in the insteps and create tears. In those two regions, dreg-dhātus are discarded and thoughts are severed. Those two channels lack bliss. Therefore, they are the external and internal charnel grounds.
The “boiling” channels are the region of Maru, where Vairochana and Chakravartinī abide. Those channels are in the big toes and produce and discharge sputum and saliva. The “excellent mind” channels are the region of Kulutā, where Vajrasattva and Mahāvīryā are found. Those channels reside at the knees and always discharge nasal mucus.[343] In those two regions, dreg-dhātus are discarded occasionally and thoughts are severed occasionally. Those two channels occasionally lack bliss. Therefore, they are the nearby charnel grounds.† [165]
The eight [heroes and yoginīs of the gathering places, nearby gathering places, charnel grounds, and nearby charnel grounds] are the heroes and yoginīs of the body chakra. This correspondence of the twenty-four channels to the sacred places is excerpted from the Conduct of Yoginīs[344] and Sampuṭa.[345] The correlation of the body and the sacred places is found in the Vajra Garland.[346]

► The enjoyment ones are in the present: they are the quintessences of the dhātus—primarily white-element ones—whose activity is taking place now.

Among the dhātus, such as the seventy-two thousand, specifically, the white-element quintessences, the excellent lunar bodhichittas, descend from the sixteen channels in the head. The sixteen channel petals are in four sets of four since each of the four root dhātus (earth, water, fire, and wind) is divided into lesser elements, such as earth-earth, water-earth, fire-earth, and wind-earth. The bindus [at the head] are also [counted as sixteen] by combining method and prajñā.• [167]
Sixteen digits of bindu fall to the saṃbhogachakra at the throat. The maturation of great bliss causes their numbers to diminish. Half of those sixteen (that is, eight digits) descend to the heart. Half of those eight (that is, four digits) fall as far as the four channels of the navel chakra. Then, these bindus become one and fall into the fire of the A stroke, the red-element quintessence. As long as it abides in the shaṅkhinī channel, it is the sixteenth digit, the fullness of the waxing moon. After great bliss has become full, it cannot be bound and is released externally.
On the basis of such [a process], there are descriptions of the passage that the dhātus that are of the natures of the [lunar] days take through the joints of the external body. Those are now well known as “the life-essence abodes.” The modes of such passages [or transferences]—which occur due to the white elements increasing [and the red elements becoming obscured] during the waxing phase, and the red elements [increasing and the white elements] becoming obscured during the waning phase[349]—are discussed extensively in the Kālachakra Tantra.† Similar explanations also appear in the astrological treatises. “The channels of the always wandering life-essence abodes” referred to in the medical treatises are in keeping with what is presented here.•

Releasing [bindus] in that manner gives rise to the three poisonous mental afflictions. The increase of bindus at the moment of transferring the dhātus causes the intense joy of embodied beings. At first, that arouses desire. Under the influence of desire, our mindstream becomes confused—that is, because we do not recognize connate wisdom, we become bewildered. Once release occurs, the absence of desire causes aggression to arise. Under the sway of our three poisons, we circle in saṃsāra. Release is the basis that creates saṃsāra.† This is the same point that “The Achievement of Unchanging Wisdom” teaches:[350] released bliss is the root of saṃsāra. [168]

Once bodhichittas are transferred, dualistic appearances multiply, and we circle in saṃsāra. On the other hand, if we bind [our bindus] in a state of no-release, connate wisdom will arise, and we will proceed to nirvāṇa. We should apply ourselves to the methods that bind [bindus] in a state of no-release.
Those who possess the special methods taught by the victor Vajradhara (which will be explained) are able to bind their dhātus such that there are no outflows.• When fire (with its abilities to cleanse, refine, and so forth) binds mercury, it can be bound properly. Analogously, when the fires of the three mudrās—karmamudrā, dharmamudrā or jñānamudrā, and mahāmudrā— bind their dhātus without outflows, [yogins and yoginīs] can progress on the inner path described below.• (“When” [in the root verse] connects this verse with the next one.)
There are three mudrās: [karmamudrās, jñānamudrās, and mahāmudrā]. The first, karmamudrās, are of three types: mantra-born ones, field-born ones, and family-born ones.
1. Mantra-born ones are qualified mudrās whose excellent qualities equal those of [the yogin or yoginī] himself or herself, and who have become accomplished through the power of their mantra practice.
2. Field-born ones belong to the families of heroes and heroines born in the fields, which are part of the thirty-two sacred regions.
3. Family-born ones have the signs of their particular family, with the colors and emblems of [one of] the five families.
Jñānamudrās are united with by such means as meditating on yidams who are male and female consorts. In actuality, they do not exist, and yet they [appear as] conceptually imputed, mental awareness-consorts. Mahāmudrā, or the excellent mudrā,[351] is neither another’s body nor a mental awareness-consort: it is emptiness endowed with the most sublime of manifestations.• [169]
These methods [taught by the Victor] have the ability to bind, and when they do, they transform what they bind into something sublime. An analogy is fire binding mercury. [Normally,] the instant fire contacts mercury, it flees. However, if special substances are used, fire can bind mercury. [Typically,] when a vajra contacts a lotus, dhātus are released. However, if we have special methods, contact can bind [the dhātus]. If mercury is bound, iron can be transformed into gold. If the dhātus are bound, the dreg-skandhas and dreg-dhātus can be transformed into buddhahood.†

By doing so, their thick and thin bodhichittas do not leak, and the winds of one lagna cease.[352] They are, thereby, united directly with the actuality of seeing the truth.

Next, [yogins and yoginīs] train in the branch of recollection with its characteristics of the path of meditation. By practicing with the sixteen recollections—recollecting the ten pāramitās, the three jewels, ethical conduct, generosity, and deities—or the recollection of the sixteen joys, [yogins and yoginīs] stabilize their bindus in a state of no-release. [170] During the period of [training in] samādhi, [their bindus] naturally ascend. By proceeding in that way, [yogins and yoginīs] attain the twelve bhūmis sequentially. When the 21,600 karmic winds and so forth cease in [the chakras], from the jewel [or pistils] to the head, there are corresponding numbers of moments of unchanging bliss and so forth.
[Yogins and yoginīs] progress through the twelve bhūmis to become buddhas as follows. [The cessation of the winds] in the jewel [or pistils] results in the attainment of the bhūmi of engagement through belief. [The cessation of the winds] in each of the five chakras—from the secret chakra to the head—results in the attainment of two [bhūmis] in each chakra, which are the ten bhūmis of noble bodhisattvas. [The cessation of the winds] in the uṣhṇīṣha results in the attainment of the bhūmi of a buddha.

The Sixteen Joys
The four joys that arise by binding bodhichitta are categorized as the joys of body, speech, mind, and wisdom, resulting in the following sixteen.
► The four joys of body are the joy of joy, the supreme joy of joy, the special joy of joy, and the connate joy of joy, which are experienced in the head.
► The four joys of speech are the joy of supreme joy and so forth, which are experienced in the throat.
► The four joys of mind are the joy of special joy and so forth, which are experienced in the heart.
► The four joys of wisdom are the joy of connate joy and so forth, which are experienced in the navel.
By practicing in a way in which the joys, that is, the sixteen types of great compassion, are inseparable from the sixteen emptinesses, [171] the channels, winds, bindus, and twelve links of dependent origination are purified from the secret place upward. This is explained in detail in the Stainless Light.•

In the context of the ground, it is taught that the sixteen digits of white dhātus divided into method and prajñā are the thirty-two major marks, and that the basic forty kā-string of red [dhātus] divided into method and prajñā is the eighty minor marks. When those are free from obscurations, the body is a rūpakāya, which benefits others. It is a gorgeous flower blooming with the thirty-two excellent major marks and the eighty excellent minor marks. It is two kāyas: the nirmāṇakāya (the vajra body of buddhas) and the saṃbhogakāya (vajra speech). True, complete awakening is attained in a single instant within the dharmadhātu. That is the dharmakāya, or vajra mind, which benefits oneself and is distinguished by being great bliss. Thus, the Bhagavat said.
Within his unerring vision of suchness, the Bhagavat taught the way in which the sixty-four excellent qualities abide as the ground in the Two-Part [Hevajra Tantra], a niruttara tantra.• He also taught this in the Stainless Light,† as well as in the Ornament of Clear Realization[354] and the Highest Continuum,[355] which [reflect] the meaning of the sūtras.

What illnesses do the dregs create? Phlegm illnesses, which are created by the dregs of the white elements, are based in the brain. They reside above, but, since they are essentially of the natures of earth and water, they move below and appear in lower areas as illnesses of the hips, waist, and so forth. Wind illnesses, which are created by the dregs of Rāhu, are based at the navel and secret place and, thus, abide below; but since they are essentially of the nature of wind, they rise up and produce illnesses above, such as headaches.
Bile and blood illnesses, which are produced by the dregs of the red elements, are based at the liver and, thus, reside in between. However, since they are of an unstable nature, when they are associated with wind as an assisting [force], they blaze up, like fire, producing illnesses in the upper areas. When they are associated with phlegm as an assisting [force], they move below, like water, producing illnesses in the lower areas.
Those three types of illnesses have the three poisons as their roots. Mind-streams with bewilderment produce phlegm. Mindstreams with aggression generate bile. Mindstreams with desire create winds; consequently, wind illnesses act as aids, increasing the development of all diseases. [173] The [Root Tantra of] the Eight Branches says:[357]
Desire, aggression, and bewilderment
are the causes that, respectively, generate wind, bile, and phlegm.[358]

Not only do those three flaws create problems in the body, they also produce three flaws in the minds meditative concentration: joyful bliss, examination and analysis, and moving thoughts. The solar dregs create blood and bile illnesses as problems in the body, and they give rise to the fire-like examination and analysis as flaws in the minds meditative concentration. The lunar dregs produce the phlegm illnesses in the body and the water-like joyful bliss in the mind. The dregs of Rāhu cause wind illnesses in the body and the wind-like moving thoughts in the mind.
Those three flaws are the reasons that the external worlds, the environments, disintegrate. The first meditative concentration (as well as everything below it) is the highest point destroyed by fire. The second [meditative concentration] is destroyed by water, and the third by wind. The reason [those three elements cause such destruction] is that each level has one of the three inner flaws of meditative concentration. [174]
It is taught that the reason the fourth meditative concentration cannot be destroyed by fire, water, or wind is that it is not moved by the three faults; however, since it is impermanent, its environment and beings are equally subject to arising and disintegration.•

Externally, space supports the environment, and earth supports beings. In the same way, the internal dhātus of space and earth serve as supports for the abiding of those two, body and mind. These two [dhātus] are without flaws that destroy the external environment and its internal beings. The wise (who are skilled in the removal of hindrances), knowing the vital points that are the excellent qualities of these two (space and earth), are able to conquer the flaws of the three, water, fire, and wind.
As for the vital points of space and earth: the lower wind is the earth dhātu and the upper wind is the space dhātu. The flaws of wind are corrected when the lower wind is drawn up. The flaws of water (phlegm) are corrected when the upper wind is stopped. The flaws of fire (bile) are corrected when both [winds] are expelled externally.•

[175] At the time of the ground, the material bindus (the five dhātus), the imagined mantra bindus, and the dependent wind bindus are linked to connate ignorance as supports and supported. These three bindus are adulterated by dualistic perceptions, and have outflows that sully the nature of reflexive awareness. They are said, therefore, to be the ground that produces the defects of saṃsāra. Nevertheless, it is also taught that, when they are embraced by the special methods of the gurus’ key instructions for binding them, they serve as remedies that will destroy saṃsāra. This accords with the statement in the Two-Part [Hevajra Tantra]:•
The incorrigible actions of people, whatever they are, will cause bondage.
But with methods, those very [actions] will free beings from the bonds of saṃsāra.[359]

Since “people” is explicitly stated in the middle [verse], it can be applied to all [the verses on] the three bindus. People with long-standing (that is, beginningless) great passion and desire are impelled by their karma and mental afflictions to be born in the three states of cyclic existence (the desire, form, and formless [realms]). For the sake of freeing their mind-streams from the causes and results of their impassioned desires, [the Bhaga-vat] taught meditations on the white and red material bindus.
For the sake of quickly freeing the mindstreams of people from their great aggression, which forces them to be born with evil bodies, [the Bhagavat] taught the stages of meditation on the imagined mantra bindus.
To protect people whose mindstreams are deluded by great bewilderment from birth in the three states of cyclic existence, to enable them to attain the eight resultant siddhis (such as of pills or eye salves), and to cause resultant wisdom that is endowed with the most sublime of manifestations to appear directly to their sense faculties, [the Bhagavat] taught meditations on the wind bindus.
Here the use of the word “great” to qualify the three poisons signifies that the three poisons are full-blown; it does not, however, mean that they are the same as what are referred to by the expressions “great desire” and so forth, which are wisdoms that conquer the three poisons. [177]

As for the channels, winds, and bindus taught in these three chapters: In terms of the provisional meaning, the channels support the winds, the winds support the bindus, and so forth. In terms of the definitive meaning, they manifest as appearing qualities of the mind. They are, mutually, dependently originated appearances. Being supports for connate wisdom, they are called “vajra body.” This is taught, in general, in the niruttara tantras and, in particular, in the Two-Part [Hevajra Tantra], where it says:
In Sukhāvatī, the lady’s bhaga, the teacher with the thirty-two major marks, the principal one with the eighty minor marks, abides in the form of shukra.[361]
According to the teachings of the exalted seventh [Karmapa, Chödrak Gyatso,] and his spiritual sons, three verses and one line [of the Hevajra Tantra, that is, part 2, chapter 2, verses 41-44a] explain that at the time of the ground the two rūpakāyas abide in the body in the form of semen (shukra); that the dhātus and bliss are mutually dependent; that the unification abiding in the body is the heart of the buddhas; and that the evolving gotra is the same as the vajra body.•

The abiding states of the channels, winds, and bindus (which are of the natures of the three vajras) have been explained. Through the interrelationships of those three, the four states—deep sleep and the others—manifest. If we do not understand the connections between the consciousnesses and wisdoms related to the four states, we will not understand the ways their corresponding stains are purified. Not understanding those, the four wisdoms will not manifest. When those do not manifest, the four kāyas do not appear. Therefore, following [the chapters on] the channels, winds, and bindus, chapter 6 presents the connections between ground, path, and result, and the interdependence of the consciousnesses of the four states and their abiding states: the five wisdoms, four mudrās, four kāyas, and so forth.[362]

The way the body develops in the beginning was explained above in chapter 2. The present period of abiding, which follows birth, is composed of four states. These four are as follows. The state of deep sleep is when, through the power of not recognizing our own nature and fixating on percepts and perceivers, the six modes of consciousness are unclear and have gathered into the ālaya. The dream state is when mentation with its formative forces arises from that [state of deep sleep]. The state of sexual union is when the latent tendencies for release are experienced. The ordinary waking period is when, through the operative consciousnesses manifesting as images of percepts and perceivers, the six modes of consciousness engage their objects. These four are the states of the four kāyas that have not been purified of stains.

Although the classifications of ground, path, and result are explained in many ways in the tantras and their commentaries, the Kālachakra [system], which [reflects] the ultimate definitive meaning, discusses the phenomena of ground, path, and result in terms of four models [or states]. As the [Kālachakra] Root Tantra says:
Waking, dreams, deep sleep,
and the fourth, the bliss arising from the two organs .. .[364]
Among these four states, [the state of sleep is described as follows]. During deep sleep the ālaya is the primary one among the eight modes of consciousness. As for its location, it abides in the channel at the center of the dharmachakra at the heart. The movements [or operations] of the six modes of consciousness are not lucid ones, and they reside in the ālaya in the sense of having dissolved there.
When the delusion of deep sleep is purified, the fruition of luminosity manifests. It is also called “mirror-like wisdom,” among the five wisdoms. Among the four kāyas, this is the dharmakāya. Since the dharmakāya is of a nature that is free from conceptual elaborations, it is also considered to be of the nature of the dharmadhātu wisdom. That is the reason for the use of the word “also” in the previous [statement].•

[The belief in] a self-entity of persons is to consider our continuum’s five skandhas (such as forms) to be a self in four mistaken ways: as permanent, as an entity, as pleasurable, and as an identity. The remedy for that is to realize the unreality [of those four mistaken views] by means of the prajñā that [develops from] meditating on the path of the sixteen divisions of the four truths.• That [remedy brings the realization of] the lack of a self-entity of persons.
Phenomena have [the possibility of] two self-entities: as percept and as perceiver. To realize that those lack inherent natures by means of profound prajñā is [the realization of] the lack of self-entity of phenomena.
Shrāvakas [realize] only one thing: the lack of a self-entity of persons. In addition to that, pratyekabuddhas understand that external referents lack an inherent nature. Thus, with their [recognition of] half of the lack of a self-entity of phenomena, they realize one and a half absences of selfentity. Since bodhisattvas realize that all phenomena lack an inherent nature, they realize the two absences of self-entity in their entirety. Those remedial cognitions, graduated [according to the capacities of] the three types of individuals, are what purify [stains].

It is taught that, at the end of each of the three yānas’ continuum of their path of training, their path of meditation’s vajra-like samādhi destroys [their particular one of] the three kinds of stains (coarse and subtle) and achieves [their particular one of] the three types of awakening in which stains have been purified.† [182]
To facilitate our understanding, [I include Karma Tinle’s explanation that] correlates the three yānas’ three remedies to the twofold absence of self-entity.[366]
The shrāvakas’ remedial cognitions realize only the lack of a self-entity of persons and purify the afflictive obscurations. Thus, at the end of the shrāvakas’ continuum of their path of training, their path of meditation’s vajra-like samādhi completely destroys the stains of mental afflictions and brings the achievement of the shrāvakas’ awakening (among the three types of purity).
The pratyekabuddhas’ remedial cognitions realize one and a half absences of self-entity: the absence of a self-entity [of persons] and the absence of a self-entity of perceived phenomena (which is one part of the absence of a self-entity of phenomena). Their remedial cognitions purify the obscurations involved in taking external referents to be real. Thus, at the end of the pratyekabuddhas’ continuum of their path of training, their path of meditation’s vajra-like samādhi destroys the stains of taking external referents to be real and brings the achievement of the pratyekabuddhas’ awakening (among the three types of purity).
The bodhisattvas’ remedial cognitions fully realize both the absence of a self-entity of persons and the absence of a self-entity of phenomena. They purify the two obscurations along with their latent tendencies. Thus, at the end of the bodhisattvas’ continuum, their path of meditation’s vajra-like samādhi destroys the stains of negative propensities with their latent tendencies and brings the achievement of unsurpassable awakening, the purity of the Mahāyāna (among the three types of purity).

Adventitious obscurations are purified through the force of remedial meditations. Therefore, those who wish [to achieve] buddhahood in one lifetime should meditate on mahāmudrā, the clear yet nonconceptual[367] luminosity of the day, and on the clear yet nonconceptual luminosity of sleep at night. [183] This alone is the true short path.
The way to meditate on the two luminosities is to savor, and enjoy, unified mahāmudrā: emptiness endowed with the most sublime of manifestations.• That [approach] encompasses [the two daytime luminosities and the two nighttime luminosities]. During the day, there are the luminosities of the four joys, [experienced] by practicing chaṇḍālī yoga, and the luminosity of an illusory body, which is connate joy arising as the body of an illusory deity. At night, there are the luminosities of deep sleep and dreams.

Here the omniscient Chödrak Gyatso states that emptiness endowed with the most sublime of manifestations and sugatagarbha are synonymous.[368] “Endowed with the most sublime of manifestations” means that sugatagarbha actually possesses the sixty-four excellent qualities of separation and maturation. “Emptiness” means that those [qualities] do not exist as identifiable [entities] or as characteristics. The practice of that is to meditate on clarity but without concepts, [in other words:] mahāmudrā meditation.

The second state is that of the dreaming mind. During deep sleep, the seven modes [of consciousness] with their accompanying [mental events] have dissolved into the ālaya. Following that, the mental consciousness is sparked by the life-force wind—the afflictive mentation with its latent tendencies—and it surfaces with the formative forces. [184] Moving through the channels, and under the influence of the sense of a self, it creates various dream delusions involving the dualistic appearances of percepts and perceivers.
When those delusions are purified, [the dreaming mind] is the saṃbhogakāya (among the four kāyas). Objects, faculties, and their consciousnesses are clear and discrete. Since [the dream state] is beyond having any reality related to particles, it is the inseparability of appearances and emptiness. In terms of its essence, [the dreaming mind] embodies two wisdoms: the purity of the inward-oriented aspect of the sixth mentation [or mental consciousness] is the discriminating wisdom, and the purity of the seventh mentation is the wisdom of equality. Among the five wisdoms, [the dreaming mind] has those two aspects.

The dhātus• and the channel locations where dreams arise create different kinds of dreams. The channels themselves are varied: there are upper ones, lower ones, ones in between, wide ones, narrow ones, and so forth.
When our mentation, accompanied by the life-force wind, goes above and dreams arise in our head and related places, we experience images of going to the gods’ lands, moving through the sky, ascending high mountains, or climbing stairs and trees. When our mentation goes to our visual channels and dreams arise there, we see images of forms vividly. When our mentation is in our auditory channels and dreams arise there, we hear sounds. When our mentation travels to our olfactory channels and dreams arise there, we experience smells. When our mentation moves in our gustatory channels and dreams arise there, we experience tastes. When our mentation goes to our body faculty’s channels and dreams arise there, we experience tangible objects. The appearances of each of those objects manifest distinctly.
The following types of dreams occur [when our mentation accompanied by the life-force wind] moves in the areas below the heart. In terms of the three paths,[370] when mentation moves through the path for excretion, the hells and so forth appear. When it moves through the path for existence, hungry ghosts appear. When it moves through the path for urine, animals manifest. When our mentation moves in a general sense [through the channels] in the lower areas, we experience images of descending or going into rocky ravines, dense forests, and other such places. We may also have dreams of darkness, ones in which everything is unclear, and the like.
When our mentation, aroused by the life-force wind, goes into channel locations in the middle areas (such as the heart), we experience general images of the terrestrial realms, such as the four continents. When it goes into the specific channels to the front, right, rear, or left, images of the eastern, southern, western, or northern directions arise respectively. When it moves through wide channels, wide-open spaces appear. When it moves through narrow channels, we experience images of very narrow places and suchlike.
When the death omens arise due to wind-mind moving through the rasanā on the right, in our dreams we will experience the appearances of going repeatedly to the southern direction. This is discussed in the Kālachakra. [186]

The myriad dream appearances arise due to the power of latent tendencies. Therefore, when yogins and yoginīs meditate on, and engage in the practices related to, the channels, winds, and bodhichittas, they examine what arises in their dreams. When the latent tendencies of their channels, winds, and bodhichitta-dhātus have been purified, [yogins and yoginīs know their] dream appearances to be illusion-like. When those have not been purified, they will relate to the double delusion [of their dreams] with reification. Thus, they know whether their channels, winds, and so forth, have been purified or not on the basis of what arises in their dreams.
Since dream appearances and bardo appearances are somewhat similar, [dreams] can demonstrate [an understanding of] the instructions for the bardo. Dreams also enable [yogins and yoginīs] to test themselves as to what path their consciousness will take when the appearances of transferring to the next world arise. Consequently, the instructions are, “Penetrate the vital points of dreams.”•

It is necessary to penetrate the vital points of dreams. Dreams are the appearances of our own mind. Those are the reasons [dreams] must be bound using jñānamudrās. The basic [practice] is the mantra bindu [meditations] of recognizing appearances to be palaces and the illusory forms of deities, sounds to be mantras, and so forth. Additionally, there are meditations on the illusion-like suchness of imputed conceptual objects.• Such instructions enable us, through training in [the recognition of] dream appearances as illusions, to perfect the paths and bhūmis in a single stride.
Here, for fear of being too wordy, I will not present the details of such topics with their many causes and results or the means for purifying dreams, all of which are taught in the sūtras and tantras.† Saying that, [Rangjung Dorje] suggests we refer to other instructions.
Saṃsāric delusions arise from latent tendencies. Dreams are created by the super-delusion of sleep and, consequently, are nothing but doubledelusion. They are saṃsāra and to be abandoned. That is additional advice [from Rangjung Dorje] about the objects to be abandoned.

Undeluded dreams, which do not involve the latent tendencies for mental afflictions, are remedies for deluded dreams. The reason for stating that there are such [dreams] is as follows. Among the mental factors, there are four changeable factors: sleep, contrition, investigation, and analysis. Since those can be anything—virtuous, unvirtuous, definite, not definite, factors to be abandoned, or remedies—there is sleep that is a remedy. Since there is such sleep, there are also dreams that are remedies.
Because dreams not involving double-delusion are remedial, the Sūtra Presenting Dreams[374] describes to the bodhisattva *Vajra Prasphoṭaka the various dreams of bodhisattvas who dwell on the ten bhūmis.•
In that case, we might think, “Dreams are produced by wind, bile, or phlegm, and it was already explained that those [three humors] are generated by the mental afflictions. [190] Since it is taught that [bodhisattvas] on the first bhūmi and higher are liberated from the mental afflictions, it is not logical that beings on the ten bhūmis have dreams.” [The answer is as follows.] The circumstances for those [bhūmi-dwelling bodhisattvas’] dreams are different: their dreams are caused by their taking on undefiled dhātus—that is to say, while on the bhūmis with the latent tendencies for ignorance and the bhūmis of undefiled karma, [bodhisattvas] assume a body of a mental nature and act like saṃsāric beings.† This accords with the statement in the Highest Continuum:
[Bodhisattvas] are liberated from birth, death, sickness, and aging, and have realized the nature of this [tathāgatagarbha], just as it is.
Even though the wise are free from the forces of birth and the rest, that [realization impels] them to display [birth and the rest][375] out of their compassion for beings.[376]

our consciousness follows the sequence of the four joys.
With passion, first it is at the head; [191]
second, at the throat; and third,

This causes fire and moon to mix, at which point

In those of us sentient beings with the desire for sexual union, where does our consciousness abide during our experience of changeable bliss?[378] Our consciousness (which experiences the four joys) follows the sequence of the four joys. With the first [moment] of passion, our consciousness gathers in the head chakra, at which time bodhichittas with the characteristics of movement abide there.
Second, when joy is experienced, our consciousness is at the throat. Third, when supreme joy is experienced, it descends from the heart to the navel. Our consciousness gathering at the navel causes the A stroke’s fire and the moon (which has fallen from the HAṂ) to mix in the lower end[379] of the madhyamā. At which point connate joy is experienced within the shaṅkhinī channel.
That connate wisdom is a cognition of a single instant. In terms of its essence, [this cognition] has three qualities: its eight modes of consciousness are unimpeded in their own natures and are distinctively lucid; its experience is bliss; and its essence is nonconceptuality. Its essence is not stained by the afflictions. In the context of the ground, [this cognition] is called the “wisdom kāya.” The other three joys involve conceptuality. Connate joy arises as being of the nature of wisdom; nevertheless, since it is not recognized, its cessation is followed by the arising of joy-without-joy.• [192]
That describes the sequence of the four joys and the recognition of connate wisdom in the context of the impure state.
What is the nature of the purity [of this state]? When the obscurations of confusion during the state of sexual union have been cleansed by remedies and purified, everything in apparent existence is just that: suchness, connate wisdom itself. Thus, [the mind during sexual union] arises as the play of three kāyas. The six modes of consciousness are unimpeded in their own natures, lucid yet distinct; they are of the nature of the nirmāṇakāya. Great bliss, which is without outflows, or defilements, is the saṃbhogakāya. [Mind’s quality of] being empty (the pervader) and yet naturally luminous is the dharmakāya. That is how [the mind during sexual union] manifests as the play of three kāyas.
This connate wisdom is present in all phenomena as the pervader, and all phenomena possess the identity of the connate state. We must penetrate the vital points, that is, meditate on it using our guru’s key instructions.•

Saṃsāra, as just described, is simply delusive appearances that manifest to those who do not recognize the wisdom of connate joy—it does not exist by way of its own characteristics. [193] Who is ignorant? As sentient beings who have not purified the stains of our dualistic apprehension and who, therefore, mistakenly take objects and perceiving subjects to be separate things, we are ignorant. Of what are we ignorant? We are ignorant of connate great bliss, which has the characteristic of being instantaneous. How are we ignorant? Not recognizing what abides within ourselves, and taking that to be something other than ourselves, we are ignorant in the sense that we imagine objects.
By being ignorant in those ways, our great bliss (bodhichitta) fades, and our three poisons are aroused.• Under those influences and against our wishes, we appear to roam and wander around saṃsāra.

The Kālachakra and other sources state that released bliss is the root of saṃsāra because simply not recognizing the wisdom of connate joy arouses our three poisons and causes us to circle in saṃsāra.[380] Chapter 1 [line 6] states:
This [mind] is itself ignorant of itself...
Here [line 92] says:
... we do not recognize instantaneous great bliss.
Their import is identical. The common dharma expression is that ignorance is the root of saṃsāra. If that is explained as intuitively aware wisdom being ignorant of its own nature, it accords with the meaning [of what is stated] here.

Not recognizing the nature of connate wisdom involves outflow [or release], which stimulates our three poisons and sets us cycling [in saṃsāra]. The way this develops is as follows. The first [moment] of passion, feeling joy, is desire. In between, although we experience the wisdom of connate joy, we do not understand it, and it becomes bewilderment. Afterward, since our dhātus have faded, we lack desire and become aggressive.
Then, desiring bliss again and being attached to our own bliss, we experience the miserliness of not wanting to give others any [bliss]. We also are jealous in that we do not want others to have bliss. We rouse all the mental afflictions and behave badly—we engage fully in nonvirtuous actions. That creates, and propels us to, all negative states and the like. [194]

Once we turn away, even slightly, from that unvirtuous behavior (which is an impure force causing saṃsāra), we have [instead] a state of mind that wishes to benefit ourselves and others. We will cast aside and abandon all flaws, such as miserliness, jealousy, and attachment. As remedies for those, we are generous with material things and eschew aggression. Not harming others, we maintain the ethical conduct of the ten virtues, which reverses any lack of conscientiousness in our mindstream. We cultivate patience toward difficulties and wish for the happiness found in the pleasurable states of the desire realm. We thereby achieve the higher states of humans and gods in the desire realm. That describes the cause and effect relationship of meritorious karma. [195]
By cutting off our attachment to our desires, we find happiness in the concentrations [of the form realm] and in the formless [realm]. Through meditating in those absorptions, we take birth in one of the sixteen levels of the form realm or one of the four states of the formless realm. That describes the cause and effect relationship of stable karma.
Nevertheless, even though we are free from the negative states, the higher ones have saṃsāric suffering. Being attached to, and fixated upon, the pleasure of desire creates the three poisons. Like the previous states, our experience of the concentrations involves attachment, which increases our three poisons. Those keep us suffering and circling in saṃsāra, as if we were on a water wheel. That demonstrates the cause and effect relationship of nonmeritorious karma and, by implication, the faults of saṃsāra.

When the outflows in the three realms are known to be the reflexive radiance of the deluded mind, the prajñā realizing no-self will destroy attachment and the rest, the causes of the three realms. Those are the factors to be abandoned on the lower path [or Hīnayāna]. The path of seeing conquers the imagined factors to be abandoned, and the path of meditation conquers the innate ones. Longing for the partial peace of nirvāṇa, that nirvāṇa is achieved, whereby concern for others is forsaken. Those who abide there in their own peace[381] are called shrāvaka or pratyekabuddha arhats.

The force of their prajñā and compassion enables bodhisattvas to abandon longing for both existence (saṃsāra) and peace (a partial nirvāṇa). [196] In order to benefit sentient beings, they engage in practices that [reflect] the equality of existence and peace. That is the path of bodhisattvas.

Those who wish to enter the Vajrayāna’s short path train their mind in the causal yānas and then [receive] the four empowerments and [practice] the two processes. Through [binding] the four doors of physical outflow, they achieve mastery of binding the dhātus with no outflows and relinquish the four defilements of mind. At that point, fruition is complete. The ways to do that are taught extensively in the Vajrayāna.
The four doors of physical outflow are:
► the uvula above;
► the shaṅkhinī below;
► the hair pores and faculties through which there is outflow to other objects; and
► very coarse objects or situations, such as beautiful forms or feeling strong anger.•
The four mental defilements are:
► the defilements of desire, which are the mental afflictions of the desire realm that are neither ignorance nor views;[382]
► the defilements of existence, which are the mental afflictions of the higher realms that are neither of those two [that is, ignorance and views];
► the defilement of ignorance, which is the ignorance that is [first in] the links of dependent origination and is the cause of the three realms; and
► the defilements of views, which are wrong views, such as the sixty-two types.
Shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas abandon the defilements of desire and existence but are unable to abandon the other two.[383] Bodhisattvas intentionally abandon the defilements of ignorance and views. They do not, however, abandon the defilements of desire and existence because they consciously take countless births in existence.•

The four joys are the vital points to be bound. In terms of their natures, they are the illustrative four joys and the actual four joys. The illustrative four joys are what reveal. They are distinguished by having mundane characteristics and being [the bliss that is] based on bodhichittas.[384] The actual four joys are what are revealed. They are distinguished by having transmundane characteristics, and by being the bliss that is recognized to be reflexive awareness.
Their order is the forward and reverse sequences of joy (as the first), supreme joy, special joy, and connate joy.• Sixteen subdivisions are described.† The problems with outflows and the methods for binding are as explained above. The benefits of binding, their purification, causes and results, and forward and reverse sequences have been explained briefly in the section on bindus.‡ In the niruttara tantras, the victor Vajradhara gave detailed presentations on all those topics.
Binding with karmamudrās is important as a method for purifying the [cognitive] stains present during the state of sexual union.§ “Here I will not write extensively, just briefly” is [Rangjung Dorje’s] statement that shows the necessity of training in these topics in connection with the key instructions.

The nature of cognition during the ordinary period, that is, our waking state, is as follows. The ālaya consciousness is conditioned by afflictive mentation and so forth, as described above in chapter 1. Through the interplay of the four conditions (such as the causal condition), the six modes of consciousness (such as the visual one) connect with the six faculties, which are the dominant conditions, and manifest as images appearing as the six objects (such as forms). Not understanding these to be our own mind, we have three types of feelings: feelings of happiness in relation to pleasant objects, feelings of suffering in relation to unpleasant objects, and feelings of indifference in relation to neutral ones. These feelings produce, respectively, desire, aggression, and bewilderment. The latent tendencies of those [afflictions] are carried by the immediate mentation and deposited in the ālaya. On the basis of the latent tendencies of the karmic formative forces, again, the karma of formative forces newly accumulates, causing us to circle repeatedly in saṃsāra.•

[199] When this ordinary cognition is purified of obscurations, it is of the nature of three wisdoms. Purified afflictive mentation is the wisdom of equality, which acts for the welfare of others unwaveringly. Purified imagination—that is, the sixth, mental consciousness—is discriminating wisdom. The purified consciousnesses of the five sense doors and their objects are the wisdom that accomplishes activities. Additionally, we should be aware that the purified ālaya is mirror-like wisdom, and that the dharma-dhātu wisdom is the primordially pure nature that is the essence of each of those four wisdoms.•

Obscurations are the factors abandoned through seeing and meditation. 6.139
Their remedies are four:
conviction, the absences of self-entity, samādhis, and compassion.
Once those purify, the results are
the nirmāṇakāya, which acts for the welfare of beings,

The factors to be abandoned, which obscure the reality of the abiding state, are of two types:
► the coarse imagined factors abandoned through [the path of] seeing, which develop under the corrupting influences of philosophical tenet systems; and
► the subtle innate factors abandoned through [the path of] meditation, which have not developed from [such influences].
In brief, the remedies that are the means for relinquishing [those two types of obscurations] are four:
1. cultivation of conviction about the Mahāyāna dharma;
2. prajñā that realizes both absences of self-entity;
3. entering through the doors to samādhis; and
4. great compassion.
Those will destroy the factors to be abandoned.• [200]

Once the obscurations of the ordinary waking state are purified by those remedies, the principal results that manifest are the nirmāṇakāya and saṃbhogakāya. The nirmāṇakāya is the purity of the five sense consciousnesses and the outward-oriented aspect of the sixth mentation. Since the sixth mentation moved by[386] the formative forces is essentially the same as it is in dreams, the inward-oriented aspect of the sixth mentation (which resembles [mentation in] dreams) is the saṃbhogakāya. The two rūpakāyas, which act for the welfare of beings, are the results of the purification of the waking state.•
Since those modes are taught extensively in the dharma found in the sūtras and tantras, here I have provided just a brief summary because of my concern with being too wordy.

The nirmāṇakāya is attained through purifying the stains of the waking state. We should bind thoughts using the practices of dharmamudrās.† Although there are numerous ways of explaining the dharmamudrās, the intention in this context is expressed in the key instructions for taking whatever appearances are encountered as the path. When the appearances of various objects (such as forms) arise, do not cling to them thinking,[387]
“This is such and such”; instead, bind them with the mudrā of being free from fixation. The statement “Whatever arises, preserve its naked state without fabrication” is the true vital point for our practice. The previous Kagyu masters are unanimous in teaching this.•

The appearances of the four states disturb our mindstream, and we mistake them to be perceived objects with perceiving subjects. By conceiving of self and other, the external and internal appear to us as separate. Even so, all external appearances are simply the reflexive light of our mind— they are not substances different from our mind. In accordance with the Kālachakra’s teachings on the unity of the external, internal, and “other,” [this chapter] will explain how the worldly realms are complete within the body, thereby [demonstrating] the one-to-one correspondences between the external and internal.•

Next, following what was just explained [in chapter 6, this chapter discusses that] as it is with the internal vajra body, so it is in the external worlds, which is the case because both the external and internal are mental appearances. This may cause us to wonder, “Do the bodies of those in the desire realm resemble [only] the physical worlds of the desire realm? Or do they resemble all three realms?” Since they are appearances of mind, all three realms are identified with the internal. [203]
Not understanding that everything external and internal is an appearance of mind, we, as sentient beings, are under the influence of our conceptual imaginations. We imagine the physical world, with its measurements and shapes, in many ways. Those who are non-Buddhists believe that the world was created by Brahma or Vishnu.[388] Within our own tradition, the two Proponents of Referents state that external referents are collections of real subtle particles. [Holders of such views] are the opponents refuted in the great treatises composed by Nāgārjuna and others.•

<d e="2">
Again, we may wonder, “Given the differing accounts of the measurements and configurations of the worlds in the Kālachakra system, the abhi-dharma, and elsewhere, which one resembles the internal body?” No matter which one is correlated [to the internal body], there is no contradiction. The common vehicles state that dominant results appear as places, which is [their way of] explaining that the external world appears due to the force of the internal body. Since the Mahāyāna teaches that phenomena are nothing other than mental appearances, all worldly realms can be assigned to yogins’ or yoginīs’ bodies.
An illustration of this is the story of the occasion when the Tathāgata and his retinue were in a cave five cubits in size. A chakravartin king with his troops arrived and entered the cave. Although the cave did not appear to become any bigger, the spheres of experience of the Buddha and the others did not appear to be in doubt [that is, everyone perceived that they fit in the cave]. On the one hand, the cave seeming to be five cubits was validly cognized as appearing as such, and, on the other hand, the chakravartin and his troops fitting into it was also validly cognized as appearing in that way. Similarly, the measurements and configurations of the worldly realms are validly cognized as appearing as such for each and every person because ultimately no appearance is real. The sūtras and tantras give various descriptions of the worlds, all from the perspectives of the different ways that they are seen by the beings to be trained.

► The thighs, which are water maṇḍalas, are the locations of the Sandy Water Hell and Muddy Water Hell.
► The shins, which are fire maṇḍalas, are the regions of the Fiery Hell and Inexhaustible Smoke Hell.
► The areas below those, which are wind maṇḍalas, are the locations of the Wailing Hell and Great Darkness Hell. [205]
► The soles of the feet are the locations of the eighth hell, the Vajra Hell.†

The doors of the sense faculties are of the natures of the nine planets.
► The two nostrils are the sun and moon, which are the wind planets.
► The eyes are Mars and Jupiter, the fire planets.[391]
► The mouth and the urethra are Mercury and Venus, the water planets.
► The opening of Brahma and the anus are Saturn and Ketu, the earth planets.
► The ears are Rāhu and Kālāgni, the space planets. [208]
Although those are ten in number, since Rāhu and Kālāgni, being the head and tail, are counted as one, they are called the “nine planets.” The ten channels at the heart• are also said to be of the natures of the planets.
► The internal thirty-two teeth are the external twenty-eight lunar mansions and four daṇḍas.
► The internal seventy-two thousand channels, through which dhā-tus flow, are the external seventy-two thousand rivers, which flow through great valleys.
► Since the internal intestines leak flavors and make noises, they are the external rain-producing clouds.
► The internal winds abiding in the body are the winds that move externally.
► The sounds made by the heart are the noises of thunderbolts.
► Stomach rumblings are said to be thunder.†

The fire, or heat, at the heart, the fire at the throat, and the fire at the navel are, respectively, external lightning, the sun’s heat, and burning fire. Since the heat of anger is produced at the heart, it is lightning, forceful and swift.
The fire at the throat performs the function of drawing in food, and the sun performs the function of passing through the twelve houses.• The navel fire and burning fire cause food to burn and melt, and, therefore, are called “pishāchas’ fires.”†

The Stainless Light states:
The fire maṇḍala is blood.
The wind maṇḍala is skin.[392]
The body’s skin, warmth, and body hairs are of the natures of fire and wind. The various kinds of microorganisms born within the body have the four external modes of birth.
► Externally, the wind dhātu is birth from an egg; internally, it is lice.[393]
► The water dhātu is birth through heat and moisture; internally, it is intestinal microorganisms.
► The fire dhātu is birth from a womb; internally, it is the microorganisms that manifest within semen.
► The space dhātu is spontaneous birth; internally, it is all the other small living creatures found in the body.•
The external rain is the amṛita that flows from the uvula internally.† All the lagnas (which are major saṃkrāntis)—and everything from the eight major periods to a single instant, including the breaths, pāṇīpalas, ghaṭikās, and so forth—are explained in terms of the external and internal correspondences that involve the channels, winds, bindus, and mind, as taught before in the sections on the channels, winds, and bindus.
When the life-force wind in the madhyamā unites with the quintessences of the white elements (the lunar dhātus) and the quintessences of the red elements (the solar dhātus), lunar and solar eclipses appear, respectively.
It is taught that at the end of junctures [or cycles] of lagnas and of lunar-day changes, and when six months, or three seasons, are complete, and when the solar padas enter the house of contact in the links of dependent origination, there is the interdependent connection of the internal lagnas moving into the madhyamā.† [210]

The various explanations concerning the corresponding purities of the external and internal, such as those just presented, are said to be limitless because the correlations ascribed to the external worldly realms, the internal vajra body, and the “other” maṇḍala chakras are correspondences with wisdom, mahāmudrā. Here these simply have been summarized due to a concern about becoming too wordy. For more details, we should refer to the Kālachakra Tantra and its commentaries. The thought of the niruttara tantras reveals a portion of the uncommon corresponding purities. [The Hevajra Tantra] says:
Vajra is what is indivisible.
Sattva is the unity of the three existences.[394]
The one-to-one correspondences between the purities of the three states of cyclic existence and the three pure vajras are called “corresponding purities.” In this context, the following can be said.
► The external mountains, continents, and rivers, like maṇḍalas, are vajra body.
► Whatever has the characteristic of time—which means to cycle repeatedly through the divisions of the four seasons or the twelve lagnas, from one breath to years and kalpas—is vajra speech.
► The planets, lunar mansions, rainbows, lightning, quintessence-winds, and space are vajra mind.
► Alternatively, the three states of existence (the subterranean places, terrestrial places, and celestial places) and the three realms are vajra body, vajra speech, and vajra mind.
All such [external features] can be assigned to individual, specific [features] of the three vajras. First, in terms of body: there are correspondences in measurements, such as the one between the four cubits of the body and the four hundred thousand yojanas of the worldly realms, which extend from the wind maṇḍala below up through the Pinnacle of Existence. According to the major texts, they are designated in that way because they are similar entities.•
In terms of speech: all inner tones [correspond to] what is to be expressed about external entities. Their connection is one of congruent dhātus. The inner vajra mind is the single collection of semen, menses, and winds (the supports), and bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality (the supported). All such appearances for the mind manifest through the force of mastering the dhātus.† Therefore, we should understand the congruent qualities of the external and internal, and that they arise in one interdependent mode.

At this point, the foundation for what we must determine through study and reflection has been well established. Now, the path of the two processes that relies on that ground will be presented. The Five Stages states:
For those who settled into the generation process well and then wish for the perfection process, the perfect Buddha taught the methods, like the progression of steps in a staircase.[396]
In keeping with the statement that we must meditate on the generation process first, [this chapter] will show how all the bases of imputation are present within the conceptually imagined generation process. It will also discuss the generation process itself and other related points.

After the presentation of the correspondences between the external and internal, [the discussion of the generation process is] next. Despite being sentient beings’ concepts and not being real, meditations on deities that are conceptually imagined are valuable in the following three practical ways.
► Beginners develop shamatha by concentrating their minds on visualizations.
► [The generation process] facilitates an understanding that all external and internal knowable objects, even the most subtle, correspond to the referents of the maṇḍalas.
► When the fruitional rūpakāyas of the buddhas are mastered, myriad and numerous configurations of the form kāyas are displayed for the benefit of others.
As for the deities and the ways they are generated, the principles of the teachings on the limitless numbers of maṇḍala chakras—from a single hero to infinite principal ones with their retinues—are as follows. (That statement introduces [the chapter] by stating its purpose.)

Since there are [triads of] bindus and channels; body, speech, and mind;

three winds, and so forth; there are three deities.
There are what come [in fours], such as the four dhātus, the pervaded four.

The madhyamā channel, ālaya (which is supported by that), authentic reality, wisdom wind, and the one bindu are bases for purification. They are the grounds for, and what pervade, everything in saṃsāra and nirvāṇa; they are what embody all excellent qualities. [In relationship to those bases for purification,] sādhanas with a single hero-deity, a heruka, are taught as means of purification. The Kālachakra states that all deities arise from the madhyamā channel. Accordingly, since the nature of all [of the above, the madhyamā and so forth] is that they are manifestations of wisdom, they are what make it possible for deities to manifest.•
When the consideration is the means of purification for bases of purification that are twofold phenomena—the fruitional two kāyas, the pair of method and prajñā (as the path), the pair of above and below (as bases of purification).† the pair of white and red dhātus, the two truths, and the like—sādhanas with male and female consorts or a pair of principal and retinue deities are taught, an example of which is connate Chakrasaṃvara [that is, Chakrasaṃvara and consort].
When the consideration is threefold phenomena—the three bindus (such as the root bindu free from elaborations); the three principal channels (madhyamā, rasanā, and lalanā); body, speech, and mind (the three vajras); above, below, and between (the celestial, subterranean, and terrestrial places); the three syllables of OM, AH, and HUM; the three winds of the moon, sun, and Rāhu; and the triad of mind, mentation, and consciousness—sādhanas with three principal and retinue deities are taught; for example, the sādhanas of the protectors belonging to three families. [215]
What is included within “and so forth” is summarized by the following statement in the yoga tantras:
Because they are embodiments of[397] three channels, three winds, three minds, and threefold illumination, there are three deities, three minds, and three faces.[398]

When the consideration is the means of purification for bases of purification that come in fours—the dhātus of earth, water, fire, and wind, the pervaded four (when the space and wisdom dhātus are consigned to being universal pervaders); and what is included within “such as”: the four joys, four vajras, four mudrās, four empowerments, four paths, and four kāyas— sādhanas with four principal and retinue deities are taught, like the maṇḍala of the four sisters in the Glorious Paramādya.[399] This is the thought of statements that everything is grouped into sets of four, such as when the Hevajra Tantra says:
The four truths for noble ones.. .[400]
When the consideration is the means of purification for bases of purification that are fivefold phenomena—such as the five resultant wisdoms; five skandhas (as bases of purification); five chakras (the secret, navel, heart, throat, and head chakras); the winds of earth, water, fire, wind, and space, or the five root winds; five dhātus (earth, water, fire, wind, including space, the pervader); five mental afflictions; five stages; five families; and five kāyas—sādhanas with five principal and retinue deities are presented. Five sets [of deities], such as [the five deities of] Chakrasaṃvara, Hevajra, and Vajrayoginī, are taught in many tantras.
When the consideration is the means of purification for bases of purification that are sixfold phenomena—such as the six dhātus (which, in addition to the four pervaded [dhātus], include the space and wisdom dhātus, classified as two); six modes of consciousness; six channel chakras, which include the uṣhṇīṣha one; six mental afflictions; and six families—sādhanas with six principal and retinue deities are taught; for example, the six chakravartins.
In order to purify the sevenfold collection of the six operative consciousnesses with afflictive mentation (leaving out the ālaya), sādhanas with seven principal and retinue deities are taught, an example of which is the seven-syllable Chakrasaṃvara. [216]

Because the eight modes of consciousnesses are to be purified, maṇḍalas with eight principal and retinue deities are taught, such as the maṇḍala of connate Chakrasaṃvara surrounded by the six armor goddesses.
When the consideration is tenfold phenomena—the ten heart channels (the eight petals of the chakra plus the upper and lower tips [or sections] of the madhyamā); ten winds (the five root and five secondary winds); ten bhūmis (such as Very Joyful); ten strengths (such as knowing what is the case and what is not the case); eight modes of consciousness and the two, objects and perceiving subjects, making ten; and the like—sādhanas with nine or ten principal and retinue deities are taught, as is the case with the nine deities of Hevajra or the maṇḍala of the ten deities of Vishuddha.
In the nine-deity maṇḍala of Hevajra, the principal male and female consorts can be counted separately, making ten deities, in keeping with the number of tenfold phenomena. However, the male and female consorts can also be counted as one, in that they are the unification of method and prajñā. That makes nine deities, which are formulated from the perspective of purifying the eight channel petals at the heart and the madhyamā as the ninth (all bases of purification). In cases such as the five deities of Chakrasaṃvara, there are similar explanations since it is said that the vases and kapālas in the intermediate directions correspond to the purities of the four channels in the intermediate directions of the heart [chakra].

From the point of view of purifying ten—the five skandhas (forms and the others) and five dhātus (such as earth)—there are sādhanas with ten principal and retinue deities. From the perspective of purifying fifteen—the five skandhas, five dhātus, and five faculties (such as the visual one)—there is the fifteenfold maṇḍala of Nairātmyā and goddesses. [217]
In order to purify twelve—the six skandhas (from forms to wisdom) and six dhātus (from earth to wisdom)—there are sādhanas with twelve principal and retinue deities. To purify eighteen—the six skandhas, six dhātus, and six faculties (from the visual one to mentation)—there are sādhanas with eighteen principal and retinue deities. From the standpoint of purifying twenty-four—the six objects plus the previous eighteen—there are sādhanas with twenty-four principal and retinue deities. When the wisdom dhātu and the wisdom skandha are counted as one, there are other maṇḍalas: ones with eleven principal and retinue deities, seventeen, and twenty-three.
There are maṇḍalas with thirty-six deities to purify the six sets with six (making thirty-six): the subcategories of the six dhātus (such as earth-earth, water-earth, fire-earth, wind-earth, space-earth, and wisdom-earth). Such sādhanas of maṇḍalas with thirty-six principal and retinue deities are also taught from the perspective of purifying six [other] sets with six (making thirty-six): six skandhas, six dhātus, six faculties, six objects, six faculties of action—the arms, legs, voice,[401] the orifice for feces and the one for urine, and the supreme organ [that is, the genitals]—and six functions [of the faculties of action]—walking, taking, speaking, releasing feces and urine, and releasing semen [that is, sexual fluids].
From the perspective of the aforementioned fivefold phenomena, there are sādhanas with five deities. When the consideration is nine—as in the case of the [two] principal ones among tenfold phenomena being united, or the five skandhas and the four pervaded dhātus [that is, earth, water, fire, and wind]—there are nine deities. When the consideration is thirteen—such as when the four chakras are added to those nine, or the thirteen consist of the twelve skandhas and dhātus, and the faculties with their appearing objects are counted as one—there are thirteen principal and retinue deities.

There are sādhanas with twenty-five principal and retinue deities when the consideration is twenty-five, as in the six objects (such as forms) and six faculties (such as the visual one) being added to those thirteen; or twenty-five being the five skandhas, five dhātus, the five physical sense faculties, the five objects, and the five perceiving subjects of those objects; or twenty-five that, in addition to the ten skandhas and dhātus, include the twelve āya-tanas and body, speech, and mind.
There are sādhanas with thirty-two principal and retinue deities when the consideration is thirty-two, as in the five faculties of action, the chakra at the secret place, and the uṣhṇīṣha chakra being added to those twenty-five; or thirty-two where the twelve āyatanas are added to the fivefold sets of skandhas, dhātus, faculties, and objects; or the thirty-two channel petals of the throat or secret chakras; or the thirty-two principal channels. [218]
There are sādhanas with thirty-four principal and retinue deities when the consideration is thirty-four, as in the case of the supreme organ and the completion of joy being added to the aforementioned thirty-two; or thirty-four that consists of the sixfold sets of skandhas, dhātus, faculties, and objects (making twenty-four), to which are added the six faculties of action, body, speech, mind, and wisdom.
When the consideration is thirty-seven—the sixfold sets of skandhas, dhātus, faculties, objects, [faculties of] action, and functions [of the faculties of action] (making thirty-six), and body and speech as one—there are sādhanas with thirty-seven principal and retinue deities. When the consideration is classifications that extend from one hundred—where fifty are the twenty-five skandhas, dhātus, and so forth, divided into body and mind, which are then subdivided into method and prajñā—to ten million and beyond, up to one hundred families and more are taught.
While those are indeed the ways that the numbers of deities in the maṇḍalas relate to specific [factors], nevertheless, in terms of the natures of the deities themselves, the Kālachakra, Two-Part [Hevajra Tantra], and other texts teach that the numerical amounts [of deities] in the maṇḍala chakras are infinite in that they are classified as being anywhere from one family to many.•

The presence of the maṇḍala chakra in the internal vajra body is described in the Kālachakra Tantra, Avadāna-stotra[-tantra],[402] and elsewhere. Like external maṇḍalas, it is composed of the following [features].
► The tiered elements begin at the soles of the feet, which are wind maṇḍalas, and end at the juncture [of the torso and legs], which is the earth [maṇḍala].
► The circular vajra line of sindhu [or sindūra] and the maṇḍalas square shape are equivalent to the square [made by] the body and its outstretched arms.
► The square, with its four corners, is [the body’s four sides:] left, right, front, and back.
► The four doors are the four upper and lower orifices.
► The four toraṇas are the four tips [or centers, of the four chakras].
Saying, “I have explained this in the treatise called the Illumination of Maṇḍalas,”[403] Rangjung Dorje advises us to look there for more details.

► As for mutually related method and prajñā: when one mutually related element is described as method, the other is prajñā because each one is designated in dependence on the other.
► Regarding right and left as method and prajñā: if right is said to be method, left is prajñā because they abide in an interdependent relationship.
► As for body and mind as method and prajñā: if body is referred to as method, mind is prajñā; and if mind is referred to as method, body is prajñā. This is because the arising of mind occurs through one being based upon another.
► In terms of white and red as method and prajñā: in a body that is method, the white elements are prajñā; and in a body that is prajñā, the red elements are method because they abide in a mutually related union.
► As for the method and prajñā of support and supported: when the physical world (the support) is described as method, sentient beings (the supported) are prajñā; when sentient beings are said to be method, the physical world is prajñā. This is because they are described as the environment and its inhabitants from the perspective of their dependence upon each other.
Thus there are [five pairs] explicitly stated to be of the natures of method and prajñā with a reverse [or complementary, set of] five [pairs of] method and prajñā, which are formed by applying the classifications of body and mind. Those constitute ten root [pairs of] method and prajñā. They demonstrate why it is said that everything within apparent existence is of the natures of method and prajñā. In this regard, we should be aware that all instances of sealing are sealings with method and prajñā.

In the context of the word-tantras (the means of discussion), the conventional expression “prajñā-mother tantras” is used for those [tantras] that primarily teach prajñā as their subject of discussion. The conventional expression “method-father tantras” is used for those that primarily teach method as their subject of discussion. Except for the degree to which they emphasize their primary subject of discussion, they both teach the unification [of prajñā and method]—if they did not, the term “yoga” would not used for them. Thus, in actuality, all niruttara tantras are of the nature of the nonduality of method and prajñā and, therefore, are nondual tantras. [221] The Guhyasamāja states:
Yoga is not [just] method, nor is it only prajñā.
The Tathāgata taught that yoga is the union of method and prajñā.[404]

The following is a detailed account of the way things are classified as method and prajñā. When the eyes are method, visual forms are prajñā. When visual forms are method, the eyes are prajñā. Accordingly, [everything related to the senses,] from the ears and sounds to the mind and phenomena, can be correlated to method and prajñā. We should know that the sense consciousnesses are in a reciprocal relationship of method and prajñā with their respective objects.
When the rasanā channel is method, the winds within it are prajñā. When the lalanā channel is prajñā, the winds within it are method, [222] When men are method, their minds are prajñā since they engage with women. When women are prajñā, their minds are method since they engage with men.• When the middle is said to be prajñā, the directions are method. When the ultimate is designated as method, the conventional is prajñā.†
The opposites of those are also the case. It is tenable to say that everything previously described as method is prajñā, and everything said to be prajñā is method from the perspective that [they are all in] dependent [relationships with one another]. Because all phenomena arise interdependently, they are method and prajñā in terms of being dependent. In terms of their natures, their conventional truth is method and their ultimate truth is pra-jñā. That is the view expressed in the Autocommentary.[405] We should be aware of those [pairings] and others: such as that the external, internal, and “other,” apparent existence, and everything within saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are configured as method and prajñā in limitless ways.
The sequences of colors (yellow and black, and white and red, as method and prajñā) and qualities (the method and prajñā of tastes and forms) are as discussed in the “Wind” [chapter]• and as they are taught in the tantras. Thus, they are not elaborated on here.
We should know that the infinite presentations of method and prajñā [come down to] appearances being mind, and mind being dependently originated. When elaborated, there are myriad appearances; when summarized, all is simply the reflexive radiance of the connate state.

Everything that appears with a shape is body. The winds and verbal expressions are mantras. Those belong to the generation process. All that the mind conceives by concentrating on bindus, nādas, and so forth, belong to the bindu-perfection process.• This is the thought of the Kālachakra, King of Tantras.[406]
The two processes are designated in terms of their bases of purification as follows. Birth in cyclic existence is taught to be the process of generation. Death in cyclic existence is the process of perfection.† The noble father and son [Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva] explain this to be the thought of the Guhyasamāja.
The two processes are identified from the perspective of their natures in the context of the paths as follows. Meditation on what is conceptually imagined—shapes and the like—is called the process of generation. The dependent, along with manifestations connected to the mental bindus, is the perfection process [because] following the dissolution of [external] manifestations [into mind],[407] the mind concentrates on mere consciousness: bindus, nādas, and so forth.‡ Virūpa and others taught that this is the thought of the Hevajra and related [systems].
[The two processes are posited] in terms of the results of purification as follows. The common siddhis belong to the generation process, and the supreme siddhis to the perfection process. That is the thought found in the Trilogy of Commentaries by Bodhisattvas and elsewhere.

<d e="2">
From the point of view of the great generation and perfection processes that are the final abiding state, the following is taught. Conventional truth free from all fixations on appearances is the process of generation since it generates the rūpakāyas of the buddhas. Ultimate truth free from conceptually elaborated characteristics is the process of perfection since all phenomena are perfect within that ultimate. This is the thought of the mother tantras, such as Chakrasaṃvara. It is stated that the yoga of mahāmudrā contains all the practices of unification.•
The methods that introduce us to the two truths are the process of generation since [such methods] generate the excellent qualities of wisdom. The prajñā [that knows] the two truths to be inseparable, which is the heart of the buddhas, is the process of perfection. This is because the unobscured manifestation of the sixty-four excellent qualities—which, from the beginning, are complete within sugatagarbha (the basis for purification)—is designated as the result. [224]
When we have fathomed that key point, we will have no difficulties [understanding] the meaning of the inseparability of ground and result taught in the precious Kagyu tradition. The position of the Lord of Victors [Rangjung Dorje] is that once the stains [covering] the excellent qualities of the ground are purified, [that state] is referred to as the result. The significance of this is that there are no divisions in terms of the natures of those two [ground and result].

All that and more—what was just explained about the modes of correspondence with method and prajñā, the generation and perfection processes, and so forth, with their external, internal, and “other” processes—are united with the one wisdom, the abiding state, the final result.• Since realizing that is the root of the Vajrayāna, it sums up everything. What is an example of that? It is as the Hevajra Tantra states:
The bond of all buddhas abides in the form of E VAṂ.[408]
[This summation is] just like the explanations that all phenomena of ground, path, and result are subsumed within E VAṂ, the abiding state of method and prajñā. In brief, yogins and yoginīs will purify their stains [by remaining] within a state free from fixating on knowable objects—which are included within the two truths—as being [real] entities.

The dhātu of sentient beings, twofold purity at the time of the ground, is the buddha heart, self-arisen wisdom. Its essence is devoid of the stains of the delusions of the eight modes of consciousness. It possesses the unified two truths: ultimate truth, which is naturally pure, and conventional truth, which is the reflexive radiance of the wisdom of that [ultimate truth]. This accords with the statement in the Guhyasamāja explanatory tantra, the Vajra Wisdom Compendium Tantra:[410]
The thought behind the two types of truths is thus: they are the conventional truth and the ultimate truth. Child of good family, conventionalities are unstable and moving. Their reality is like the moon [reflected in] water. Ultimate truth is the eighteen great emptinesses. Its limit abides.• [228]
Conventionalities are the appearances of percepts and perceivers. Although, in actuality, [conventionalities] do not exist, the conceptually imagined environment, beings, and so forth, do appear. As for their reality: since it is said that [conventionalities] appear even though they have no nature, like the moon in water, they are only real for deluded minds. The ultimate refers to natural emptiness, which is explained in terms of the eighteen emptinesses (the emptiness of the internal and others). As for its reality: it is self-arisen wisdom, free of the duality of percepts and perceivers. It exists ultimately because it is the object of reflexively aware wisdom.
The two truths are unified in an inseparable and connate manner. The correct conceptual process of examining that abiding state [of the unified two truths] generates what becomes the direct and correct realization of the view. That realization, the generated remedy, is wisdom—it is the method that is the means for purifying the concepts of percepts and perceivers. This is taught in the texts of [Secret] Mantra, Yogāchāra, and Madhyamaka. Because the numbers of the bases of purification, the factors to be purified, the means of purification, and the results of purification are consistent, many tantras describe phenomena (which include the factors to be purified, the means of purification, and the results of purification) as corresponding to the numbers of bases of purification. Such modes [of correspondence] are said to contain the rationale for the ways stains are purified.•

In the Vajrayāna [view], the perfect resultant wisdom, the generation of the remedial cognitions that are concordant with that [wisdom], and the pure white buddha qualities, which are the causes for developing the correct view, are inseparable.• In that sense it is said, “results are taken as the path.” The bases of purification are all phenomena, which are included within the two truths and are pure in being of the natures of deities, mantras, and great bliss. The means of purification is taught to be prajñā realizing the ultimate, which arises on the basis of conventional concepts. Thus, the connection between the two truths is one of method and what arises from method. This accords with Nāgārjuna’s statement [in his Fundamental Treatise on the Middle Way]:
The ultimate cannot be taught without relying on conventions.
Nirvana will not be achieved [229] without realizing the ultimate.[411]
When we amass merit in accordance with the conventional way things appear, our faculty of prajñā increases. When, with that prajñā, which is in harmony with the ultimate way things are, we rest in equipoise as the accumulation of wisdom, we develop the prajñā arising from meditation, and our merit is able to increase more fully. An analogy for this is when we are dreaming, if we know that our dreams have no nature, we are able to create emanations and transformations.

Tīrthikas—Brāhmaṇas and others, which include the Vaiṣhṇavas, Aish-varas, Bārhaspatyas (who are [followers of] Amaraguru), [followers of] Rahman, Sāṃkhyas, and Nirgranthas—[hold] philosophical tenets that are incorrect knowable objects created and imputed solely by thoughts.• Thorough [discussions] of the way they are refuted can be found throughout the texts on madhyamaka and valid cognition.
The Sāṃkhyas, whose view is that causes and conditions have relationships of conjunction and inherence [with their results], fall into the extreme of permanence. The Lokāyatas, who adhere to [the notion that] past and future lives are nonexistent, fall into the extreme of nihilism. Everything that is formulated by [those who hold any of] the sixty-four incorrect views of the tīrthikas falls into [the categories of] espousing permanence or nihilism. The Bhagavat said in the Brahmā’s Net Sūtra[412] that their various wrong views arise in dependence upon the percepts and perceivers of body and mind. [230] Those with wrong views who, out of delusion, state that there is a self-entity can be refuted by the scriptures and reasonings of bodhisattva-scholars and be led to the correct view.

As for the assertions of the two Shrāvaka schools in our own tradition: They maintain that the external worldly realms and so forth are composed of particles that are real substances and are referents other than mind. They assert that when particles form gross phenomena there is contact between them but they are not joined and they have interstices, like [the hairs in] a yak’s tail or [grasses in] a meadow; or that they have no interstices, like [the pages of] a book or [the grains in] a pile of barley; and that they abide having been restrained by winds, which cause cohesion.
Vaibhāṣhikas assert that when [particles] appear to the sense consciousnesses they do so without intermediary images—they arise nakedly as directly perceptible things, without images. Sautrāntikas assert that particles do not appear directly to the sense consciousnesses, their mode is that of hidden phenomena; they appear as images of minute particles, like a hand concealed under a cloth.
Both those assertions lack the understanding that what appear as various objects from the manifestations of the latent tendencies of the ālaya and formative mentation are the potentials. Under the sway of not understanding that [appearing objects] arise from latent tendencies, [shrāvakas] are mistaken in their conception [of external objects] as being “other” [or separate] referents. [External objects] do not truly exist as referents that are other than mind because all conventional appearances—which manifest as appearances for sentient beings—arise from delusive latent tendencies. [231] Nevertheless, in order to refute assertions that a self, a principal substance, or the like is a creator, the Victor taught about external referents—the skandhas, dhātus, āyatanas, and so forth, which are [said to be] composed of minute particles—as if they were objectively existent. We should know that such teachings were given with a specific intention. The Commentary on Bodhichitta states:
The skandhas, dhātus, āyatanas, and so forth, are taught to counteract notions of a self.[413]

On the basis of [the Buddha’s] statement in the sūtras “Bhikshus, there is a burden, and the bearer of the burden is the person,”[415] some in our own tradition, such as the Vātsīputrīyas, believe that there is an inexplicable self of persons. That is not a tenable [position] because, despite the use of “self,” “person,” and so on, to refer to things that exist imputedly (being superimposed by thoughts) and that are mere names, they do not have even an atom’s worth of existence as real substances. It is said in the Ornament for the Mahāyāna Sūtras that if they existed, there would be a dilemma: either the self would exist on the side of liberation and sentient beings would be liberated effortlessly, or the self would exist on the side of saṃsāra and sentient beings could not be liberated. That text says:
“Person” refers to something existing imputedly, [232] not to a substance.[416]

As just explained, those and others [are the factors to be abandoned]. Vai-bhāṣhikas believe that external referents are real. Sautrāntikas assert that even though external referents are not real, appearances in their own time are real as mental appearances.• Chittamātras maintain that [external referents] are not other than mind, like dream appearances, and that the reflexively aware, reflexively clear mind is real. Mādhyamikas declare that mind is not real. The Great Mādhyamikas assert that a nonimplicative negation, which is mere absence, is not it: the correct reality is unified wisdom, mere intuitive reflexive awareness, free from the four extremes. In fact, everything that can appear is simply what appears to the mind—there is nothing that exists by way of its own nature.
We should understand the stages of relinquishing the factors to be abandoned (the stains of dualistic apprehension) and developing their remedies (the wisdom that realizes nonduality) in accordance with what the previous masters have taught.
The remedy for the idea of a self is to meditate on the nonexistence of a self. Following that, the remedy for the delusion [of taking apprehended objects] to be referents that are other [than the apprehending subject] is to recognize that [external referents] are merely mind.[417] Next, what is apprehended as mere cognition is realized to be free from conceptual elaborations. We should know that that process of engaging the correct path [encapsulates] the heart of every description of the infinite factors to be abandoned and their remedies.

In light of the vital point[419] of the unity of the winds and mind, it is taught that to purify that number of bases of purification (concepts), the doors of dharma (the remedies) are the same number as the factors to be abandoned: 777,600,000.[420] The presentation of eighty-four thousand dharma doors is given simply as a rough calculation of the roots of the factors to be abandoned and their remedies, and from the perspective of the common yānas.

Here it is explained that all beings’ life spans—from a bug’s briefest to the Akaniṣhṭha [gods’] longest—are one hundred years. The breaths of every individual being are enumerated as follows:
► six breaths are considered a pāṇīpala;
► sixty pāṇīpalas are a ghaṭikā; and
► sixty ghaṭikās make one solar day.
We should be aware that one human day is a tiny bug's one hundred years, and one human year is one breath for those in Akaniṣhṭha.• Jamyang Chenpo [Trim-khang Lotsāwa Sönam Gyatso], father and sons, state:
There are eighty-four thousand wisdom[-wind] parts in one hundred years. Taking those as the bases for purification, the teaching that there are eighty-four thousand doors of dharma (or means of purification) is well known as a rough calculation.[421]

Among the winds that occur during those one hundred years, if every moving[422] wisdom wind (which is one thirty-second part of a breath) is added up, there are 24,300,000. They contain the path to nirvāṇa and are the essence of all remedies. When they are embraced with methods, they are the supreme of all remedies. This is the single vital point for saying that the state of Vajradhara can be achieved in three years and three half months. Since the niruttara tantras are said to correspond to the number of wisdom winds, the number of branches of the niruttara tantras is also 24,300,000.• [235]

The wisdom winds of one hundred years 9.43
add up to three years and three half months.
In three years, there are 1,080 days.
Classifying three years as body, speech, and mind
yields the three tantras of body, speech, and mind.
The passages explain the tantras of the six families.
The divisions of the months[423] explain the families
belonging to the thirty-six tantras.
Splitting right and left into method and prajñā
makes the method and prajñā tantras, the seventy-two root tantras.

[The following explanations are given] because the niruttara tantras are presented in relationship to the wisdom winds. The wisdom winds of one hundred years add up to, or equal, the number of breaths in three years and three lunar half months. The deities of the Kālachakra and the method tantras are presented in relationship to the number of days in three years and in three half months. There are 1,080 days in three years; and in relationship to those bases of purification, there are the assemblies of Kālachakra deities. To purify the forty-five days in three half months, there are the assemblies of deities of the method tantras.
In relationship to three years (the bases of purification), the tantras (the means of purification) are classified as body, speech, and mind, yielding the three tantras of body, speech, and mind. [23 6] Since every year is divided into southern and northern passages, it is explained in dependence on the [six southern and northern] passages that occur in three years that there are the tantras of the six families: vajra, padma, ratna, Amoghasid-dhi, Vairochana, and the sixth, Vajradhara. When those are divided into method and prajñā, there are the six families of the method tantras and the six families of the prajñā tantras.
Each year is divided into twelve months. In relation to the thirty-six months in three years, it is explained that the number of families [correspond] to the thirty-six tantras: there are twelve tantras of the body family, twelve tantras of the speech family, and twelve tantras of the mind family.
Those thirty-six months each have a phase when the dark digits increase in dependence on the right and a phase when the light digits increase in dependence on the left. Splitting those [months] into method and prajñā results in the seventy-two lunar phases. In relation to those, there are thirty-six root tantras considered to be method and thirty-six root tantras considered to be prajñā. Combined, they make the seventy-two root tantras, which comprise the yoga tantras and yoginī tantras. The Glorious
Ḍākārṇava Tantra[424] teaches that they are the purities of the number of hands (seventy-two) of the Bhagavat. Those purities are said to be seventy-two remedial wisdoms, whose numbers correspond to the seventy-two thousand channels, the [seventy-two] winds in the navel channels (which include the madhyamā saṃkrāntis),• and the number of concepts involving desire or the absence of desire.

The discussion of the number of letters[425] that occur in one lagna during a single day is as follows. There are five root vowels, A and the others: I, ṚI, U, and ḶI. There are five guṇas: A, E, ar, O, and AL; and the five that are derived from the pratyayas [affixations]: HA, ya, ra, va, and la. Collectively, those are the fifteen short vowels. With the differentiation of the fifteen long vowels (a, I, and the others), there are thirty. In addition to those, there are the five “inexpressible letters,” which are the five root vowels assuming different forms resembling an anusvāra, visarga, curved knife, staff, and plow.[426] The addition of AṂ makes the thirty-six letters that are vowels.
There are thirty consonants, KA and the rest: KHA, GA, GHA, NGA; CHA, CHHA, JA, JHA, ÑA; ṬA, ṬHA, ḌA, ḌHA, ṆA; TA, THA, DA, DHA, NA; PA, PHA, BA, BHA, MA; SA, FPA, ṢHA, SHA, XKA. By adding HA, YA, RA, VA, LA, and KṢHAḤ to those, the consonants equal the vowels in number: thirty-six. Those are the main letters, which are the means of expressing meaning, what is to be expressed.
Each of those is thirty minor tantras, which are their respective branches. Take, for example, the Ka-Vajra Tantra:[427] Multiplying the letter KA by the five short root vowels gives KA, KI, KṚI, KU, and KḶI. Multiplying it by the guṇas makes KA, KE, KAR, KO, and KAL. Multiplying it by the five that derive from the pratyayas creates K.HA, KYA, KRA, KVA, and KLA. Those are the fifteen short [ka syllables]. Multiplying them by the long vowels makes the fifteen: KĀ, KĪ, and the others. Together those are thirty. By multiplying kha and the other consonants in the same way, there are nine hundred letters that combine the [sixty] vowels and consonants. Dividing those into method and prajñā makes two sets of nine hundred, or 1,800. This is said in the Kālachakra.•

There are 1,800 winds in one lagna [or major saṃkrānti], the [same] numeric configuration as those letters. Since there are twelve major saṃkrān-tis in one day, there are altogether 21,600 breaths in those [saṃkrāntis]. As for the letters that arise during those: The 1,800 letters (the aforementioned multiplicand) are multiplied by the twelve [vowels formed] by differentiating the six root vowels (the multiplier) into long and short, and including either anusvāra (AṂ) or visarga (ĀḤ). [238] Thus, the letters contain the branches of the minor[428] tantras of 21,600 letters. Because the number of breaths in one [solar] day and the number of ghaṭikās in one year are the same, the vowels and consonants that arise during the ghaṭikās of one year[429] are that [amount: 21,600].† The branches of the niruttara tantras are the same as the number of letters that occur in the ghaṭikās during one year; therefore, they are presented as 21,600.
Those letters are divided into the anusvāra (intermediate long), visarga (extra long), and curved knife (short)—which are of the natures of body, speech, and mind—making 64,800. Thus, they correspond to the number of ghaṭikās in three years.[430] The letters just presented are the roots of the number of the tantras, which correspond to the aforementioned three years.

Modifying the thirty consonants (ka and the others) with the six short vowels makes 180: KA, KI, KṚI, KU, KḶI, KAṂ, and so forth. Modifying them with the six long vowels forms 180: KĀ, KĪ, KṚĪ, KŪ, KḶĪ, KĀḤ, and the rest, Combined they make 360, which are the root vowels. There are the 360 letters that occur during the days in one year. The thirty vowels of the daytime and the thirty of the nighttime add up to sixty. During one day, there are the thirty letters that are modified by the thirty short vowels that occur during the daytime and the thirty letters that are modified by the thirty long vowels that occur during the nighttime. [239]
Therefore, the vowels counted during the breaths in one day are consistent with the vowels counted during the ghaṭikās in one year. Since the consonants are the same number as those vowels, there are 21,600 consonants during the breaths in one day and 21,600 consonants during the ghaṭikās in one year. It is taught that the numbers of tantras (the means of purification) are the same as the bases of purification to which they relate.
The consonants are the body, and the vowels are the life-force [or breath]. Since body and life-force are combined, the numbers of the body and the life-force become one point. Scholars are aware that when the consonants are enumerated, the forms of the letters are to be counted. When the vowel letters are enumerated, it is the morphemes[431] that are to be enumerated. When the vowels and consonants are combined, all that can [create] verbal expressions are to be enumerated.
The explanation here is just a rough, basic illustration. Those who wish to investigate the details and understand this fully are advised to consult the svarodaya [system] found within the Kālachakra, and the second chapter of the latter [or second] section of Compendium of Astrological Texts by the lord himself [Rangjung Dorje].[432]

Having presented the classifications [found] in the tantras, now I will discuss the principles of deities’ numbers. Among the numbers of deities described in the method, prajñā, and nondual tantras, first I will mention the principal ones. (That statement serves as an introductory link.)
As for the wisdom parts [that are equivalent to] three years and three half months: the three years[433] are the deities of the Kālachakra and the yoginī tantras; and the one and a half months are the father tantra deities. Therefore, dividing the 1,080 days of three years (which are the bases of purification) by the seven weekdays yields a result of 154. That is the number of deities with lotus seats (who are the means of purification) in the Laghukālachakra. The two remainders (which are leftover from that division) are the principal male and female consorts, who pervade all. The “Inner Chapter” [of the Kālachakra Tantra] says that they represent the two tantras that are the embodiments of method and prajñā.[434]

Dividing the 1,080 days of three years (which are the bases of purification) by the fifteen lunar digits makes seventy-two. The seventy-two deities that are enumerated as the means of purification—the yoginī goddesses of the maṇḍala with its coupled lord (that is, the [principal] male and female [deities] in union)—are explained to be the deities of the Great Chakrasaṃvara Avadāna-stotra-tantra in one hundred thousand [verses].[435] Those families can be condensed into the thirty-seven heroines and one method, or hero, residing in the body. That is the number of deities found in the Laghusaṃvara, the abridged root tantra.[436]
The reason that the prajñā ones [the female deities] are counted individually and the method ones [the male deities] are considered as one is that the twenty-four heroes residing in the three chakras are nondual with [that is, inseparable from] Chakrasaṃvara, and the heroines, in order to free sentient beings from saṃsāra, alternate uniting with that one male. This is taught in the Conduct of Yoginīs Tantra.[437] Alternatively, Dak Rampa explains that the purity of great bliss is the hero deities; and, since great bliss is impartial and without manifestation, it is single.[438] The purity of emptiness is designated as the goddesses; and because that [emptiness] has manifestation, it becomes numerous reflected images.

The days in the three half months 9.85
are, specifically, the method tantras.
Classifying them as twelve lagna movements yields 540.
In regard to those, in the Māyājāla
there are three forms: a maṇḍala of forty-nine, [242]
one of forty-five, and one of forty-three, all in pairs, making 274.
The six forms of the glorious Guhyasamāja

The forty-five days in the three half months are, specifically, the bases of purification for the deities of the method tantras. When the forty-five days of the half months are classified as, or multiplied by, the twelve movements of the lagnas (or saṃkrāntis), they become 540, which is the number of the bases of purification. In relationship to those bases of purification, from the perspective of the Māyājāla,[439] the means of purification are 274[440] deities in three forms of maṇḍalas. There is a maṇḍala of forty-nine deities, a maṇḍala of forty-five, and a maṇḍala of forty-three. Added together, they make 137. However, since they are all in pairs of method and prajñā, [the number 137] is doubled, making 274.
As for the remaining [days]: When the six forms of maṇḍalas of the glorious Guhyasamāja are combined, they are the basis for the arising of 264 deities. They consist of maṇḍalas of nine central deities, thirteen deities, nineteen, twenty-five, thirty-two, and thirty-four, which altogether are 132. Classifying those in terms of method and prajñā adds up to 264.
When the former [the Māyājāla deities] and the latter [the Guhyasamāja ones] are combined, they make 538. Because the numbers of the bases of purification and the means of purification must be consistent, in addition to those there is a principal male consort and a female consort, who symbolize the family lords and who, as the roots of method and prajñā, pervade all.[441] Since that makes 540 [deities], the total number of the bases of purification and the means of purification are consistent.

In addition to those just mentioned, Buddhakapāla, Vajrāmṛita, Hevajra, and others (such as Mahāmāyā) are said to be contained within the principal mother tantras, the major and minor Chakrasaṃvara [texts]. Bhairava, Raktayamāri, Six-Faced Kṛiṣhṇayamāri, Yamāri, and others— such as Hayagrīva, Vajrapāṇi in Mahāchakra [form], and other maṇḍalas of krodhas—are included within the principal father tantras, the Guhyasamāja. The glorious maṇḍala of constellations with its 1,620 deities, such as those of the Dharmadhātu Vāgishvara and others, is found within the Kālachakra.
The father and mother tantras also include all yoga tantras (such as Vajradhātu) as their branches. Kriyā tantras (such as the [Questions of] Subāhu)[442] and charyā tantras (such as the Awakening of Vairochana)[443] are also branches of the yoga tantras. For that reason, the Commentaries by Bodhisattvas teach that all the deities of the tantras radiate from the wisdom winds.

[Now] I will present the teachings that the channel dhātus are the same: that is, they have the same modes of correspondences as the deities of the tantras. This is not simply an ancillary statement. Because the white-element bindus have similar qualities to the winds and the red elements to the channels, [the bindus] are subsumed under the channels and winds. This explains why there will not be a separate discussion of the correspondence between [the deities] and the bindus.

The life-force at the heart is Kālachakra. 9.109
Rasanā and lalanā are the natures of his feet.
The buddhas and eight goddesses are in the heart.
Wisdom is referred to as Vishvamātā.
The vases are feces, urine, flesh, marrow, semen, and blood.
The uṣhṇīṣha is a jewel, gaṇḍi, tree, and conch.
The skandhas and dhātus are the buddhas and their consorts.
The six (the visual one and so forth) and their objects
are the bodhisattvas and goddesses. [245]
The faculties of action (the legs and so forth) are the ten krodhas.
The channels in the navel are of the natures
of the speech maṇḍala: Bhīmā and the others.
The channel chakras in the twelve major joints
are those who abide in the body maṇḍala.
The finger and toe joints are nāgas and chaṇḍās.
The body hairs are of the natures of the bhūtas.
Concepts involving desire or its absence are the offering goddesses.

The madhyamā channel at the heart with the life-force wind is Kālachakra himself.• The two channels, the rasanā and lalanā, are the natures of Kālachakra’s feet. The reflexive appearance of wisdom is referred to as Vishvamātā since she is mahāmudrā. (The Autocommentary says that Vishvamata is mentioned after the eight goddesses in the root [verses for reasons of] compositional style.)[444] The six families, or six dhātus, in the center of the heart chakra are the six buddhas. The eight channel petals at the heart are the eight goddesses, Dhūmā and the others.
The ten vases are the purities of the dhātus flowing through those channels. In the east there are two vases that are the purity of marrow; in the south are two that are the purities of flesh and blood; in the north are two that are the purity of urine; in the west are two that are the purity of feces; and above and below are two that are the purities of semen and blood. The four channels in the uṣhṇīṣha are of the natures of a jewel, gaṇḍi [or gong], wish-fulfilling tree, and dharma conch.

The six skandhas and six dhātus are the six buddhas (Akṣhobhya and the others) and their consorts.• The six faculties (the visual one and so forth) and their six objects (such as forms) are the six bodhisattvas (Kṣhitigarbha and the rest) and the six goddesses (Rūpavajrā and the others).† [246] The six faculties of action (the legs, arms, and so forth) and the six functions [of the faculties of action] (such as walking) are the six krodhas (Padmāntaka and the others) and the six krodhis (Jambhakī and the others), making twelve. (Both the root text and the Autocommentary say “ten,” [however, the additional] two are implied.)
The channels of the major and minor saṃkrāntis at the navel (which added together make seventy-two) are of the natures of the seventy-two goddesses in the speech maṇḍala: Bhīmā, Charchikā, and the others. The petals of the channel chakras in the twelve major joints of the legs and arms (which combined make 360) are the 360 deities of the days [of a year] who abide in the body maṇḍala. The channels in the finger and toe joints, which are the chakras in the minor joints, are nāgas and chaṇḍās. The channel dhātus of the thirty-five million body hairs are of the natures of the thirty-five million bhūtas. The thirty-six concepts involving desire are the thirty-six offering goddesses of the speech maṇḍala. The thirty-six concepts involving the absence of desire are the thirty-sixpratīcchās of the body maṇḍala.
When all the aforementioned deities—from the principal ones up to and including the icchās[445]—are classified in terms of being sealed as method and prajñā, they are a maṇḍala of 1,080. If the channel dhātus are also divided by the classifications of method and prajñā, they are 1,080.

The Vajraḍāka teaches that the 120 petals of the chakras are deities.
The correspondences between the numbers of major and minor deities of the glorious Chakrasaṃvara and the channel dhātus are as follows. The three principal channels (madhyamā, rasanā, and lalanā) and the “māra-free” channel are the principal male and female consorts. Among the eight channel petals at the heart, the four petals in the main directions are the four female consorts, the yoginīs in the heart. The four petals in the intermediate directions are the four offerings, which are four vases with amṛi-ta-filled kapālas, symbolizing the male consorts.
The twenty-four major channels (“indivisible” and the others) are the twenty-four yoginīs, Prachaṇḍā and the others. The twenty-four dhātus, which descend in those twenty-four channels, are the twenty-four heroes, Khaṇḍakapāla and the rest. The eight female gatekeepers, Kākāsyā and the others, and the two of the zenith and nadir, Siṃhāsyā and Vyāghrāsyā, make ten. They are similar to the ten krodhas referred to above in that the faculties of action and their functions, or the sense faculties, are the natures of the ten krodhas and the ten krodhis.• Those are the correspondences with the minor Saṃvara deities.
Since the twenty-four channel dhātus are divided into the absorbed, enjoyment, and dominant types, the [resulting] seventy-two channel dhātus are of the natures of the seventy-two major deities of Chakrasaṃvara.
For more detailed classifications, we should refer to the Vajraḍāka Tan-tra, Avadāna-stotra, and other texts that teach how the 120 petals of the four channel chakras are the deities of Chakrasaṃvara. That [detailed description of the families] correlates to the abbreviated families.

I will now present the way the deities of the glorious Guhyasamāja correspond to the channel dhātus. The five channel chakras and the five skan-dhas are the five buddha families. The four dhātus (such as earth) and tangible objects (making five) are the five goddesses, the female consort Sparshavajrā and the others. [249] The eyes are Kṣhitigarbha. The ears are Vajrapāṇi. The nostrils are Akāshagarbha. The nature of the tongue is Lokeshvara (Avalokiteshvara). The female consorts who are of equal taste with those four are Rūpavajrā, Shabdavajrā, Gandhavajrā, and Rasavajrā.
The mind dhātu is Mañjushrī, and everything with the nature of the dhātus of [mental] phenomena is Sarvanīvaraṇaviṣhkambhin. The body dhātu is Samantabhadra; its channel and muscle dhātus are Maitreya. The female consorts who are of equal taste with those four are the secondary Rūpavajrā, secondary Shabdavajrā, secondary Gandhavajrā, and secondary Rasavajrā.[446] The eight major limb joints (the wrist and ankle joints are excluded), the mouth, and the privates are of the natures of the ten kro-dhas. Those are thirty-six deities. However, since the principal male and female consorts are the bases for the classifications, or because they are the pervaders, here the Autocommentary says:
[The channel dhātus] are of the nature of a maṇḍala of thirty-four deities.[447]
The channel petals in the four chakras are correlated with the maṇḍalas that contain the families as follows. In the navel chakra (whose nature is the earth dhātu), there are the sixty-four goddesses of the karma family: Vedhani, Chandika, and the others, including *Vīrā, *Karmatārā, *Priya-manī,[448] and *Yantrī.
In the heart chakra (which is the water dhātu), there are the nine of the vajra family: Vajradhātvīshvarī and the others, such as Vajramudrā and Mahābalā. In the throat chakra (which is the fire dhātu), there are the sixteen goddesses who are of the nature of the padma family: Padmatārā and the rest, such as Puṇḍarīka and Padma.
In the head chakra (which is the wind dhātu), there are the thirty-two goddesses of the chakra family: *Prabodhikā and the others, including Chakravegā and *Vajrāsana. Their details—such as that they all have three faces and six arms—are found in the Vajra Garland.[449] They are also of the natures of the channels and dhātus. [250]

There are many different maṇḍalas, such as those just discussed—from ones with a single figure (one hero) to multifeatured ones, [maṇḍalas] with principals and retinues of two, three, and so forth. As was taught earlier in chapter 8, everything said about [maṇḍalas] is contained in what is presented here: that [their deities] correspond to the bases of purification, such as the body’s channels, winds, and bindus. For example, the nine-deity maṇḍala of Hevajra is the means of purification for just the heart chakra. Accordingly, all deities are set forth in relationship to the body’s channels, winds, and so on. The Nyingma tantras and instructions also explain that the deities in the Eight Transmitted Practices are aspects of the body’s channels, winds, and bodhichittas.

The topics comprising this chapters subjects for discussion are summarized in brief as follows. Since the channels are the deities’ bodies, they are the generation process. Since the winds are mantras and letters, the nature of speech, they are recitations. Bindus are the nondual wisdom-mind and the yogas of the subtle perfection process.
All the activity practices, including burnt offerings, yantras, and the rest, are presented as means of purification for internal bases of purification: the channels, winds, and bindus. We should understand these according to the previous discussions. Here I simply mention [these activity practices] in order to acknowledge the supremely victorious activities.
The deities correspond to the internal. Similarly, the wisdoms taught in the Pāramitāyāna are that, in the maṇḍala of Dharmadhātu Vāgishvara, the twelve bhūmis, the twelve pāramitās of the paths, the twelve dhāraṇīs, and the infinite samādhis are deities and mantras. The Buddha, the one who sees the reality of all, presented these in relationship to the internal classifications of the appearances of body and mind.•

As explained above, the internal channels, winds, and bindus manifest as properties of mind, what is "other,”• and are, therefore, mental substances. Although there is no duality of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa in the nature of mind, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa appear due to the purities or impurities of the channels, winds, and bindus, which are supports for mind. For that reason, the means for transforming the dreg-body into a rainbow body are the two processes that bind the vital points of those principles [of channels, winds, and bindus].[450] These methods are like a gold-producing elixir. [253] They are superior to all [other] graduated paths—that is, to the lower ones of the shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, and to the Mahāyāna’s pāramitā paths— because the definitive meaning of those [paths] is this very path of [Secret] Mantra and because in the end this path must be relied upon to awaken [to buddhahood].

Since the Shrāvaka [path] is categorized by the four truths for noble ones, its general characteristics are that it is the means for abandoning [what constitute] the truths of suffering and its origins, and it is the means for making cessation manifest by utilizing the path with thirty-seven factors for awakening. The Shrāvaka path [provides] the means for relinquishing the obscurations of mental afflictions so that the absence of a self of persons (the distinctive feature of its view) may be realized and the mere peace of nirvāṇa for oneself (the distinctive feature of its mental orientation) may be attained.
The time it takes to achieve awakening on the basis of this path is as follows. From the perspective of those who are swift, this lesser awakening can manifest within the support [that is, the body] of those who take birth three times in cyclic existence through karma and mental afflictions. During the first lifetime, they manifest as stream-enterers, during the second lifetime as once-returners and nonreturners, and during the third lifetime as arhats. It is also possible that those who are very swift will awaken in one lifetime. Those who linger as stream-enterers seven times in cyclic existence take rebirth seven times in the desire realm through karma and mental afflictions, and then achieve the lesser awakening. [254]
Sautrāntikas assert that [some stream-enterers] take seven births as gods and humans, which accords with the presentation in the Autocommen-tary.[451] Vaibhāṣhikas state that [some stream-enterers] take rebirth as gods seven times, as humans seven times, and as bardo beings seven times, making twenty-one. Since those seven sets of lives have similar qualities, [those stream-enterers] are called “ones [who take rebirth] in cyclic existence seven times.” There are also two types of arhats: those with remainder and those without remainder.
The awakening attained in that way is not a complete awakening—it is the mere pacification of suffering for the benefit of themselves alone.

[Pratyekabuddhas] are naturally of intermediate acumen and rely on the path of the intermediate yāna. Since the distinctive feature of their view is that they realize the absence of a self of persons and that apprehended objects have no nature, they realize one and a half absences of self-entity. Given that their mental orientation is one of great pride, during their last [lifetime] in cyclic existence they manifest their own awakening in places devoid of buddhas and shrāvakas, without relying on anyone else to be their master for instructions. Thus, they are pratyekabuddhas.
Their three subdivisions[452] are as follows. By classifying [pratyekabuddhas] into those who start as ordinary beings and those who start as shrāvakas, there are the greater congregating practitioners, who are of intermediate acumen, and the lesser congregating practitioners, who are of lower acumen. The third type is the rhinoceros-like, who are of the highest acumen.
As for the time it takes them to manifest the awakening of a pratyekabud-dha: Lesser congregating practitioners spend twenty kalpas amassing the accumulations prior to the path of seeing, after which they proceed to their own awakening. (“Within” is an inclusive term that shows the range [of time].) Greater congregating practitioners spend fifty kalpas gathering the accumulations, and the rhinoceros-like ones spend one hundred kalpas. After that, in their last birth they achieve their own awakening. Pratyeka-buddhas’ awakening is a partial [or incomplete] peace.

[255] In the Pāramitāyāna, it is taught that [the bodhisattvas’] mental orientation is the twofold [bodhi]chitta of aspiration and engagement with which they work for the welfare of sentient beings. The view is the prajñā that realizes both absences of self-entity without abiding in the extremes of existence or peace. With that [view and orientation], bodhisattvas[453] practice the six pāramitās as their path and attain awakening after three incalculable kalpas.• [Bodhisattvas] remain for incalculable [kalpas] only to benefit sentient beings with their loving-kindness; they do not do so for their own benefit. They are able to do this because of the limitless sphere of their compassionate activity and their power to display miracles.
The necessity of amassing the accumulations during three incalculable [kalpas] is taught generally throughout the pāramitā sūtras. The Great Commentary on the “Eight-Thousand-[Stanza Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra]”[454] teaches that, even though it is explained that the accumulations are gathered for [periods] such as thirty-seven incalculable [kalpas], it is not necessary to gather the accumulations throughout that period of time; rather it is necessary to gather them in a way that equals amassing them for that amount of time. For example, it is taught that, when our compassionate Teacher was a brāhmaṇa in a former time, his exertions in praising the Buddha Puṣhya with one verse while circumambulating him for seven days encompassed the accumulations [gathered] throughout nine kalpas.[455]

This has been just a general brief presentation [of the three common paths]. For a detailed exposition of the five paths of the three yānas of shrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas (each with five divisions, making a total of fifteen), we should refer to the [Buddhas] words and the treatises belonging to the [prajñā]pāramitā [teachings], such as the Ornament of Clear Realization.

In relationship to the definitive meaning, the final destination of the lower yānas and the Mantrayāna is the same. Nevertheless, the Mantrayāna is distinctive, as the Lamp of the Three Ways says:
Although there is only one point,
the Mantrayāna is superior [to the other yānas]:
it is for the undeluded,
has a multitude of methods, is without hardships, and is the province of those of highest acumen.[456]
The Mantrayāna is distinguished by four features: its refined methods, its numerous methods, its easy methods, and that it is for those of great intelligence. Consequently, even though the Sūtra and Mantra yānas are comparable in terms of the actual practice of the path—the realization of the abiding state—the Mantrayāna is special in terms of the ease and speed of its methods. Regardless of the many stages traversed on the path, here in the context of discussing the Vajrayāna, it is the force of its unimaginably special methods of maturation and liberation that make the Mantrayāna swifter than, and superior to, the Pāramitā path.

At this point, we should be aware that, in general, Secret Mantra practitioners have [three approaches: practicing] the path that abandons the bases, [practicing] the path that changes the bases, and taking the entities that are the bases as the path.
Since the first contains the remedies that are contradictory to the factors to be abandoned and [incorrect] modes of perception, it can abandon the mental afflictions, the imagined aspects. The latter two are means for abandoning the innate aspects, both coarse and subtle. These [three] can be illustrated by the meditations on the four applications of mindfulness [practiced] on the lesser level of the path of accumulation.
The first [approach, the path that abandons the bases,] is well known in the Pāramitā [system] and below. It is to meditate on uncleanliness, suffering, impermanence, or the absence of self-entity as remedies for taking the body to be clean, feelings to be pleasurable, mind to be permanent, or phenomena to have a self-entity.
The second [approach, the path that changes the bases,] is, for example, to meditate on the four incorrect modes of perception (taking things to be clean and so forth) as being the four retinue ḍākinīs of Chakrasaṃvara.
In the third [approach, taking the entities that are the bases as the path,] the activities of body and mind are bound so that an extremely subtle body arises as a form of emptiness, feelings are great bliss, mind is intuitive reflexive awareness, and the natures of all phenomena are that of great unification. Those are the natures of the four [applications of mindfulness]. We should be aware that, as such [explanations] demonstrate, [these approaches] are vast.•

First, from qualified vajrāchāryas using the proper rituals, [bodhisattvas] receive the four empowerments, which are the means of maturation pointing out the significance of the empowerments. [258] These yogins and yoginīs, who have the vows and samayas of vidyādharas, learn well the meaning of the imagined generation process and the perfection process (the consummate path). They do so by applying the three types of valid cognition: the scriptural valid cognition of conviction in the lineage, the inferential valid cognition of conviction in the āchārya, and the direct perceptual valid cognition of conviction in their own experiences. Sugatagarbha is their substantial cause, and they rely upon the two types of bodhichitta as cooperative conditions. They develop the virtuous excellence of conviction, which includes faith, respect, and the like.• Following that, they undertake the approach in sessions (such as four sessions). Their practice is to be diligent in continuous, uninterrupted application in isolated places. Those with such [qualities and practices] are on the path of accumulation.

The common [or Pāramitā] yāna teaches that the four applications of mindfulness are meditated on during the lesser level of the path of accumulation, the four correct relinquishments are meditated on during the intermediate level, and the four feet of miraculous powers are meditated on during the greater level. Here [in the Vajrayāna], those are present in the deity yoga meditations. Concerning the greater level of the path of accumulation, [the Ornamentfor the Sūtras] says:
At that time, within the dharma stream they receive vast instructions from the buddhas in order to achieve shamatha and vast wisdom.[458]
That contains all the points [mentioned above]: The samādhi of the dharma stream is diligence in continuous application as the cause.[459] Since qualified gurus are nirmāṇakāya buddhas appearing to [the student] himself or herself, to receive instructions from such [gurus] is to receive instructions from the buddhas.
On the Mahāyāna path of accumulation, listening and reflecting are the primary forms [of prajñā], and yet [prajñā] arisen from meditation is also present. This is the reason for the line in the root text, “learn well,... develop conviction, and practice” (whose source is a passage in the Stainless Light cited in the Autocommentary).[460] In the present [Vajrayāna] context of the path of accumulation, [that line,] with its emphasis on meditation, relates primarily to withdrawal, within the six-branched yoga. [259] Abiding on that [Vajrayāna] path of accumulation develops from having trained well in many lives prior to entering the path. The Conduct of Yoginīs states:
Those who have developed true faith and are diligent in yoga have been inspired by my wisdom during thousands of millions of lifetimes.[461]

Once they learn the vital points of the channels, winds, and bindus, 10.22
[bodhisattvas] maintain excellent conduct, attain heat, and dwell on the path of preparation.
At that time, their conduct of discipline moves them along the path of preparation and prepares them for seeing.
This is the path of withdrawal
and fourfold meditative concentration.
It is described as “what purifies the channels.”
It is taught that perfecting the branches of meditative concentration brings the attainment of the five supercognitive abilities.
This is the entrance to the maṇḍala of body.

When, on top of those previous [practices, bodhisattvas] learn to bind the vital points of the channels, winds, and bindus properly, they are able to uninterruptedly sustain the illustrative wisdom, which is an experience of the perfection process. That is the excellent conduct.• Maintaining it, they attain the signs of heat: the experiences of bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality, which are illustrated by smoke[462] and so forth. [260] From this point on, since those are the immediate causes that prepare them for the path of seeing, they are dwelling on the path of preparation. What marks the threshold of the path of preparation is the engagement with the special experiences of the perfection process.†
As for the meaning of the terms: It is called “the path of preparation” since it is the path that actually prepares [bodhisattvas] for the path of seeing. “Heat” is used because it makes manifest the potential to quickly produce the path of seeing.
Here the signs of heat are described by referring to lines in the Two-Part [Hevajra Tantra]:
Fear, insanity, and suffering,
all the torments of misery and harm .. .[463]
[That is explained as meaning that] not being oppressed by such things is the sign of the lesser level of heat. Next, it says:
Strong desire, aggression, and bewilderment do not afflict practitioners.[464]
Not being oppressed by the mental afflictions that major [adverse] circumstances produce is the sign of the intermediate level of heat. It also states:
The results of benefit and harm arise.[465]
Achieving the results of samādhi—the supercognitive abilities, miraculous powers, and so forth—is said to be the sign of the greater level of heat. Those three levels are essentially the same as the three levels of heat, peak, and forbearance described in the Pāramitāyāna.
At that time (when heat has been attained), two types of conduct are used for enhancement and purification: conduct with elaborations and conduct without elaborations. Conduct with elaborations involves mixing with external situations, practicing with the first three mudrās, and engaging in the conduct that is the discipline of awareness. That conduct moves [practitioners] gradually along the path of preparation and prepares them for the path of seeing. The tantras explain that those who prefer not to engage in conduct with elaborations may practice mahāmudrā, the inner conduct utterly free from elaborations, since it can train them for that path [of seeing].

The basis for the definition of this path of preparation is as follows. [261] It is predominantly the path of the key instructions for the withdrawal from conceptuality and the key instructions for meditative concentration (mind resting one-pointedly) with its four branches.• It is when the instructions for the isolation of body, the vajra body, are practiced. Since this path is principally the means for binding the activities of the channels, it is described as “the path that purifies the channels.” To purify the channels, it is necessary to penetrate the vital points of the wind [or breath] yogas. Therefore, [the path of preparation] also involves the practices of life-force control and retention, vajra speech. It is taught that meditating perfectly on the five branches of meditative concentration brings the attainment of the causal five eyes and is the cause for the five or six types of supercognitive abilities. The [Kālachakra] King of Tantras, states:
Lord of Men: those who are purified by means of the practices of meditative concentration will achieve the five supercognitive abilities.[466]

<d e="2">
Since this path primarily purifies the channels, it is the entrance to the maṇḍala of body (among the three maṇḍalas of body, speech, and mind) and, consequently, is known as the nirmāṇakāya and vajra body in the context of the path.

Following the attainment of the path of preparation, to purify their winds [bodhisattvas must practice] the yogas of training in life-force control and retention. Those are called the doors to the maṇḍala of speech. On the basis of fully purifying the comings and goings of the winds in the channel chakras, they are able to stop one of the twelve lagnas that occur in a day. At that time, they are able to bind without outflows the same number of bindus in the lower end of the shaṅkhinī, the secret chakra.• Thus, they purify 1,800 concepts into wisdom and master the supercognitive abilities and miraculous powers in relation to the worldly realms, [in numbers starting with] one hundred times ten, [extending up to] the final reaches. [262] Those are the excellent qualities attained on the path of seeing. Having meditated on the path of preparation, [bodhisattvas] attain the path of seeing with its aforementioned virtues. That is [the meaning] expressed by the words, “are prepared for.”
The reason for [the statement that the life-force control and retention yogas prepare bodhisattvas for the path of seeing] is that, by using the wind [or breath] yogas, yogins and yoginīs constantly retain their bodhichittas without release. The force of that retention truly brings Vajrasattva—the inseparability of wind and mind—to all the channel chakras and establishes him there. This is called the result of perfecting the yoga of winds or life-force control. It is the attainment of nonconceptual wisdom and corresponds to the system of the Kālachakra Root Tantra.[468]
The truth is seen at the end of retention and mental isolation. Since the truth is seen, they are the path of seeing. This is explained in the quotations from the Sūtra Requested by the Merchant Bhadrapāla[469] found in the Lamp That Summarizes Conduct.[470] Because this [path] is the entrance to the maṇḍala of speech, it is called the saṃbhogakāya and vajra speech in the context of the path.

Once [bodhisattvas] attain nonconceptual wisdom, they practice the following conducts. Unelaborate conduct is [to see] the subsequent state of attainment as illusion-like, and very unelaborate conduct is meditative equipoise. On the basis of those nonconceptual conducts, the fire of chaṇḍālī blazes, and with that [comes] recollection, the bliss of melting bodhichitta. [Bodhisattvas] train in the sixteen branches of recollection: recollection of the three jewels, deities, generosity, ethical conduct, and the ten pāramitās. [263] Training in numerous and varied kinds of samādhi is the yoga of vajra wisdom—the samādhi that achieves unchanging bliss—and is the yoga of vajra mind. Since those [that is, recollection and samādhi] are victorious over all the “directions” [or spheres] of māras and the Hīnayāna, the victorious conduct brings the final accomplishment of the path of meditation. [The path of meditation] has the power to create the connections for, and to achieve, an abundance of benefit for others; therefore, it is also called the great group conduct. Because this [path] is the entrance to the maṇḍala of mind, it is, in fact, the attainment of the dharmakāya and vajra mind in the context of the path.
The Commentaries by Bodhisattvas do not explicitly state a correspondence between the six-branched yoga and the paths and bhūmis. Nevertheless, [the presentation] here is made from the perspective of the path alone [by showing] how the worldly and transcendent paths are traversed by the one stream of the six branches.

To begin with, by means of the practices of withdrawal and meditative concentration, the channels are blocked. [264] This purifies into wisdom the first lagna’s 1,800 winds with their associated concepts (which are of equal number) and stops the bodhichittas in the four victory-banner channels in the vajra’s jewel [or the lotus’s pistils]. That is the two worldly paths, the paths of accumulation and preparation [achieved] by engagement through belief.
On the basis of the practices of life-force control and retention, the winds of the second lagna and 1,800 concepts, along with the thick bindus, cease in the secret chakra. That is the attainment of the Mahāyāna path of seeing, the first bhūmi, Very Joyful. Now, because this has been achieved by engendering ultimate bodhichitta, the individual who is the support for [or embodiment of] that is called an ultimate bodhisattva.

Through that attainment, the physical aspect of the link of dependent origination of ignorance ceases. Then, sequentially and in correspondence with each of the bhūmis, the twelve links of dependent origination, such as birth and death, stop in reverse order. Another way to state this is that the birth and death that come about due to karma and mental afflictions— which are themselves generated by ignorance and defiled karmic formations—cease. Even though those cease, [bodhisattvas dwell on] the bhūmi with the latent tendencies of ignorance, have bodies of a mental nature that arise from undefiled karma, and demonstrate the inconceivable transference of death. The Highest Continuum states:
Noble ones have eradicated
the sufferings of illness, aging, and death.
They are without those because
their births are not brought on by karma and mental afflictions.[471] It also says:
[Bodhisattvas] are liberated from birth and death, sickness and
aging.[472]
Next, the force of recollection purifies the winds of the third lagna, 1,800 concepts, and their associated bindus, in that same secret chakra. This is the second bhūmi, Stainless. (The particle ste [rendered as a semicolon in English] is a connector that links [this line] with what follows.) [265]
When the winds of the fourth and fifth lagnas, with their respective sets of 1,800 concepts and bindus, are purified in the navel chakra, the third and fourth bhūmis are attained. Once the winds of the sixth and seventh lagnas, and their associated concepts and bindus, are purified in the heart chakra, the fifth and sixth bhūmis are attained. With the purification of the winds of the eighth and ninth lagnas, and their associated concepts and bindus, in the throat chakra, the seventh and eighth bhūmis are achieved. When the winds of the tenth and eleventh lagnas, along with their associated concepts and bindus, are purified in the head chakra, the ninth bhūmi and the tenth, Cloud of Dharma, are attained.

Then, having progressed through the ten bhūmis, the winds of the twelfth lagna, with their associated 1,800 concepts and bindus, cease in the uṣhṇīṣha chakra.

It is said in the tantras that fruitional, complete buddhahood is attained at that time. Also, at this point the twelve links of dependent origination cease, or are purified, in reverse order. [266] The sixteen ascending joys are complete. The sixteen emptinesses and the sixteen types of great compassion—which are indivisible in being of the nature of wisdom—are present in their entirety. As explained in chapters 6 and 9, when the amount of karmic winds that a person has in a lifetime of one hundred years is pure in being of the nature of three years and three half months of wisdom winds, the wisdom kāya is attained.
The number of stages of that wisdom kāya cannot be identified definitively, such that we could say, “They are this many.” Nevertheless, when we summarize all the various types of wisdom, they are included within stages [or a group] of five. The wisdoms are achieved in keeping with the stages of the bases of purification in the context of the ground (such as the purities of the five skandhas), as explained previously. The five skandhas—forms, feelings, discriminations, formative forces, and consciousnesses—become, respectively, the mirror-like wisdom, the wisdom of equality, discriminating wisdom, all-accomplishing wisdom, and the wisdom of the dharmadhātu.

Here the great lotsāwa Sönam Gyamtso and Dak Rampa comment:
Since it is explained that ignorance ceases on the path of seeing, is it not that the cessation [of the twelve links of dependent origination] occurs in a progressive order? No, it is not. Each link of dependent origination has physical, verbal, mental, and wisdom [aspects]. On the path of seeing, [only] the physical aspect of ignorance ceases—the other three (verbal and so forth) cease at the end of the reverse order [that is, as the last of the twelve links of dependent origination].[474]
As for the sixteen joys: On the external level, they are the purities of the sixteen digits of the waxing and waning phases of the moon. Fifteen are the joys of the cessations of the five skandhas, five dhātus, and five faculties. The sixteenth is the joy of the cessation of the wisdom aspects of those [skandhas, dhātus, and faculties].
The sixteen emptinesses are [categories of emptiness, from] the emptiness of the external to the emptiness of an essence of nonentities. As for the sixteen types of compassion: There are five types with reference to sentient beings, five types with reference to phenomena, and five types without any reference. The sixteenth is the great compassion of a buddha. Joy and compassion correspond to the waxing phase, and emptiness corresponds to the waning phase.• [267]

Here the stages of the path under discussion are the steps for progressing through the five paths by means of practicing the six-branched yoga. The aforementioned channels, winds, and bindus are the three kāyas in the context of the ground and, thus, they involve obscurations. When their activities are not bound, we circle in saṃsāra. When their activities are bound, we achieve nirvāṇa.
The methods for binding their activities are the following. Withdrawal and meditative concentration purify the channels. Life-force control and retention purify the winds. Recollection and samādhi purify the bindus. The six-branched yoga, which is the practices of the three vajras, is the path of training, as discussed in detail above.
The result of perfecting those is the bhūmi of buddhahood. Withdrawal and meditative concentration (which bind the channels) arrest the activities of the impure body and cause vajra body to manifest. Life-force control and retention (which bind the winds) stop the activities of impure speech and cause vajra speech to manifest. Recollection and samādhi (which bind the bindus) arrest the activities of impure mind and wisdom[176] and cause vajra mind and wisdom to manifest.
Although all the topics of the scriptures—such as the stages of the paths and bhūmis—are included within these six branches, and the sūtras, tan-tras, and treatises expound the infinite divisions of the paths and bhūmis, I will not discuss these here for fear of being too wordy.

Following [chapter 10’s] presentation of the stages of the bhūmis and paths, [this next chapter] explains the stages of dissolution because all phenomena are empty of any nature,[477] that is, no phenomena is beyond being suchness free from elaborations. Since the perfection process was correctly presented in earlier parts of the treatise, we are already aware that, in the end, all phenomena dissolve into emptiness, in keeping with our progressive understanding that they are natural luminosity.• Nevertheless, since the channels, winds, and so forth begin to disintegrate as soon as they are fully formed, those of us with bodies consisting of channels, winds, and bindus should be certain that [our bodies] are of the nature of arising and disintegration, that they are impermanent and illusion-like. We should understand how the tantras explain the stages of the death omens: that the energies of the channels, winds, and bindus gradually dissolve and are absorbed, one into another, when the life-force faculty ceases.

Next, [following chapter 10’s] discussion of the correspondences with the stages of the path, I will set out (in keeping with the teachings in the tan-tras) the stages of the dissolution of, and death omens related to, the channels, winds, and bindus in the vajra bodies of ordinary beings. Death is the basis of purification for the perfection process, and birth is the basis of purification in the generation process. The previous explanations of the perfection process provided a generalized discussion of the dissolution process. Nevertheless, [this topic] needs [to be presented again]. Once we are aware that as soon as we are born death omens can appear, we become discouraged [with saṃsāra] and apply ourselves to entering the dharma. When we are able to recognize the omens of untimely death, we can [perform rituals that] outwit death.
As for the nature of death: When we leave our body (which is of a concordant type[478] with our place [or realm]), we move to another existence. Since our life, power, and heat are gone, we have become nonassociated formative forces.• That is what happens to all ordinary beings. However, [death] is not predictable for those accomplished in the wisdom yoga, who see the abiding state directly.† It is also not predictable for those who take rebirth consciously, for those who are accomplished in the yogas that bind the vital points of the channels, winds, and bindus, and even for those who have achieved longevity by relying upon worldly paths that involve meditative concentrations, awareness-mantras, rasāyana, and so forth. This is because they have mastered their minds and winds.

In the vajra body of ordinary beings, all the channel dhātus are generated within one year from when the madhyamā (the first of the channels) begins, which occurs after the fourth week in the womb. That means that the channels are complete in the third postnatal month.
The Kālachakra explains that starting the very next day (that is, the first day of the fourth month), the energies of two method and prajñā channels atrophy each day. The overall process is that when one hundred years are complete, the seventy-two thousand channels will have dissolved. To look at this specifically: all the subtle channels dissolve during ninety-six years and ten and a half months. Each solar day, 2 of the 69,750 subtle channels dissolve.• The way the remaining 2,250 channels dissolve during the three years and three half months is explained below.

After that dissolution of the subtle channels, the 2,250 major channels dissolve during three years and three half months. This brings up a general topic related to the chakra channels and the twenty-four major channels. In terms of the channels where the karmic winds move, there are 14 at the head, 28 at the throat, 8 at the heart, and 60 at the navel, making 110 in the four chakras. By including the upper and lower ends of the rasanā and lalanā,[480] there are 114. The chakras at the major and minor joints have 720 channels. Dividing each of the twenty-four channels into sixty and leaving out the twenty-four madhyamā parts makes 1,416. Those are the 2,250 [channels] that dissolve during the three years and three half months.

Every three days, one of the 360 channels in the chakras of the twelve major joints atrophies. It is the same for the 360 channels in the fingers and toes: one atrophies every three solar days. [272] Thus, they dissolve within three years. The navels sixty channel petals, which are the ends of the channels divided from the twelve houses, dissolve over three years with the energies of the lagnas’ winds.
The fourteen channels of the lunar padas in the head dissolve during the fifteen days of one half month. The twenty-eight channels of the lunar mansions in the throat dissolve during one month (which add up to the days of two half months). The channels in the secret chakra are the same as the throat, and, therefore, they are not counted separately. Since the eight channels in the heart are gone in eight days of the same month in which the throat and secret dissolve, the eight days are shared [or are counted as part of that month].

As just explained, once all the twenty-four major channels in the chakras, with their subdivisions (but leaving out the madhyamā parts), atrophy, the winds and bodhichittas do not move. Then departure to the next world will occur after one day. On that day, the 21,600 winds of great darkness• move through the channels that are parts of the madhyamā. The channels of the madhyamā are two at the head, two at the throat (which combine the four of method and prajñā), the two upper and lower channels at the heart, four at the navel, and the channels of the opening of Brahma and the shaṅkhinī. Those twelve channels that are the madhyamā s passages within each chakra and the madhyamā parts of the twenty-four major channels are the thirty-six major channels that, along with their minor ones, atrophy during that final day.

Having explained the channels’ dissolution stages, now I will present the stages of dissolution of the winds. As discussed in the section on the way the body develops,• the ten root and secondary winds are complete in ten months since one wind forms each month. After birth, the energies of those ten winds dissolve one by one into each other sequentially every ten years until the time of death throughout a lifetime of one hundred years.
In the tenth year after birth, the strength of the dhanaṃjaya wind merges with the strength of the devadatta wind. In the twentieth year, those merge with the strength of the lizard wind. In the thirtieth year, those merge with the strength of the tortoise wind. At forty, they merge with the strength of the nāga wind. Since the energies of the five secondary winds are absorbed one into another, the sense faculties (such as the visual one) weaken[482] and physical dexterity is slightly diminished.
At fifty, those winds merge with the strength of the pervading wind. At sixty, they merge with the strength of the fire-coinciding. At seventy, they merge with the strength of the upward-moving. At eighty, they merge with the strength of the downward-expelling. At ninety, the energies of all the winds merge with the strength of the life-force wind. The point is that the energies of the earlier winds diminish slightly and the strengths of the latter ones increase—it is not that the energies of the earlier ones are eradicated. The Vajra Garland states that the strengths of the ten winds “are absorbed one by one into each other.” [275]

In the one hundred years of the life of a human endowed with the six dhātus, the ten winds become complete gradually during the first year. This process begins when the madhyamā channel arises in the womb and finishes in the third month after birth. The moment the ten winds are complete, the winds of the twelve lagnas move as even numbers, that is, as 1,800 for each lagna, without any fluctuations in quantity. There are no shortages or surpluses.†

Next, during the third course, 11.51

During the fourth course, there are no fluctuations.
In the second year, the winds increase to two [276]
as earth winds through the right.
In that way, the increases occur in alternation every [year].
By the seventh year less three half months,
[the death-omen winds] have become one pāṇīpala.
Then, following the left and right sequencing, they increase by a pāṇīpala every year.
By the sixty-seventh year,

Next, during every course for thirty years,
they increase by daṇḍas,

Next, following the first year’s two courses, due to fractional increases throughout the six months of the third course, the movement of [death-omen][484] winds increases to one within the space wind area.• Not being the same as the other lagnas, these are 361 movements. During the six months of the fourth course, there are no fluctuations. Although this is a person’s second year in relationship to the arising of the madhyamā, it is his or her first year in relationship to the increase of the death omens following birth.
► In the second year, due to the fractional increases during the six months of the fifth course, the [death-omen] wind movements increase to two: one movement as earth winds through the right nostril and one as the quotient on the right.• There are [now] 362 movements. During the sixth course there are no increases. [277]
► In the third year, during the seventh course, [the death omens] increase to three breaths, [moving] as space winds through the left nostril. There are no increases during the eighth.
► In the fourth year, during the ninth course, [the death omens] increase to four breaths, [moving] as earth winds through the right nostril. There are no increases during the tenth.
► In the fifth year, during the eleventh course, [the death omens] increase to five breaths, [moving] as space winds through the left nostril. There are no increases during the twelfth.
► In the sixth year, during the thirteenth course, in a quarter [or period] that is less one and a half months, [the death omens] increase to six breaths, [moving] as earth winds through the right nostril. That makes 366 movements. During the fourteenth there are no increases.
In brief, since there are no increases during the second of a pair of courses, and there are fractional increases of the death-omen winds during the first [pair of courses], the increases are of distortions. The wind [or breath] yogas, which create balance, are said to be what straighten distortions.

Next, [the death-omen winds] increase by one ghaṭikā [or daṇḍa] every course. For thirty years, during each course they increase by a danda,[486] alternating between those space-wind and earth-wind locations, following the sequence of the left and right nostrils.
Thus, after ninety-six years and eleven months less one-half month,• the death-omen winds have increased to one day, when they move as the nature of space wind through the left nostril.† This [space wind] is the space wind that is one of the set of five maṇḍalas; it should not be mistaken for the protector of space.‡
To put this in a way that is easy to understand: After the completion of the first fourteen courses, [the death-omen winds make up one pāṇīpala. During the following sixty years, they increase by one pāṇīpala each year].[487]
Then, there are thirty years with their sixty courses (each year having two courses). During the first course, [the death-omen winds] increase to one daṇḍa, [moving] as space-wind maṇḍalas through the left nostril; during its second course, they increase to two ghaṭikās, [moving] as earth-wind maṇḍalas through the right nostril. [278] In that sequence, the increases during the first course are on the left, and, during the second course, they are on the right. By the sixtieth course, which takes place on the right, [the death-omen wind movements] have increased to sixty ghaṭikās. The death omens [now] make up a day.
Thus, the period from when the madhyamā arises to when [the death-omen wind movements] make up a pāṇīpala is seven years less one and a half months. It takes sixty years for them to reach a ghaṭikā, and an additional thirty years for them to reach a day. Added together, these make ninety-six years and ten and a half months, at which point, [the death-omen winds] move for one day as space-wind maṇḍalas through the left nostril.•

Having explained the way the death omens increase throughout ninety-seven years less one and a half months, now I will present the verity of the increases of the madhyamā death omens that take place during three years and three half months. (Those two lines [of root verse] serve as the [introductory] link.)
The number of months in three years and three half months is thirty-seven and a half (that is, thirty-eight minus a half), and the number of days is 1,125. During this [period of three years and three half months], the days of actual death omens increase to thirty-three. As for the way they increase: Throughout thirty-four and a half months, the death omens increase gradually to reach thirty days. By thirty-four and a half [months], the number of [death-omen] days has increased to thirty days (that is, one month) since the death omens have moved and increased each day, alternating between the right and left nostrils. The way the death omens increase to three days in the remaining three months will be discussed below.

The way the death omens increase for thirty days will be explained in some detail by correlating them with the channels of the twelve houses. [280] At the navel, there are sixty ends that branch from the channels of the twelve houses. In the six houses on the left (Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquarius), starting from the space wind (followed by the winds of wind, fire, water, and earth), six channels atrophy for every three days that the death omens increase. By moving in the odd ones (one, three, five, and so on), the death omens increase to fifteen days, at which point thirty channels of the minor saṃkrāntis in six houses become empty.
In the six houses on the right (Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces), the order of dissolution starts with the earth wind, followed by [the winds of] water, fire, wind, and space. [Death-omen] movements in the even ones (two, four, six, and so on) cause three channels to cease, or atrophy, for every six days that the death omens increase. When the [death] days increase to fifteen, thirty channels of the minor saṃkrāntis in six houses become empty.

Since this section can be a bit hard for the dull-witted to understand, I will present the following according to the direct commentary[488] given by the lord of scholars, Lhalungpa, on the thought of the Autocommentary.[489]
► When [the death-omen winds][490] move for one day as space winds through the left nostril, that is the beginning of the dissolution in three years and three half months.•
The number of days of life when the winds move straight decrease in keeping with the process of the death-omen days increasing.
► At thirty-three and a half days, [the death-omen winds] move evenly without fluctuations.
► Then, they move for a second day as earth winds through the right nostril.
► Next, at thirty-two and a half days, they move for a third day as space winds through the left nostril.
► Then, at thirty-one and a half days, they move for one day [a fourth day][491] as earth winds through the right.
► Again, at thirty and a half days, they move for a fifth day as space winds through the left.
Since [the death-omen] movements on the left are the dissolution process of the odd ones [and follow the order of] the stages of development, when they make up five solar days of saṃkrāntis, the movements of the space winds in the six petals of the odd houses at the navel (Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquarius) terminate, and six channels atrophy.

► Then, at twenty-nine and a half days, [the death-omen winds] move for a sixth day as earth winds through the right.
Since [the death-omen] movements on the right are the dissolution process of the even ones [and follow the order of] the stages of dissolution, when they make up a sixth solar day of saṃkrāntis, the movements of the earth winds in the six petals of the even houses (Taurus, Cancer, Virgo, Scorpio, Capricorn, and Pisces) terminate, and six channels atrophy. Thus, there are five death days on the left and one on the right. When the [death] days have increased to six, twelve channels of minor saṃkrāntis have atrophied.

Following that pattern: [281]
► At twenty-eight and a half days, [the death-omen winds] move for a seventh day as wind winds through the left.
► At twenty-seven and a half days, they move for an eighth day as water winds through the right.
► At twenty-six and a half days, they move for a ninth day as wind winds through the left.
► At twenty-five and a half days, they move for a tenth day as water winds through the right.
► At twenty-four and a half days, they move for an eleventh day as wind winds through the left.
Once [the death-omen winds] make up five days of wind winds,[492] the movements of the wind winds in the six odd houses terminate, and six channels atrophy.
► Then, at twenty-three and a half days, [the death-omen winds] move for a twelfth day as water winds through the right. The water winds in the six even houses terminate, and six channels atrophy. When the death days have increased to twelve, twenty-four channels at the navel have become empty.

Here Dak Rampa’s commentary says:
When the death days are increasing on the left in the navel, they do so by five every six months. Thus, in thirty months there are twenty-five death days. When the death days are increasing on the right in the navel, they do so by one for every month less three solar days [that is, every twenty-seven days].[494] Thus, in four and a half months there are five death days. Adding those five death days to the previous twenty-five makes thirty death days. Adding the four and a half months to the thirty months makes the thirty-four and a half months.[495]

Following that increase of death omens to one month in thirty-four and a half months, further increases occur during three months.
In the first month, the death omens increase by one day on the left, moving for a thirty-first solar day, thereby terminating the phlegm dhātus and lunar winds. The channels of the six odd houses on the left (Aries and the others) become empty, after which lightness terminates during the final lunar course. [283] In the second month, the death omens pass on the right and increase by a second day—moving for a thirty-second day—thereby terminating the bile dhātus and solar winds. The channels of the six even houses on the right (Taurus and the others) become empty, after which motility terminates during the final solar course.
The termination of the dhātus of motility and lightness in two months and three days causes the cessation of the two sets of six major channels (six to the right and six to left), which are the roots of the sixty minor saṃkrāntis. These are the twelve major channels of the twelve houses, or major saṃkrāntis.
Next, in the third month, the death omens [pass] through both nostrils and increase by a third day—moving for a thirty-third day—thereby terminating the wind dhātus and Rāhu dhātus. Fourteen channels at the head, twenty-eight at the throat, eight at the heart, and twenty-eight at the secret place atrophy. Subsequently, since the skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas do not have their usual connections with objects and perceiving subjects, the 21,600 [life-force winds][496]—called “the winds of great darkness,” which bring the complete termination of the wisdom winds—move for one solar day and cause departure to the next [state of existence]. Thus, darkness terminates.

The quotient of dividing the 1,125 days in three years and three half months by thirty-two and a half [establishes] the verity of the death omens in the madhyamā.
That statement is proven by means of the following calculations. Since the divisor [32½] entails a half fraction, it is multiplied by two to give taste-arrow [sixty-five].• To make the dividend [1,125] equivalent,[497] it is multiplied by two, yielding eyes-tattva-space [2,250].
That thus-increased dividend [2,250] is divided by the divisor [sixty-five], yielding thirty-four days [with a remainder of forty]. The remainder of forty [is converted to] ghaṭikās by multiplying by sixty, [making 2,400]. That [2,400] is divided by taste-arrow [sixty-five], making thirty-six [with a remainder of sixty].
The remainder of sixty [is converted to] pāṇīpalas by multiplying by sixty, [yielding 3,600,] which is then divided [by sixty-five], making fifty-five [with a remainder of twenty-five]. The remainder of twenty-five [is converted to] breaths by multiplying by six, [resulting in 150,] which is divided [by sixty-five], making two [with a remainder of twenty].[498] The remainder of twenty [is converted to] breath parts by multiplying by thirty-two and a half, [making 650,] which is divided [by sixty-five,] making ten [with no remainder]. [284]
Added together, there are thirty-four days, thirty-six ghaṭikās, fifty-five pāṇīpalas, two breaths, and ten of the thirty-two and a half parts of a breath. These principles of the Rāhu death omens in the madhyamā are shared: they are shared between the solar and lunar winds on the right and left.

The 1,125 days of three years and three half months are reduced by the madhyamā days and so forth; and the quotients are divided by two.[499] This yields 545 days, eleven ghaṭikās, thirty-two [pāṇī]palas, one breath, and twenty-seven of the thirty-two and a half parts of a breath.[500]
To facilitate an understanding of the process, [I will state it] again: Below [or starting with] the wrathful-tattva [1,125] days list the five: the madhyamā days to the [breath] parts. The days (at the top) are reduced by what are lower [the ghaṭikās] and the remainder is carried down and multiplied to taste-space [(sixty) ghaṭikās]. Continue by subtracting the ghaṭikās of the madhyamā and [carrying those] to the next place. This makes, in order, 1,090 [days],[501] twenty-three [ghaṭikās], four [pāṇīpalas], three [breaths], and twenty-two [breath parts]. That is the share of the sun and moon combined.
To understand [each step] individually: dividing the days by two [yields] no remainder, as was stated above. Dividing the ghaṭikās [by two] produces one remainder. When [that remainder is converted to, or] multiplied by, pāṇīpalas and combined below, [the division] is exact. Dividing the breaths [by two] yields one remainder. When [that remainder is converted to, or] multiplied by, the thirty-two [breath parts], combined below and [the breath parts] are divided, [the result] is exact.•

As for the solar death omens: death omens moving for one day through the right nostril are an omen of certain death in three years and three half months if death is not outwitted. (That completes the [introductory] link.)
► When [death omens] move for five days through the right nostril, there are three years of life remaining. That is the sign that the five channels of the Taurus house have ceased.
► Next, the death omens increase gradually throughout one year. When they move for ten days through the right nostril, there are two years of life remaining. That is the sign that the five channels of the Gemini house have ceased.
► Again, [the death omens] increase throughout one year. When they move for fifteen days through the right nostril, there is only one year of life left. That is the sign that the five channels of the Cancer house have ceased.
► Then, the death omens increase by a day each month. When during six months they move for twenty days through the right nostril, there are six months left of life to live. That is the sign that the five channels of the Leo house have been emptied.
► Next, the death omens increase by five days during three months. When they move for twenty-five days through the right nostril, there are three remaining months of life. [286] That is the sign that the five channels of the Virgo house have been emptied.
Those gradual increases of the death-omen days in multiples of five during the years and months cause the twenty-five channels in five houses to become empty.
Then, with the death omens increasing each day by one day, one house is vacated.
► [Death omens] moving for four days through the left nostril [and] twenty-six days through the right indicate that two months of life remain. That is the sign that the five channels of the Libra house have been emptied.
► Next, [death omens] moving for three days through the left nostril [and] twenty-seven through the right mean that it is possible that there is one month left to live. That is the sign that the five channels of the Scorpio house have been emptied.
Up to this point, death can be outwitted through the force of yoga.[504]

Once, due to the increase of death omens, the seventh house from Taurus (Scorpio) has gone (that is, has become empty), the death omens have expanded to the point that no one can reverse death. Death will definitely come in thirty-three days. The death omens increase in the remaining one month and three days of life as follows.
► The death omens increasing during fifteen days cause the five channels of the Sagittarius house to become empty. [287]
► Then, they increase during ten days, causing the five channels of the Capricorn house to become empty.
► Next, they increase during five days, causing the five channels of the Aquarius house to become empty.
► Then, by increasing during three days, the five channels of the Pisces house become empty.
The death omens moving for thirty-three[505] days on the right causes those four houses to be vacated. Once the eleventh house has become empty, the sun’s strength terminates.
After that, the wind that terminates the moon’s strength moves for two days through the left nostril. The twelfth house—which is the Aries house with its five channels—becomes empty. The winds no longer move through the sixty channel petals at the navel. Then, the wind of great darkness moves for one day in the madhyamā. Since all the navels of the chakras have been cut off, the consciousness goes elsewhere, that is, to another existence.

The movements of death omens for one day through the left nostril are a sign that departure to another existence will definitely occur in three years and three half months. The principles expressed in that [introductory] link are simply an approximation. To understand this in detail, we must look at the period of forty-five days, which are the [three] half months, after which no [life] remains—even though departure occurs after three years.
The death-omens increase during six months. Since they increase by a day every two months, at the end of six months, they move for three days through the left nostril. Now there are thirty months of life remaining for this person. Those [death omens] are signs that one house at the navel—the Aries house with its five channels—has become empty.
Following that, the death-omen days increase by one each month. Thus, every three months, one house (with its five channels) at the navel is vacated. Each three-day increase of death-omen days is a sign that one house has become empty.
As the number of days of the lunar death-omen winds [moving] through the left nostril increases, the number of months of remaining life decreases. The correspondence [between the death omens increasing and the houses emptying] takes place in the following sequence.

At three months, when the death omens move for thirty-three days through the left nostril, the lunar energy terminates, and death is certain to come in three days. That is the sign that the eleventh house at the navel—the Aquarius house with its five channels—has become empty.
Next, the wind that terminates the solar dhātus moves for two days through the right nostril, and the house of Pisces[507] with its five channels becomes empty. Then, the wind of great darkness moves for one day in the madhyamā, after which the consciousness goes somewhere else: to another existence.
Erratic movements of both the solar and lunar winds for just a few days lack any definitiveness. It is explained that they appear as indications of bad omens or are created by illnesses.

Whether we live for one hundred years (as discussed in detail above) or only for one day after birth depends on whether the winds move in all the channels without exception or only move in the madhyamā and not through any other channels. That means that the lengths of our lives are determined by the movements of the winds. For those who will die in three years after birth, the winds move only in 2,250 channels. It is said that such explanations show that the duration of life is determined by the winds moving in various numbers of channels.• Those are the principles and rationale of the timely and untimely death omens.

If the force of previous karma causes someone to die suddenly—without timely or untimely wind death omens—how do their channels and winds cease? When strong poisons, sharp weapons, or serious illnesses (which are all sudden conditions for death) cause the channels and winds to cease all at once, that death is said to be a sudden death. The way the channels, winds, and bindus cease in this situation is described as follows:
What occurs in the navel
is what occurs in the other chakras.
Thus it is said.[510] In the same way that the five elemental winds of the twelve lagnas and the solar, lunar, and Rāhu dhātus cease all at once in the navel, in the other chakras, the eight periods at the heart, the lunar mansions at the throat, and the succession of lunar padas at the head are vacated all at once. In each of the five [main] chakras and the thirty chakras of the joints, there are twelve daṇḍas for each of the five elemental winds, [making sixty maṇḍalas of elemental winds] with arising and dissolution sequences. Once those sixty maṇḍalas [of the dissolution sequence] move for six days, there is termination.
Having provided explanations of the individual [dissolution processes, here] the wind’s death omens are presented in terms of their common [or collective] dissolution [processes] along with their principles.

After the channels have formed completely, the bindus increase until the sixteenth year in boys and the twelfth year in girls. That is the expansion of the wisdom dhātus. Then, from the seventeenth year in boys and the thirteenth year in girls, the white elements gradually decline and fade. [293] Next, the blood dhātus (the red elements) increase for sixteen years. At thirty-two years of age, the blood dhātus will fade.
The strengths of the wind dhātus, fire dhātus, water dhātus, and earth dhātus fade and decline every sixteen years. The generalized calculation is that all the body's strengths will have dissipated by the ninety-seventh year.[511]

Since the dhātus of phenomena, semen, degenerate both above and below, after one day we will go somewhere else, to another world. At that time, our white-element quintessences (which we received from our father) will descend from the crown of our heads, and our red-element quintessences (which we received from our mother) will ascend from our navel. The winds of the maṇḍalas will depart through the doors of our nostrils in no particular order and not return. At that point, our ālaya resides in the center of the white and red elements that are now united at our heart (having come from above and below). Our skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas dissolve. Although ground luminosity, the dharmakāya, is experienced, because, as an ordinary being, we do not recognize it, we depart for another existence. [295]

Once the quintessences of the white elements, red elements, and winds gather in our heart, if our ālaya consciousness departs through our opening of Brahmā at the crown of our head, we will be born in one of the four formless states. If our consciousness departs through our bindu (meaning the point between our eyebrows), we will be born as a god with the Great Goddess, that is, in one of the sixteen levels of the form realm.
If our consciousness departs through our navel, we will be born in one of the six classes of desire realm gods or we will be born as a demigod (which is the view stated in some tantras). If our consciousness departs through our eyes, we will be born as a powerful human in the desire realm, that is, in the kṣhatriya [or warrior] caste. If our consciousness departs through our nostrils, we will be born in the land of yakṣhas, the northern region of Alakāvatī.
If our consciousness departs through our ears, we will be born as a deity of accomplishment, meaning as a vidyādhara god in the Thirty-Three. It is said that if our consciousness departs through our paths of existence (semens pathway), we will be born as a hungry ghost. According to the Saṃvarodaya, we will be become a hungry ghost [if our consciousness departs] through our mouth. Since Chatuḥpīṭha Tantra commentaries state that the path of existence is the mouth, [the path to being reborn as a hungry ghost] is both [the mouth and the pathway of semen].
If our consciousness departs through our urethra, we will be born as an animal. [296] If our consciousness departs through our lower door, we will be born in one of the eight great hells.•
Next, immediately after our departure and until we connect with our next birth, the appearances of the bardo manifest. The only exceptions to this are those who have committed the five acts of immediate consequence and those taking birth in the formless [realm, since they do not experience a bardo between their previous life and their next birth].
We can learn the details of the bardos from the exalted Rangjung Dor-je’s Treatise Summarizing the “Foundations of Mindfulness”[513] and the bardo section of the six dharmas.[514]

Those stages of dissolution can be summarized as the [dissolution] stages of illumination, radiance, and attainment. The vanishing of what is coarse— forms, sounds, and so forth—and illumination is the nirmāṇakāya dissolution. The vanishing of what is subtle—conceptuality—and radiance is the saṃbhogakāya dissolution. The ālaya abiding in luminosity and the vanishing of attainment is the dharmakāya dissolution. Although those are dissolutions into the nature of the three kāyas—that is, into luminosity— we do not recognize that.
We are unable to differentiate between sugatagarbha, which is called illumination—mind, whose nature is luminosity—and what obscures it: the darkness of ignorance.• We do not realize, just as they are, [emptiness, great emptiness, and extremely great emptiness]. Emptiness is that the six modes of consciousness and their objects are not real. Great emptiness is that [afflictive] mentation with its formative forces, which resides in the ālaya, is not real. Extremely great emptiness is that the ālaya consciousness is not real.
Thus we wander repeatedly in the cycles of saṃsāra. [297] And yet, since the path refines and gradually purifies those stains, wisdom will manifest. With full purification, that [wisdom] is nirvāṇa, the final dharmakāya.

Those eleven sections, or chapters, provided detailed explanations of the natures of the ground, path, and result. Now the third general point [of this treatise] will, by means of its synopsis [of those topics and chapters], enable us to understand the rationale for the Mantra piṭakas. Since all the genuine scriptural dharma belongs to one of three piṭakas, this chapter will explain the correspondences between the outer and inner piṭakas, the purpose of understanding those, and other [related points].

The Victor, the true, perfect Buddha, taught in all four sections of tantras about the external worldly realms, skandhas, dhātus, āyatanas, and so forth, that appear to cognition [in ways] that seems to be shared externally—even though there are no referents that exist apart from mind. In the Vajrayāna, he presented the channels, winds, and bindus of the internal vajra body, and the deities and mantras of the “other” imagined generation process. Such teachings describe the bases of purification, which continue for as long as stained conceptuality defiles, and the result, when the twofold stainless wisdom—the qualitative and quantitative knowledges—manifests. He taught that all those involve elaborations (such as names, words, and letters) in the context of conventional truth, and are of the nature of suchness, devoid of the elaborations of percepts and perceivers, in the context of ultimate truth.•
Although all phenomena are the unification of the two truths, as a method that can be easily understood by sentient beings who engage conceptually, it is taught that all phenomena (from forms to omniscience) can be characterized as threefold: as definition, definiendum, and basis for definition, each of which can also be classified as threefold.• The Ornament [for the Mahāyāna Sūtras] states:
To benefit sentient beings, the buddhas teach using the characterizations of bases for definition, definitions, and definienda.[516]

To guide those sentient beings to be trained who have descended into particular [wrong] views, the philosophical yānas teach that what appear as external worldly realms have no separate creator, such as a self or Brahma. Dependently arisen appearances are simply the reflexive appearances of our mind. Appearances do not exist externally: they are included within [the category of] conceptually imputed nonassociated formative forces. Appearances manifest as the environment and its inhabitants (support and supported); the subtle (such as instants and small particles) and the gross (such as the mental continuum and Mount Meru); names (like “vase”), words (like “a vase is impermanent”), and letters (such as a), which are the bases for the previous two; directions (east and the others); time (the past and so forth); and other things included within [this category]: the factors to be abandoned and their remedies, and the mind and mental factors. All such detailed teachings found in the sūtras are considered to be the abhi-dharma that is part of the Pāramitā[yāna], external to the Vajrayāna. These teachings are found, for example, in the Compendium of Abhidharma and Treasury of Abhidharma.

The examples are that closed eyes cannot see any images of forms at all; that, when undamaged eyes are open, the manifestations of forms[518] (such as the moon) are clearly present; and [302] that, when we press on our eyes and look out, we see two moons even though there is only one; that is, pressing on our eyes, the cause for our mistake, makes [one thing] appear to be two.
Accordingly, those three examples illustrate the following. Those who do not know how to bind the vital points of the supports (the channels, winds, and bodhichittas) cannot see directly the wisdom that is the mastery of the inseparability of cyclic existence and peace—even though they may understand the external abhidharma’s teachings on the factors to be abandoned and their remedies. Those who bind the vital points of the supports (the channels, winds, and bindus) will see directly the wisdom of the path: the ten signs, the excellent qualities of bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality, and the inseparability of appearances and emptiness. Although the referents of the generation process and its branches are not external to our own mind, conceptually imagined deities and maṇḍala chakras are displayed in order to master displaying numerous emanations as appearances for others. That is the reason [for training in the generation process].•
The first analogy illustrates the difference between the external abhi-dharma and the internal abhidharma. The second shows the distinctiveness of the perfection process, and the third, the distinctiveness of the generation process.
In brief, the subjects of discussion in the abhidharma piṭaka are the training in higher prajñā, the skillful methods that quickly give rise to that, and the means for directly realizing the wisdom of the path and the result. Thus, the term “the abhidharma of the inner principles” applies to all Secret Mantra treatises.

The external sūtras of the Pāramitāyāna teach the trainings in the higher concentrations and the stages of the bhūmis and paths. In the tantras, the deity meditations and practices of the maṇḍalas, which are described as the “other” maṇḍala chakras, [303] are connected to the samādhis that achieve benefit for both oneself and others. [Specifically, these samādhis] include [the means for achieving] the ten bhūmis (which are the inner abodes, nearby abodes, and so forth), the five paths, the ten pāramitās, the thirty-seven factors for awakening (using dhāraṇī mantras, secret mantras, and awareness-mantras), the totalities, overpowerings, and so forth, as branches[519] of the generation and perfection processes, as well as the [divine] eye and other supercognitive abilities. [The tantras] teach extensively on what is profound and vast. Therefore, the Vajrayāna is said to be the internal sūtras and pāramitās.

Of the two types of vinaya, external and internal, the external vinaya is as follows. According to the teachings given in the four [vinaya] scriptures and elsewhere, the vinaya is the means for achieving peace because it [provides] protection from, and vows related to, the seven physical and verbal factors to be abandoned and what is associated with them, and because it involves the ethical discipline of abandoning both natural misdeeds and proscribed misdeeds. That is the vinaya of the Pāramitāyāna.
The internal [vinaya] is the teachings in the tantras on how to change the mental afflictions into wisdoms by means of the special skillful methods of the generation and perfection processes and by protecting the ethical discipline of vows. It is [practiced] by those who are not confused about the way to benefit themselves and others, which is by cultivating the two types of bodhichitta. Having changed the afflictions into wisdoms, they are able to tame the misdeeds of the mental afflictions and take all sentient beings beyond the faults of saṃsāra. The Mantrayāna teaches the vinaya of the inner principles, the training in higher ethical discipline.
Consequently, Secret Mantra is said to contain all three piṭakas. [304] It is abhidharma in that it describes, individually and uniquely, all phenomena in terms of their specific and general characteristics, correlates the external supports and supported to the internal ones, and brings about the direct realization of wisdom. It is sūtra in that it accurately presents the bhūmis, paths, factors for awakening, totalities, overpowerings, [divine] eyes, supercognitive abilities, and the abiding state of profound emptiness. It is vinaya in that it teaches the methods for controlling the mental afflictions, by protecting us from all unfavorable physical, verbal, and mental factors equally, and by relying on special inner proscriptions.[520] Since [Secret Mantra] is in harmony with, or contains, all three piṭakas, it is called the Vidyādhara piṭakas.

Those who understand the three Hīnayāna pitakas—its vinaya, abhidharma, and sūtras, which are the means of presenting the external principles—achieve the temporal results of the shrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas: mere arhathood.
More wonderful than those [piṭakas] are the sūtras, vinaya, and abhidharma of the profound principles found in the Mahāyāna’s Pāramitā[yāna] and the lower sections of tantra. However, they are difficult for inferior beings to comprehend. Those who understand them and undertake the practices of the three trainings are bodhisattvas. Their result is the unsurpassable awakening that only manifests after a long period of time. [305] Those who, additionally, fully understand the inner principles of the special skillful methods, such as the ones taught in this treatise, and who correctly realize the mode of the two truths, the heart of the buddhas, take fruitional realization as their path. Realizing that the ground and result are identical in nature, they quickly achieve unsurpassable buddhahood. That being the aim [of the Vajrayāna], this treatise provides concise verses that reveal the profound principles—the methods for understanding the profound inner principles taught in the Vajrayāna’s tantras.

When sense direct cognition, mental direct cognition, and reflexively aware direct cognition are joined with true yogic cognition, all is of the nature of connate wisdom, yogic direct cognition.• Yet the stains that obscure that wisdom are such that the ālaya is not recognized to be luminosity. The movements of that [lack of recognition] are the surfacing of afflictive mentation: what is not “I” is taken to be “I,” and what is not a self is taken to be a self. The cognition involved with the factors to be abandoned—the delusive concepts [that consider] percepts and perceivers to be separate—arises and expands. It is adventitious since it can be separated[521] from wisdom. By obscuring the nature, it creates a double delusion.
When formative forces[522] (which are the afflictive mentation present within the ālaya) fully manifest as the three realms, what exists in fact— the true abiding state—is not seen. [306] Like mistaking a mirage for water, the mind that takes things to be what they are not sees what in fact does not exist: the varieties of delusive appearances. Since their wisdom is mired in the mud of their concepts, ordinary, childish beings circle and sink in saṃsāra’s ocean of suffering.

Wisdom at the time of the path realizes that the external worldly realms, the internal vajra body, and the “other” maṇḍala chakras are inseparable as wisdom-mahāmudrā, suchness. Thus, [all phenomena][523] are, in fact, of the nature of the buddhas. The equivalent [Sanskrit] term for [the Tibetan] sang-gye (sangs rgyas) is “buddha,” which can be used for both understanding and realization.
With practice, conventionally, all conceptually elaborated characteristics—which include the dualistic appearances of percepts and perceivers— are seen to be the mind’s own brilliance. They appear to conceptuality as external referents while, in fact, not existing, just like the moon reflected in water. The essence of the ultimate truth is to see the eighteen emptinesses as reality: the singular abiding state, the inseparability of objects and perceiving subjects. Cultivating the prajñā that unifies the two truths is the means for purifying all obscurations.

Practicing the yoga of unification frees us from afflictive obscurations (such as desire), cognitive obscurations (concepts of the three spheres and so forth), and obscurations to absorption (whatever impedes samādhi), along with their latent tendencies. The wisdom that is the intuitive reflexive awareness of the abiding states of the two truths, just as they are, is the wisdom of the buddhas. In terms of its objects, it is said to be the two types of wisdom: the wisdom that knows dharmatā qualitatively and the wisdom that knows phenomena quantitatively.

This treatise explaining the profound inner principles is not flawed by being a personal fabrication. The bhagavat Buddha knows perfectly the abiding mode of all phenomena, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and is victorious over the four māras. What he taught in the sūtras and tantras is all I wrote.
If that is the case, since the tantras taught by the Victor are enclosed in the six parameters and four modes, are they not extremely difficult to comprehend? Is it not, therefore, inappropriate to explain them? [309] While that is so, nevertheless, many commentaries have been written by the lords of the secrets of the body, speech, and mind of all buddhas—the protectors belonging to the three families, the bodhisattvas with the authority to compile the [Buddhas] words—and the scholars and siddhas (Saraha, Nāgārjuna and his followers, and others), who behold the suchness of the Vajrayāna.• Relying on the power that resides in those texts and my own analytical abilities, I saw with the eyes of intelligence. I utterly and truly discovered the profound inner principles of the Vajrayāna: I understood well the actual and implied meanings of the words[524] and uncovered the secrets of the principles, just as they are. I, therefore, have the confidence to speak without hesitation. (That is [Rangjung Dorje’s] statement of his certainty.)

The Victor perfected his relinquishment and realization on the basis of the Vajrayāna path. Having conquered māras and unfavorable conditions, the factors to be abandoned, he is free from all obscurations. He perfected great peace, which is unconditioned, spontaneously present, and without arising or cessation. [In his Entrance to the Middle Way] Chandrakīrti states:
When the dry wood of knowable objects is fully consumed, there is peace: the dharmakāya of the victorious ones.
At that point, there is neither arising nor cessation.
With the cessation of mind, the [saṃbhoga]kāya makes this [dharmakāya] manifest.[525] [310]
Once the mind, the ālaya consciousness, has ceased, the Tathāgata’s wisdom kāya becomes manifest. Thus, he is endowed with the kāya of space, the svabhāvikakāya, the stainless dharmadhātu. The dharmakāya is achieved by means of that profound concordant cause. Since the dharmakāya is of the nature of the four wisdoms (mirror-like and the others), it is called the wisdom kāya or, in the Kālachakra, the solar kāya. Since it dispels the darkness of ignorance and brings the attainment that illuminates all infinite knowable objects, here it is referred to by the metaphor “maṇḍala of wisdom sun.”
From that wisdom kāya, multitudes of rūpakāyas are displayed in the worldly realms of the ten directions, extending throughout space, continuously, for as long as saṃsāra is not emptied. This is the inconceivable secret of [the Buddhas] kāyas.

The activities of the body, speech, and mind of the Victor manifest altruistically in all the realms of sentient beings, engaging with those who have mental afflictions. Despite that, the Buddhas body, speech, and mind are not sullied by their mental afflictions in any way. An analogy for this is the sun’s light: it touches everything and everybody—precious mountains, the ground, forests, places that are unclean and filthy, and all kinds of sentient beings—and it performs its functions of illuminating, drying, and burning, yet it is not tainted by the substances [it touches]. In the same way, although the Buddhas activity engages with the various dispositions of those to be trained, pure and impure, their mental afflictions do not stain the Buddhas activity. To you, the self-arisen, unchanging Victor, the true, perfect Buddha, I, Rangjung Dorje (the author of this treatise explaining the profound inner principles), respectfully pay genuine homage with my body, speech, and mind.

His composition of this treatise has no faults, misunderstandings, mistaken ideas, or doubts. Nevertheless, he said that, if in writing about the hidden profound principles of the tantras in a way that can be clearly understood there are any breaches with samaya, however slight, may the gatherings of ḍākinīs, who are the holders of the dharma, be patient.

To the one who resembles the two supreme chariots of the Noble Land,
where the teachings of the unrivaled supreme Teacher [flourished], [315]
to the mighty lord, the self-arisen [Rangjung] Vajra Holder, I bow.
I touch [the feet of] the glorious vassal kings, the other scholar-siddhas.
The various scriptures—and even one word—
can be understood in an infinite variety of ways.
Thus there appear transmissions of collective writings, extensive and concise,
commentaries produced by discerning minds.
When some hear the profound and deep root vajra teachings,
they seem to have something resembling an understanding.
Yet only a few grasp the secret key points
unifying the one viewpoint of the great chariots of sūtra and tantra.
Those who hear just a fragment can only discuss and explain a fragment.
The one root is explained in many ways—not just one.
The Victor’s teachings can be co-opted by our own faulty intellects.
In the degenerate age, the activity of scholars is mostly to deceive.

Those with weak intellects and inferior training cannot fathom any of this, and spout much falsehood—like me. Though not capable of unraveling the meaning of profound words,
I always follow those with superior minds.
In this way, being possessed of lineage, a bit of training, some understanding, and open eyes, with devotion, I repeat the excellent speech of the previous supreme seers—
though the collection of words of various explanations can proliferate [on their own].
Those who, full of the water of words, feed on the power of the profound principles, [316]
are repudiated in the tantras and Commentaries by Bodhisattvas. Followers of authentic scholar-siddhas with the eyes of dharma are deep in both temporal and lasting [ways].

When the stream of excellence is sullied by the dross of childish minds,

By hearing of the nature of the heart—the unified two truths— may it be understood, and may the profound view be unerringly realized.
By contemplating the external, internal, “other,” and suchness, may those who have discovered certainty train in the meditations on channels, winds, and bindus.
May threefold conduct enhance the inseparability of ground and result, the three vajras, and supreme connate union.
From the expanse of the dharmakāya, the first buddha, may a great cloud of rūpakāyas radiate throughout the space-pervading chakra.

[For the composition of] this [commentary]—Illuminating “The Profound Principles”: A Concise Elucidation of “The Profound Inner Principles, ” Which Contains the Essence of the Ocean of Yoganiruttara Tantras—I requested, with great perseverance, the reading transmission of the words and the exegetical transmission for the root text and the Autocommentary, and [Könchok Yenlak’s Illuminating] the Essential Content. I was also able to gain some understanding. [317] Out of their concern for the teachings, and in the context of explaining and propagating, some great beings with the highest intentions directly and indirectly encouraged [me to write this commentary].
Since the Autocommentary is very deep, it is hard to understand. [Illuminating] the Essential Content does not provide a complete presentation of each word of the treatise. With other commentaries, only the reading transmission remains, and the extensive and concise [commentaries] do not suit recipients of lower intellects. Those on the path who aspire [to practice] the six dharmas of the great and glorious Nāropa have no alternative but to understand just this [text].
With the hope that at least the exegetical stream will continue, I kept in mind my motivation to write only a word-commentary and transcended my idleness. Later on, as service to the great illuminator of the teachings of the practice lineage, the third Ontrul, Karma Drupgyu Tenzin Tinle— in connection with the practices of the three grounds and to establish the exegetical transmission—[I,] Karma Ngak-wang Yonten Gyatso Tinle Künkhyab Palzangpo, or Lodrö Taye, a renunciate following the teachings of the omniscient Karmapa and his spiritual sons, in my mature years, composed this in the upper hermitage of Drubde Kunzang Dechen Ösal Ling at the Kagyu seat of Palpung in Do-kham. I wrote it in a few words and in a way that is easy to understand, without inserting any new elaborations, incorporating the key points of the aforementioned excellent explanations.
May it be a cause for fortunate ones to accurately realize the profound inner principles and for the tradition that is the heart of the practice lineage to increase and expand, like summer lakes, without ever diminishing.
