<d e="2">
The following prayers intone the names of the progenitors or inspirational sources of the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks and their successive historical lineage holders in India and Tibet through to the time of their compiler, Kunga Drolchok (1507–1565). Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Taye (1813–1899) later extended the lineage of the first prayer, Parting from the Four Attachments, by adding the names of subsequent lineage holders who followed Kunga Drolchok, including the latter’s acknowledged reincarnation Drolmei Gonpo Tāranātha (1575–1634), as well as Rinchen Dorjéma Ratnavajriṇī (1585–1668), Katok Tsewang Norbu (1698–1755), Zhalu Lotsāwa Losal Tenkyong (b. 1804), and Jamyang Khyentsé Wangpo (1820–1892). Readers should understand that this extended lineage is to be appended to each of the one hundred and eight guidebooks in turn.
Each prayer concludes with a pithy quatrain requesting the blessings of the lineage holders and alluding tersely to the doctrinal content of the lineage in question. In a few instances, explanatory notes have been added, but in general the reader should understand that these allusions and technicalities are explained in the corresponding guidebooks themselves (chap. 9).
In his concluding remarks at the end of this chapter, Kunga Drolchok comments on the difficulty he encountered in composing these versified prayers. In order to maintain the meter, he frequently resorted to a well-established poetic device—rendering the names of the successive lineage holders obliquely through epithets or contracted variant forms. For the aid of the reader, this translation presents these names not in metrical verse but in a simplified linear form, and each prayer is preceded by a short paragraph, which I have added, that dates the relevant chronology.

The progenitors of the first lineage are Śākyamuni Buddha and the bodhisattva Mañjughoṣa, whose revelation was transmitted to Sachen Kunga Nyingpo (1092–1158), the first of the five founders of Sakya Monastery. His successors, the hierarchs of Sakya, include Sonam Tsemo (1142–1182), Drakpa Gyeltsen (1147–1216), Sakya Paṇḍita Kunga Gyeltsen (1182–1251), Chogyel Pakpa Lodro Gyeltsen (1235–1280), Zhang Konchok Pel (1240–1317), Drakpukpa Sonam Pelwa (1277–1350), Lama Dampa Sonam Gyeltsen (1312–1375), Lama Dampa Pelden Tsultrim (1333–1399), Sharchen Yeshé Gyeltsen (1359–1406), Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo (1382–1456), Gyeltsab Kunga Wangchuk (1424–1478), and Kunga Chogdrub (fl. fifteenth–sixteenth centuries) who was an important teacher of Kunga Drolchok (1507–1565). The extended lineage (see above) includes: Choku Lhawang Drakpa (fl. sixteenth century), Tāranātha (1575–1634), Rinchen Dorjéma Ratnavajriṇī (1585–1668), Rinchen Gyatso (fl. seventeenth century), Nyingpo Tayepa (fl. seventeenth century), Kunzang Wangpo (fl. early eighteenth century), Katok Tsewang Norbu (1698–1755), Kunzang Choying Rangdrol, Kunzang Chojor, Lobzang Tutob (fl. late eighteenth–early nineteenth centuries), Nyima Chopelwa, Zhalu Lotsāwa Losal Tenkyong (b. 1804), and Jamyang Khyentsé Wangpo (1820–1892).

I supplicate the teachers of the primary lineage.
Grant your blessing that the genuine coalescent middle way

Separated from all grasping,
Including attachment to this life,
Attachment to cyclic existence—the three world systems,
Attachment to self-interest, and attachment to prejudice.[2] {3}

The progenitors of this lineage are Śākyamuni Buddha and the bodhisattva Maitreyanātha, who revealed the instruction to Maitrīpā (ca. 986–1063 or 1007–1085). The latter’s Indian successors were the great paṇḍita Ānandakīrti (fl. eleventh century) and Sajjana (fl. eleventh century), who introduced the instruction to the Tibetan translator Ngok Lotsāwa Loden Sherab (1059–1109). The succession then fell to Tsen Khawoché (b. 1021), Gya Marwa, Drolungpa Lodro Jungné (fl. eleventh–twelfth centuries), Chapa Chokyi Sengé (1109–1169), Dulkarwa, Tsangpa Dregurwa Dongtro Dulwadzin, Jamyang Darma Ozer, Drubpa Sengé, Bagton Tsultrim Gyeltsen (fl. thirteenth–fourteenth centuries), Pangton Drubpa Sherab (fl. fourteenth century), Yagton Sangyé Pel (1348–1414), Rongton Sheja Kunrik (1367–1449), Paṇchen Donyo Drubpa (fl. fifteenth–sixteenth centuries), and Pelden Tsultrim.

The progenitor of this lineage is the primordial buddha Mahāvajradhara, along with the female deity Vajravārāhī, who revealed this instruction directly to Ānandavajra. The succession was maintained in India by Vajrāsana the Elder and Vajrāsana the Younger, who was also known as Amoghavajra. The last mentioned introduced the practice to Bari Lotsāwa Rinchen Drak (1040–1112), after which it was transmitted, largely through the Sakya lineage in Tibet, as follows: Sachen Kunga Nyingpo (1092–1158), Sonam Tsemo (1142–1182), Drakpa Gyeltsen (1147–1216), Sakya Paṇḍita Kunga Gyeltsen (1182–1251), Chogyel Pakpa Lodro Gyeltsen (1235–1280), Zhangton Konchok Pel (1240–1317), Drakpukpa Sonam Pelwa (1277–1350), Pelden Lama Dampa Sonam Gyeltsen (1312–1375), Gyelsé Tokmé Zangpo (1295–1369), Jangsem Radengpa, Śākya Chokden (1428–1507), and Changlungpa Zhonu Chodrub (fl. fifteenth–sixteenth centuries).

The progenitors of this lineage are the primordial buddha Mahāvajradhara and the bodhisattva Vajrapāṇi, who revealed this instruction to Karmavajra. The latter’s immediate successors in India were Tang Lotsāwa, Shing Lopa, Karṇaripā, and Valacaṇḍa. The lineage was introduced to Tibet by Rechungpa Dorjé Drak (1085–1161) and continued through the following, largely Drukpa Kagyu, transmission: Sumpa Repa Rinchen Gyeltsen (fl. twelfth century), Lingjé Repa Pema Dorjé (1128–1188), Dzongripa Konchok Zangpo, Riwo Gangpa, Uriwa, Sangdak Drubchen, Tulku Jodenpa (ca. 1292–1361), Gangtropa, Khenchen Jangchubsem, Sangyé Zangpo, Nesar Zhonu Drub, Lhundrub Dorjé, and Rabsel Dawa Gon (fl. fifteenth–sixteenth centuries).

The Indian transmission continued through Maitrīpā (ca. 986–1063 or 1007–1085), Nāyakapāda, Vikhyātadeva, the great paṇḍita Śākyaśrī of Kashmir (1127–1225), and Dānaśīla (fl. twelfth century), after whom it was introduced to Tibet by Chak Lotsāwa Chojé Pel (1197–1263/4). The lineage was then maintained by his successors: Zhonu Gyeltsen, Sherab Pel, Lekden Pelchen, Yeshé Pelwa, Gyelsé Lobzang Peljor, Chak Lotsāwa Rinchen Chogyel (b. 1447), and Kunpang Rinpoché Chokyi Nyima (1449–1524).

The progenitor of this lineage is the primordial buddha in the form Kālacakra, who revealed the transmission to the religious kings of Śambhala and to the three bodhisattvas known as the “lords of the three enlightened families.” This lineage, distinct from the transmission of Somanātha, which is outlined in guidebook 40, appears to have entered Tibet somewhat later, through Menlung Guru Sonam Pel (b. 1239), who is known to have traveled to both Śambhala and Oḍḍiyāna. It was subsequently maintained in succession by Yarlungpa Lotsāwa Drakpa Gyeltsen, Nyemdo Kunga Dondrub (b. 1268), Kachupa Zhonu Sengé, Hūṃchen Namka Neljor, Hūṃ Gyel Lhundrub Rinchen, Rikgom Bepei Neljor, Chimé Drub, Drogon Chogyel Namka Pelzang (1462–1529), and Khewang Lotsāwa Rinchen Zangpo (1489–1563), the last of whom taught Kunga Drolchok.

The progenitor of this lineage is the buddha body of reality in the form of Amitābha and the buddha body of perfect resource in the form of Avalokiteśvara, who revealed the instruction directly to Songtsen Gampo, the buddha body of emanation (617–650). Later Padmākara (fl. eighth–ninth centuries) also instructed Tri Songdetsen (742–797), but the revelations of the king are said to have been rediscovered and redacted in their present form by the accomplished master Ngodrub (fl. eleventh–twelfth centuries) and Ngadak Nyangrel Nyima Ozer (ca. 1124–1192). Thereafter, the transmission was maintained through the latter’s disciple Menlungpa Mikyo Dorjé (fl. twelfth century), Śākya Zangpo, Lharjé Gewa Bum (b. twelfth century) to whom authorship of the present guidebook is attributed, Chammo Yeshé Chok, Chugompa, Tazhi Jadrel, Tsulchen Sonam Sengé, Tashi Gyeltsen, Churak Lodro Gyeltsen, Pak Chok Norzang, Hor Kabzhipa Sengé Gyeltsen (fl. fourteenth–fifteenth centuries), Pelden Lekpa, Kachu Jangchub Pel, Pakpa Lodro Rinchen, and Yigdruk Sherab Peljor (fl. fifteenth–sixteenth centuries). The last named was a teacher of Kunga Drolchok.

The progenitor of this lineage is the buddha body of reality in the form of Samantabhadra, and Vajradhara, who revealed the instruction directly to four male accomplished masters: Saraha, Śabaripā, Mitrayogin, and Padmākara (fl. eighth–ninth centuries), along with their four female consorts, the ḍākinīs of pristine cognition. The practice was revealed in Tibet as treasure by Drampa Kunga Zangpo and then transmitted in the following line: Trulzhik Kundarma, Ngokton the Great, Drakpa Peljor, and Norbu Rinchen, the last of whom instructed Kunga Drolchok.

Grant your blessing that we may realize the primordially pure buddha body of reality
In the gorge of instruction where the two rivers of Great Seal and Great Perfection converge,
Through multiplication of the four mothers and seventeen offspring,
And may our minds not grasp the ten signs [of realization]
That would be indicative of the abyss of eternalism and nihilism![52]

The progenitor of this lineage is the primordial buddha Mahāvajradhara, who revealed the instruction directly to Tilopā (988–1069). The latter taught Nāropā Jñānasiddhi (1016–1100), and his disciple Marpa Lotsāwa Chokyi Lodro (1012–1100) introduced the practice to Tibet, where the transmission passed through Milarepa (1040–1112), Dakpo Lharjé Gampopa (1079–1153), Kyebu Yeshé Dorjé, and the treasure revealer Drogon Dungtso Repa (fl. thirteenth–fourteenth centuries). Thereafter the instruction was handed down through Newu Repa, Choying Wangchuk, Garjong Gonpo Gyeltsen, Trulzhik Tsultrim Gyeltsen (fl. fourteenth–fifteenth centuries), Śākya Chokden (1428–1507), and Changlungpa Zhonu Chodrub (fl. fifteenth–sixteenth centuries). The last named was a teacher of Kunga Drolchok.

This supplication to the lineage of teachers who transmitted the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks is easy to recite, listing the names of the lineage holders, and it should be chanted many times. Each time it is recited, we should consider the great difficulty that was incurred while composing, expressing, collating, and refining the prayer. I composed these verses, having thoroughly grasped the gist of their essential points, which are extensive in the manner of a string of auspicious gems. When there are doubts based on misunderstanding of the oblique references to the names of the teachers, these have been elucidated and clarified by annotations. As for the usefulness of reciting this prayer from beginning to end, I have always kept in mind the simple thought and meditation that I should painstakingly commit this supplication to writing, but, owing to my physical distractions and idleness, I was in a state of apathy that deterred me from taking it in hand. At that time, my committed disciple Namdrol Sengé Pelzangpo[53] would encourage me repeatedly, each day. It was in this context that these verses have emerged from the ornaments of the mind of Kunga Drolchok.

It is said we should look to teachers for sacred doctrines and their transmissions.
This mode of activity is absent from our own mind with its conceited conduct,
But present in the essential buddha speech of Munīndra.
By persevering in conformity with it,
May we successfully acquire the freedoms and opportunities![54]
The supplicatory verses to the names of the lineages holders,
Embodiments of the sacred doctrine,
Are enhanced by [honorific terminations such as] -zhabs.
The armor [of bodhisattvas] that can withstand hardships
Arises from such subtle modes of expression.
Each one of these profound guidebooks
Constitutes a path that is naturally beneficial.
May the words spoken by these teachers,
Unerring, unadulterated, and without contradiction,
Untainted by mental analysis and conceptual thought,
Exactly come to pass, and flourish within our hearts!
By virtue of such merits of body and speech, well conducted {37}
And in association with the mind, wherever I have gathered them,
I dedicate these so that all beings, relying on the sacred doctrine,
Might abandon all the obscurations of past actions
And come to attain buddhahood.
Through the melodious voice of Mañjughoṣa—
Mighty lord of speech who is skilled in speech—
May our speech, skilled in verbalizing beautiful verses,
Melodious words free from negativity,
Auspiciously acquire the eloquent level of Vagīśvara!
The writer of this benediction is Kunga Lekgyel.[55]

This basic supplication to the lineage, which was composed by Venerable Kunga Drolchok, employs very concise words that, as it were, refresh the memory. For this reason, it is not easy to retain or recite, and it has become customary to embellish it for the most part with annotations.[56] Yet the original text itself is entirely flawless, and, besides that, it becomes extremely difficult to chant when these annotations are inscribed. But when the supplication lists the names alone, the text is not too verbose. I have, therefore, left the primary text unchanged, with all sorts of inconsistent variant forms of the names for the lineage holders, and I have discarded all the annotations. Having deleted the series of annotated names that were needlessly inserted, with the exception of those found in the supplement to the lineage that follows, the yogācārin Lodrö Tayé[57] then arranged the root verses as a ritual for reading aloud. I apologize for and confess any errors, mistakes, or faults that there may be to the teachers, the conquerors, and their heirs.
May this merit become the causal basis for the noble tradition of the profound One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks to flourish and expand, without decline, until the end of the rebirth process!
Let virtue prevail!

The supplementary lineage prayer that forms the content of the short second chapter was composed by Losal Tenkyong of Zhalu at the behest of Jamyang Khyentsé Wangpo. It commences with Kunga Drolchok (1507–1565), the compiler of the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks, and continues through the Jonang line of transmission as follows: the latter’s disciple Draktopa Choku Lhawang Drakpa (fl. sixteenth century), and reincarnation Tāranātha (also known as Drolwei Gonpo Kunga Nyingpo, 1575–1634), the ḍākinī Ratnavajriṇī (also known as Jonang Jetsunma Kunga Trinle Pelwangmo, 1585–1668), Khenchen Rinchen Gyatso Neten Dorjedzin (fl. seventeenth century), Nyingpo Lodro Tayé (fl. seventeenth century), Dzalongkar Lama Drubwang Kunzang Wangpo (fl. early eighteenth century), Katok Rigdzin Tsewang Norbu (1698–1755), Ngawang Nampar Gyelwa, On Dzalongkar Lama Kunzang Chojor, Drinchen Lobzang Tutob (fl. late eighteenth–early nineteenth centuries), Chakzampa Tulku Nyima Chopel, and the hermit Zhalu Lotsāwa Losal Tenkyong (b. 1804). Thereafter the lineage passed to Jamyang Khyentsé Wangpo (1820–1892) and Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Tayé (1813–1899), compiler of The Treasury of Precious Instructions.

Having requested the blessings of the lineage holders of the past, Kunga Drolchok now offers a prayer to sustain the lives and enhance the enlightened activities of those, such as himself, who recount the history of the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks, over successive lifetimes. The prayer contrasts the rarity of the sacred doctrine with counterfeit forms that would lead beings astray through sophistry, and dedicates the merit accrued by his documenting the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks for the sake of buddhahood on behalf of all sentient beings.

Supreme gems of buddha mind,
Gathering the elixir of the enlightened intention
Of all the conquerors, their heirs, and emanations,
May we realize at this time the profound ocean depths
Of your respective manifestations,
Unadulterated and untainted in many ways!
Through my good fortune as the boatman of liberation,
May hosts of beings, ten million in number, find the wish-fulfilling gems—
The repository of gems forming the instructions of the ocean of sacred doctrine
Handed down through the lineage of learned and accomplished mighty nāgas!
Like gems with their attributes, colors, and functions,
The sacred doctrine guides mental capacities by superior and inferior means.
This is a wondrous and marvelous drama of multiplicity—not singularity—
Resembling the efficacy of medications that alleviate disease.
This sacred doctrine may also be exemplified by the light
That radiates the diversity of sparkling gems.
Although it is no different from the light that is the color of quartz,
Ignorant fools abandon the supremely precious light
And accept one that is inferior. {43}
This resembles a fisherman, unable to expose by burning, cutting, or grasping
A wish-fulfilling gem found within a fish,
Who then, with pointless frustration, as if pearl were stone,
Casts the large fish back into the lake whence it came.
A gem such as this in which the wise rejoice
Is not an inferior object but renowned
As the crest of an empowered nāga king
Within lakes of glacial origin.

Those endowed with good fortune at the present day
In respect of the essential words and meanings
Contained within the great ocean of scripture of the present day
Adhere at the present day to topics appraised through pride in learning,
And, finally, at the present day they laboriously reject authentic words.
“How amazing are the words of our predecessors
That any unfortunate person who accepts the secret doctrine
Will, through the power of merit, excellently realize its words and meanings!”
So they say with the purposeful words of an old worldly person,
But the thoughts and deeds of demonic forces
Lead oneself and others astray through the common desire for knowledge,
Causing dissension within the sacred doctrine.
How pitiful are those in whose minds arise
Convictions opposed to the discussions of their teachers!
The lowest of the low are those possessed by all the well-known obstacles
That distort the view and practice. {44}
Under the sway of the most degenerate of all degenerations,
Those who shrink from acting to complete the accumulation of merit,
But who right here, starkly and with wide-eyed clarity
Resembling the magic of a Chinese weaving,[2]
Disclose the different patterns of the sacred doctrine
And the different nuances of exegesis
As objects to be manifoldly refined by their manifold erudition,
Have led beings according to the path of reason
That glibly employs words of sophistry,
Guiding them [ostensibly] toward intrinsic knowledge.
For them, the ordinary scriptures
And the infinite profound secrets of the way of Secret Mantra
Resemble poisoned foods of one hundred flavors.

Therefore, the omniscient ones who bear witness to authentic cognition
Should persevere to acquire the true meaning of study,
Without doubting the transmitted teachings of the Conqueror
And the lineage traditions that comment on their enlightened intention,
Exactly as they have been explained!
May I, too, have faith in the impartial Buddhist teaching
And take responsibility without degeneration
For the experiential cultivation of the Sakya tradition
Upheld by Mañjughoṣa in human form,
And apart from that may I not mistakenly impose hatred or attachment upon anyone!
May I liberate the minds of those who question and discuss
The philosophical systems of the elders of the past,
And any of their experiential cultivations, exegeses, or doctrinal discourses.
Oh! When I return to this world in the future,
May I persevere each day, again and again,
So that, with regard to the essentials of the sacred doctrine,
I may not inspect even a mere letter
Of books that have been fabricated;
And with my mind not exhibiting this excessively delusional approach,
Whether for a short time or when death is certain,
May my mind never waver for a mere instant
Toward unfinished study, reflection, and meditation
That resemble a pointless millstone in a terrifying gorge!

In order to achieve life-sustaining leisure
I will simply fulfill each latent impulse
That generates an advantageous foundation
Exclusively for the benefit of the sacred tradition in which I persevere {45}
And [in general] for the Buddhist teaching and living beings.
In sadness due to terrifying fear of the aeon of darkness,
Afraid of fabrications that resemble the sacred doctrine,
I weep excessively, thinking how things will turn out in other lives
If I have no independence.
With a mind that inspects the one hundred and eight guidebooks
And ponders their meaning,
Listens to the one hundred and eight guidebooks
And cultivates their meaning,
And confers their one hundred and eight empowerments,
As my own ordinary life manifestly passes away,
And the chariot of my mental faculty is driven
The Life-Sustaining
By the messenger of aging, the mighty lord of death,
While I can still write and see,
I have penned this as the legacy of my studies,
So that unfinished tasks may be swiftly carried out.
These purposeful life-sustaining verses that resemble a [rare] daytime star
Should be offered whenever they may possibly be of benefit,
But, in addition, they will exclusively sustain the propensities for study
In your own future lives.
I dedicate the stock of merit that originates from having composed this prayer,
That through its purity, resembling a conch or a snow mountain peak,
All obscurations of past actions might be renounced, dependent on the sacred doctrine,
And that omniscient buddhahood might be attained.
By the force of my faith of conviction in genuine buddha speech,
By the power of the truth of having accumulated virtue devoid of negativity,
By however many means and at all times,
May the good auspices of practicing in accord with the sacred doctrine be granted!

In this personal statement Kunga Drolchok describes how he was inspired by Sangyé Pel to seek out the respective lineage holders of the one hundred and eight guidebooks. Over thirty-one years, starting from the young age of seven through to his thirty-eighth year, he assiduously acquired these diverse teachings and here he presents his achievement in the well-established format of a “record of teachings received” (thob yig, bsan yig). The names of the teachers from whom he obtained each lineage are documented here, including his own root guru, Kunga Chogdrub, to whom he respectfully refers not by name, but by the epithet “venerable hidden buddha” (rje sbas pa’i sangs rgyas).
Kunga Drolchok also provides a wealth of information concerning the names of the Tibetan authors and redactors of these guidebooks, where they are known, and in cases where the authorship is unclear, he remarks that they derive from unspecified ancient writings. There is evidence of an incisive critical faculty in the way in which he occasionally differentiates between multiple strands of a given lineage, indicating which are to be included in the anthology and which are not. Further information on these primary sources, their antecedents, and so forth can be found in the bibliography and also in the initial note to each of the one hundred and eight actual guidebooks in chapter 9.
The chapter begins with a “signature” quatrain, in which the four syllables of Kunga Drolchok’s own name are embedded within the lines of verse, and it ends with a poetic dedication of merit and a colophon.

May “she who is endowed with all the finest aspects”[5] protect us
Without scrutiny, in the manner of the reflection on an oracular mirror,
Having abandoned analytical emptiness,
Our meditative experience devoid of the poisonous savor of emptiness.[6]
How wonderful! The rain of the sacred doctrine
Is not determined as singular,
But satisfies each according to need,
So that the aspirations of each bear fruit
In the fertile field of disciples to be trained.
May the unforgettable retention of this book within my own mind
Be verbally expressed by all sentient beings
And penned by scribes for one hundred aeons
On surfaces of dry land,
With ink of the four great lakes[7]
And pen lines of plants and forests! {49}
To that end I will proudly present in just a few words
That which is called “inexhaustible intelligence.”[8]

Remain individually and distinctly in my own mind,
I persevere to distinguish their exegetical sources,
Untainted and not conflated with one another.

Established as sources of their respective textual traditions.

Though learned and accomplished masters
May repeat insinuations regarding one another,[9]
We accept all traditions entirely on the basis of our faith,
Holding all of them to be interdependent, and without error,
Just as the eighteen schools [of monastic discipline][10]
Had points that were permissible and impermissible,
And yet we regard them all with devotion and confidence.
May any who have not savored
The conquerors’ authentic teachings and transmissions
And are themselves endowed with a share of merit {50}
Drink of this nectar elixir!
O heart sons, endowed with pristine cognition,
Holding me with faith in your minds,
If you wish to establish the real nature, just as it is,
You should secure the nail of speech inherent in my explanations.
And when the actual sources are revealed without fabrication,
Devoid of my own creations,
Such that this point does not transgress that one,
Low-level secrets will emerge through these written exegeses,
And then the real nature will become clear,
When my own unwritten explanations
And those that are most subtle—not low-level matters for discussion—
Flourish in beings whose minds have been refined.
In the face of those who nowadays do as they wish,
Who stammer with childish expression,
And with the negative perspective of fools and nursemaids,
The mighty lord of speech yet prevails on earth.
Avoiding fame, meager in wisdom but great in perseverance,
May I find an opportunity to protect the traditions of my predecessors
In the correct manner, unfabricated by my own mind!
Owing to manifold efforts in this life,
The doctrines that I have heard
From the words of my teachers
Resemble the honey on an anthill.
Such are the definitive essentials of the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks.

When I was young, according to the words of one of my disciples who journeyed from the land of Utsang, my mind was greatly moved upon hearing the introductory narrative of the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks given by the teacher named Sangyé Pel. He himself emphasized the approach that nurtures guidance rather than empowerments and transmissions. So as the first of the guidebooks on the transmitted teachings that I heard—that which first penetrated my ears, I received excellent instruction on the Oral Transmission of Venerable Mañjughoṣa: Parting from the Four Attachments. Thereby at the age of seven, my resolve with respect to the three kinds of faith[11] became much stronger, inspired by an intense disillusionment that was without attachment to the comforts of worldly existence, and that was not impoverished—owing to the nectar of meditative concentration. Starting from then, as I developed as a youth, I obtained other memorable and profound instructions, {51} but because I obtained so many, for the while it was simply that original guidance to which I adhered as the acceptable standard when enumerating the one hundred and eight guidebooks, up to and including the last of them, which is entitled The Nature of Mind: The Wish-Fulfilling Gem.
Thereafter, too, while my own mind was enriched by the responsibilities associated with the many acquisitions of the sacred doctrine that I had, there was no guidebook that I newly obtained through the acceptance or rejection of the earlier ones. Contrary to those who, having attended upon many unsuitable teachers, simply conduct funeral ceremonies in pursuit of fame, I do not reject those who arrive at true convictions by analyzing authentic words and meanings. But thinking that I should be of benefit to small-minded persons who have not acquired extensive experience and who lack understanding, I propagate writings that bring forth the essence of the words and meanings of the old texts that do not reiterate one another’s methods of guidance.

If, at the outset, I may briefly comment in general on these anthologized teachings, from our perspective as beings of lesser aspiration, these approaches are all indicative of the pure sacred doctrine, unadulterated and untainted by the absence of the doctrine, and extracted from the great pathway of the sutras, tantras, and treatises in accordance with the singular true utterance, devoid of falsehood, of all the saintly beings of India and Tibet who grasped the essential mind of the buddhas and bodhisattvas. Since each individual may attain perfection by means of each of these guidebooks, the essential points firmly conveying beings to the state of buddhahood are unmistaken.
On that basis, the anthology is exemplified by these guidebooks that summarize the extensive sutras and are derived from the Kadampa tradition of Jowo Atiśa, commencing from the acceptance and rejection of past actions and their fruits in the context of mind training that delineates persons of superior, middling, and inferior capacity, and continuing through to the perfection of loving-kindness, compassion, and the two precious aspects of enlightened mind.[12] But the anthology is also exemplified by the oral transmission of the great, supremely accomplished masters of the Sakya and Kagyu traditions, who have extracted the definitive secrets of the profound tantras.[13] {52} Entering through the supreme way of the two stages of the path,[14] these two modes of guidance [of the Sakya and Kagyu traditions] that reach the level of an adamantine holder[15] are the essence that is to be explained in this anthology. Derived from these traditions are quintessential instructions through which one correctly achieves supreme confidence based on the subtleties of the direct teachings of the conquerors and their heirs, and which are disclosed directly, indirectly, or covertly based on the testimony of the sutras and tantras in the joyous tradition of the buddhas. Through them, without straying from the acquisition of the conclusive four reliances,[16] the introduction to the nature of reality that secures the nail [of firm realization] then takes effect. This is because there are no valid expositors surpassing the conquerors in the ways of the sacred doctrine.

The definitive topics in all the profound guidebooks that I obtained in accordance with my good fortune are without even a single adulteration that would come about by juxtaposing with them biased writings indicative of mere discussions I had with teachers that are but the excellent imaginings, analyses, or inclinations of my own appraisal. Those who see with the eye of the sacred doctrine, by investigating exemplary topics, do not harbor doubt owing to their enlightened intention and their faculty of discriminative awareness. Therefore this preamble to the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks sets forth in writing the concise points that I have obtained through the kindness of my root teachers, and that have been embraced, as it were, by one who has the name of a writer.
You should know and understand that the gradual propagation of the names of all these lineages without exception will be contingent on the increase in the number of good auspices that flow from attending to the supplication prayers of their lineages and their presentation of the content of the [two] stages of the path.

The first of the eloquent instructions of profound guidance that I heard in my lifetime was the guidebook entitled Parting from the Four Attachments, which I received from my teacher, the venerable hidden buddha Kunga Chogdrub {53}, and which is itself the nectar elixir of Mañjughoṣa’s oral transmission. This includes the Root Verses of the Account of Sachen Kunga Nyingpo’s Encounter with Mañjughoṣa, the Versified Instruction on Parting from the Four Attachments by Jetsun Rinpoché Drakpa Gyeltsen, and the Songs of Meditative Experience by Jetsun Drakpa Gyeltsen, which were imparted in support of this doctrine. It further includes the List of Instructions in the Form of a Memorandum that Nubpa Rigdzin Drak composed on the teachings of Jetsun Rinpoché,[17] and then, based on the notes of the great teacher [Sakya Paṇḍita] and Chogyel Pakpa,[18] it includes the Essence of the Focus on Guidance that was composed by Zarjang Pukpa Kunga Lekpa Rinchen.[19]
You should keep this instruction in your heart as the strength of your conviction. Since the pure seed of virtuous action is found in this initial guidebook through devotion, including faith, I esteem it emphatically. If any faithful disciple of mine should appear, placing their hopes in me, I think I would instruct them through this, opening the portal of the first guidebook.
Furthermore, with regard to this guidebook, I later requested Ngorchen Lhachok Sengé for the instruction composed by the omniscient Gorampa Sonam Sengé,[20] and I also heard instruction from Changlung Rinpoché [Zhonu Chodrub] based on the guidance of [Kunga Tashi], doctrinal lord of the Great Vehicle.[21]
Since I myself have relied on the very first and earliest transmission that I excellently received, I have transcribed the lineage accordingly in the Supplication to the Lineage of the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks. Acting with faith and devotion, each of us should assiduously accept responsibility in this manner for the respective lineages to which we are devoted. This instruction was also the one that I had a need to request and receive repeatedly from different teachers. So, after initially receiving this guidance on virtuous action, it indeed became the foundation of my experiential cultivation of the Great Vehicle.

With regard to the second guidebook that I heard, entitled The Seven-Point Mind Training of the Great Vehicle,[22] there are approximately sixty texts of Indian and Tibetan origin. {54} As an exegetical transmission, I received their synopsis in the form of the Compendium of Eloquence, compiled by Gangtropa Gyelsé Konchok Bang of Bulé, who was also called Sempa Zhonu Gyelchok.[23] The quintessential points were composed by Drogon Pelden Yeshé according to the sayings of Gyelsé Sempa Chenpo Ngulchu Chodzongpa,[24] and the pith instructions derived from his teachings that emerged as an aural transmission were compiled as a supplement in five notebooks by Hor Kabzhipa Sengé Gyeltsen.[25] After completing the preliminary practice entitled the Supporting Doctrine, I directly obtained a text entitled Cycle That Adopts the Calmness of Visualization for the main practice, while setting my mind on altruistic engagement.[26]

Thereafter [the following were bestowed upon me]: the third guidebook, the pith instruction entitled The Heart of Dependent Origination, which was based on the extensive introductory narrative composed by Muchen Gyeltsen Pelzangpo;[27] the fourth guidebook, entitled The Carrying of Happiness and Suffering on the Path,[28] according to Remdawa Zhonu Lodro’s Memorandum on the Teaching of Gyelsépa;[29] and the fifth guidebook, entitled The Mind Training according to Sumpa Lotsāwa, according to the composition by Chojé Pelden Lama.[30]
I then received The Direct Guidance of Avalokiteśvara according to the tradition of Drubchen Tsembupa,[31] and in addition I searched in Utsang and definitively obtained the memorandum that Gyamawa Lodro Gyeltsen had written on the teachings of Gyelsépa entitled The Coemergent Union of the Great Seal.[32] These are both found below. My teacher, the venerable hidden buddha Kunga Chogdrub, said that these completed the six instructions of Gyelsé Tokmé Zangpo.[33]

These instructions on the three sorts of person and so forth were based exclusively on the adaptations of Chimchen Namka Drak.[38] My teacher, the venerable hidden buddha Kunga Chogdrub, joyfully conferred upon me the transmissions that Raton Yonten Pelzangpo had received in the presence of Drakpa Pelden Dondrub, the monastic preceptor of Nartang, in that very seminary where he had resided for three years.

In the presence of Changlungpa [Zhonu Chodrub] I also received the twenty-first guidebook, entitled The Five Paths of Pacification, according to the writings of Rongton. I have listed this only once, although I also obtained some sixteen methods of instruction that are preserved within the later lineages of the trio Ma [Chokyi Sherab], So [Chung Gedunbar], and Kam [Yeshé Gyeltsen], and so forth, but I did not list them.[40] This guidebook discloses the essentials of the Three Stages of Meditation by Kamalaśīla, who was identical in nature with Dampa Sangyé.
Then I excellently obtained the twenty-second guidebook, entitled The Three Stages of Meditation, which is established as an exemplar of the Svāntantrika Mādhyamika, in the presence of the masterly scholar [Lowo Khenchen Sonam Lhundrub], on the basis of the writings of Rongton.
I also received in ripening manner the twenty-third guidebook, entitled The Five Doctrines of Maitreya, from my teacher, the venerable hidden buddha Kunga Chogdrub—a transmission that Raton Yonten Pelzang had obtained from Kunkhyen Donyo Pelwa, through the lineage of Tsen Khawoché and based on the writings of Chomden Rikpei Reldri.

As for the twenty-eighth guidebook, the instruction on long life entitled The Guidance of White Tārā, I received in succession two traditions—the lineage derived from Jowo Atiśa and the lineage derived from Karmapa Rolpei Dorjé. But on this occasion I am counting the special tradition of Jowo Atiśa, perceiving that it is worthy of confidence.

The thirtieth guidebook, entitled The Direct Guidance of Avalokiteśvara according to the Lakṣmī Tradition,[41] is an ancient instruction documented by Yolgom Chowang, based on the teachings of Jowo Atiśa.
The thirty-first guidebook, concerning The Direct Guidance of Avalokiteśvara according to the Candradhvaja Tradition, is based on three works—the brief notes of Zhang [Ring] Kyitsa Ochen, the extensive analysis by Dzimchen Gyeltsen Pelzang, and the actual guidebook of Rongton.
As for the thirty-second guidebook, concerning The Direct Guidance of Avalokiteśvara according to the Tsembupa Tradition, I obtained higher maturation [of empowerment] through experiential guidance based on the instruction manual of Rinpoche Sherab Bumpa, and as the supporting transmission I received from my teacher, the venerable hidden buddha Kunga Chogdrub, the transmission of the Great Guidebook composed by Chojé Lama Dampa [Sonam Gyeltsen].[42] {58}
Jangchub Zangpo had also requested it from Avalokiteśvara in person, and he had transmitted it to the supreme incarnation Barawa Gyeltsen Pelzang; he [then transmitted it] to Namka Sengé, Maṇiwa Lekpei Gyeltsen, and Maṇiwa Drakpa Sonam; and from them it was maintained by the venerable hidden buddha Kunga Chogdrub. Though I indeed obtained that transmission, I have not counted it.[43]
Later on, from Changlungpa [Zhonu Chodrub] I further obtained the transmission of the instruction composed by the bodhisattva Gyelwa Yeshé, and from Trewo Chokyi Gyatso the transmission of the instruction composed by Tokden Khacho Wangpo, both of which pertain to the tradition of Tsembu.
The Direct Guidance of Avalokiteśvara according to the Kyergangpa Tradition is to be counted here as the thirty-third guidebook. I obtained from Gyagom the instruction manual on this composed by Choku Śākya Rinchen.

As for the forty-third guidebook, entitled The Path and Its Fruition,[48] this is based on the eighteen traditions of common descent[49] and comprises twenty-four extensive subdivisions, or twelve when these are condensed.[50] When further condensed, these may be subsumed in four primary divisions, or again in the two traditions of Drokmi and Gyijo.[51]
Among the twenty-five authentic transmissions, leaving aside the tradition of Zhama, there are twenty-four lineage traditions in the Sakya tradition alone. Their subdivisions include both the tradition of the Great Vehicle and the tradition of Ngor.[52] Changlungpa received the Path and Its Fruition according to the former lineage, descended from the tradition of the Great Vehicle, with all its components intact when he had reached the age of one hundred. As for the second lineage that descended from Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo, I received this three times, in turn, from my teacher, the venerable hidden buddha Kunga Chogdrub, {60} based exclusively on the Instruction Manual Elucidating the Concealed Meaning.[53] I also received it respectfully three times at the feet of Lowo Khenchen Rinpoché [Sonam Lhundrub], based on that same instruction manual.
In the presence of Ngorchen Lhachok Sengé, I then received the Religious History of the Path and Its Fruition, which had been composed by the omniscient [Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo], and The Treasure That Brings Forth Accomplishment—an extremely ripening exegetical method that resembled a baby placed in its mother’s lap[54]—which was the work of Venerable [Jamyang] Sangyé Rinchen. These are to be counted here.
Since in the two lineage prayers [of the traditions of the Great Vehicle and Ngor] Tsangpa Gyaré is missing, my teacher, the venerable hidden buddha Kunga Chogdrub, cited this as an example of the succession of Ling Repa being interrupted.

Although I many times obtained the tradition of The Six Doctrines of Nāropā, the instructions that are to be counted as the seventy-sixth guidebook comprise the Molten Gold of the Six Doctrines, composed by Lord Rangjung Dorjé, which I obtained from Trewo Chokyi Gyatso.
As for the cycle of The Six Doctrines of Nigumā, which is the seventy-seventh guidebook, in general there are twenty-five lineages, among which the long lineage that the accomplished master Tangtong Gyelpo had received from Jangsem Jinpa Zangpo, {63} otherwise known as the Chakzam tradition, exclusively refers to the tradition of Mu. This also separately evolved in an unwritten symbolic method that Nigumā imparted directly to the accomplished master Tangtong Gyelpo. The other twenty-four lineages were consolidated by Jakchen Jampa Pel and Samdingpa Zhonu Drub, so that they all came to be subsumed in these two transmissions. Subsequently, the lineages that derived respectively from each of these two also evolved distinctly and were no longer considered to be subbranches. I actually obtained from Gyagom [Lek Gyeltsen] the instruction that is to be counted, which derives from the lineages of Aseng of Nenying and Rechen Peljor Zangpo.

May those who strive to study and receive such instructions
Consume this supreme drink, quenching the thirst of the rebirth process,
Its pure streams forming the syllables of sutra and tantra
Emerging from snow mountain ridges, bastions of the lineage!
As the taste and potency of rivers that freely flow
From this land become diluted,
The nectar of these instructions may seem to lack potency,
According to the analysis of unrefined and foolish persons;
But their respective modes of experiential cultivation,
Like medications that remedy diseases,
Serve as an antidote to eliminate corresponding afflictions,
In accord with our share of good fortune.
The approaches of the sacred doctrine are such
That they accord with the constitutions of infinite disciples.
Like serving clothes to those who are hungry,
How could mere beneficial thoughts offer this protection! {66}
Like the diverse and distinct colors of fine brocade,
Like the clouds of the heavens that diverge from one another,
Like rainbows in the sky, ever insatiably beheld,
The vitality of the sacred doctrine that appears to be one
Has manifold attributes that are all of a single savor.
We should indeed realize that,
Like rivers flowing into a great ocean,
These are not different!
And yet whatever words of fools out for reputation and praise
May, in the perception of the unrealized,
Roar like noisy tributaries,
Or slowly flow like wide rivers,
These are absent in the Buddhist teachings.
When pure vision is total and impartial,
Where could you find anything impure!
Wonderful is this simultaneous blessing
Of the all-pervasive
objects of refuge, none excepted!
When the anthologies that collect these deep profundities
Are examined again and again, their reiteration
Is a treasure store of distinct teachings.
If we inspect them thoroughly, they cannot be exhausted!
Likened to rice paddies arduously cultivated,
With their excellent ripening harvest forming awns of grain,
They have the character of a contented, peaceful friend.
Although their felicity extends outwardly to all,
May the clear crystal of my own rejoicing mind,
Aspiring to and practicing the sacred doctrine over successive lives,
Confer liberation through the merit of this dedication
Upon virtuous minds, excellently free from negativity![62]

The transcription was undertaken by one Kunga Lekgyel, who excellently emerged from the ocean of the mind of Kunga Drolchok.

Chapters 5 and 6 contain diverse anecdotal accounts of the transmission of the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks by earlier generations of lineage holders. Many peripheral texts associated with these cycles are also incidentally mentioned. References are generally found in the bibliography and in the notes to chapter 9.
Chapter 5, written by Kunga Drolchok, covers the anecdotal accounts of the first seventy-four guidebooks, commencing with Parting from the Four Attachments and concluding with The Kharamukha Cakrasaṃvara. The supplement by Tāranātha, which is contained in chapter 6, completes the remainder, from the seventy-fifth to the one hundred and eighth.
The introductory verses of chapter 5 are not balanced by any corresponding concluding verses, which may perhaps suggest that it was originally Kunga Drolchok’s intention to complete these anecdotes himself. Tāranātha, the acknowledged reincarnation, may have considered this task as a personal responsibility.

Respectful homage to the teachers and to the lord-protector Mañjughoṣa!
May the three precious jewels who have become a refuge
For living beings including the gods,
Along with Yongdzin Lama[2] and his teachers
Endowed with the great compassion of the perfect conquerors, unsurpassed by others,
Grant protection to the beings of this world including myself!
Now I will briefly introduce the lineage holders who initiated the tradition—
The tradition concerning all essentials of instruction, most secret—
The secret disclosed in one hundred and eight modes of guidance—
The guidance profound that is embraced by numerous good auspices.[3]
Inspired by faithful, devout, and respectful requests,
Here I will write a partial historical account
Of the most saintly individuals of the past,
Who maintained the ways of learning and accomplishment
In order to benefit others of equal fortune.

With regard to the historical account of the guidebook entitled Parting from the Four Attachments: At the time when the teacher Sakyapa the Great, Kunga Nyingpo, was in his twelfth year, estimated from the death of his father [Khon Konchok Gyelpo],[4] {69} the offerings presented on behalf of his deceased father were laid out near the main temple [of Zimkhang].[5] Those entering the monastic seat in a single day were such that the things they left behind were said to be meritorious and bountiful, whereupon his mother said, “Since your father indeed had conviction in the teachings associated with the teacher Bari Lotsāwa that are not counterfeit, you should invite Bariwa!”
After he did so, Bari said, “You, the son of that venerable father, should study! For that you need discriminative awareness. This is why you should propitiate Mañjughoṣa!” Bari then bestowed upon him the doctrinal cycle of Mañjuśrī in the form Arapacana, and he engaged in that practice. When slight indications of an obstacle arose, Bari conferred the initiation of blue Acala, along with the water protection rite, so that Sachen was set free from these obstacles. When six months had passed, he had a vision of sublime Mañjuśrī, seated in an elegant posture upon the precious teaching throne—the central figure along with a retinue of two bodhisattvas. Mañjuśrī intoned the root verses [of Parting from the Four Attachments], and Sachen acquired the meditative stability of continuous flow and unforgettable retention. In consideration of that, {70} the Eulogy [to Sachen] speaks of him in the following words:[6]

Jetsun Rinpoché [Drakpa Gyeltsen] also said, “Speech that is favored by Mañjughoṣa is renowned among all living creatures” and “You should know that all convincing rational axioms and all doctrines without exception are said to be within the buddha mind.”[7]
All the lineage holders [in the familial descent from Sachen Kunga Nyingpo]—including Lopon Rinpoché [Sonam Tsemo], Jetsun Rinpoché [Drakpa Gyeltsen], Chojé Sakya Paṇḍita, Drogon Pakpa, and Chojé Lama Dampa [Sonam Gyeltsen]—were emanations and embodiments of Mañjughoṣa, as if the two retainers of Mañjughoṣa—Akṣayamati and Pratibhākuṭa—had emerged from an ancient painted scroll, and they were absolutely favored by him.
Arising from the basis of that conviction, this original instruction constituted the first guidebook to the sacred doctrine that I acquired in this lifetime.

Immediately after that, with regard to the guidebook entitled The Seven-Point Mind Training of the Great Vehicle: Over the period of one year and in the context of sessions of practice that were not interrupted for a single day during that twelve-month period, my elder brother Drungtsun Zangpo Tenpa pointed out its interconnections based on the memorandum of Drogon Pelden Yeshé, the senior disciple of Gyalse Chodzongpa [Tokmé Zangpo], and the five notebooks composed as a memorandum by Hor Kabzhipa [Sengé Gyeltsen] on this very teaching.[8] He began by citing the following verses:[9]

When sixty aeons have passed after the conqueror Maitreya
Has set his mind on enlightenment,
The Sugata himself, setting his mind on enlightenment,
Will cherish others above self
And attain buddhahood in the age of degeneration.
Emphasizing the teaching of loving-kindness, {71}
His former lives as the daughter of a friend and so forth
Set the framing narrative for this pith instruction.

Jowojé Atiśa called out the names of his teacher Dharmarakṣita, who was actually capable of granting his own flesh to others, and in addition of [Mitrayogin], the yogin of loving-kindness. Consequently, he had two actual visions of Ajita Maitreya, the heir of the conquerors. In the first of these he received The Wheel of Sharp Weapons and The Peacock’s Neutralizing of Poison;[10] and in the second he received The Adamantine Song of Chanting Meditation.[11] Then crossing the Andaman Sea, he voyaged to the supreme sacred land of Sumatra, where he bowed at the lotus feet of a teacher known by the name of that very land[—that is, Serlingpa Dharmakīrti].[12] Atiśa excellently requested the essence of the teaching of enlightened mind, exchanging self with others in the context of the preliminary practice of setting the mind on enlightenment, and his mind was perfectly satisfied.

There are eighteen factors that are to be carried on the path, in association with [Serlingpa’s] Stages of the Heroic Mind.[13] In that regard, the most secret counsel is contained in the following verses:[14]
Adverse conditions are your spiritual mentor,
Spirits and demons are emanations of the conquerors,
Sickness is a broom for negative obscuration,
And suffering is the display of reality.

Having realized the essential instructions concerning the tarnish of the mind according to the Lesser Vehicle, it is said that whenever Atiśa recalled leaving the silver reliquary of his peerless teacher [Serlingpa Dharmakīrti], he would burst into tears; and whenever he said or heard that name, he would place the palms of his hands together on the crown of his head.
Without interrupting the power of his resolve and the continuity of his fervent devotion, Atiśa transmitted this instruction [in Tibet], commencing from Dromton, the three dharma siblings [Putowa, Chen Ngawa, and Puchungwa], as well as Sharawa and Chekhawa; and it was finally epitomized by the practical application and pointing-out instructions in accord with reality that Gyelsé Rinpoché [Tokmé Zangpo] received from Jangsem Sonam Drakpa.
Nowadays in the heartlands of Utsang, not even a trace of the conferral of this experiential guidance is extant; {72} and in the northern direction the major, mediocre, and minor teachers feign contentment simply when the transmission of the Compendium of Eloquence on Mind Training of the great bodhisattva Venerable Zhonu Gyelchok is conferred.[15] But this may be refuted on the basis of the following words of Gyelsépa [Tokmé Zangpo], which are found in the latter work:
The fundamental nature of nonarising awareness is examined in the memorandum of Drogon Pelden Yeshé.[16]
There were also points that reflected my own ideas and accorded with Guidance on the View [of the Middle Way] by Tsongkhapa the Great that were not within the perceptual range of any proud scholars, or points in which I had conviction but did not understand, wondering whether they were false examples or not. By rectifying these, I brought this train of thought to its conclusion. I saw and heard my monastic preceptor, the [veritable emanation of] the transcendent Lord Mañjughoṣa, confer praises extensively and continuously on this guidebook that is the quintessence of Hor Kabzhipa; and it is certain that Khen Rinpoché himself was indeed distraught because he had not received it. It was in these circumstances that I acquired conviction from the depths of my heart that there is no means higher than this guidance on the path for attaining buddhahood.

Distinct from that, the guidebook entitled The Heart of Dependent Origination derives from that same lineage. The transmission of this teaching, through which Bodong Rinchen Tsemo averted leprosy, descended from the yogin Chokyi Yungdrung and Nyemo Gyagom [also known as Nyipuwa Gyergom Zhikpo] to Nyenchen Sonam Tenpa. Immediately after receiving this instruction, Sonam Tenpa planted the victory banner of attainment, abandoning the concerns of this life, and after he passed away, the anthology of his teachings that contained the following root verses of pith instruction resounded:[17]
First you should cultivate loving-kindness,
And inquire whether it has arisen or not.
If it has arisen, you should cultivate compassion,
Avert [the distinction between] self and others,
And generate the mind of enlightenment.
Then from within this mountainous disposition of wisdom {73}
You should calm the diffusion and absorption of these cultivations!

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Carrying of Happiness and Suffering on the Path: Paṇchen Śākyaśrī of Kashmir imparted this many times to the official attendants of his nine lesser paṇḍitas,[18] as well as to Indian nuns, invalids, and so forth. But, at the time when he was invited from Baiḍūr Tsongdu to Nezin in Pari, traveling uphill in a palanquin for almost half a month, Tropu Lotsāwa [Jampa Pel] and his disciples carried him with utmost care and responsibility, so that they were worn out. On that occasion, the following words of Paṇḍita Śākyaśrī imparted the guidance that introduces happiness and suffering as the three buddha bodies:[19]

This sacred doctrine was held, maintained, and mastered by the learned and accomplished masters of the Land of Snows in general and in particular by all those who became preceptors at the four monastic communities [of Śākyaśrī].[20] It gained importance, was formulated as a guidebook, and was then conferred upon these communities as a group teaching, as a public teaching, and so forth. The transmission of this discursive discourse is undiminished at the present time.

With regard to the guidebook [entitled The Mind Training according to Sumpa Lotsāwa], which is established in the distinctive teachings of Sumpa Lotsāwa Dharma Yonten: When Sumpa Lotsāwa was traveling back from India to Tibet, he refined the state of mind in which the physical elements are absorbed. He passed days and nights in a state of exhaustion, wondering if this were some premonition of impending death, or what he should do. Although the blessings of empowerment that he had received from his own teacher Paṇḍita Sergyi Bumpa and others were useful for focusing on the alleviation of disease, there was no benefit. At that time, he had a small amount of residual gold [for his travels], with which he sought out offering sacraments, including flowers, and then he went to make offerings to the Mahābodhi at Vajrāsana. In the sky above the inner sanctum {74} there were two women—one blue and one red. The blue one prostrated three times before the red one, saying, “Last night my mind was unhappy. It did not rest in the place where the mind should abide. I hope this is not some premonition about my death, for I am afraid of dying.” She asked this question four times, and then the red woman, looking directly toward Sumpa Lotsāwa, replied, “Madam! If you are content with whatever thoughts arise, whatever you do will bring happiness. Your mind suffers because you are not content with whatever arises. Madam! If your mind rests where it is placed, it will be content even though you travel. Your mind suffers because it does not rest where it is placed. Madam! If your mind turns toward the sacred doctrine, it will be easy even when you die. Your mind suffers because it is not turned toward the sacred doctrine. Madam! If you realize that your own mind is immortal, there will be no death. Your mind suffers because you have not realized that your mind is immortal.” As soon as Sumpa Lotsāwa heard these four replies, an extraordinary realization arose in his mind, and he said that these two women, blue and red, were none other than Vajravārāhī and Venerable Tārā.

All later spiritual mentors have esteemed this mode of guidance. Chojé Pelden Lama Dampa [Sonam Gyeltsen] is known to have conferred it when Gyelsé Chodzongpa [Tokmé Zangpo] requested of him an instruction that had been the quintessence of his contemplation and that would benefit his mind. The actual guidebook is also said to have been composed at that time. Then, during the time when Lachen Lodro Gyeltsen became the familial lineage holder of the Sakyapa, Gyelsé Rinpoché went to escort him as far as Lhasa, and there, while acting as chant master, he also imparted this instruction as a public teaching in the courtyard [of the Great Temple] of Lhasa. This incident is illustrative, since it is mentioned in the biography of Gyelsépa.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Severance of Machik Labdron: There is a memorandum originating from India, composed by Āryadeva the Brahmin, of which greater and lesser verses are extant, {75} but it is not contained within the Tengyur [manuscripts] of Utsang.[21] In Tibet this system was propagated extensively by the mother, Jomo [Machik Labkyi Dronma] herself.[22]
When a geshé went to meet Rinchen Gangpa Śākya Shenyen, the latter was staying in a room with four pillars. All around them it was filled to the brim with labeled books. When the gesheé asked what these books were, he replied, “They are exclusively Machik’s cycle on Severance.” The gesheé was astonished and asked whether all these books naturally belonged to [the cycle on] Severance, to which he replied, “If the books of Severance were gathered together, they would not fit within a single valley!” So that is illustrative.
Among the manifold recensions of such [teachings on Severance], I had supreme confidence in the new pronouncement composed by Lama Gyeltangpa Samten Ozer, which is a commentary on The Eight Appendices.[23] From start to finish this work is excellently adorned with new revelations that were actually given to him by the mother Labdron, the secret ḍākinī of pristine cognition, and that are unknown in the earlier recensions on Severance. In addition, there is no higher teaching among those that sever the expanse of the four demonic forces than [the third of these appendices], the aptly titled Wish-Fulfilling Gem: An Instruction on the Inner Meaning. Manifestly disclosing the key points that directly reveal the nature of reality, this is indeed an expression of my inherited ancestral teachings.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Three Essential Points: Once upon a time there was a devout person in Tropu who heard someone say in a dream, “You should sweep your house clean each day! On this very day next year, Avalokiteśvara will come to rent a room.” {76} He swept and cleaned it each day, and others would ask him, “Why are you doing this?” to which he replied, “I am doing this in accordance with a prophecy I received in a dream.” And they would laugh because they did not believe this to be true. Then, when the great accomplished master Mitrayogin was invited by Tropu Lotsāwa, he arrived in Tropu and there was a commotion due to his fame. Thousands of gesheés with parasols gathered there from all directions of upper and lower [Tibet], and they were so many that they could not be accommodated. Some were properly housed, but some had to stay in the open plain. Seeing this, the great accomplished master Mitrayogin offered the lodgings where he was staying to them. Then he directly knocked on the door of that devout householder and said, “Do lend a room to this Indian!” Since this accorded with the circumstances of his earlier dream, the certainty arose within the devotee that this Mitrayogin was actually Avalokiteśvara. He at once offered the fields, house, and all possessions that he owned, and requested an essential instruction, saying, “Because I am old, I do not understand the extensive and manifold nuances of the sacred doctrine.” Thinking him to be worthy, with Tropu Lotsāwa translating, the great master taught him the root verses of the pith instructions, entitled The Fourteen Quatrains on Resting in the Nature of Mind,[24] which are carried through this life, at the time of death, and in the intermediate state, which he had himself received from Jowo Khasarpaṇi [Avalokiteśvara]. It includes the following verse:[25]
Placing great compassion in front,
Always looking at it, without distraction,
Through the union of male and female deities,
The practitioner should come to rest.

With regard to the guidebook entitled Resting in the Nature of Mind: Immediately after explaining [The Three Essential Points], the great accomplished master Mitrayogin actually displayed a cubit-sized image of Jowo Khasarpaṇi upon the maṇḍala in front, and he then taught the twenty-five verses of Resting in the Nature of Mind in tandem with twenty-five meditative stabilities that are mentioned in the sublime Sutra of the Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines. He established three metaphors indicative of nondistraction from the essential points of experiential cultivation—namely, an expert swordsman in battle, a wise person finding a bull without looking for it, and a bird flying aimlessly over a boat. The omniscient Buton Rinchen Drub, a percipient lineage holder who experientially applied these metaphors, also esteemed this guidebook, and it is said that he imparted his innermost thoughts on it to all his senior disciples.

With regard to the profound teachings of Kadam, Ra Yonten Pelzangpo (fl. fifteenth century) stayed for three years at the great seminary of Nartang where these were all conferred upon him in the presence of Pelden Dondrub, who was renowned as an emperor among the accomplished monastic preceptors of Nartang. In this regard, he firstly received the guidebook entitled The Three Sorts of Person. Jowo Atiśa had transmitted this to Ngok Lekpei Sherab, he to Drolungpa Lodro Jungné, and the spiritual mentor Tsangnak Tsondru Sengé received it, in turn, from him. In his presence, Tumton Lodro Drakpa, the founder of the seminary of Nartang, received it.
Geshé Sharawa had offered alms three times to Tumton’s community, and on the last of these occasions he said to Tumton, “You should acquire a monastery in the direction of Tsang. It will bring great benefit to living beings. These donations offered by my patron, the nāga king who provides all my necessities, will be dispatched henceforth to you.” On the way up [to Nartang], directly above the road on which Tumton was traveling, there appeared a bee with tiger stripes and a large, coarse body, {78} making a loud buzzing sound. During the night it circled within his alms bowl. Then on reaching exactly the place where the courtyard of Nartang is now located, the bee vanished into a tree that still stands there today. Thinking this to be the place prophesied by the lama Sharawa, he founded a monastery there.
There are six renowned texts of the Kadam tradition—namely, Garland of Birth Stories and Collection of Aphorisms, which are texts concerning faith; Level of the Bodhisattvas and Ornament of the Sutras of the Great Vehicle, which are texts concerning conduct; and Compendium of Lessons and Introduction to the Conduct of a Bodhisattva, which are texts concerning the view. Later, Chimchen Namka Drakpa composed his annotations and tables of contents to these texts, so that the ancient oral transmissions might not degenerate. Chomden Rikpei Reldri composed a supplement to the Tales of Past Lives, entitled Flower Ornament of the Tales of Past Lives. In this way the transmission was definitively conferred from the mouths [of the masters] upon the ears of the disciples.

In addition, the guidebook entitled The Sequence of the Buddhist Teaching, which Tumton received from his spiritual mentor Sharawa in person, was also extensively propagated. Its oral transmission, later established by Chimton Lobzang Drak, is itself maintained by all those endowed with the clear eye of the sacred doctrine. Hor Kabzhipa said that the basis of the composition of his two doctrinal collections, large and small, was modeled on this alone.[26] It is said that at the end of his life, Tumtonpa returned to his native place in the northern direction, where he nurtured enlightened activity at the place known as Cholung Kunra, and then passed away.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Great Middle Way: Jangsem Dawa Gyeltsen received this from the Newar Penyawa [Ratnabhadra], a lineage holder of the teachings that had descended from Nāgārjuna the father and Ᾱryadeva the son. He transmitted the instruction to Dzilungpa Ozer Drakpa, and Droton Dutsi Drak (1153–1232) requested it from him and then propagated it.
Though there are some who hold that this guidebook also accords with the lineage of the Guidance on the View of the Middle Way, which Venerable Remdawa [Zhonu Lodro] propagated from the highland region of Ngari, that is not certain, because it represents the original Mādhyamika texts—the old tradition where Prāsaṅgika and Svātantrika are not differentiated. {79} It is simply the case that the distinctions introduced by Remdawa accord with the adherents of the texts of Candrakīrti that uphold consequential reasoning.

With regard to the guidebooks concerning the four deities of Kadam: At the time when Sangyé Gompa Chenpo [Sengé Kyab] came to Utsang in the entourage of Jowo Atiśa, he went directly to Langtang and received these teachings from Geshé Zhangpa [Chokyi Lama] at the monastic seat of Geshé Langri Tangpa.
As far as these guidebooks concerning the four deities [of Kadam] are concerned, there have been some later individuals with the title “master of the Kadampa teaching” who failed to understand that the Cornucopia of Avalokiteśvara’s Attributes is associated [not with this guidebook on Avalokiteśvara but] with The Direct Guidance of Avalokiteśvara according to the Tradition of Candradvaja. They also seem to have juxtaposed and conflated the guidebook on Acala with the higher tantras that concern fierce inner heat, illusory body, dream yoga, luminosity, and so forth. In this context, however, the guidebook on Acala is the foremost instruction on the attainment of the yogic gaze of Acala, whose right and left eyes exclusively focus upward and downward. It is known as such because it originated from the ancient account of Geshé Neuzurpa Yeshé Bar who, after meditating in that manner, by gazing upward is said to have seen what a shepherd was doing on the cliff above, and by gazing downward saw a buddha field below. Similarly, with regard to the guidebooks on Munīndra and Tārā, the method of cultivating calm abiding and the establishment of protection from the eight fears are never secured apart from these instructions concerning the corresponding deities.

Yet there are proud gesheés, responsible for abandoning the sacred doctrine, who insistently exclude this from the perspective of the Riwo Geden tradition, [saying] that there is no such lineage of this doctrine that derives from Venerable Tsongkhapa and his heirs. Indeed, they seek to make revisions, saying that it contains terms that are outside their view, such as pure in the expanse (dbyings su dag pa) and absence of pointed focus (’dzug gu gtad sa mi gda’ ba).

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Six Descents of the Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom: As mentioned in the guidance on the transcendent perfection of wisdom by Venerable Rongton Sheja Kunrik, the transcendent lord Buddha appointed the noble Kāśyapa to preside over his actual monastic succession, and he was followed, in turn, by Ānanda, Śāṇavāsika, Upagupta, Dhītika, and so on, up to and including the arhat Siṃha[bodhi]. In this way the transmission was successively maintained at Vajrāsana through twenty-four successive hierarchs of the teaching.[27] Afterward, following subjugation by the Turuṣka army, the transmission of study and exegesis was interrupted. A heretical beggar propitiated the sun god utilizing the means for attainment of Sūrya, and consequently the great Buddhist temples were mostly incinerated.[28] Collections of scriptures comprising words, phrases, and letters were even turned into heaps of ashes.
At that time, for the sake of the Buddhist teaching, there was a brahmin nun named Prakāśaśīlā who, through union with a kṣatriya, gave birth to the sublime Asaṅga, and on consorting with a brahmin youth, gave birth to the master Vasubandhu. Asaṅga instantaneously arrived in Tuṣita, where he sojourned for fifty human years and received twenty doctrinal collections as a follower of Maitreya. {81} Thereafter he propagated those teachings extensively. The younger brother Vasubandhu committed to memory the entire meaning of the Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines, and he would recite it aloud while submerged in a pool of sesame oil from the neck downward. Throughout the early and later parts of his life, he extensively propagated the approaches of the sacred doctrine, according to both the Great and Lesser Vehicles.[29]

[In Tibet,] it was Rongton the Great (1367–1449) who synthesized the essentials of experiential cultivation on these teachings concerning the Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom.
In earlier times, at a place known as Yumta Yulma in the uplands of Gyel in Penyul, someone requested Dampa Sangyé to consecrate a manuscript of Extensive Mother [which is the Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines]. Dampa then sat upon the pile of books, and the supplicant took a negative view of that. Immediately the pages were all carried away into the sky by a strong wind that naturally arose, and they surged high into space. Dampa scattered consecrated barley upon them and recited the following offering verse from Refutation of Disputed Topics:[30]

Thereupon, the pages descended onto their books in the correct order. Later, when Rongton saw that manuscript of Extensive Mother, the following words resounded from the formless dawn sky:[31]

In accordance with this prophetic declaration, the master [Rongton] and his disciples set out for the sake of the doctrine and arrived without impediment at Dingri Langkor in Lato. There Rongton received the cycle of the Six Descents from Venerable Lodro Gyatso and wrote down a memorandum, which is this guidebook, extant at the present day.

With regard to the guidebook concerning the direct guidance on The Five Paths of Pacification: {82} it is said that Dramen Chikpa[32] Sherab Zangpo (1411–1475) received this instruction [from Pelchen Kunlhunpa] and experientially cultivated it.
With regard to the guidebook entitled The Three Stages of Meditation—Beginning, Middle, and Conclusive, which is the work of Kamalaśīla: this is the essence of the teachings of Rongton, the marvelous tradition of the path that is the illustrative basis of the Svātantrika Mādhyamika.

[With regard to this guidebook:] Among The Five Doctrines of Maitreya, it is clear that the Distinction between Phenomena and Actual Reality and the Supreme Continuum of the Great Vehicle were not extant at the time when the master Haribhadra (late eighth century) was alive. This is understood because in his Great Commentary on the Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines, he repeatedly cites Ornament of Clear Realization, Ornament of the Sutras of the Great Vehicle, and the Distinction between the Middle and Extremes, but he does not even mention the titles of the Distinction between Phenomena and Actual Reality and the Supreme Continuum of the Great Vehicle.
On an auspicious occasion, Lord Maitrīpā the Great restored a dilapidated stupa on which a ray of light shone. He saw a rainbow emerge from the gap formed by a crack, and inside found an old manuscript inscribed on bark. He then prayed one-pointedly to Maitreya to request its transmission, without focusing on any other object. Consequently, Maitreya revealed his visage from within the clouds of the sky and bestowed upon him its transmission, instruction, and further instruction. These texts became well known to all the paṇḍitas of India, and among them there is an unbroken lineage that was propagated in Tibet by Tsen Khawoché.[33]

[With regard to the guidebook entitled The View of Intrinsic Emptiness:] At the time when Patsab (b. 1055) roared the lion’s roar that was the enlightened intention of glorious Candrakīrti, this was comprehended by all his contemporary scholars [in Tibet]. Above all, gesheé Sharawa sent a letter to Patsab Lotsāwa, asking certain questions. Patsab offered in reply his own explanation—Abridgement of the Essentials of the Root and Commentary of the Introduction to the Middle Way—under the headings view, meditation, and conduct. When it reached Sharawa, who was presiding over a molasses feast, {83} as soon as he saw Patsab’s writings, tears flowed uncontrollably, and with his hand he scattered the molasses in front of him into the ten directions, saying, “This is an offering to Nāgārjuna, father and son! This is an offering to Candrakīrti! This is an offering to Patsab Nyima Drakpa! He understands the enlightened intention of Lord Nāgārjuna.” In that very row of monks he proclaimed, “I will send a hundred young intelligent monks to study under Patsab.” Patsab had studied in India under the paṇḍita Tīlakakalāśa and others.
Afterward, when Patsab went out one day for recreation in the midst of a forest, he met a paṇḍita wearing a black robe, with a light-bluish complexion, exuding the fragrance of supreme sandalwood, and walking with two monastic boots on his hands.[34] He paid homage and requested a blessing, whereupon the paṇḍita placed his two hands on his head and said, “You need not stay long in cyclic existence.” When Patsab related this incident to other scholars, they encouraged him in one voice, saying, “You have great fortune. That paṇḍita is Candrakīrti. You met him while he was engaged in the conduct of the ascetic discipline of awareness.” Henceforth it is said that Patsab could convey an extraordinary certainty concerning the essential points of the view.
Jowojé Atiśa also remarked that their views were identical, and indeed on that account praised Patsab greatly, saying, “For every hundred persons who have not set out on the path, there is one who has set out on the path…. For every hundred who propound the middle way between extremes, there is only one who propounds consequential reasoning.” [Elsewhere] it is said in his biography that Patsab himself was also the reincarnation of Jowo Atiśa.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The View of Extraneous Emptiness: It says in the words of Tsen Khawoché, “The paṇḍita Sajjana of Kashmir has made the following most significant remark, ‘The Conqueror turned the wheel of the sacred doctrine three times—teaching the four noble truths in the first turning, the absence of defining characteristics in the second, and the excellent analysis [of all buddha attributes] in the final promulgation. Among these, the first two did not differentiate between the real and the imputed, whereas the final turning did determine the ultimate truth. On that occasion, therefore, the Buddha taught the distinction between the middle way and extremes, and between phenomena and reality. {84} The original manuscripts of the Distinction between Phenomena and Actual Reality and the Supreme Continuum of the Great Vehicle were simply lent out [to Maitreya].[35] Indeed, if these two texts had vanished, it would have denoted Maitreya’s passing away into bliss.’ ”
In this regard, there is an ancient memorandum entitled Hook of the Lotus, composed by Tsen Khawoché, forewarning against the later allegation that the term extraneous emptiness was unknown in India but appeared in Tibet through the omniscient Dolpopa. You may also investigate that in a response to questions composed by the all-knowing Buton Rinchen Drub, it says that there was an earlier philosophical tenet of Tanakpa Rinchen Yeshépa that was later enhanced and maintained by Dolpopa.[36]

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Guidance of Amitāyus, which was imparted to Siddhirājñi: It is certain that, starting from Rechungpa Dorjé Drak (1085–1161), who offered this to Milarepa, and continuing down to the supreme emanation Barawa Gyeltsen Pelzang (1310–1391), the line of transmission was from mouth to ear, maintained in a single succession as a sealed precept. Although there were also different teachers who extensively propagated the discourses of Siddhirājñi, even the names of their “single-deity single-vase” transmissions are unknown.[37]
The original source of the guidebook of Barawa Gyeltsen Pelzang, this supreme incarnation, was also previously unknown in the Land of Snows. In the latter’s secret biography, it mentions that while he was focusing on this very practice at a hermitage in Paro Drang-gyé, he wrote down the instruction of the aural lineage, based on a prophecy he received from the glorious ḍākinī Guhyajñānā, and afterward he conferred the empowerment in a large public gathering.
Nowadays, whatever philosophical systems of the Sakya, Kagyu, and Geluk {85} are espoused, there is no one at all who performs this ritual that is beneficial to others. The long-life empowerment that is the foundation of this guidebook is, however, still conferred in the context of an empowerment rite. I have recited with my tongue many tens of thousands of times the liturgy of this empowerment rite, so I am convinced that if any empowerment is to be conferred, there will be no greater blessing that there is in this.

Later, when Gyelsé Chodzongpa [Tokmé Zangpo] stayed for some three years in central Tibet, he guided his disciples at Jang Radeng and so forth through his definitive work, Direct Guidance on All the Meditational Deities in General. Then he gave teaching, commenting separately on each of the following methods of direct guidance: [The thirty-fourth guidebook, entitled The Direct Guidance of Cakrasaṃvara,] which is based on the master Ghaṇṭāpāda’s short treatise entitled Innate Cakrasaṃvara; and [the thirty-fifth guidebook, entitled The Direct Guidance of Hevajra,] which is based on Ānandavajra’s Sanskrit text concerning Innate Cakrasaṃvara and Hevajra. On that occasion, all the meditational deities were transformed into their unsurpassed forms. The glorious Lama Dampa [Sonam Gyeltsen] is also said to have approved of this, and actually it puts to rest the notion that Gyelsépa [Tokmé Zangpo] never taught the way of Secret Mantra. {86}

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Six-Branch Yoga of Kālacakra: Although there are many independently written commentaries extant throughout India and Tibet, here I have counted the Commentary [Entitled Taintless Light], which accords with Somanātha and the questions addressed to Somanātha, and in which word and meaning are indivisible. Having investigated the commentary on the tantra itself, I acquired conviction in it.
With regard to the guidebook entitled The Aural Lineage of Kālacakra according to Menlung Guru [Sonam Pel]: This later merged with the Great Perfection, so that it is hard to differentiate them. This method is incomplete when one is engaging in the path that explores the structure of the subtle body, and it employs the terms disposition (ngang) and self (rang) instead of the term this (’di). For these reasons it resembles the threshing stick of a blind man.
For a long time I was left without finding any method based on the practice of its ritual service and attainment or its guidance. Later on, however, my paternal uncle, who had previously received this along with my father, the great translator,[38] from Chojé Khewang Rinchen Chowang at Tsetang and had become a great master of this doctrine, came to Drakhar in U to confer a connection with this teaching on me. When I questioned him about it, he said Hūṃchen Namka Neljor and Hūṃchen Lhundrub Rinchen had modified [the terminology] because they had formerly doubted the additions and deletions made by Menlungpa himself, who distinctively added certain unrelated terms from Tantra of Heruka Galpo here.[39] He, however, was satisfied [with the original] because he had acquired certainty in the term disposition (ngang) and also in the term mine (nga’i nga), {87} understanding these to denote the purification of the seven aspects of consciousness, including the afflicted mental consciousness.[40] He also said that his name had originally been Rinchen Zangpo. Since he and my father had the same name, I was contented, thinking of him with gratitude. This illustrates that when one has never tested a guidebook at all, one should persist in examining precisely the actual source of the lineage from which it originated.
[With regard to the forty-second guidebook, entitled Ritual Service and Attainment of the Three Adamantine Realities according to Orgyanpa: there is no mention of this here in these historical anecdotes].

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Path and Its Fruition: Firstly, Drokmi [Lotsāwa] and later Gyijo Dawa Ozer received this from the paṇḍita Gayādhara.[41] Fifteen major traditions evolved from Drokmi, along with their twenty-three offshoots, but they number only twelve when arranged according to those that are still extant.[42] Sachen Kunga Nyingpo received the long lineage from Seton Kunrik and Zhangton Chobar; and, in addition to the lineage of Drokmi, he also received it from Virūpa in person, forming a close lineage that is virtually unbroken at the present time.[43]
As far as the [distinct] tradition of Zhama is concerned, only the transmissions of the Instruction Manual and Dispelling of Obstacles Entitled Ocean-Like Visualizations of Ha, which were composed by Kodrakpa, are extant. I understand that Mar[ton] made an accurate investigation [of this transmission], although Gyijo had told him not to propagate it. But Gyijo did teach it to Khorewa Okyi Gyeltsen, and thereafter his transmission naturally continued down to Bardingpa Namka Gyeltsen.

With regard to these guidebooks, which are collectively entitled Eight Further Cycles of the Path: There are six that engage with the perfection stage of the three meditational deities—Cakrasaṃvara, Hevajra, and Guhyasamāja—and two that comment on the tantras in general.[44] Among them, Ḍombipā’s The Attainment of Coemergence and Saroruha’s The Nine Profound Methods pertain to the commentarial tradition of Hevajra and the actual perfection stage of the Saroruha tradition. The Perfection of the Path of Fierce Inner Heat and The Straightening of Crooked Posture pertain to Cakrasaṃvara. The Attainment in Proximity to a Stupa [or The Determination of Mind] pertains to Guhyasamāja in the form Akṣobhya, and The Great Seal Devoid of Letters pertains to Guhyasamāja according to the Buddhajñānapāda tradition. The Inconceivables and the cycle of the path of Indrabhūti [entitled The Path of the Female Mudra] are both unquestionably practiced in the perfection stage of all the unsurpassed tantras without exception. {88}

Here, in the practical transmission that is perfectly implemented, The Attainment of Coemergence and The Nine Profound Methods are not conferred through their own individual maturational empowerments, which would respectively be the maṇḍala rite of Ḍombipā and the inaugural maṇḍala rite of Nelingma. Rather, the maturation of each of the Eight Further Cycles of the Path is exclusively rendered efficacious through the empowerments associated with the instructional tradition of Hevajra. Following this line of reasoning, it is unquestionable that the maturational empowerments of all the mantra-related sections of all the one hundred and eight could be performed according to the instructional tradition of Hevajra alone! The essential point here, however, is that although the lineages of maturational empowerment and liberating path coincide in both the aforementioned traditions of Ḍombipā and Saroruha, they have diverged in the other six. For example, in The Perfection of the Path of Fierce Inner Heat and The Straightening of Crooked Posture, the empowerment accords with the Kāṇha tradition of Cakrasaṃvara, whereas The Attainment in Proximity to a Stupa adopts the empowerment of Guhyasamāja in the form Akṣobhya, and The Great Seal Devoid of Letters adopts [the empowerment of Guhyasamāja in the form] Mañjuvajra. The Inconceivables and the cycle of the path of Indrabhūti [entitled The Path of the Female Mudra] adopt the maturational empowerment of the Tantra of the Vital Essence of Union. And yet, although the empowerments [of these six guidebooks] manifestly correspond to their respective tantras, since the lineages of their maturational empowerment and their liberating path have diverged, the maturational empowerment is best performed according to the instructional tradition [of Hevajra] alone, with that empowerment functioning as their inaugural rite. For the lineages of instruction in addition to that empowerment, however, one cannot find any method apart from their individual applications.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Three Purities: This is said to be a term that is not at all found in The Path and Its Fruition. Formerly, at Mutso, the glorious lord of the sacred doctrine Gyelwa Bum first delivered an essential teaching on Parting from the Four Attachments. Afterward, when he taught at Jonshing, he gave teachings on the [absolute] setting of the mind on enlightenment, which is nonarising and indeterminate; and then he conferred empowerment in the commentarial tradition that accords with the maṇḍala rite of Ḍombipā. He began with the guidebook entitled The Three Purities, next he bestowed the related instruction entitled The Inconceivables, and finally he bestowed The Twenty-Nine [Essential] Visualizations of Self-Consecration. There is an actual detailed account of Ngari Ulekpa, the monk Aba Drakpa, and the others who were his disciples at the time when they acquired the title of “one who had reached the Path and Its Fruition of the Hevajra commentarial tradition.” {89}

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Exegesis of the Concealed Path: The portal of this teaching was opened through the transformative empowerments of the profound path, exclusively in the palace of Akṣobhya—the adamantine reality of buddha mind. Jetsun Drakpa Gyeltsen alludes to this in his Analysis of Empowerment.[45] This guidebook concerns the application and symbolism of yogic exercises that constitute the guidance of the five celestial palaces [of the body], according to the concealed exegesis.
The root verses of the concealed exegesis were originally in hybrid Sanskrit and Prakrit, as follows:

With these words, Virūpa symbolically taught seventy-two tantras to Sachen Kunga Nyingpo, and in the same manner he also taught him the four profound doctrines [in secret], without going beyond the boundary wall [of his hermitage].[46] Sachen wrote down the elucidation of their meaning in a concordance of bilingual examples.[47]

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Elucidation of the Symbolic Meaning: Sachen Kunga Nyingpo revealed this in a pure vision to Jetsun Drakpa Gyeltsen. He explained the essentials of the Path and Its Fruition by means of making symbolic signs on the white rock upon which he sat. It brings together extensive, middling, and concise visualizations. Later on, certain proud scholars said of this that its root verses had been deliberately distorted following the interpretation of the six-branch yoga of Hevajra according to the class of mother tantra, which Ga Lotsāwa had given to Sachen Kunga Nyingpo.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Vital Essence of Liberation: this comprises the six-branch yoga of the Guhyasamāja, as enunciated in the Subsequent Tantra of the Secret Assembly.

As for the guidebook entitled The Unelaborate Practice of Red Yamāri: I acquired conviction in the tradition of Lowo Lotsāwa.
The guidebook entitled The Four-Stage Yoga is also based on the writings of Lowo Lotsāwa. Later, Ārya [Kanaśrī] from Upper Nyang and others made a false claim concerning a yogin named Karṇaripā, dissimulating that he had stayed for twelve years standing on one foot alongside [an image of] Khasarpaṇi, and in consequence of that actually obtained this instruction from Virūpa. This needs to be investigated since it is indeed a false assertion.
With regard to the guidebook entitled The Mental Focus on the Horns of Bhairava that accords with the Kyo tradition, and the associated Nocturnal Motion and The Erect Penis [of Bhairava]: These are authentic, and there are extant Sanskrit memoranda attributed to the Indian masters Amoghavajra, Lalitavajra, and Mañjuśrīmitra. [In addition], the Riwo Gedenpa composed a supporting text on the Guhyasamāja, which was arranged according to the great accomplished master Śrīdhara’s Four-Stage Yoga of Red Yamāri and Śāntipa’s The Inner Yoga of the Communal Offering.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Central Channel Dependent on the Male Deity Cakrasaṃvara: This denotes the teaching of Jetsun Drakpa Gyeltsen entitled Elixir of the Buddha Mind of Nāropā. The guidebook entitled The Central Channel Dependent on the Female Deity Vajravārāhī—in which the “referential basis” is established as the male deity who enters into union with the female deity, or “referential object”—is contextualized by Mu Konchok Gyeltsen as follows:[49] “Vārāhī Khecarī of the Generation Stage and The Central Channel of the Perfection Stage had been taught sequentially, but the two had not been taught together. It was the glorious Lama Dampa Sonam Gyeltsen who conferred instruction on Chojé Zung[50] that combined The Central Channel with Nāropā’s Khecarī and this is said to have been his own formulation. It represents our own tradition—the guidance of the concise and cherished pith instructions of inner Pullahari.” And, “Though Jetsun [Drakpa Gyeltsen] did explain them, integrating the three channels with the two structures of the body, in his Catalog he still refers to them [separately] as ‘Khecarī, The Central Channel, and so forth.’ ”[51] {91} In addition, the Venerable Dorjé Chang [Kunga Zangpo] speaks of “the yoga of Khecarī, the profound generation stage, and the yoga of the central channel of the perfection stage.”[52] There is therefore no authentic basis for conflating them. On the other hand, when glorious Lama Dampa Sonam Gyeltsen received guidance on the central channel from Drakpukpa Sonam Pelwa, over seven days he did perfect the power of the fierce inner heat. Since this is mentioned in the Biography [of Lama Dampa Sonam Gyeltsen] composed by the great translator Jangchub Tsemo, [his differing opinion] should be properly considered.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Five Stages according to Ghaṇṭāpāda: There is an extensive exegesis on this composed by Tsongkhapa in respect of which I never obtained the blessing of the preliminary practice.[53] There is also the insightful commentary by [Taktsang Lotsāwa] Drapa Sherab Rinchen for which I acquired the blessing and empowerment.[54] As far as my own tradition is concerned, I have confidence in the teaching of Jetsun Drakpa Gyeltsen, which is an injunction of Vajradhara, so how could I follow naive chatter?[55] Although there is also an instruction composed by Pakpa,[56] in this context I count the text of Tsokgompa [Kunga Pel], which was definitively written. It is the experiential guidance through which Tsokgompa acquired a precisely flowing and clear meditative stability while cultivating this instruction under Sakya Paṇḍita. There are also definitive notes on that by Zhang Dodé Pel.[57]

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Four Stages according to Kṛṣṇacārin: Mal Lotsāwa, Purang Lochung [of Kashmir], and Mardo [Chokyi Wangchuk]—those three—were generally similar in that they composed instructions that were later comparable to The Perfection of the Path of Fierce Inner Heat.[58]
Gungru Sherab Zangpo and others also composed tables of contents entitled A General Description of the Four Stages and A Particular Exegesis of the Vital Essence of Spring.[59] Then he came to know that the Instruction Manual Entitled Oral Discussion is mistaken in teaching that the Vital Essence of Spring illustrates only two cakras because the Sanskrit text of the Vital Essence of Spring absolutely does have an extensive exegesis of four cakras.[60]
Also, with regard to Inciting the Path of the Four Stages, it is said that the teaching transmission of Purang Lochung was committed to writing by Mar Chokyi Gyeltsen, and a definitive memorandum on Marpa Dopa’s Oral Discussion was definitively recorded by Chokro Chokyi Gyeltsen. {92} Then there was Venerable Sachen Kunga Nyingpo’s [Commentary on] Inciting the Path of the Four Stages. All three could withstand revisions and are reliable because they are in harmony with the pith instructions of Nāropā.
Nowadays all the most dignified gesheés of the Sakyapa school proclaim with trepidation that the four stages of the path are extremely dangerous, but there is no basis for Kṛṣṇacārin’s Four Stages of the Path being dangerous for the Sakyapas. The reason why it is widely reported that this instruction is very dangerous is that formerly when Chokro Chokyi Gyeltsen set out from Kham, all his relatives sent much gold. In particular, his mother sent a golden spoon inlaid with turquoise in order to sustain his acquisition of the sacred doctrine. On reaching Utsang, he stayed a long time at Yamdrok, where for twelve years he sat pillow to pillow with Mardo Chokyi Wangchuk. He received all the tantras and pith instructions pertaining to Cakrasaṃvara, and also wrote an exegetical commentary on the tantra according to the teachings of Mardo. Buton later praised that treatise immensely, saying among the indigenous Tibetan commentaries on Cakrasaṃvara, that one was excellent. Venerable Tsongkhapa was also attracted to that commentary.

At that time when Chokro Chokyi Gyeltsen was contented with the teachings he had received, Mardo’s son José Namka-o saw that golden spoon in the hand of Chokro and said to him, “You are contented with those oral instructions, but you have not received the direct guidance on implementing the Four Stages [of the Path], which is the essence of the instructions. You should offer this golden spoon to the lama and request that!” So Chokro prepared an excellent communal offering, on top of which he offered the golden spoon inlaid with turquoise and requested Inciting the Path of the Four Stages. Marpa Dopa rose on his teaching throne {93} and said, “No one at all knows the name of this doctrine. Who told you about it?” Chokro replied that José had told him, whereupon he looked at José and said, “Greedy! Is your vital channel of life made of diamond! Now, even if your life is cut off, there is an auspicious circumstance indicating that the continuity of this instruction will not be interrupted in the future.” Mardo Lotsāwa conferred the instruction, and as soon as he had done so, he passed away. And as his son got dressed in order to make the funerary offerings, thieves launched a nighttime raid and pierced his body with weapons, so that he also died after eleven days. Throughout the country this was taken as an indication that the instruction was dangerous. Nowadays, the transmission that Mardo imparted to Chokro is no longer extant, but the text that Chokro composed survives.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Guidance of White Cakrasaṃvara: This was supreme among the four extraordinary and special instructions through which Śākyaśrī, the paṇḍita of Kashmir, attained enlightenment. Although dissimilar to the exegetical methods of the Indian masters Abhayākaragupta, Atiśa, and paṇḍita Vibhūticandra, Śākyaśrī said that Vajravārāhī actually conferred this upon him.
Formerly white Cakrasaṃvara was the principal meditational deity of all the monastic preceptors of the four communities [established in Tibet by Śākyaśrī]. Considering that, Rongton Sheja Kunrik later traveled to Ngor to request Dorjé Chang Kunga Zangpo for instruction on white Cakrasaṃvara. The letter of request that he made at that time is even now kept in a relic box at Ngor. But he did not have an opportunity to receive it.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Four Adamantine Seats: The profound gradation of guidance on The Four Adamantine Seats is extremely rare. When Buton Rinpoché was teaching this instruction, he would confer it in the same way as his teacher, facing in the same direction, and exactly at the same time of day, neither earlier nor later.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Great Magical Emanation: Here I refer exclusively to the tradition that maintains the texts and lineage of Ngok Choku Dorjé. {94} It is said that Buton also requested this and never acquired it, but that later he eventually did receive it from Jamkya Namka Pelden. Khyungpo Lhepa [Zhonu Sonam] received it from Buton, the lama Tashi Rinchen received it from him, and Dorjé Chang [Kunga Zangpo] received it from the latter.
Later on, some years after Dorjé Chang had founded Ngor Monastery, a great monastic preceptor known as Rongchung Sherab Pelden came to attend upon him. He and Chojé Rongpo both had the same birthplace, and there was not the slightest difference between them in their erudition or learning. Even so, Rongchung said, “Taking our physical stature into account, you are known as Rongchen and I am Rongchung. Previously, apart from following the causal vehicle of defining characteristics alone, I have never heard a single teaching on the way of mantra. Confronted by death in my old age, I feel sad even though I have listened to exegeses. In this last part of my life, I think I should engage in some experiential cultivation. So, O Lama, since you are a master of the tantras, I request you to confer upon me a maturational empowerment, liberating path, or supporting tantric exegesis of the way of Secret Mantra that is brief and concise, easy to understand, and absolutely easy to carry [on the path]—for I have not trained in the way of Secret Mantra.”
Dorjé Chang replied, “In that case, I will offer you this sacred doctrine through which our predecessor the lord-protector Chogyel Pakpa dispatched the Kadampa Namka Bum to the realm of the sky-farers.” In the southern castle [at Ngor], in a public exegesis, he conferred upon Rongchung the empowerments and guidance of Cakrasaṃvara and the Great Magical Emanation, based on the Vajragarbha Ḍākinī. Rongchung stayed there for about eleven months and a supreme joy was born within him. He then returned home and took up residence within a grass hermitage at the foot of the palace known as Nub Cholung’s Cakrasaṃvara Chapel.[61] There he nurtured his liberating career, planting the victory banner of attainment without distractions. {95}

When some three years had passed, a vulture fell down upon the residence of the Governor Norzang of the Rinpung Estate.[62] Astrologers and others predicted that “this hare year there will be a great disaster that cannot be averted by any longevity rites and so forth. It is certain that the Drungchen will die.” Many random teachers of the Rong area and the Shong area also said that such signs had occurred in their dreams. So Drungchen Norzang was despondent. They said, “Since death is certainly approaching at this time, having in the past accumulated most severe negativity through your governorship, there will be nowhere at all for you to go but the hells. So, before the movement of your life-breath expires, you have no choice but to receive empowerments of Sarvavid Vairocana from a lama who knows the way of Secret Mantra. Nowadays there is no one in the Tsang area other than Ngorpa Dorjé Chang Kunga Zangpo who is adorned with the practical applications of Secret Mantra. You should invite him!”
An invitation duly arrived at Ngor Evaṃ Choden, outlining the reason for this request. At that time, Dorjé Chang had finished teaching the three appearances according to the Path and Its Fruition,[63] and it was the day on which he was conferring the vows of setting the mind on enlightenment. Learned persons from each of the residential houses within the monastery assembled, and they said, “If you go at this time, it will not be auspicious. Since this is the high point of the teaching that you are conferring, it will indeed be difficult to achieve anything.” On the other hand, since he would be censured [if he did not go there] before the governor passed away, Dorjé Chang said, “The master Konchok Gyeltsen who has not actually come [to this meeting] should confer upon the community of practitioners the empowerment of Nairātmyā in a maṇḍala of colored sand, and after that, seated upon a cushion in front of the teaching throne, he should deliver an extensive exegesis on the indivisibility of cyclic existence and nirvana.” Then Dorjé Chang directly set out on horseback.
At Rinpung he conferred upon the governor an elaborate ritual on cheating death according to the Sanskrit text of Jetāri,[64] and in association with a hundred long-life empowerments. {96} In that manner, the obstacles of that year were dispelled, and thereafter it is said that he would virtually make an annual visit [to Rinpung].

On the way back up [to Ngor], just above Soldro Jetang in Nub Cholung, they set up their fireplace, and Chojé Rongchung went there from his retreat hermitage to meet him. After the others had set out from Soldro, Rongchung stayed alone for a while in the presence of the Venerable Dorjé Chang, offering many prostrations and suggesting some reasons [for leaving his hermitage], but the lama was displeased.
The lama and his disciples were then invited to the palace, where they had excellent sweet tea. At the break of dawn when the horizon was still pale, Gugé Paṇḍita, who was the attendant at that time, went to disturb Venerable Dorjé Chang with an offering of some black tea. At that time the sky was entirely filled with light. Inspecting this in detail, he saw that the grass hermitage of Rongchungpa was shrouded by a seven-layered umbrella of rainbow light, its upturned staff in the form of a tube fashioned of five-colored rainbow light. In astonishment he went inside and reported this, but the lama did not say anything at all. At sunrise, the attendant of Rongchung arrived there and said that although Rongchung’s complexion had not shown any signs of illness and the like, when he went to bring him morning soup he had already passed away. The lama then said, “Over the last three years he has increased his meditative commitments. Reaching the essential point, he has departed without impediment for the realm of the sky-farers. Since we are responsible for the funeral ceremony, we will stay for three days, after which you may cremate the body.” Since Rongchung’s mortal remains had dissolved into light owing to the rites of the Great Magical Emanation that the Venerable Dorjé Chang the Great had himself bestowed, the valley was permeated with a shower of flowers, a symphony of music, and an exquisite fragrance. He presented gifts at the crematorium and said they should not open it for seven days. Then he set out on the way back to Ngor. {97} When the crematorium was opened on the eighth day, they found that he had been invited by the ḍākinīs, leaving behind not even a single bone relic the size of a fingernail or a spoonful of funerary ash. When they asked if they should build a small brick reliquary stupa at the place where he had departed, no one said anything in reply. When they looked for a quantity of earth to make one, they did not find even the slightest trace.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Kharamukha Cakrasaṃvara: This is a wondrous and marvelous profound teaching that had never previously been translated in Tibet. Dorjé Chang Kunga Zangpo visited Ngari Lowo [Khenchen Sonam Lhundrub] on three occasions. On the last occasion, at a place called Netsedrum in the connecting lower valley (bar tshigs lung thur) of Lowo, there was a lama named Samten Ozer who had received the empowerments and oral instructions of Kharamukha Cakrasaṃvara from the Newar Mahābodhi. He had practiced the generation and perfection stages of meditation without interruption and had completed seven hundred million recitations of the seven-syllable mantra and eighty thousand recitations of the Litany of the Names of Mañjuśrī in Sanskrit. Immediately after that he had lived as a hidden yogin, selling yeast for brewing ale.
Venerable Dorjé Chang summoned Samten Ozer to Drakar and also gave him precise training in the tradition for the conferral of empowerment, after which Samten Ozer was due to offer the empowerment the next morning. That evening, however, Samten Ozer ran away and entered the temple of Lower Rongting. Venerable Dorjé Chang then said, “If he cannot confer the empowerment on me, since otherwise the transmission of this teaching will be interrupted and ruined, let him confer it on these three disciples of mine!” The three—Chojé Peldenpa of Jampeling, Gugé Paṇḍita [Drakpa Gyeltsen], and Lama Gyelsé—then requested it, and Samten Ozer bestowed it upon them, after which he was sent on his way with inconceivably fine donations. As commanded, Samten Ozer took care when conferring the empowerment. He conferred the preparatory rite, and the following day, during the exegesis on the empowerment, he detailed the hierarchy of the five [downfalls], from the killing of life to sexual misconduct, and of the ten nonvirtuous actions; and then he continued with a teaching on the eight freedoms and ten advantages.[65] {98}

When those three returned into the presence of Venerable Dorjé Chang, he examined them in detail, asking about the practical application at the time when these empowerments were conferred. Drung Peldenpa reported it naturally, just as it had happened, so that the lama was pleased. Gugé Paṇḍita said, “I have offered a quatrain in praise of it.” “That’s right!” he replied. The glorious and precious root guru Lama Gyelsé then said, “He excellently taught the definitive order of the ten nonvirtuous actions, and then continued with the eighteen aspects of freedom and endowment. Let’s pray to you, Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom!” It is said that the master and his disciples all laughed.

The transmission was not propagated by two of these teachers, but Gugé Paṇḍita did confer it upon Lowo Khen Rinpoché [Sonam Lhundrub] and Chojé Namka Tenpa. These two propagated it extensively, so that its transmission is indeed unbroken at the present time. Gugé Paṇḍita also composed an arrangement for the visualization maṇḍala, concluding with the words, “The perfection stage of that which is called the oral transmission of the hidden and great accomplished yogin Samten Ozer, disciple of the cakravartin Mahābodhi who belonged to the class of accomplished masters blessed by Vajravārāhī, concerns the yoga of subtle vital essence, and is also reckoned to include his memorandum on the words of the Tantra of Clear Expression, and an exegesis on the fierce inner heat of the blazing fire of kuṇḍalinī according to The Kharamukha Cakrasaṃvara,[66] which pertains to The Four [Adamantine] Seats. Since these are without error, it is said that in these sacred texts it appears that we encounter the Indian and Newar paṇḍitas themselves.”

Homage to the teacher!
Among the one hundred and eight profound guidebooks, the foregoing historical anecdotes up to and including the seventy-fourth, which concerns the perfection stage of Kharamukha Cakrasaṃvara, were composed by Jetsun Kunga Drolchok, but the remainder were left unfinished in that chapter. I [Tāranātha] have therefore presented them here in the form of a supplement.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Six Meditations of Vajravārāhī: This is based on the longer and shorter texts concerning Vajravārāhī in the form Dvimukhā,[2] the longer and shorter texts on Vajravārāhī in the form Chinnamuṇḍā,[3] and the longer and shorter texts concerning Vajravārāhī in the form Sarvārthasiddhā,[4] which are collectively known as the Six Texts concerning Vajravārāhī; along with the supplementary text entitled Rite of Burnt Offerings.[5]
Concerning Vajravārāhī in the form Dvimukhā (“with two faces”), prior to the Indian and Newar lineage holders, this was known and highly esteemed as Vārāhī according to the pith instructions of Oḍḍiyāna.[6] The shorter text on Vajravārāhī in the form Dvimukhā composed by Śabaripā, who was also known by the name of the master Śūnyatāsamādhivajra, has an extremely great blessing. Although elsewhere this is reputed to have been composed by Indrabhūti the Younger, that is simply because Śūnyatāsamādhivajra had been accepted as a disciple by Indrabhūti the Younger. {101} Later, the master Śūnyatāsamādhivajra composed a most excellent poetic work entitled the Means for Attainment of Jowo Bhugama, and he revealed it to all the Indian and Newar paṇḍitas, who could not discern any flaws. He became renowned for his learning and was revered as a teacher by the chief minister of Nepal, who offered him Meñja Lingpa and its estate.

His resources and merits were extremely great. At that time, with pride in his mastery of poetics, he composed the Attainment of the Pristine Cognition of the Real, which is also known as the “longer text on Vajravārāhī in the form Dvimukhā,” and he also wrote the longer text on Vajravārāhī in the form Sarvārthasiddhā,[7] but these were not approved by the Ḍākinī. As a negative consequence of having interpreted the profound Secret Mantra in a poetic form, the infant child of the minister did not recover her health, a downpour of rain could not be stopped, and there was great damage inflicted on the harvest. The master’s resources faded like a stream that had been cut off. After passing three further years engaged in a confession rite, the Venerable Vajravārāhī actually revealed her visage and delivered the following prophetic declaration: “If you had meditated instead of writing these treatises and had been transfigured into the rainbow light body, those obstacles could have been prevented. Henceforth, however, I will consecrate these two means for attainment, {102} so that they will be of benefit to many sentient beings, and all your activities will be accomplished unimpededly.”

Thereafter Śūnyatāsamādhivajra’s merits increased a hundredfold more than before. He became the teacher of the kings of both Nepal and Magadha, and those texts of his were indeed propagated throughout India and Nepal. Later, Chel Lotsāwa Kunga Dorjé, the son of Chel Lotsāwa Sonam Gyeltsen, received them from Hadu Karpo, the master of this sacred doctrine, pleasing him with his conduct and offerings. In order to request this doctrinal cycle completely, he traveled three times to Nepal.
Under these circumstances the exegesis of all six texts spread extremely far and wide. Ngok Lotsāwa the Great also made a translation. Although there were many who were extremely adept in this entire oral instruction—including the translator Khu Netso, Maben Chobar, and Nubton Gyelyé—Chel [Lotsāwa Kunga Dorjé] was absolutely greater in his blessings and enlightened activities, owing to the power of his inestimable ascetic discipline and persistent endeavors. So it was said that “Vārāhī had encountered Chel.”[8]

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Six Doctrines of Nāropā: This is the quintessence of the oral instructions of the lineage holders of the four transmitted teachings.[9] Essentially these comprise the oral instructions of the lineage blessed with experiential cultivation, revealing (i) the fierce inner heat and action seal extrapolated from the Tantra of Hevajra; (ii–iv) the illusory body, luminosity, and dream yoga extrapolated from the Tantra of Guhyasamāja; and (v–vi) the consciousness transference and resurrection extrapolated from the Tantra of the Adamantine Four Seats—the last two being ancillary aspects of the path. Although there are many dissimilar interpretations of the Six Doctrines that are extant, here the Molten Gold of the Six Doctrines[10] is to be counted as the seventy-sixth guidebook.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Six Doctrines of Nigumā, and so forth: There are widespread accounts that Nigumā, the ḍākinī of pristine cognition, had been the wife of Nāropā,[11] and so forth. In particular, when she received some oral instruction from Lavapa in the eastern direction, {103} she meditated alongside the master himself for seven days, so that she was transformed into the rainbow light body of a ḍākinī of pristine cognition and actualized the realization of the eighth level. It is said that she left a claw-sized mark protruding from the crown of the easterner Lavapa’s head. That was Lavapa the Younger.

As for the name Nigumā, the corresponding Sanskrit is nigupta, which is also known to mean “definitively secret” (nges gsang) or “definitively concealed” (nges sbas). Actually, it is a symbolic term for the “ḍākinīs of pristine cognition.”

The great accomplished master Khyungpo Neljor, who was endowed with five culminations,[12] received many Sanskrit texts that were well known throughout the sublime land of India. In particular, in the evening of the fifteenth day of the month of Vaiśākha, as the pale moon rose, Nigumā conferred the great empowerment of the illusory body upon him in an emanational maṇḍala; and at dawn in a dream he received the Six Doctrines all at once. Later he received them from her twice in person, so that he actually received them on three occasions.
From Khyungpo Neljor through to Drogon Sangyé Tonpa, the teachings remained sealed, transmitted to a single lineage holder in each generation. Drogon Tonpa had an inestimable number of disciples whom he favored with the oral instructions of Pacification, Severance, and those of Jowojé Atiśa, Nāropā, and so forth; and with the oral instructions of Maitrīpā, Rāhula, Vajrāsanapāda, and the others that constitute the sacred doctrines of the Shangpa. Although there were an infinite number who obtained from him a portion of the oral instructions of Nigumā and Sukhasiddhi, there were three on whom he bestowed the maturational empowerments and liberating path along with ancillaries in their entirety—namely, the master Ayi Sengé, Khedrub Shangton, and Khedrub Zhonu Drub. Although there are an inestimable number of different lineage transmissions that derived from the last two, the symbolic meanings were never differentiated because they are contained in the Ḍākinī [Nigumā’s] Inventory [Clarifying the Six Doctrines].[13] {104} Since they were without contrived views, they arrived at the summit of all the lineages of attainment.

The entire instructional cycle of Nigumā contains the enlightened intention of all the tantras in general, and in particular it is the essence of the five tantras that reveal the culmination. The most uncommon of them are said to be contained in essential extracts from the Tantra of the Ocean of Vows and the Tantra of the Precious Ocean.[14]

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Amulet Tradition of the Great Seal: Khyungpo Neljor inscribed the root verses of this instruction on palm leaves and inserted them into an amulet made of sandalwood.

An alternative interpretation suggesting that the “gemstone of awareness or mind was inserted within an amulet of skillful means and discriminative awareness” is pointless, nonsensical talk.

The oral instructions of this guidebook contain a preliminary, main practice, and conclusion, and they never transgress the speech of the ḍākinī Nigumā. The lineage holders of its authentic realization are distilled in the unique perspective that is the enlightened intention of the ḍākinī Nigumā, Sukhasiddhi, and Maitrīpā—these three. When it was first introduced [to Tibet], the great accomplished master Khyungpo Neljor coined the terminology of the three sealings in the following verse:
External appearances are sealed with appearance and emptiness.
Awareness or mind is sealed with radiance and emptiness.
One’s own body in which the deity is present is sealed with bliss and emptiness.[15]
When an inconceivable realization of the Six Doctrines was born in Venerable Mokchokpa, the accomplished master Khyungpo Neljor was not present, so in order to cut off his misconceptions, Venerable Mokchokpa studied the Great Seal under Venerable Gampopa and perfected the successful outcome of realizing the abiding nature. Then, in accordance with the explanation of Venerable Dakpo Gampopa, he coined terminology that excluded the term sealing.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Six Doctrines of Sukhasiddhi: Although the great accomplished master Khyungpo Neljor did not receive the great word transmission in connection with the Sanskrit texts derived from the ḍākinī of pristine cognition Sukhasiddhi, her kindness was unsurpassed for the following three reasons: (i) she imparted the oral instruction of essential meaning; (ii) she conferred upon him the empowerment of profundity; and (iii) she blessed the mind of the great accomplished master himself, along with all of his lineage holders.
This instruction contains extremely profound doctrinal cycles, including The Three Nails of the Pith Instructions of Secret Attainment.[17] Derived from that, and also renowned within the Six Doctrines of Sukhasiddhi, is the instruction based on The Emanational Cakra of the Navel. Although there is a clear ancient document concerning this instruction that is extant, it was not widely propagated in the past. But later it was disseminated widely by the Venerable Kuzhang Khyenrab[—that is, Rinchen Khyenrab Chogdrub].[18]
With regard to the guidebook entitled The Inner Guidance of Nairātmyā: this is the doctrine of the accomplished master—Āryadeva the Brahmin, who was the maternal uncle of Dampa Sangyé.
For each of these doctrinal cycles of Sukhasiddhi, there is an oral instruction dating from the time of Khyungpo Neljor. In addition, all of them also contain the particularly profound points to be extrapolated concerning the instructions that the ḍākinī Sukhasiddhi actually conferred in person on Nyenton the Great Chokyi Sherab (1175–1255) over seven days at Yang Gon in Rigongpel.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Coemergent Union of the Great Seal: Only the kernel of this instruction was transmitted from Nāropā and Maitrīpā to Marpa and Milarepa, and apart from that there was no detailed guidance. The peerless Dakpo Lharjé Gampopa then directly received a prophetic declaration from Venerable Milarepa. After passing six years enhancing his realization at Sewalung in Nyel, where he meditated skillfully on the fierce inner heat, he then stayed for three years at Gelung in Olka, perfecting the realization of the abiding nature. {106} Thinking it would be of no benefit even if he were to explain this to others, with the exception of certain industrious persons, he did not teach others for some years, but thereafter he did teach it somewhat to certain persons, including Neljor Choyung. Consequently, in the manner of a flame that spreads from one butter lamp to the next, without hardship, the realization [of the abiding nature] was absolutely perfected and widely enhanced. This master of the Great Seal was universally of benefit to others. Henceforth most of the instructions on the nature of mind that were known among the new and old traditions of Secret Mantra practiced in Tibet could probably not stand comparison with this guidebook.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Introduction to the Three Buddha Bodies: This is the sacred doctrine that arose from the mind of Karma Pakshi, simply by following his predecessors; a teaching endowed with the authentic lineage of blessings. At the time when he entrusted the authentic lineage of all his doctrines to the accomplished master Orgyanpa Rinchen Pel, it is said that he bestowed this instruction alone.
With regard to the guidebook entitled The Indivisibility of Subtle Energy and Mind: this is a profound doctrine that is known within the Karma Kamtsang tradition.
With regard to the guidebook entitled The Six Doctrines according to the Sekharma Tradition: The Venerable Marpa imparted this instruction to his son Dodé Bum. The scrolls were concealed as treasure at Sekhar, and later brought forth from their treasure trove by the treasure finder Chowang Rinpoché. After transcribing them, he reinserted the originals in their proper resting place. Knowing this instruction to be the doctrinal fortune of Lha Rinchen Wangyel, he bestowed them upon him, and consequently it was extensively propagated by Lhapa. {107} Although this was preserved among the upholders of the Kagyu teaching until the time of Nyopa and his followers, the transmission became denigrated due to disputes and repeated insinuations within the Kagyu school.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Mingling and Transformation of the Three Poisons according to Ngok: this is the unsurpassed profound pith instruction in conformity with the enlightened intention of the Root Tantra of Hevajra and its exegesis.
Lord Marpa, during his final pilgrimage, received a prophetic declaration from his teacher Sendhepa. He prayed for seven days in the service of glorious Nāropā, and actually beheld his visage. But when he ran toward him, thinking to request some blessing, there was no trace of Nāropā—only a skull cup filled with Vairocana (that is, excrement) and consecrated as nectar. Just by drinking it, an inestimable meditative stability arose. After praying again for seven days, he met glorious Nāropā, who said, “What do you want?” He requested an exegesis on Hevajra, whereupon Nāropā emanated the nine-deity maṇḍala and conferred the empowerment. He then gave a single teaching on the tantra and its instruction, introducing it in accordance with the meaning of the empowerment and cutting of all doubts. Marpa then thought, “Now I should request Cakrasaṃvara and Guhyasamāja,” but Nāropā said, “Do you understand Hevajra?” “I do understand it,” he replied. “Well then, that’s enough!” Nāropā replied, and he vanished.
Earlier and later Marpa also attended upon Lord Maitrīpā for a long period of time and received an infinite number of oral instructions on the tantras, but he held the tradition of Nāropā to be foremost, crucially because the empowerment had been conferred in an emanational maṇḍala. At that time Marpa requested the empowerment following the example of Buddhajñānapāda. But what is the point of recounting his wrong choice and so forth.[20] {108}

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Four Scrolls of the Aural Instructions:[21] This concerns each of the extraordinary profound points pertaining to Hevajra, Secret Assembly, Great Magical Emanation, and Four Adamantine Seats. At the time when Tsurton Wang-gi Dorjé presented four great offerings to Venerable Marpa, he received each of these oral instructions individually. There are many extant old writings concerning this guidebook, but nowadays there is a newly composed text with the title Four Scrolls that has become widespread.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Nine Doctrinal Cycles of Nirdehaḍākinī: Once upon a time when the accomplished master Tilopā journeyed here [to India] from Oḍḍiyāna, each evening the ḍākinīs would invisibly recite root verses from the sky, so these became known as the “doctrinal cycles of Nirdehaḍākinī,” the “disembodied ḍākinī.” It is also said that this ḍākinī was actually Vārāhī in the form Sarvārthasiddhā. Of the nine cycles, the first four descended to Marpa and the last five were painstakingly sought from India by Rechungpa.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Elaborate Guidance of Zhang Tselpa: This comprises the common traditions of Drigom and Dakpo Gomtsul Nyingpo, and the uncommon traditions of Ga Lotsāwa and Vairocanabhadra. Known as the “four definitive presences,” their instructions include (i) the definitive presence of Cakrasaṃvara according to Ga Lotsāwa, (ii) the definitive presence of Vārāhī according to [Drigom] Melton Yerpawa, (iii) the definitive presence of Tārā according to the Indian Vairocanabhadra, and (iv) the definitive presence of Buddha Śākyamuni according to Dakpo Gomtsul Nyingpo.
The nucleus of these oral instructions comprises the cycle of the one hundred teachings of the path of skillful means and the single scroll of instruction pertaining to the path of liberation, which are introduced to fortunate individuals in an immediate manner.
With regard to the guidebook entitled the cycle of The Six-Branch Yoga according to Pelchen Ga Lotsāwa: Ga Lotsāwa requested from Tsami Chenpo Sangyé Drak (fl. eleventh century) the oral instruction through which there would be no need to change focus from the time when one is a beginner until the attainment of buddhahood. He was therefore granted the teaching entitled On a Single Seat, which integrates Cakrasaṃvara of the generation stage with the six-branch yoga of the perfection stage.[23] {109} By meditating for seven years he obtained the indications of great warmth. He then practiced for eleven months at the Śītavana charnel ground, during which time the ḍākinīs also presented him with the Seven Days of Fierce Inner Heat. Then he effortlessly became an accomplished master, known throughout India and Tibet, and possessing infinite signs of spiritual accomplishment.

With regard to the guidebook concerning the uncommon tenets of the Drigungpa entitled The Unique Enlightened Intention: While Jigten Gonpo was residing at Wangmopuk Monastery in Yechung Pulung, the Tenfold Doctrinal Instruction[24] and The Threefold Doctrine[25] arose in his mind. Since he understood all the crucial points of auspicious circumstance, these tenets also arose in his mind. Later at the time when he met Dodé Rabjam, he is said to have presented these in accordance with the real enlightened intention of the teachings. Although these tenets are for the most part extremely noble in meaning, they have generally been subjected to refutation, owing to their incompatibility with other terminologies. Their adherents also say that The Unique Enlightened Intention represents a promulgation of the doctrinal wheel that was never turned by anyone else after the Buddha attained nirvana. It is prone to criticism on account of being incompatible with all other traditions, but that seems not to be the main point that is intended.

With regard to the guidebook of the cycle of the Middle Drukpa [entitled The Means for Attainment of the Guru, Auspicious Circumstances, and Common Savor]: The oral instructions that were transmitted to Drogon Tsangpa Gyaré, renowned as the glorious Drukpa, are said to be subsumed in three stems. These three stems comprise (i) the view that accords with the tradition of Gampopa, (ii) the oral instructions that accord with the tradition of Rechungpa, and (iii) the auspicious circumstances that accord with his own tradition.[26]
The first of these denotes The Coemergent Union of the Great Seal, which was transmitted from Gampopa to Pagmodrupa. The second denotes most of the empowerments and oral instructions associated with this Drukpa tradition that were transmitted from Lorepa Darma Wangchuk (1187–1250), Tsangpa Gyaré, and Sumpa Repa (fl. twelfth century). However, the main disseminator of these two stems was Ling Repa (1128–1188). The third is the instruction that Tsangpa Gyaré himself received in a vision of the seven generations of past buddhas.
Among these, the lineage of blessings contained in The Means for Attainment of the Guru as the Three Buddha Bodies, which is of useful practical application, is compatible with [the aforementioned lineage of] the Six Doctrines, whereas the essential points of its oral instructions follow the texts of Vibhūticandra.

The kernel of the Six Cycles of Common Savor appears to be contained completely in the [aforementioned] Doctrinal Cycles of Nirdehaḍākinī. On the other hand, the instructions concerning supreme common savor that are prevalent today[—that is, in the time of Tāranātha—]integrate together both the transmitted teachings that were preserved as an aural lineage and the revelations that were concealed as treasure at Kharchu by Venerable Rechungpa and later brought forth by Tsangpa Gyaré.
Although all the lineages of the disciples of Tsangpa Gyaré are compatible as far as his oral teachings and eight great instructions[27] are concerned, here I adhere to the Middle Drukpa tradition, which was transmitted through the nine who had the name Sengé,[28] and so forth.
With regard to the guidebook [entitled The Fivefold Capacity of Lorepa], which represents the cycle of the Lower Drukpa: The Venerable Lorepa (1187–1250) founded monasteries in the lower eastern parts of Tibet at Jang Uri and so forth, and he acted for the great benefit of living beings. His distinctive composition was entitled The Fivefold Capacity.

Among them is Trilogy on Mountain Retreat, along with its ancillary texts that bring together all useful necessities for practitioners. The Trilogy includes (i) Source of All Attributes, (ii) Liberation from the Dangerous Passageway of the Intermediate State, and (iii) Concealed Exegesis of the Adamantine Body.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Four-Armed Mahākāla in the Form Kurakma: This instruction is known as the “vitality essence” (srog thig).[29] In general, throughout India and Nepal, four-armed Mahākāla is the most renowned among all the classes of Mahākāla. Although there are many lineages that derive from different Tibetan translators, the tradition of Pelchen Ga Lotsāwa is unrivaled because he was appointed as an attendant of Mahākāla. He acquired three distinct instructions—namely, the cycle that he received from Tsami Sangyé Drak and Abhaya, the revelation that he brought forth from Śītavana, and the exegesis that he actually received from Mahākāla and his acolytes. In addition, the pith instructions that arose from his buddha mind were also innumerable.
Here [in Tibet], Pagmodrupa received these cycles of the supreme attainment from Khampa Aseng, the great disciple of Pelchen Ga Lotsāwa. Since he esteemed the Instruction on the Book with a Sash and so forth, [this form of raven-faced four-armed Mahākāla] became known as Kurakma (the one with a sash).[30] With regard to this form of the deity, there are traditions without profundity in which the deity has four or five cakras, as well as profoundly crucial teachings in which the deity is conclusively established to have two cakras or one cakra; but here, however, these are all integrated together.[31]
In olden times, the liturgical feast offerings associated with this deity were widely propagated, but its supreme rite of spiritual attainment was rare.[32] Consequently it was said:
Raven-faced Mahākāla (Bya rog ma) is extremely rare,
Although birdlike figures are widespread.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Trilogy of Spiritual Songs: The [first cycle] is known as The Spiritual Songs of the Populace and also as The Treasury of Spiritual Songs, including the [renowned] songs that concern the fettering [of cyclic existence]. In olden times, this cycle was not widely propagated in India. The books were simply kept in the two great temples of Ratnagiri and Devagiri.[33] However, when the transmission of The Spiritual Songs of the Populace had virtually come to an end, Maitrīpā (ca. 1007–1085) received them from Śabaripā and propagated them more strongly. Later, when Maitrīpā, in turn, was about to die, he foreordained that Vajrapāṇi, one of his four Indian disciples, would act for the welfare of living beings in the northern direction. The latter, accordingly, performed acts of great benefit for the sake of living beings throughout Nepal and Tibet, extensively propagating the exegesis and attainment of The Seven Sections of Spiritual Attainment, The Six Essential Cycles, The Twenty-Two (or Twenty-Four) Doctrinal Cycles of Nonmentation, and The Four Doctrines Exhorted by Injunction.[34]
This Treasury of Spiritual Songs had previously been established by Jowojé Atiśa, who delivered a lengthy exegesis on the extent of its pitfalls. When Nagtso Lotsāwa translated part of it, Dromton Gyelwei Jungné said, “What need is there for butter lamps! It seems that such words will not be of a single benefit to Tibet.” Later, Nagtso Lotsāwa went off to Chimphu and continued with the translation. On reaching the words “Just as one possessing an antipoison mantra is unharmed by poison…”[35] he ceased to translate the remainder, saying, “This will bring nothing but harm to Tibet.” It is said that he inserted the earlier part that he had translated into a stupa. {113}

This same text is also known to have been translated once in Ngari dependent on another translator, but that version was not propagated in Utsang. Later on, although it was also maintained through other lines of transmissions, principally it was bestowed upon one named Joden Ngaripa [Zhang Joton] by Vajrapāṇi from India, who prophesied, “Since you are learned in the middle way and the perspective of mind, you should master this essential cycle.” Accordingly, it was widely propagated through him.
The other two cycles from The Trilogy of Spiritual Songs [entitled The Spiritual Songs of the King and The Spiritual Songs of the Queen] were not well known in India and Nepal but propagated extensively in Tibet. It must be the case that their lineage descended from the Newar Asu alone.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Six Doctrines of the Accomplished Masters: The eighty-four accomplished masters who had attained buddhahood instructed the two ḍākinīs named Kokolilā and Dharmaviṣā in Pith Instruction Entitled Precious Garland in order that they might assist a yakṣinī of Śītavana who was exhausted by suffering. Those two instructed the yakṣinī who, by cultivating this, became a great ḍākinī of pristine cognition, capable of seeing the truth.
In general, each of those known [collectively] as the eighty-four accomplished masters, from the “holder of the sword, bull, and fish” to the “holder of the peacock and treasure vase,” attained spiritual accomplishment.[36] Having become masters of the very spiritual accomplishments that they had obtained, they were recognized as the originally present accomplished masters, eighty-four in number, endowed with occult power that was swifter than others.
As far as the eighty-four accomplished masters who are revealed in this specific guidebook are concerned, they are exclusively great masters of mantra who appeared in earlier and later times. Later, during the time of a king named Kunīka, in Kantamara, which belonged to the land of Saurāṣṭra in the west, the [aforementioned] two ḍākinīs, acting as intermediaries, actually invited the eighty-four accomplished masters. {114} They held a communal offering and sang songs of adamantine reality. The king also commissioned an image of each of them. It was in their presence that the spiritual songs they had sung were committed to writing. It is also said that later they would return there on a single occasion, until the fifth generation of kings.[37] On that last occasion, the paṇḍita Vīraraśmi is said to have encountered the accomplished masters, but he could not catch their footprints (zhabs rjes ma zin). Instead, the two ḍākinīs revealed all the oral instructions to him, so that he became accomplished, and compiled an anthology containing all the short spiritual songs together. The root verses of both the Spiritual Songs and the Precious Garland, translated by Minyak Lotsāwa Mondrub Sherab, were considered reliable by all undisputed scholars of Sanskrit texts. This lotsāwa is said to have also prepared a memorandum on the teachings of Paṇḍita Abhayadattaśrī, including the narratives and commentaries [concerning the eighty-four].[38]

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Gradual Path of Padmasambhava: This denotes the actual source of the pith instructions of the Great Perfection—the enlightened intention of Master Padmasambhava, which were transmitted from Nubchen Sangyé Yeshé (fl. ninth century),[39] their descent eventually falling to Zur Śākya Jungné (1002–1062).[40]
Leaving aside the treasure revelations of Guru Padmasambhava, within the individual ancient translations collectively known as the “[distant lineage of] transmitted teachings,” the doctrinal cycles of the Great Perfection mostly descended from Vimalamitra and Vairotsana;[41] but there are many other lines of transmission including those of Buddhaguhya, [the teachings of Anuyoga] that Nubchen adopted from Burushaski, the seven lineage holders of the Chinese Hoshang, the seven lineages of the Indian masters, and so forth.[42] It is clear, however, that this present guidebook exclusively represents the Great Perfection that descended from Master Padmasambhava.

With regard to the guidebook entitled The Collected Injunctions of the King: The means for attainment of the deity [Avalokiteśvara] and the root verses of the oral instruction were certainly composed by the religious king Songtsen Gampo. These actual transmitted teachings of sublime Avalokiteśvara and the ancestral doctrines of Tibet that are extant in the Nyingma teachings themselves were known to have been concealed as treasure by Master Padmasambhava. {115} The chronicles and most of the ancillary texts were later compiled by the treasure finders Drubtob Ngodrub, Nyangrel Nyima Ozer, and so forth.[43]

Here it may be said:
I have presented here the most astonishing anecdotes
Concerning the sources of the unstructurable one hundred and eight guidebooks—
The most profound instructions—experiences regurgitated by accomplished masters,
Extracted from the enlightened intention of the profound sutras and tantras,
Supreme path in which the conquerors rejoice.
This account includes authentic sources,
Without pursuing false reports and mundane tittletattle
That resonate simply owing to bias and fixation.
Completing these unfinished anecdotes concerning the sources of the lineage
That elucidate the actual circumstances of the one hundred and eight guidebooks
Is certainly a deed endowed with meaningful intent,
So that our positive actions might be enhanced.
In order to fulfill the enlightened intention of the supreme masters of the past,
And also benefit others who are of equal fortune,
Though it has been somewhat laborious to pen these anecdotes,
I rejoice in the thought that they are beneficial.
In particular, may those fellow travelers
On whom the definitively secret teachings of my supreme teachers are bestowed {116}
Never squander the enlightened activity of all the conquerors and their heirs!
So it was that in the presence of my venerable root guru Dorjé Chang Lhawang Drakpa, in whom all the teachers of the fundamental lineages are subsumed, I was urged to prepare this supplement to the historical anecdotes of the lineage holders of the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks.

Having presented the historical background in the foregoing chapters, in the second part of this book, Kunga Drolchok focuses on the actual experiential cultivation of the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks. The ordinary and extraordinary preliminary practices, briefly presented in chapter 7 and chapter 8, respectively, are the prerequisites for those wishing to pursue any of the main practices that are compiled in the long chapter 9. Among them, chapter 7 outlines the preliminary approaches suitable for individuals of lowest, average, and superior capacity. The endnotes here refer to the detailed and succinct explanation of these topics found in Patrul Rinpoche’s The Words of My Perfect Teacher. As before, the chapter is introduced by auspicious verses and concludes with a signature quatrain.

The essential points of the ordinary preliminary practices, which are applicable to all the one hundred and eight guidebooks without exception, are as follows:
You should gather all the objects of refuge in your teacher and resolve that they are indeed identical in essence to your root teacher. You should reflect that you have genuinely acquired the freedoms and advantages that are hard to obtain,[3] and then analyze the circumstances of death and impermanence through which you will not live long,[4] so that overwhelming sadness will arise due to disillusionment with the nature of conditioned and perishable phenomena, and fascination with the ways of this life, including the eight worldly concerns, will not arise, even in your dreams.[5] Mindful of this, you should distill your experiential cultivation, emphasizing the discipline of the self that, from the perspective of bewilderment, innately conflates the actor of past actions with the experiencer of their ripening effect. With steadfast certainty in the unfailing results of positive and negative actions, and without scorning even minutely the acceptance of virtuous actions and the rejection of negative actions, you should strive for this experiential cultivation that may be followed by persons of lowest capacity.[6] {119}

Then, after determining that all the tainted bliss and excellence of cyclic existence are imbued with suffering—mere reflections of an externally contrived happiness—you should resolve to be emancipated from all cyclic existence. Through study, reflection, and meditation, founded on the ethical discipline that you have adopted in your own mind, you should earnestly follow all the scriptures of the conquerors without exception, without partiality or bias, and practice them as they should be experientially cultivated by persons of average capacity.
Finally, you should cultivate love, understanding that all the living beings who fill space have been your gracious parents. Thereby you will acquire the higher aspiration that cherishes others more than yourself. Whatever you do, you should maintain the relative enlightened mind that is intent exclusively on the benefit of others.[7] You should abide in sky-like meditative equipoise, realizing that all phenomena of cyclic existence and nirvana, from an analytical perspective, are without any reliable inherent existence whatsoever, and also in postmeditation, realizing that all that appears manifests as a magical reflection, without inherent existence. Within that disposition resembling a magical illusion, you should earnestly and responsibly follow this experiential cultivation in all your recitations, meditations, movements, sitting, lying down, and standing, until the path of persons of superior capacity has been perfected.[8] {120}

The more advanced visualizations of the extraordinary preliminaries outlined here are practiced in the contexts of taking refuge, setting the mind on enlightenment, ritual purification, and offering the body maṇḍala. These finally enable the practitioner to settle into the physical posture appropriate for calm abiding, and thence to undertake the main practices of the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks that follow in the next chapter.

Of the two approaches leading toward the practice of the consecutively arranged one hundred and eight guidebooks, distinct and profound, the ordinary preliminaries have already been explained. There now follows an elucidation of the practical guidance that constitutes the extraordinary preliminaries.
Once the mindstream has been refined by means of the general preliminary practices in the above manner, you should imagine your residence as a pure land, with the words:

In the midst of this pure land, upon a wish-granting tree with extensive fruits and foliage that brings forth all that is desired, you should visualize in the manner of a dense cloud an assembly that includes the teachers of the fundamental lineage, an apparition that is essentially the source of all spiritual accomplishments; the meditational deities associated with the four classes of tantra, an apparition that essentially comprises the deities amassing your own past actions; the buddha bodies of perfect resource, an apparition that is essentially the nonarising buddha body of reality; the volumes of sutra and tantra, an apparition that is essentially the truth of cessation; {123} the bodhisattva heirs of the conquerors, an apparition that essentially comprises sublime beings abiding on the levels; and the doctrinal protectors and guardians, an apparition that is essentially the truth of the ten powers.[3]
You should visualize that, just like you, all sentient beings—an apparition that essentially comprises your gracious parents—respectfully seek refuge with body, speech, and mind; and then you should repeat one hundred thousand times the following words:[4]
I go for refuge to the teachers.
I go for refuge to the buddhas.
I go for refuge to the sacred doctrine.
I go for refuge to the monastic community.
I go for refuge to the deities of the maṇḍala.
I go for refuge to the doctrinal protectors.

Then, as before, you should cultivate love for the realms of sentient beings. You should repeat many times “SARVASATTVA KĀRUṆIKA—O you who are imbued with compassion for all beings!” And then,
Oh! Sentient beings are a field of suffering,
Fixated on conceptual thoughts.
To subdue their conceptual thoughts
I should attain perfect buddhahood![5]

Upon the crown of your head and those of all other sentient beings, arising from a sword marked with the letter KHAṂ that rests on a lotus and moon disk, you should visualize the transcendent lord Samayavajra, his body green in color, with one face, his two hands holding a sword and a bell, {124} embracing the female consort Samayatārā, who resembles him. Seated respectively in the adamantine posture and the lotus posture, they are united in equipoise. They each have three eyes and a tuft of matted hair, and they are each adorned with silks and precious gems, slightly wrathful in demeanor, and wearing a crown indicative of successful accomplishment. Their foreheads, throats, and hearts are marked respectively with the letters OṂ, ĀḤ, and HŪṂ, and within their hearts, light rays are diffused from the sword that is marked with the letter KHAṂ.
All the buddhas of the ten directions then appear in the form of Samayavajra:

Visualize that from the letter KHAṂ within the heart a stream of nectar is exuded, filling the bodies of the male and female deities, and that from their point of union the downpour of nectar enters through the crown of your own head. Your entire body is cleared and purified, and negative obscurations and their propensities emerge in the form of smoke from the soles of the feet, the rectum, and the urethra.

Then, after reciting one hundred thousand times OṂ ĀḤ KHAṂ HŪṂ PHAṬ SVĀHĀ, you should confess all violations of the primary and ancillary commitments of buddha body, speech, and mind with the words:

Then you should mentally tally the outer, inner, and secret [offerings].[9] That is to say, the mighty terrain of gold should be conflated with your physical frame covered with skin and blood, the substratum should be conflated with the moisture of your generative fluid, Mount Meru with the spinal bone, the root of the sacred doctrine with the mind, the four continents with the four arms, {125} the four immeasurable aspirations with the solar and lunar channels and the red and white vital essences, and the seven insignia of royal dominion with the five solid viscera and the six hollow viscera—seven along with the genitalia.[10] The seven aspects of sublime spiritual wealth are conflated with an uncultivated harvest,[11] the three naturally arising buddha bodies with the uninterrupted flow of enlightened activities, and the wish-granting cow with the uvula. The altruistic mind should be conflated with the wish-granting tree; the treasure vase with sacraments, clothing, and all resources without exception; and the channels, winds, and vital essences with the buddha bodies, pristine cognitions, and enlightened activities. Then you should make this maṇḍala offering with the words:

The seven insignia of royal dominion and seven precious things,

After reciting this, let the objects of refuge dissolve into yourself, and then with legs crossed in the adamantine posture, place your hands four finger widths below the navel in the gesture of meditative equipoise, with the two thumbs properly positioned. Straighten your spine like a stack of disks, bend your head like a swan, let your tongue rest against the palate, and fix your eyes directly in front without contrivance. Having made the body into a worthy vessel for meditative concentration, you should then practice in accordance with each of the one hundred and eight guidebooks in succession, or else you may excellently guide your mind in whichever of them you prefer, and finally that itself will lead you to the supreme path.

After completing the ordinary and extraordinary preliminaries outlined in the previous two chapters, practitioners may then undertake the main practices contained in the one hundred and eight guidebooks, which constitute by far the longest chapter of the book. These practices, collated by Kunga Drolchok, represent all eight authoritative lineages promulgated in Tibet—Nyingma, Kadam, Sakya, Kagyu, Severance and Pacification, Six-Branch Yoga, Shangpa Kagyu, and the Ritual Service and Attainment of Orgyanpa; and they derive from both the Sutra and Tantra traditions, the latter emphasizing the generation stage (bskyed rim) and perfection stage (rdzogs rim) of meditation, along with instruction on the Great Seal (phyag rgya chen po) and the Great Perfection (rdzogs pa chen po). The compiler advises, in his concluding verses, that these main practices are to be undertaken distinctly and individually in their own terms, without being intermingled. The intricate relationships between the guidebooks are set aside for discussion in a later chapter.
These one hundred and eight guidebooks are for the most part written in the terse, shorthand style of a memorandum (zin bris), for which reason, in this translation, it has often been necessary to add phrases or entire sentences in square brackets to elucidate the meaning. Such insertions derive from primary sources and related texts, found elsewhere in Jamgön Kongtrul’s Treasury of Precious Instructions, or in the collected works of their original authors. In the introductory note to each guidebook I have indicated, wherever possible, its primary source and antecedents in Sanskrit or Tibetan literature. There are also some cases where the primary sources are no longer extant outside this anthology, and others where references are made to later commentaries by Tāranātha or Jamyang Khyentsé Wangpo. Readers will note that the order in which these guidebooks are presented corresponds for the most part to chapter 9 of the Tibetan text, but there are a small number of exceptions where this sequence is at variance with that of the earlier historical chapters. Most notably, The Six-Branch Yoga of Kālacakra (40) has been moved in the Tibetan text to be guidebook number 90, perhaps in consideration of its content. But for the sake of consistency, I have followed the ordering clearly stated in the earlier chapters.

After taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: (i) You should cultivate from the heart a desire to practice the sacred doctrine by means of three considerations: the consideration that the time of death is unknown since attachment to this life resembles a bubble of water and there is no value in being attached; the consideration that there are many circumstances giving rise to death; and the consideration that nothing at all is of benefit at the time of death. This is the principal instruction that leads the mind toward the sacred doctrine.

</d>
<d e="2">
(ii) Next, you should consider the circumstances of cyclic existence, since this cyclic existence with its three world systems entirely resembles a poisonous fruit. Although it may be delicious in the moment, ultimately it causes pain and death. Anyone who has attachment to that is self-deluded. You should proceed on the path of the sacred doctrine, considering that even those who have acquired the kingship of an emperor will eventually die and perish, and they will not transcend suffering.

<d e="2">
(iii) Then you should consider that attachment to self-interest resembles the raising of an enemy’s son. Though this may ostensibly bring short-term happiness, in the long term it will be harmful. According to this example, even though there may be short-term happiness when you are attached to self-interest, in the long term it will impede the attainment of enlightenment. For there is no benefit in yourself alone attaining liberation from these three world systems, imbued with the nature of suffering. {129} Instead, you should eliminate the bewilderment of the path by intensely cultivating the following thought that easily arises again and again in the mind: “Until each of these sentient beings, all of whom have been my parents, attains buddhahood, supreme bliss, I will take birth from one aeon to the next, even in the hells!”

</d>
<d e="2">
(iv) Finally, you should consider that when you are attached to entities and symbols, this resembles grasping the mirage of water. Even though a mirage may immediately appear as water, thirst will not be alleviated because there is nothing for the mouth to drink. Even though this cyclic existence appears to the bewildered mind, when genuinely investigated, it is without inherent existence in any respect whatsoever. Therefore, when all things are ascertained to be free from conceptual elaboration, without the mind dwelling on the past, without the mind dwelling on the future, and without consciousness dwelling on the present, it is said that bewildering appearances will arise as pristine cognition and buddhahood will be attained.

Seated in an upright posture, you should count the exhalation and inhalation of breath, up to twenty-one times, without error. Phenomena appearing as perceived objects in the manner of a dream become manifest when the nature of mind has been bewildered, but there is nothing existing at all apart from the mind. After reflecting upon this, you should next inspect the fundamental state of nonarising awareness, and rest in the disposition of that fundamental state that is absolutely without inherent existence. After reflecting that objects and mind are both empty, you should then observe the essential nature and rest in the radiant clarity of the substratum, without grasping anything at all, your mind free from the diffusion and absorption of the seven aspects of consciousness.[7] Then, during postmeditation, you should regard the inhabited world and its inhabitants as a magical display.
At the outset you should meditate on the visualization of your dear mother. All the sufferings that arise in your mother’s mind will manifest within your own heart. When they have manifested, you should cultivate an intense volition toward empathetic joy. You should send forth your own happiness and merit to your mother, and immediately after that bliss and harmonious circumstances will converge, and buddhahood will simply be obtained.
Then, in the same way, you should meditate upon all sentient beings, headed by your father. When the wind is exhaled, in association with that, you should meditate that all your happiness and joy is sent forth to others, and on breathing in, that all the negativity and sufferings of others manifest within yourself.

“May sentient beings in whom attachment, aversion, and delusion arise dependent on pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral sense objects possess the three virtuous actions [of body, speech, and mind]!”[8] These words should be repeated in the course of all your daily activities.[9]
As for the sequence in which this volition is to be adopted, you should accept right now the sufferings that would otherwise be purified in the future. You should take upon yourself the sufferings of sentient beings lest they might have the effects of negative actions: harm or degeneration. {131}

In particular, if harmful human or nonhuman beings arise, you should summon them through your own negative past actions and meditate intensely on the exchanging of compassion for the suffering of others,[10] reflecting that since these beings have a negative, harming influence on you, later, after experiencing their ripening suffering, you will have compassion for them. In the case of humans and dogs, for example, you should persevere with whatever actually brings them benefit. When evil spirits are present, you should turn your mind firmly toward the thought “Let my flesh and blood be consumed!”

(iii) [As for the transforming of negative circumstances into the path:][11] When you regard the bewildering appearances of suffering that afflict the inhabited world and its sentient inhabitants due to adverse circumstances as having the essential nature of unreality, like calamities that arise in a dream due to fire and flooding, at that time you will be introduced to the four Buddha bodies—the nonarising buddha body of reality, the unimpeded buddha body of perfect resource, the nonabiding buddha body of emanation, and the indivisible buddha body of essentiality.
If you catch leprosy or other such illnesses, you should think, “If this disease were not present, I would be embroiled in the grandiose activities of this life. If I neglect to remember the sacred doctrine, this will induce me to do so! This very disease is the enlightened activity of the precious jewels!”
In brief, if you do not wish for suffering [and instead wish for happiness], you should reflect that this [suffering] is an indication that is indispensable [for happiness] and the like,[12] and you should say, “Grant your blessing that when I am ill, I may make offerings to the precious jewels, venerate the monastic community, present the torma offerings of the elemental spirts, and make a maṇḍala offering to my teacher! Also, when I recover, grant your blessing at the time of my recovery. When I am to die, grant your blessing at the time of death!” You should pray fervently in this manner, so that hope and doubt come to cease. When offering tormas to malign spirits, you should sincerely cut off hope and doubt, saying, “Thank you! May the sufferings of sentient beings ripen within me!”

(iv) [As for the integration of a lifetime’s experiential cultivation:][13] With regard to this essential pith instruction, starting now and continuing through the months and years until you die, you should strongly propel your thoughts with the power of the seed of virtuous action and the power of propulsion that increases necessities and merits! {132} You should repeatedly refine the power of familiarity! You should reject the cherishing of self through the power of eradication. And as far as the power of aspirational prayer is concerned, at the conclusion of any virtuous activity you should say, “May I not be separated from the two aspects of enlightened mind!” Through these five powers all things are integrated within the syllable HŪṂ.[14]
At times when consciousness transference is applied, when death is certain or you are afflicted by illness, you should pray, saying, “Through [the power of] the seed of virtuous activity, [the power of propulsion] that enhances necessities and merits, and [the power of] aspirational prayer, grant your blessing that during the intermediate state and in all my subsequent lives, I may refine the two aspects of enlightened mind and encounter teachers who reveal this sacred doctrine!”
You should make this aspiration, reflecting that through the power of eradication the cherishing of the physical body is rejected, and that through the power of propulsion the enlightened mind is refined during the intermediate state.
Through the power of familiarity, your former memories and deeds will, at the time of death, cause you to lie down on your right side, and you will refine the two aspects of exchanging compassion with the suffering of others, regulated according to the exhalation and inhalation of breath. Your mind should not at all grasp the state where thoughts of birth and death arise. You should die while continuing to enhance and cultivate this practice.

(v) [As for the measure of mind training:][15] All the doctrines of the Great and Lesser Vehicles are subsumed in the overcoming of self-grasping. Since mind training is an antidote, you should endeavor not to deride yourself. By training the mind well, you will delight in whatever adverse circumstances arise. In addition, with regard to the adverse circumstances of others, just as a skilled horseman does not fall from his horse even though he sways, these very adverse circumstances will gradually come to assist in mind training.

(vi) [As for the commitments of mind training:][16] You should be most effective if you do not err in the commitments, do not lapse into nonsensical talk, do not fall into one-sided bias, and remain inconspicuous.
Do not speak of the faults of others. However great afflicted mental states may be, amass all things as an antidote. Abandon self-interest. Abandon grasping things as true. Abandon enmity. Abandon bad language, without resorting to it. Abandon recrimination. Do not dig up human frailties. {133} Do not target the recitation of life-extracting mantras and so forth toward nonhumans. Abandon the transferring of your own burdensome liabilities to others by devious means. Abandon the desire for good outcomes.
If, after cultivating mind training, your mind remains obdurate, this will have the opposite effect, like carrying a scapegoat effigy to the west gate when a demon is causing harm at the east gate. Therefore, you should dispense medications directly relevant for [the treatment of] diseases. You should abandon thoughts [of schadenfreude], such as thinking that if relatives should die, you will acquire food and property; if patrons should incur a fatal disease, you will acquire an accumulation of merit; if someone of a status equal to yourself should die, you alone will acquire merit; or if an enemy should die, you will be satisfied.

(vii) [As for the precepts of mind training:][17] The precepts concerning food and clothing are observed by all yogins who are absolutely of a mind to benefit others. You should practice the exchanging of compassion with the suffering of others to overcome all deviations.
There are two tasks, one at the start and one at the end. In the mornings, you should mindfully retain this thought: “May I not be separated from enlightened mind for the duration of this day!” And in the evenings, you should make a reckoning, saying, “If I have deviated from the enlightened mind, I am contemptible.”
You should practice patience in both circumstances [of good and bad fortune]. That is to say, you should not be proud of your entourage, resources, and the like; and you should act without discouragement even in a state of extreme frailty.
You should guard dearer than life itself the commitments of the sacred doctrine in general and those pertaining to mind training. You should strive so that the three difficulties do not arise—namely, the difficulty of recollecting afflictive mental states, the difficulty of averting them, and the difficulty of eradicating them.
You should cultivate joy with respect to the three principal conditions—namely, meeting an excellent teacher, making your own mind malleable to mind training, and engaging in experiential cultivation in accordance with the ways of the sacred doctrine—and you should aspire that others also may completely possess these three principal conditions.

<d e="2">
Then there are three nondegenerations—namely, nondegeneration of devotion to your teacher, nondegeneration of enthusiasm for cultivating mind training, and nondegeneration with regard to the slightest infringements of the precepts. There are three nonseparations—namely, the nonseparation of body, speech, and mind from virtuous action.
You should be unbiased in all respects and profoundly refine mind training with respect to all things, without merely paying lip service. As for the unpleasant tasks with which you are charged, you should carry these, above all, onto the path of enlightened mind.
With regard to foremost experiential cultivation, in this present life {134} the sacred doctrine is foremost, more important than this life. Even with regard to the sacred doctrine, practice is foremost; and with regard to practice, mind training is foremost. Furthermore, for those who would engage in this training by means of scriptural authority and logical reasoning, training in a concentrated manner dependent on the pith instructions is foremost.

There are six misplaced understandings: (i) Misplaced tolerance denotes the tolerance of suffering that comes from disciplining enemies and nurturing allies while lacking the tolerance of suffering associated with the practice of the sacred doctrine. (ii) Misplaced volition denotes acting according to the volitions of this life, without engaging in the volition to practice the sacred doctrine. (iii) Misplaced savoring denotes the savoring of mundane things without savoring the sacred doctrine. (iv) Misplaced compassion denotes the cultivation of compassion for those who practice austerities for the sake of the sacred doctrine, without having cultivated compassion for those who engage in negative actions. (v) Misplaced striving denotes the engagement in the affectations of this life, paying attention to oneself and not practicing the sacred doctrine. (vi) Misplaced rejoicing denotes the cultivation of empathetic joy when enemies experience suffering and the noncultivation of joy with respect to virtuous actions.

Refinement ensues once the mind is entirely transformed in mind training itself. Ideation and scrutiny abandon afflicted mental states through antidotes, dependent on whichever afflicted mental state is most dominant. You should practice the sacred doctrine without boasting and reminding others of your own kindness.
You should not retaliate, getting upset over small matters such as when you are humiliated by others. You should not have a fickle demeanor that likes or dislikes anything for even the slightest moment. You should not hope for gratitude or verbal rewards from those you have benefited. By acting in this manner throughout your entire life, you should plumb the depths of the training in the two aspects of enlightened mind, through both meditative equipoise and postmeditation.

After you have taken refuge and set the mind on enlightenment, there ensues the particular preliminary practice:[19] You should meditate that on the crown of your own head, {135} on a seat comprising a lotus and a moon disk, your teacher is present in the form of Avalokiteśvara, and in front you should visualize your actual mother.
[In the main practice] (i) the meditation on loving-kindness is as follows:[20] You should reflect on her, starting from your conception within her womb, through to your birth, and finally to her nurturing you into adulthood. Cultivate an intense power of love and repeat the words “My mother!” again and again. You should meditate in this manner until your body hairs are moved and you are brought to tears.

(ii) If that does not happen, the meditation on compassion should follow:[21] You should sit cross-legged with your knees touching your chest, your face lowered, your facial expression sad, your hands supporting your cheeks, and your ring finger inside your mouth. With the vital points of your body in this state of distress, you should meditate strongly on compassion, and pray with a loud voice, calling out for help: “Father, Teacher! Lead this kind mother of mine now on the path of liberation!”

(iii) After reaching the limits of this meditation, you should change focus and meditate, turning toward all six classes of living beings who have been your parents. Be mindful that the gods are subject to change at death; the antigods are quarrelsome; human beings experience sorrow and endure birth, aging, and death; animals are slaughtered and coerced to work; anguished spirits are prone to hunger and thirst; and denizens of the hells are tormented by heat, cold, roasting, and burning. You should generate compassion for them.

The first method: When all the circumstances that converge are favorable—your physical body without ill health and your mind without suffering—you should reflect, “Who apart from me has happiness at the present?” At that time, you should think with a pure heart and also say aloud, “Just as I wish for happiness, so do all sentient beings also wish for that. Since each and every sentient being has been my parent, there is no one who has not helped me. Therefore, just as I have happiness, may all sentient beings who have been my mother also experience happiness!” You should determine that since this acquisition of happiness has indeed arisen through the power of past merits, if you wish henceforth also to experience happiness, you should persevere in virtuous actions; and then you should persevere in virtuous actions of body, speech, and mind.[26]

Apart from these two, nothing else could be the subject of happiness. If there were no mind, the body would be inert, like a corpse in a charnel ground, and so there would be no cause of felicity and no cause of happiness. Therefore, this perception of happiness did not arise from anywhere in the beginning, nor will it cease anywhere in the end. And if it appears to abide in the interim, it does not abide anywhere within the body, from the crown of the head to the soles of the feet. This fundamental nature in which entities such as colors, forms, and so forth are without inherent existence in all respects is termed the buddha body of reality.

(ii) Next, there is the introduction to happiness in the buddha body of perfect resource:[28] You should meditate that this nature of mind that is perceived as happiness {137} assumes the form of a white HRĪḤ, and that from its visarga the path manifests as Avalokiteśvara. Count the mantra OṂ MAṆI PADME HŪṂ as much as possible.

(iii) The third part is the introduction to happiness in the buddha body of emanation:[29] Here you should meditate that this nature of mind that perceives happiness and is diversely perceived in unceasing hues of blue, yellow, white, red, and so forth is the buddha body of emanation. After that you should say:
When happy, I dedicate this happiness as a provision of merit.
May space be filled with spiritual and temporal well-being![30]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: (i) You should cultivate a sense of contentment, without reproach, concerning those appearances that now arise commensurate with the past actions that you have previously accumulated. You should relax your mind. Without mistaking the impact of past actions, you should determine in your mind the source from which body and mind acquire modes of happiness. When this is settled, happiness arises from within.

(ii) You should not cut off thoughts that have passed. Do not welcome those that have not yet come.

(i) there ensues the preliminary practice in which the view, the meaning of the “mother”—the transcendent perfection of wisdom (prajñāpāramitā)—is introduced:[36] You should rest on the basis of the abiding aspect of the uncontrived nature of mind, and your mental faculty should not engage in any activity at all. Your mind should not ponder anything at all. There is nothing it should pursue. You should bring forth the clarity aspect of awareness. Your eyeballs should not flicker, and your gaze should be instinctively focused.[37]
It will be excellent if you can establish this and, if you can meditate, you should meditate simply on that. Meditate on that state alone! But if you are not at all inclined to meditate, you should visualize in this space in front a miniature icon, one inch in size, in which your teacher and Machik are inseparable. From that icon an [immeasurable] fiery light is diffused, unimpeded in respect of any corporeal form, and imbued with the power to pierce [earth, stone, mountain, and rock], penetrating them outward and penetrating them inward. You should meditate that it pierces your own body, from the crown of your head to the soles of your feet, penetrating it outwardly and penetrating it inwardly with the unique resonance of PHAṬ—the wrathful syllable indicative of buddha speech.[38] Having done so, you should be introduced to the abiding aspect [of the nature of mind] that is free from the dynamic of conceptual thought, resembling the centerpoint of space. [At first] this should be induced to some extent by your teacher, and then your teacher should repeatedly reinforce the view associated with this guidance.[39]
The ultimate reality associated with this practice is the intrinsic face of the mother—the transcendent perfection of wisdom[40] that is the mind of the present moment, unrecognized, free from focus, devoid of positive gods, devoid of negative demons, free from the extreme of external inspection, {139} and free from the extreme of internal inspection.[41] It is dependent on this ultimate reality that all buddhas have attained buddhahood; and it is through realizing the meaning of this ultimate reality that buddhas of the future will come forth.[42] You should experientially cultivate this!

(ii) Next, you should engage in the main practice, where the four devils are severed in the expanse of reality.[43] After making that preliminary visualization your support and having been first introduced in that manner to ultimate reality, then you should settle in the disposition of the mother—the transcendent perfection of wisdom. You should summon the consciousness that is devoid of focus, since fundamentally it is without fixed conditions, and [sever the four devils as follows]:[44]

You should sever within the disposition of the mother—the transcendent perfection of wisdom—the five sense organs and five sense objects, namely, the sights that appear to the eyes, the sounds that appear to the ears, the odors that appear to the nose, the tastes that appear to the tongue, and the tangibles that appear to the body. That is to say, as these arise on the path in your own mind, you should shout out PHAT? and let your mind rest in a relaxed state. Thereby the continuity of attachment and aversion will be absolutely severed. You should abide with clarity in your own intrinsic nature, and starkly determine that natural state. Should attachment and aversion again arise on the path, sever them with PHAT?, and settle into that disposition. Stark freedom from thought is the evidence of the successful outcome of this severance. You should experientially cultivate that![45]

Then, since they constitute the devil [of unimpeded thoughts], the plethora of fleeting conceptual thoughts of the past, future, and present will then arise on the path—including joy, fear, terror, irritation, sadness, trepidation, desire, and nondesire.

The conceptual thoughts that arise on the path are established and severed in emptiness, without training and without grasping.

Similarly, when exaltation manifests out of attachment to the sacred doctrine, there will arise on the path attachment to the notion that a teacher such as this is excellent, or a doctrine such as this is profound. You should shout out PHAT? and rest the mental faculty in a relaxed state, and that exaltation will be absolutely severed. You should recognize with clarity the nature of mind without attachment.

(ii) After you arise from that state, there next ensues the yoga of the transference of consciousness at the time of death: Here you should visualize that your meditational deity plucks the skull from your gross material body and places it on the surface of a cooking tripod fashioned of skulls. This is then filled with the remnants of your body, and through recitation of OṂ ĀḤ HŪṂ, your impure propensities are refined. Transformed into uncontaminated nectar, this is then offered to the guests—mundane beings associated with cyclic existence and supramundane beings associated with nirvana, headed by Maitreya. {141} Finally, a tube of light with a hook emerges from the heart of Maitreya, and within it you yourself in the form of Khasarpaṇi shoot upward like a comet and are transferred to Tuṣita, where you listen to the sacred doctrine in the presence of Maitreya.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: (i) You should assume the seal of body that is to be secured with the sevenfold posture of Vairocana.[55] Also, the seal of speech that is to be recited is lucid in its disposition, without the movement of wind—that is to say, without purposeful exhalation or purposeful inhalation of breath.

(ii) Next, the seal of mind that is to be cultivated does not pursue thoughts of the past. You should forsake notions of the past. You should not welcome those of the future, and you should cut off their association with the mental faculty.
Right now, you should apprehend the natural state of awareness, without pondering likes and dislikes, and then directly and without wavering, just like an expert swordsman engaging in battle, you should watch with mindfulness from a distance, without wavering anywhere from the disposition in which the mind is perfectly tensioned; and after that you should settle your mind fixedly in this unbewildered essence.
At intervals you may then let your mind relax wherever it alights, without purposefully holding it and without purposefully letting it go, and without turning away from its disposition of bliss, just as a skilled person can nurture a bull without seeking to do so.[56] You should not be confused by any thoughts, nor should you strive toward them. You should dispatch them, vanquished, into the expanse {142} without grasping.

(iii) Finally, just as a bird flying directly from a boat, without finding a perch to alight or any support apart from merely seeing the sky above and the sky below, will land naturally upon that very boat, in the same way, wherever the mind becomes diffused, you should cut off its diffusion, since it has been nurtured without contrivance. When this has been determined, you will establish with the conviction of recognition that the diffusion [of mind] implicitly abides, timeless in an unfabricated state, naturally alighting right where it is, through its modality of rest.[57]

First, the meditation is as follows: You should meditate on that which you have achieved, because you have at least acquired a human body as a physical support. You should meditate on preparing for death, because you will assuredly die.
You should meditate on the unfailing nature of past actions and their results. You should be certain about the impact of past actions on account of their benefit, their swiftness of time, their inalienable nature, their frequency, their causal basis, and their examples.
You should meditate that you will soon die, that internal phenomena are impermanent, that external phenomena are impermanent, that they are certain to die, that the actual time of death is uncertain, that death cannot be averted by any means whatsoever, that there is an impermanence of temporal instants, that there is an impermanence of the serial continuity [of thought], that there is no one to increase the life span, and that death will come due to its decay.

There is no one who will not die. Death is the reality for sentient beings. You should examine the impermanence of outer phenomena—whether in the corpses of a charnel ground, the shade of a tree, or the constellations of the sky—and be certain that the results of past actions are unfailing. For this reason you should forsake negative actions and adopt positive actions. You should meditate that you are saddened by negative actions {143} and that you have confidence in virtuous actions. You should be saddened by nonvirtuous causes with results that bring forth suffering.

You should consider that there are four types of result: (i) the ripening results of past actions, (ii) results corresponding to their causes on the basis of past experience, (iii) results corresponding to their causes on the basis of past activity, and (iv) predominant results.[59] You should consider whether or not you can tolerate the results of negative ripening at the time when it is actually experienced—the strongest sort of negative ripening being rebirth among denizens of the hells, the middling sort being rebirth among anguished spirits, and the weakest sort being rebirth among animals.

First, the meditation is as follows: You should meditate on the defects of cyclic existence, the defects that the five acquisitive aggregates generate,[60] and the sufferings of human beings, the sufferings of the antigods, and the sufferings of the gods. Sentient beings encounter unpleasant circumstances—birth, aging, sickness, and death. They are without pleasant circumstances, and although they seek their desired outcomes, they do not find them. You should meditate that the five acquisitive aggregates are imbued with suffering—they are conceived in the womb; they are born; they experience the sufferings of childhood, the degeneration of aging, and the unpleasantness of ill health, death, and separation from places, wealth, friends, and the physical body.
The gods experience the signs of death and the signs of impending death. You should meditate on the defects of meditative stability in the higher world realms of form and formlessness, the degeneration of meditative stability, the necessity of lapsing into the lower world realm of desire, the nature of bewilderment, the bewilderment of thoughts, the bewilderment of sexual union, the uncertainty of birth, the uncertainty of friendships, the uncertainty of past actions, and the defects associated with the past actions of each of the six classes of sentient beings.

First, the meditation is as follows: You should meditate on the compassion that is skillful means, the emptiness that is discriminative awareness, their basis that is immeasurable, their essential nature that is enlightened mind, the compassion that is the natural condition of this birth and the natural condition of other births, and finally the need to repay kindness owing to gratitude for all sentient beings and the loving-kindness that seeks happiness through the repayment of gratitude. You should repay the kindness of those who have benefited you, those who have afflicted you with suffering, and those who have given ineffectual assistance. You should wish that human beings should not have to bear their sufferings and that they should be separated from their sufferings. {144} You should cultivate the enlightened mind, exchanging self with others. You should pray that they will wish to attain buddhahood. You should cultivate the certainty that discriminative awareness is emptiness, that both the external inhabited world and the mind are without inherent existence, and that subtle and gross particles are each imbued with conscious awareness.

After you have taken refuge and set the mind on enlightenment, (i) there then ensues the base of ethical discipline:[62] Just as in the past the teaching of the Buddha and his entourage emphasized the mendicant ordination, the full monastic ordination, and the precepts of individual liberation,[63] you should also aim to act accordingly. You should pledge the vows in that manner and carefully keep in mind the precepts of individual liberation, just as they have been upheld by the monastic preceptors and masters of the past.
Each day should comprise six sessions of practice, and during each of these sessions you should recollect in your mind the gross precepts according to the Ground Rules of Monastic Discipline and its synopses, and the downfalls that are mentioned in the Analyses [of monastic discipline for monks and nuns]. Thereby you should examine whether or not your own mind has been tainted by the generic downfalls and the specific subsidiary downfalls.[64] If it is untainted, you should cultivate empathetic rejoicing. But if it is tainted, you should confess those transgressions that are to be confessed, secure those vows that are to be secured, and reconsecrate those items that are to be consecrated. This confession should be undertaken in a timely manner. You should purify your own mind during each session with the fervent thought that your transgressions will not recur in the future.
Just as the elder sages of the past depended on the precious Buddhist teaching that is the source of spiritual and temporal well-being, and on the monastic community endowed with ethical discipline; and just as they trained in the precepts, including the monastic discipline that is the root of the Buddhist teaching; {145} so you yourself should emulate them and train in that manner.

(ii) Subsequently, with regard to study, reflection, and meditation:[65] You should recognize that this ethical discipline was experientially cultivated by all mendicants of the past and is itself the foremost of experiential cultivations. Through this, fortunate beings have attained liberation. You should adopt this monastic support that is revered by all. Anyone desirous of liberation who engages in this ethical discipline and also encourages others to engage in it should take as their witnesses those who are skilled in the ethical discipline of individual liberation. For those maintaining the pure unbewildered precepts of monastic discipline and all the bodhisattva heirs of the past have, without destitution, considered their own body and life, which are hard to dispense on behalf of sentient beings, as a means of generosity.
You should cultivate from the heart the unbiased, impartial love that understands the six classes of living beings to have been your parents. You should practice tolerance toward anyone whomsoever, without enmity. You should be mindfully aware that all sorts of criticism are incurred absolutely due to your self-grasping, and you should cultivate the particular antidotes. You should insistently refine in succession whatever directly and indirectly benefits others, along with forsaking negative deeds and adopting positive deeds according to past actions and their results, as well as loving-kindness and compassion, the integration of calm abiding with higher insight, and so forth.

After you have taken refuge and set the mind on enlightenment, then (i) with regard to relative appearances:[67] The abiding modality of cyclic existence is imbued with suffering, like the revolving buckets of a waterwheel, and its apparent modality is imbued with the negative actions of your own suffering that you have incurred, like a blind person roaming in a rugged wilderness. By employing the watchman of acute mindfulness during six sessions of practice, day and night, you should, in the aforementioned manner, also confidently inspect the steadfast realm of quiescent nirvana, {146} the citadel of all blissful appearances, the excellent fields of the mature roots of virtuous action, and the array of the groves encompassing spiritual and temporal well-being. In this way, clear mindfulness of happiness and suffering, the rejecting of negative deeds and accepting of positive deeds, will surge within you.
At this juncture, if your mind is afraid and saddened at the modality of cyclic existence and becomes insistent on and attached to the abiding modality of nirvana, you may deviate toward the perspective of the pious attendants and hermit buddhas who maintain the Lesser Vehicle. But in this fearful dangerous pathway, there is no one among all the sentient beings of the three planes of existence who has not been your parent. How, then, is it permissible to cling shamelessly to your own happiness, as if setting aside the kindness of your actual parents, including all those who have acted in turn as your parents? Rather, you should strongly cultivate the following notion: “I should assign my own body, speech, and mind to engage in positive and virtuous actions, without interruption, day and night, to quell the sufferings of all sentient beings of the six classes who wander in this existence, along with the causes of their sufferings!” You should cultivate compassion for all unprotected sentient beings. You should practice loving-kindness, undertake acts of benefit, reverse negative actions, and train in the manner in which loving parents act toward their child. You should apply yourself to the teaching in a timely and inconspicuous manner, and obstruct the dangerous pathways of sheer doubt whereby this practice might itself become a causal basis for lackluster, narcissistic praise.

(ii) Finally, with regard to ultimate truth:[68] You should place your mind without hesitation in the natural state where the nature of existence and quiescence abides intrinsically and timelessly in sameness. You should dispel obstacles at will, without even the slightest trace of hope or doubt, and beneficially reflect upon and recite the following prayer: “By the power of whatever roots of virtuous action of body, speech, and mind that I possess, may all sentient beings, equal to space, who have been my mother, come to acquire provisional happiness and conclusive buddhahood!” It is said that an exemplary instance of this meditation reaching the crucial point will occur if you are without repulsion or attraction,[69] even when sandalwood paste is smeared to the right {147} and dog’s dung to the left.

You should examine the abiding nature of appearances and emptiness. Here, appearances denotes this phenomenal world that arises diversely without impediment. Emptiness does not denote the emptiness that ensues when a vase has been broken, nor the emptiness that ensues when a vase is empty of being a blanket, nor the emptiness of sheer nothingness, like the horns of a hare, but rather intrinsic awareness, empty of inherent existence, at the very moment when things appear. Relative truth is empty, in the manner of a magical display. Ultimate truth is empty of essential nature, in the manner of space. In brief, however things appear, they are without true existence even to the extent of a hair tip. This is not the emptiness of the cessation [of appearances], and it is not the emptiness of things that have been fabricated.

(i) The inception of one-pointedness when the mind is not diffused toward unobscured radiance or circumstantial objects is termed calm abiding, {148} and (ii) its nonconceptual nature, devoid of [dualistic] recognition, like the circle of the sky, is termed higher insight. (iii) Composure then ensues, untouched by the intellect that adheres to objective referents. And then, during postmeditation, experiential cultivation entails the four sorts of physical activity,[75] with an awareness that has the modality of a dream or a magical display.
When hairline distinctions concerning existence and nonexistence forcefully arise, you should gradually refine your skill, and it is said that thereby you will come to encounter the face of the abiding nature that is untainted by stains of conceptual elaboration due to the eight extremes.[76]

(i) After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment, (ii) you should visualize a flat stone and position your body upon it. Thereupon king spirits, attachment spirits, spirit lords of the soil, and cannibal spirits will assault you from the four directions, each carrying a hammer with which they beat your body, covering some two-thirds of its surface with drops of your flesh and blood. Then these king spirits, attachment spirits, spirit lords of the soil, and cannibal spirits will cut your body with knives.
Attachment, hatred, and delusion are then generated by a king spirit, an attachment spirit, and a nāga. You should visualize that by eating your own flesh, you summon the attachment spirit before you and cultivate compassion. The attachment spirit eats the putrefying flesh of your body, and she is satisfied with that. The mind of that attachment spirit then emerges from her heart in the form of a vital essence. Exiting from her right nostril, it settles in the sky in front. Then visualize that your own mind extends upward, also in the form of a vital essence. As the mind of the attachment spirit vanishes farther and farther into the sky, your own mind in the form of its own vital essence is absorbed into the left nostril of the attachment spirit, causing her body to vanish clearly into space. Then you should rest in that disposition.
After that you should offer your body to the king spirit in the same manner as before, and then summon the harmful nāga spirit in front. Visualize your torso as its palace, and visualize your stomach, blood, and serum as a lake, {149} with writhing snakes and also worms, spirit lords, tadpoles, and so forth moving around the small and large intestines, and the five solid viscera headed by the heart as five precious gems, their impurities and filth as perfume and incense.

(iii) You should then visualize that all the negativity and obscurations of all sentient beings headed by that nāga emerge, like a hide of leather being scraped with a knife, and that these are ripened within yourself. In exchange, imagine that all your own virtuous actions and happiness are ripened in them.
In this practice you should make the visualizations instantaneously, determine that this is the unique path, concentrate your volition, and suppress conceptual thoughts. You should not esteem any path other than this violent antidote. Today if the self perishes, today buddhahood may be attained. Tomorrow if the self is rendered nonexistent, tomorrow buddhahood may be attained. Once the self has been rendered nonexistent, buddhahood will be attained.

Among the four deities of Kadam, the guidebook concerning Munīndra is as follows: After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment, in front you should visualize the transcendent lord Munīndra, the master of the Buddhist teaching in this field, upon a lion throne with lotus and moon cushions. His body resembles a polished golden door bolt, blazing with light, wearing the three religious robes.[80] His hands are in the gestures of earth-touching and meditative equipoise, his legs in the adamantine posture, and he is adorned with the major and minor marks, diffusing rays of light throughout the ten directions.
You should compose your body, and then, as for the methods of settling the mind, you should engage in calm abiding with a support, calm abiding without a support, calm abiding with a partial support, or calm abiding with a perfect support.[81] Then you should apply the nine phases of calm abiding—namely, (i) mental placement, (ii) total or perpetual placement, (iii) definitive or integrated placement, (iv) intensified placement, (v) controlling, (vi) calming, (vii) intensified calming, (viii) perpetual or one-pointed placement, and (ix) placement in meditative equipoise.[82]
After that, you should meditate on higher insight, and make the following into the path by means of meditative equipoise: (i) the nonself of individual persons, (ii) the nonself of phenomena, {150} (iii) the nonself of the causal basis, and (iv) the nonself of the essential nature.[83]
Through postmeditation you should then cut off superimpositions: the nature of the causal basis is nonexistent, the nature of fruition is nonexistent, the nature of dependent origination is nonexistent, the nature of sense objects is nonexistent, the nature of subjective consciousness is nonexistent, the nature of all things is nonexistent, the nature of entities is nonexistent, the nature of nonentities is nonexistent, the nature of the inhabited world is nonexistent, and the nature of sentient beings is nonexistent.
Here I have elucidated in writing the list of visualizations
Concerning guidance on Munīndra, in whom all buddhas are gathered.
This is the instruction whereby the supreme liberation
Integrating delight and joy is swiftly traversed.

Among the four deities of Kadam, the guidebook concerning Acala is as follows: After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment, you should then be seated with the vital points of your body composed, and vibrantly visualize the body of the deity Acala, emerging instantaneously from the syllable hūṃ. In this context, his body is blue, with one face and two arms, the right one brandishing the sword of pristine cognition and the left one holding an adamantine lasso while forming the gesture of menace at the heart. The hair of his head, beard, and eyebrows is reddish-yellow, blazing upward; and he has three flashing eyes, red and round. His teeth bite down on the lower lip. He is adorned with precious gems and the eight great nāgas,[85] and wears a skirt of tiger skin. His right leg is drawn in and the left leg extended, trampling upon Vināyaka, the king of impediments, who has an elephant’s nose, diffusing and absorbing many lesser wrathful emanations, and present within the blazing fire of pristine cognition.

In his heart, upon a lotus and sun cushion, there is the syllable HŪṂ surrounded at its extremities by the ten-syllable mantra.[86] Fierce flames emerge from it, like the conflagration at the end of an aeon of destruction, blazing with seven defining characteristics—namely, (i) heat, (ii) harshness, (iii) wrath, (iv) sharpness, (v) power, (vi) strength, and (vii) swiftness.
At first, the HŪṂ and its mantra garland {151} burn noisily within the fire. Then more intensely, the curving flames fill the butter lamp inside your body and red flames dart from the nine orifices of your body, like the tongue of a snake. Finally, the reddish glow permeates all the pores of your body. It mingles with the tented aureole of fire on the outside, and from that it blazes, flickering as far as a double arm span or bow span, an earshot, and a yoking distance.[87] You should visualize that this fire expels and scatters the venomous enemies of the Buddhist teaching and the most powerful mistresses of disease and plague to the extremities of the ocean. Then you should recite the [aforementioned ten-syllable] mantra.

After that, you should visualize a solar disk arising from the syllable maṃ within the right eye. It beholds the buddha fields and all phenomena of cyclic existence and nirvana that arise dependently through causes and results. You should visualize a lunar disk arising from the syllable a within the left eye. It beholds all phenomena as emptiness, nonapprehensible in all respects. Then within the space between those two eyes, another sparkling eye emerges. Visualize that it lucidly beholds the inseparability of skillful means and discriminative awareness, the coalescence of calm abiding and higher insight, the inseparability of eternalism and nihilism and of being and nonbeing, and so forth. Then remain in one-pointed meditative equipoise.
If you then practice consciousness transference, you should unite the upper and lower winds within the vital points of your body, and then meditate on the vibrant meditational deity Acala. With the mantra OṂ CAṆḌA MAHĀROṢANA HŪṂ, visualize that all phenomena are merely echoes. With the syllable PHAṬ, visualize that the nature of your mind resembles a fading echo, reverberating off a cliff.
At the time when the spiritual mentor Nezur Yeshé Bar passed away,[88] he recited the mantra OṂ CAṆḌA MAHĀROṢANA HŪṂ, and after sitting a while, he uttered PHAṬ, and departed with his eyes staring upward and wide open. The crown of his head exuded steam like that of an open teapot.

Among the four deities of Kadam, the guidebook concerning Avalokita is as follows: After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment, you should visualize yourself instantly as sublime Avalokita, with one face and four arms, seated upon a lotus and moon cushion. At the aperture formed by the pore of his body that is named “sunlight”[90] there are many million trillion bodhisattvas and ten thousand golden mountains, each of which has twelve thousand peaks, adorned with many arrays of gemstone mansions, groves, and ornaments, resonant with the sound of the sacred doctrine—the six-syllable mantra OṂ MAṆI PADME HŪṂ.
Also within that pore, inside the cavity of an inner pore named “power of the conqueror,”[91] there are eighty thousand divine golden mountains with cliffs of gemstone, trees, food, and clothing—all materialized from the nature of the gods; and there are practicing bodhisattvas chanting the sacred doctrine of the six-syllable mantra.
After the visualization of that pore has passed, you should then imagine that inside the cavity of another pore named “great medication”[92] there are eighty thousand million trillion bodhisattvas who have just set their minds on enlightenment; and eighty thousand mountain peaks of diamond, silver, gold, sapphire, ruby, emerald, and crystal. The melody of the sacred doctrine of the six-syllable mantra emerges from the symphony of gandharva music; and those bodhisattvas who have initially set their minds on enlightenment are imbued with emptiness and signlessness. You should say, “Alas, what suffering there is! Protect us from birth, aging, sickness, death, and so forth!” Then take your place alongside them, with your legs crossed in the adamantine posture, your body straightened, and mindfulness clearly established.

When the visualization of that pore has also passed, you should imagine that inside the cavity of another pore named “king of diversity”[93] there are many hundred thousand million trillions of hermit buddhas, revealing diverse miracles, blazing with fire, and causing downpours of rain; and there are one hundred thousand kingly mountains fashioned of the seven kinds of precious gems, {153} from which grow wish-granting trees—with trunks and roots of pearl, leaves of silver and gold, and flowers of crystal—that bring forth all that is desired. Many ornaments and garments of kāshikā linen spill forth from them. On mountains such as these the hermit buddhas are seated, and the twelve branches of scripture are also revealed in the resonance of the six-syllable mantra.[94]
Last of all, inside the cavity of another pore named “king of victory banners”[95] there are eighty-four thousand gemstone mountains, with wish-granting trees and as many sandalwood and coral trees; and in a mansion of blazing gemstones, the body of the Tathāgata is seated, facing toward Jambudvīpa, teaching the sacred doctrine, and expounding the six transcendent perfections in the resonance of the six-syllable mantra.
In brief, within a mere pore, there are present as many buddhas and bodhisattvas as there are within the extent of the three times, and the melodic symphony of the six-syllable mantra resonates. The million trillion rays of light that they emanate then emerge from the billion apertures formed of their pores. In order to purify the propensities of the six classes of beings, without being separated from the disposition of your one-pointed focus, you should then recite OṂ MAṆI PADME HŪṂ as often as you can.

She is green in color, with a golden face and two arms, holding a lily stem, her legs in the bodhisattva posture; {154} she is adorned with gemstones and silk, her aureole formed of the moon, her hair in curls, and she has a smiling facial expression. You should visualize that from the pores of her body emanations of Tārā resembling herself are diffused, permeating space and dispelling the sufferings of the six classes of beings along with their causes, establishing them in states of bliss. You should then recite OṂ TĀRE TUTTĀRE TURE SVĀHĀ as often as you can.

After taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment, it behooves worthy recipients of the teachings to be untainted by three flaws that resemble (i) an upturned vase, (ii) with a leaking base, and (iii) a bad odor.[100] [Those listening to the teachings] should be without the five stains of pride, disinterest, distraction, mental inertia,[101] and sadness.[102] They should turn away from misunderstandings concerning meanings, words, and symbols, and from objects of misapprehension.[103] They should cultivate the power of the four modes of faith—conviction, longing, confidence, and incontrovertibility.[104]

In the chapter on the attributes of the way of mantras that concludes the vehicle, there are six parables of compatibility, starting from the parable of handcrafted [buddhahood] and continuing through to the parable of [a disciple who became accomplished despite misinterpreting] the mantra MARAṆA JAḤ. There are thirteen parables of incompatibility, starting from the parable of [Atiśa finding] no [suitable teacher of mantras] in Tibet and continuing through to the parable of Apo [passing the buck and] saying he did not know.[155]
In the chapter on the need to please the root teacher of the path, there are seven parables of compatibility, starting from the parable of [an irrigation pool] fed by a mountain spring and continuing through to the parable of Atiśa [encountering Ḍombipā who was] of an inferior social class.[156] There are six parables of incompatibility, starting from the parable of [a child who claimed not to be inferior to his] paternal ancestors and continuing through to the parable of [a brahmin who obtained the accomplishment of] swift-footedness [but trivialized it out of faithlessness].[157]

In the final chapter on the dedication of merit, there are nine parables of compatibility, starting from the parable of the [perfected workmanship] of a goldsmith or silversmith and continuing through to the parable of [a boatman crossing a river] with a safety towrope.[158] There are ten parables of incompatibility, starting from the parable of [a passing] comet [that self-destructs] and continuing through to the parable of offering someone a pull rope [after weighing him down with an anchor].[159] {159}

In the synopsis of all [these topics], there are [five] parables, including (i) the conclusive investigation of enemies [such as the aforementioned incompatible factors], (ii) [the balanced raising of a grain container from] its four corners, (iii) [the accurate counting of Bon ritual ingredients required] for a single doughball, (iv) [the persistent effort required when] rubbing sticks to make fire, and (v) [the exemplary pursuits of] Sadāprarudita and Subhadra.[160]
Having cultivated an understanding of these parables, this guidebook is a form of mind training for the sake of persons of the three capacities.

As to the first group of four, these are respectively the spheres of (i) the inconceivable external array of the universe in general; (ii) the world of Patient Endurance within the trichiliocosm in particular; (iii) Tibet, the Land of Snows, more particularly; and (iv) the northern direction of Uru, most particularly.
As to the first of these spheres, this denotes the complete defining characteristics of the celestial palace, which is square with four gates and so forth. When this is respectfully observed, the white syllable OṂ appears at its zenith, white MA appears at the eastern gate, yellow ṆI appears at the southern gate, red PAD appears at the western gate, green ME appears at the northern gate, and blue HŪṂ appears at the nadir. At the center, within [the palace], there is a seat comprising a one-thousand-petal white lotus and a crystalized moon disk.[163]
As to the second sphere [the world of Patient Endurance within the trichiliocosm], this denotes the great sage Vairocana in the form Himamahāsāgara, yellow in color, who has the appearance of the buddha body of emanation, teaching the sacred doctrine.[164]
As to the third sphere [in the case of Tibet], this denotes Avalokiteśvara in the form Jinasāgara, with one thousand arms and one thousand eyes, seated in the [adamantine] posture.[165]
As to the fourth sphere [the northern direction of Uru], this denotes standing Padmapāṇi in the form of a crystal youth, according to Dromton. His right hand counts the beads of a crystal rosary and his left hand holds a crystal staff surmounted by a one-thousand-petal white lotus, at the center of which the Great Mother Prajñāpāramitā appears with Śākyamuni on her right, Jowo Atiśa in a not dissimilar form on her left, and on the one thousand petals are seated the one thousand buddhas of the Auspicious Aeon.[166] {160}

As to the second group of six spheres, these comprise the six meditational deities: (v) The Great Mother Prajñāpāramitā is yellow in color, with four arms, her first right hand holding a nine-pronged vajra, her first left hand in the gesture of meditative equipoise, her second right hand holding a rosary, and her second left hand holding a scripture. Her legs are in the adamantine posture, and she has gemstone ornaments. (vi) Śākyamuni appears in the Māra-subduing form, with his right hand in the earth-touching gesture and his left in the gesture of meditative equipoise. (vii) Avalokiteśvara has one face and four arms. (viii) Tārā is peaceful and greenish-yellow in color, and she liberates from [the fear of] sandalwood forests. (ix) The dark green and wrathful form of Tārā, with four arms, holds a knife and skull, ḍamaru and khaṭvāṅga, and has bone ornaments; the hair of her head is yellowish-red; her left leg is extended and upright, in a dancing posture. (x) Acala has one leg extended, the other drawn in, trampling upon Gaṇapati; he is wearing an elephant hide, holding a sword and a noose, the hair of his head yellowish-brown; and he is adorned with snakes.[167]

The five spheres of the teachers are those of (xi) the father Jowo Atiśa; (xii) the son Dromton; and (xiii–xv) the three deities Maitreya, Mañjughoṣa, and Vajradhara, who are respectively surrounded by the lineages of extensive conduct, profound view, and blessed experiential cultivation.[168]
(xvi) As for the sixteenth, this sphere denotes [Samantabhadra], the buddha body of reality, blue in color, with one face and two arms, forming the gesture of meditative stability, radiant and perfect in enlightened attributes and divine form. All the fifteen other spheres have an external divine form and an inner celestial palace. Within the heart of the sixteenth you should meditate and visualize with one-pointed focus that there appears a yellowish-white extremely minute sphere combining both subtle energy and mind, along with the modalities of the supporting palaces and supported deities. When this is diffused, it encompasses space. When it is absorbed, it assumes a form the size of a split pea; and around it, about the thickness of a white mustard seed, is the self-manifesting sphere of enlightened mind, diffusing five rays of light.[169]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: (i) You should then meditate in a single sitting upon the eight phases [of clear realization] that derive from the regent Maitreya in the paradise of Tuṣita, source of happiness. These phases comprise the three understandings; the four applications; and the fruition, which is the buddha body of reality.[172] Having established this methodology to constitute the vitality of the path, you will have confidence in it.
(ii) In addition, the sixteen volumes of Extensive Mother: The Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines were brought forth from the underworld of the nāgas, source of resources.[173]
(iii) When its content is analyzed in detail, it comprises the aforementioned eight phases as well as the [subsequent] division into six summations and the division into three summations,[174] along with the distinctions between analysis and meditative cultivation, and the distinctions between scriptural authority and logical reasoning established by the learned paṇḍitas of Bengal, source of awareness.
(iv) The sequence in which the path is cultivated—the sequential phases of application, including the four grades of ascertainment[175] and so forth—originated from the southern land of Beta, source of enlightened attributes.
(v) The sequence of the teaching and the compilation of the transmitted teachings, in which each of the six transcendent perfections is revealed to subsume within it all six, is the lineage originating from the speech of the ḍākinīs of the western land of Oḍḍiyāna, source of blessings.
(vi) In addition, with regard to the latter, the [related instructions on] pacification of all sufferings of mental anguish without exception originated from the isle of Viśvakoṭacandana, source of wonder.[176]
In sum, {162} from the perspective of analysis, the transcendent perfection of wisdom is ineffable, unthinkable, and indescribable. It is of the essential nature of space, without arising and without ceasing. And from the perspective of meditative equipoise, you should comprehend the perceptual range of pristine cognition—particularizing intrinsic awareness—that is termed the “mother of the conquerors of the three times.”

On the crown of the head, you should visualize your actual teacher, imbued with radiance, upon a lotus, sun, and moon cushion that rests on the stem of a lotus. Stacked above and below are the four tiers of the teachers of the lineage. Dampa Gyagar’s body is reddish-brown in color, the hair of his head bristling like [the leaves of] an elm tree,[178] overwhelming phenomenal existence. In all, there are fifty-four male and female accomplished masters. [To their rear] are the eleven teachers of dialectics and Sanskrit grammar, [headed by Nāgārjunagarbha]. [To their right] are the eleven teachers of the dynamic subtle energy [of the father tantras, headed by Buddhaguhya]. [To their left] are the eleven teachers of the blissful experience [of the mother tantras, headed Saroruhavajra]. [In front] are the eleven teachers of the symbolic [Great] Seal [headed by Saraha]. [In the intermediate directions] are the ten teachers who confer the introduction to awareness [headed by Sukhamahāsiddha]. [Above their heads] are the thirty-six teachers endowed with wondrous sky-faring ability, and [above their heads in turn] are the twelve teachers who are sugatas in steadfast meditation.[179] All of them are naked, clad in space, without the elaboration of costumes.
You should visualize that rays of light emerge from your own heart and are presented as offerings. You should pay homage to those teachers and go for refuge to them. Pray for their blessing, and then [dedicate your merits of the past, present, and] future in all respects.[180]

Then [as for the consecrations of the four cakras]: You should visualize that from OṂ [in the crown cakra], the seed syllable indicative of buddha body, a white [stream of] generative fluid flows down and fills the body. From ĀḤ [in the throat cakra], the seed syllable indicative of buddha speech, a red stream of generative fluid freely flows down and fills the body. From HŪṂ [in the heart cakra], the seed syllable indicative of buddha mind, a blue stream of generative fluid spreads forth and fills the body with bliss. From HRĪḤ [in the navel cakra], the seed syllable of buddha attributes, a stream of generative fluid emerges in diverse colors, transforming your body and mind into stark emptiness.[182]
Then, in order to carry the introduction [to awareness] on the path, you should cross your legs in the adamantine posture, with your hands in meditative equipoise, your spine straight, your neck [slightly] bent, your shoulders stretched out [like the wings of a garuḍa], your lips and teeth in their natural positions, and your eyes focusing on the tip of your nose.[183] Concentrate your eyes, nose, and mind together, and rest in their natural state, without conceptualizing. [Thereby nonconceptual pristine cognition will abide in its own intrinsic nature.] During postmeditation, all that appears is fictitious. You should make this determination [counterintuitively], having dried things in water![184]
Then you should count the eight-syllable mantra with intense longing: OṂ ĀḤ HŪṂ GURU SIDDHI HŪṂ. You should visualize that your actual teacher does not vanish [from the crown of your head] and that the blessings [of nondual bliss and emptiness] enter into you. At the session’s end you should say, “May I become accomplished!”[185]

Here in particular you should visualize your teacher as the buddha body of perfect resource, adorned with the major and minor marks. The other steps are the same as above. You should recite the vowels and consonants four times. Then, as before, sights become deities, sounds become mantra, and thoughts become the four pristine cognitions.[186]
[With regard to the four empowerments that are associated with the four cakras:] At the crown of your head, the seed syllable indicative of your teacher’s buddha body manifests as white Vairocana, in union with female consort. At the throat, the seed syllable indicative of his buddha speech manifests as red Amitābha, in union with female consort. At the heart, the seed syllable indicative of his buddha mind manifests as blue Akṣobhya, in union with female consort. At the navel, the seed syllable indicative of his buddha attributes manifests as yellow Ratnasambhava, in union with female consort. These are seated in the adamantine posture upon a lotus and moon cushion. The four empowerments should then be similarly received.[187]
You should regard subtle and gross conceptual thoughts with the five eyes. That is to say, you should regard such thoughts with the closed eyes of a turtle; you should regard them with eyes like cowrie shells, slightly open and squinting; you should regard them with eyes like a crescent moon, somewhat open; {164} you should regard them with eyes like kidneys, slightly open with admiration; and you should regard them with eyes like the full moon, open wide. You should bunch these conceptual thoughts together and smash them, and thereafter you will be entirely without thoughts.[188] Then you should pray as before, reciting OṂ ĀḤ HŪṂ GURU SIDDHI HŪṂ.[189]

The particular distinction here is that you should visualize your teacher naked with bone ornaments, and then recite the vowels and consonants four times. Then visualize the essential nature of sense objects—sights, sounds, [and thoughts]—as your teacher; and senses as the meditational deities—nonarising, nonabiding, nonceasing, nonexistent, empty of sights, empty of sounds, and empty of thoughts, without duality.[190]
With regard to the visualizations associated with the four empowerments, in order that beings might attain liberation in that state devoid of inherent existence, there are five gazes: the eyes should be turned downward in the gaze of pious attendants, upward in the gaze of hermit buddhas, to the zenith in the gaze of male bodhisattvas, to the left in the gaze of female bodhisattvas, and straight ahead in the gaze of sugatas. At those times, the relaxation of your mind should be maintained just the same as in the aforementioned austerity practices [and mind training]. Then recite OṂ ĀḤ HŪṂ GURU SIDDHI HŪṂ.[191]

The particular distinction here is that you should meditate on the teacher wearing indeterminate costumes. You should then recite the vowels and consonants as before, and as a result, sights, sounds, and thoughts will manifest as the teacher’s buddha body, speech, and mind, without duality of bliss and emptiness.[192]
As for the particular visualization of the four empowerments, within the four cakras you should visualize the sugatas, and receive the empowerments from them in no particular order.
[As far as the practical application of meditative equipoise and postmeditation is concerned, Kamalaśrīvajra has said, “One who relies on beneficial things that facilitate the path] should fear the persistent grasping of entities. This is the crucial point that topples the established order in a carefree manner.”[193]
[As far as the modes of conduct are concerned,] there are five sitting postures—namely, the cross-legged adamantine posture, the semi-cross-legged posture, the crouching posture, the leaning posture,[194] and the posture of royal ease. There are five sorts of movement: walking, dancing, running, jumping, and resting. There are five standing postures—namely, rising, half standing, standing, getting dressed, and stepping forward. There are five ways of reclining—namely, lying down on the right side, lying down on the left side, lying down on the back, lying down on the front, and covering the head. {165} You should bunch all of these modes of conduct together, destroy and smash them. After crushing them, you should rest in a relaxed and naked state.[195]

The particular distinction here is that you should visualize your teacher as the supreme buddha body of emanation, wearing the costume of a monk, and then recite the vowels and consonants four times. Thereupon, though sights, sounds, and thoughts may appear, they will be without inherent existence, like the vanishing of clouds in the sky or the melting of ice on an ocean.[196]
As for the four empowerments, the particular visualization of the four cakras is as follows: In the crown cakra, Vairocana dissolves and vanishes into his female consort. This ḍākinī of the buddha family is white in color, holding a wheel and a skull of blood, and she overwhelms extraneous appearances with her charisma. In the cakra of resources [in the throat], Amitābha dissolves in the same manner as before into his female consort. This ḍākinī of the lotus family is red in color, holding a lotus and a skull of blood, and she brings extraneous appearances under control. In the cakra of the phenomenal wheel [in the heart], Akṣobhya dissolves in the same manner as before into his female consort.

This ḍākinī of the vajra family is blue in color, holding a vajra and a skull of blood, and she longs for disciples who have been gathered within her power.

This ḍākinī of the ratna family is yellow in color, holding a gemstone and a skull of blood, and she is satisfied by the mental faculties and mental phenomena of others who are faithful.[197]
You should then reflect, “Henceforth I am not to view my own self-interest rather than the interests of other sentient beings. I should not have that view! Perish the hope of having that view! If I were to have that view, I would incur negativity. Henceforth I am not to meditate on my own self-interest rather than the interests of other sentient beings! I should not meditate on that! Perish the hope of meditating on that! If I were to meditate on that, I would incur negativity. Henceforth I am not to act out of my own self-interest rather than the interests of other sentient beings! I should not act in that manner! Perish the hope of acting in that manner! If I were to act in that manner, I would incur negativity. Henceforth I am not to accomplish my own self-interest rather than the interests of other sentient beings! I should not accomplish that! Perish the hope of accomplishing that! If I were to accomplish that, I would incur negativity.” In this way, you should crush the grasping and clinging that ensnares you!

Next, with regard to the assessment of the three sorts of austerity, this comprises the three examples, the three sorts of person, the three times for austerity, and the three methods for the conferral [of empowerment].[199]
The three examples are as follows: You should cut off exaggeration and deprecation in the manner of a pious attendant. You should practice alone in the manner of a hermit buddha. {166} And you should experientially cultivate the interest of others, in the manner of a bodhisattva.[200]
There are three sorts of persons—namely, [mendicants], who abandon worldly activities; [householders], who give no space for worldly activities; and [ascetics], who do not stockpile necessities.[201]
With regard to the three times for practicing austerities, the optimum period for maintaining them is three days, the mediocre is two days, and the worst is one day.[202]
As for the methods of conferring empowerment, you should not enter into experiential cultivation of the higher paths [of empowerment] without having completed the lower paths.
As for the fruition that is free from activity, the best achieve this goal within this very lifetime, the mediocre do so at the time of death, and the worst are reborn in accordance with their former talents through the intermediate state.[203]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: By understanding that conditioned phenomena are impermanent and that contaminated phenomena are imbued with suffering, which is the guidance of the path enunciated in the first turning of the doctrinal wheel, you should have confidence in the unfolding of actions and their results, the virtuous actions to be adopted, and the negative actions to be rejected. And then with absolute certainty that [specific] results will emerge in respect of the causes you have investigated, you should insistently pursue abandoning negativity and practicing virtue for the sake of yourself and others. You should abandon bad associates who confuse actions and their results, and you should attend upon spiritual mentors who reveal the unfailing relation between actions and results. You should strive on the path of study, reflection, and meditation. You should cultivate empathetic joy for those who have acquired a place for spiritual attainment in a land that supports the adopting [of virtuous actions] of body, speech, and mind. You should engage in acts of renunciation and remedial acceptance with respect to minor offenses. It is important to purify your own mind through discipline.

Then, in a grass hermitage free from distractions, as in the mountains of Prānta that were praised by the Conqueror, with a mind disillusioned with cyclic existence, you should focus your mind inwardly, with inspiration that is unattached and does not cling to anything at all. Place in front whatever you can find as a support for mental focus—a stick, a pebble, or a flower, for example—as enunciated in the second turning [of the doctrinal wheel]. {167} To impede the flow of thoughts that are diffused toward objects, your mind should be one-pointed, your body should settle into the adamantine posture, your hands should be placed in the gesture of meditative equipoise, your spine should be straightened, your eyes focused on the visualization support, your neck bent, and your teeth and lips not quite touching. You should not pursue any circumstantial object whatsoever. You should remain clear and vivid and be absolutely determined to sever the tree of subjective conceptual thoughts with the sword of discerning discriminative awareness.
Then you should rest in the disposition where all things are empty and without self. Never submit to sluggish inertia but let your awareness flourish. Do not relish the taste of quiescent and blissful nirvana. You should absolutely and completely banish self-grasping, the primary downfall. Do not objectify any determinations concerning the pretentious abyss of eternalism and nihilism, and dispel the darkness of deepest inertia that resembles entering a marmot’s burrow. You should remain confident and undisturbed, subsuming naturally radiant intrinsic awareness within your own mind. Do not adopt an intellectually fabricated understanding that would establish from the perspective of logic that things are empty. Without determining any distinction between object and subject or between enemy and friend, you should absolutely resolve that whatever arises is the natural form of emptiness.
Next, you should analyze the testimony of your own experience and, without perpetuating that, train in natural liberation, just as the knots of a snake are naturally uncoiled. As far as conduct during postmeditation is concerned, without distinguishing between meditative equipoise and postmeditation, you should guard the prescribed boundaries according to the teachings of the Conqueror, as if they were your own eyes. You should insistently pursue an expansive view and precision of conduct.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: At the outset [of this practice], you should recite the offering prayers. In that connection, the quintessential point of the Ornament of Clear Realization is that you should practice with reference to the three aspects of objective understanding on the path of provisions.[206] Through the four essential applications[—namely, warmth, peak experience, acceptance, and supremacy[207]—] you should then practice the six transcendent perfections that constitute the path.[208]
As far as the attainment of the armor of aspiration is concerned, there are six transcendent perfections, preceded by the taking of refuge. They comprise (i) the three aspects of generosity,[209] (ii) ethical discipline that has abandoned the attentiveness of the pious attendants and hermit buddhas, (iii) tolerance of unpleasant phenomena, (iv) perseverance that longs for the assembly of the Great Vehicle, (v) meditative concentration that is unadulterated with other vehicles, and (vi) wisdom that dedicates merit toward enlightenment. You should retain these without conceiving them in terms of the threefold interaction of subject and object. In addition, the provisions associated with the [ten bodhisattva] levels entail ten corresponding transcendent perfections through which the levels are chiefly refined.[210]

The quintessential point of the Ornament of the Sutras of the Great Vehicle is the experiential cultivation of the conduct of a bodhisattva. To that end: (i) You should act with resolve on the impure levels (ma dag sa’i mos spyod). (ii) You should have higher aspirations for the pure levels (dag pa sa’i lhag bsam). (iii) You should experientially cultivate the conduct of a bodhisattva. (iv) You should cultivate devotion for the attributes of the Great Vehicle with the thought of engaging in acts of benefit. (v) You should teach the sacred doctrine acquired for the sake of others with a disposition that does not mistakenly long to find it for your own sake. (vi) You should realize the actual nature of phenomena for your own sake during the main practice. (vii) You should teach the oral instructions and further instructions for the sake of others. (viii) You should skillfully maintain conduct for your own and others’ benefit during postmeditation. (ix) You should frequent the pure levels, and (x) you should engage in conduct that is extensive and profound.[211] The advantages are that by having experientially cultivated the attributes of the Great Vehicle, the ailments of afflicted mental states will be calmed. If you practice this, you will acquire power over enlightened attributes. If you hold it in mind, all sorts of external benefits will emerge, resembling the wish-fulfilling gem.

The quintessential point of the Distinction between Phenomena and Actual Reality is that the appearances of your own mind as conceptual thoughts associated with the eight aspects of consciousness arise when reality is not recognized, {169} but these are without true existence.[212] In order that these thoughts might not manifest, you are introduced to the appearance of genuine reality. Afflicted mental states develop due to fixation on bewildered thoughts that appear as both the internal mind and the external inhabited world with its inhabitants. But when the awareness that impedes conceptual thoughts and dualistic perceptions abides in reality, the nonconceptual pristine cognition then ensues. During postmeditation there is an absence of fixation and appearances arise like a magical display.[213]

The quintessential point of the Distinction between the Middle and Extremes is that once the mind has renounced mundane concerns, you should dedicate enlightenment for the sake of sentient beings. Commencing with the path of provisions and the path of preparation, on the first bodhisattva level magical display is attained. On the eighth bodhisattva level causally concordant conduct is attained,[214] while on the tenth bodhisattva level and on the buddha level the transcendent perfections are attained.[215] In terms of skillful means, you should resolve that self and others are the same. And then, in order to actualize nonconceptual pristine cognition, you should attain mastery in the meditative stability of the other transcendent perfections [in addition to skillful means],[216] and then practice the ten facilitating modes of doctrinal conduct,[217] along with unwavering calm abiding and unerring higher insight.[218]
The Supreme Continuum of the Great Vehicle establishes the entrance and support [for the path] since that is mentioned in its concluding verses of dedication.[219] The quintessential point is that this text is the essence of the four preceding doctrines of Maitreya that have already been explained.
This treatise explains the presence of natural luminosity in detail, and by means of seven adamantine topics[220] and nine examples.[221] After determining that innate pristine cognition, tarnished by the dualistic perceptions of the subject-object dichotomy, is the naturally radiant intrinsic awareness, free from grasping, your awareness should then obstruct the dangerous passageway of eternalist views by eliminating nihilistic views. Since the nature of mind is unchanging like space, the seed of buddha nature is uncovered by the afflicted mental states that emerge from inauthentic conceptual thoughts. To fortunate persons who receive this introduction, this actual book of Maitreya refines the instructions by pointing out the path.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should engage with precision in experiential cultivation of the ground that is the middle way, adopting virtuous actions and rejecting nonvirtuous actions with respect to mere conventional appearances. You should engage in meditative equipoise that is free from the eight extremes, since there is no ceasing, no arising, no nihilism, no eternalism, no coming, no going, no diversity, and no unity. In postmeditation you should cultivate for a long period of time the view that appearances are like a magical display. When you are familiar with this practice, your mind may experience great bliss and your body hairs may stand on end, just when you hear the word emptiness. Your eyes will be disturbed by tears, and you will awaken to the enlightened heritage of the Great Vehicle. Manifestly realizing the crucial points, you will be liberated from the afflicted mental states that are to be abandoned. You will refine the experiential cultivation that is devoid of conceptual elaboration, without grasping and without clinging, and in that case, you need not emphasize engagement in virtuous actions of body and speech. If, however, you have not yet attained stability in the truth devoid of conceptual elaboration, you should continue to emphasize engagement in virtuous actions of body and speech.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment, [you should understand that] clinging to bewilderment as true is imaginary. The inauthentic imaginary nature includes all aspects of clinging to the subject-object dichotomy as entities, in the manner in which a multicolored rope resembles a snake.
All things from physical forms to omniscience in respect of which the imaginary nature engages in grasping constitute the dependent nature that is contingent on causes and conditions. Although these phenomena diversely appear, they are simply realized to be inauthentic. Like that multicolored rope, all dependent phenomena from physical forms to omniscience are conceptualized in accordance with past actions and afflicted mental states.
The naturally present original reality {171} that permeates all these [dependent phenomena], in the manner of the space that permeates the multicolored rope, constitutes the incontrovertible consummate nature and the unchanging consummate nature, which respectively denote the two buddha bodies of form.[224]
The factors conducive to enlightenment, the truth of the path, and all things from physical forms to omniscience that are conventionally imagined are empty of defining characteristics. Although they are indeed established in terms of the three essenceless natures, when investigated, there is no dualizing perception apart from the mind, and so apparent phenomena are assigned to the dependent nature, and reality itself to the consummate nature. The latter alone denotes the immaculate and spontaneously present, unique reality.
So it is that imaginary things resemble the horns of a hare because they are empty of their own inherent existence. Dependent things resemble a magical display because they are empty of the imaginary. Consummate things resemble space because they are empty of both the imaginary and the dependent. All conventional appearances associated with the imaginary and dependent natures exist relatively but not ultimately. The consummate reality exists ultimately but is neither identical in nature with nor different from relative appearances. It denotes the great middle way that is devoid of all extremes.

After you have taken refuge and set the mind on enlightenment: For those of highest capacity, their own intrinsic awareness in an instant innately and directly perceives the generation and perfection stages of meditation as primordially perfect. For those of average capacity, the glow of the nonarising fundamental nature unimpededly manifests, fresh and without effort, as the deities. For those of inferior capacity, the uncontrived essential nature of meditation forcefully emerges. For those of the worst capacity, the graduated path [of mind training and so forth] is established as mainstream, and the buddha body, speech, mind, and pristine cognition are established as the four adamantine realities. In this last context, [there are four sessions of practice of which] the first two respectively concern (i) the eradication of hostile and obstructing forces and (ii) the acceptance of fortunate disciples.[226] {172}

This denotes the Unelaborate Practice and the Four-Stage Yoga, which are meditations of the perfection stage pertaining to the generation stage of three deities: Red Yamāri, Black Yamāri, and Vajrabhairava.[227]
With regard to the deity Red Yamāri, the Unelaborate Practice has six lines of transmission—namely, (i) the tradition of Chel Lotsāwa that makes [the realization of] freedom from extremes into the path; (ii) the tradition of Chak Lotsāwa entitled the unique visualization that enters into the path of luminosity; (iii) the tradition of Lowo Lotsāwa that details the Unelaborate Practice dependent on the adamantine verses of Virūpa; (iv) the tradition of Dānaśīla that applies the path of the Great Seal; (v) the tradition of Tarpa Lotsāwa that constitutes a close lineage in respect of the Unelaborate Practice; and (vi) the oral tradition of upper Nyang that derives from Kanaśrī.[228]
In the case of the Four-Stage Yoga, there are also six approaches—namely, those of Chel Lotsāwa, Chak Lotsāwa, Lowo Lotsāwa, Dānaśīla, Tarpa Lotsāwa, and Ārya [Kanaśrī]. So, altogether there are twelve traditions [pertaining to the deity Red Yamāri].
Similarly, with regard to Black Yamāri, there are the four lineages of Ra Lotsāwa, Kyo Lotsāwa, Zhang Lotsāwa, and Sakya, each of which has both an exegetical tradition based on the translation of the Tantra of the Black Slayer of Death alone and a tradition of pith instruction.[229] On Black Yamāri there is also the text of Devākaracandra concerning the four seals.[230]
On Ṣaḍānana (the “six-faced form”of Black Yamāri), there are the two traditions of Vajrahāsya’s Array of the Staircase Differentiating the Stages and the [extant] Indian manuscript. Also on Ṣaḍānana,[231] there are four summations of the visualization, and by way of commentary, four supplements and four steps of guidance, making eight [commentarial traditions] altogether.
As for Vajrabhairava, there are four distinct traditions—namely, The Profound and Extensive Training by Ra Lotsāwa; The Mental Focus on the Horns of Bhairava by Kyoton Lotsāwa; The Inner Yoga of the Communal Offering: A Vase of Nectar by Zhang Śāntipa; and Nāropā’s pith instruction entitled The Erect Penis [of Bhairava], which represents the Sakyapa school.[232] In brief, the methods of guidance on all those aspects of Yamāntaka [including Black Yamāri, Ṣaḍānana, and Vajrabhairava] number twenty-four.

[The guidance concerning] the four seals of Vajrārali, which are similar in approach, are also subdivided into twenty-four, according to [distinctions in] the bliss of the deities. When these are added together with the previous [twenty-four], the traditions of guidance number forty-eight. With the further addition of the related guidance on Vajrapāṇi in the form Mahācakra, they number forty-nine, and fifty with the further addition of The Coemergent Union [of the Great Seal] that represents the corresponding tradition of experiential cultivation.[233]
When all these are summarized, the visualization of Vajrabhairava should be clear, lucid, and unsullied. The deity arises without obscuration and is endowed with the three pure essences [of channels, winds, and generative fluids]. He has an extremely wrathful dark blue buffalo head, with three eyes that are wrathful, mottled, and round, and light-blue horns—wrinkled at the base, bent in the middle, and pointing sideways at the tip. His uppermost [central] face is bright red, shining red, like one hundred thousand rising suns, and it loudly bellows the laughter of HA HA! Above that is the yellowish-red face of Mañjuśrī. The eyebrows [of Vajrabhairava] are black and darting. His eyes are long and bright. His nose is tall and high, and his lips are slightly snarling. His right and left faces, along with his arms and legs and his mighty wrathful body, are variegated as a rainbow body, shimmering as a mass of light.
This visualization should be established and then examined.

At that time, by the cultivated power of meditative concentration, the mind delights and there arises a state of joy and happiness, similar to the cheerful perceptions of human beings. You should remain in the coemergent union of this generation stage, which is associated with one-pointed unbewildered meditative concentration, and also indeed with emptiness, sameness, ineffability, and nonconceptualization.
Then, from within that disposition where the appearances of the three world systems arise as deities, you should engage in the perfection stage of meditation. On the two horns’ tips there are generative essences, bright and shining. Like threaded webs, these converge at the throat, after which they dissolve into Mañjughoṣa within the heart. You should meditate that the body is filled with bliss and that there is no grasping. If this is further explored, you should engage in the coemergent union of the perfection stage, which concerns the luminous mind, the lucid winds, and the unsullied state transcending common objects. This completes the guidance of the first session.

The second session concerns the pathway of Guhyasamāja, through which fortunate disciples are accepted. The relevant texts comprise the Root Tantra of the Secret Assembly itself and its six exegetical tantras—namely, the Subsequent Tantra of the Secret Assembly, the Compendium of the Adamantine Reality of Pristine Cognition, the Tantra Requested by Four Goddesses, the Adamantine Garland, the Tantra of the Ornament of the Nucleus of Adamantine Reality, and the Tantra Requested by Devendra.[234] These are further supplemented by the Tantra of the Victory of Nondual Sameness.
The practice of the four-session yoga is based on the distinction of the introductory narrative of the root tantra, which describes the thirty-two-deity assemblage of Akṣobhya. In addition, the body maṇḍala also may be presented based on the distinction between the twenty-five-deity assemblage of Akṣobhya according to Śāntipā; or the nineteen-, thirteen-, {174} or nine-deity assemblages; or else on the basis of the five enlightened families or the single enlightened family.
The tradition of Buddhajñānapāda then changes the principal deities based on the Subsequent Tantra of the Secret Assembly, extrapolating that there are nineteen deities in the assemblage of Mañjuvajra,[235] and identifying them with the nineteen deities in the assemblage of Avalokiteśvara.
Although there are no more than five transmissions actually revealed on the basis of the Root Tantra of the Secret Assembly, there are six ancillary traditions revealed on the basis of the Subsequent Tantra of the Secret Assembly. Among the latter, Yangonpa’s Three Crucial Points of the All-Pervasive Coemergent Union That Brings Forth the Miraculous Ability of the Esoteric Instructions has primacy, and there are eighteen further traditions stemming from that.
Above all, with regard to The Five Stages of the Secret Assembly,[236] you should examine and cultivate the exegetical tradition of Nāgārjuna, and the tradition of the paṇḍitas that establishes conviction in the words of the Tantra of the Secret Assembly, stemming from Āryadeva and Candrakīrti, as well as the experiential cultivation that accords with the tradition of the yogin Kusāli, and the two traditions of direct guidance that were imparted by Mataṅgi to Tilopā and Nāropā. This should be combined with Lochen Rinchen Zangpo’s [translation of Candrakīrti’s] Clarifying Lamp commentary.

In general, there have been ten [important transmissions of The Five Stages in Tibet], starting with the three scrolls that were separately presented by Samayavajra, Vajrāsana, and Devākaracandra. The fourth was Patsab Lotsāwa’s Eight Sacral Aspects, and the fifth was his Analytic Meditation. The sixth was the guidance on the Five Stages that Jowo Atiśa received from Śāntipā; the seventh was Nāgabodhi’s tradition of the Five Stages, which Dampa Gyagar imparted to Ma Lotsāwa; the eighth was the instruction through which Paṇchen Śākyaśrī of Kashmir guided Chel Lotsāwa; the ninth was Tarpa Lotsāwa’s close lineage of the Five Stages; and the tenth was Chak Lotsāwa’s annual cycle of the Five Stages.
In The Five Stages Perfected on One Seat, which is a distinctive doctrine of Marpa[237] based exclusively on the Indian texts, headed by those of Nāgārjuna and his disciple, there are two aspects—the direct guidance that is pointed out, and the black guidance that is discussed—or four with the additional explanation of the two gates—the upper gate and the lower gate. The practices pertaining to the upper gate include modes of guidance that are gradual and all-surpassing. The practices pertaining to the lower gate are sixfold, including both the traditions of Nāropā and Nigumā. The implementation of the forceful method is revealed separately as a sealed injunction, and it is not enunciated in this common presentation.

With regard to the deity Mañjuvajra, it is by means of Buddhajñānapāda’s Vital Essence of Liberation that the Subsequent Tantra of the Secret Assembly is fully understood. {175} This work integrates the luminosity of The Five Stages, condensing the final dissolution [of luminosity during the generation stage] in the yoga of higher absorption [during the perfection stage]. Because this work is connected as the vital lifeline of [Yangonpa’s aforementioned Three Crucial Points of] the All-Pervasive Coemergent Union, the eighteen derivative instructions are similar in their experiential cultivation of composure and similar in their meditative concentration, and so forth.[238]
When the visualization is established, the deity [Akṣobhya or Mañjuvajra] has three faces and six arms. His legs are in the adamantine posture, and he is embraced by a female consort resembling himself. On examination, you should visualize that his primary face is bright blue, shining blue, with black darting eyebrows and sparkling eyes that stare. His nose is blue and pointed. His mouth is partly blue, partly red. His teeth are slightly snarling. Visualize that his demeanor is partly wrathful, partly alluring. The face to the right is bright white, shining white; and the face to the left is bright red, shining red. He is irresistible to behold, with an alluring demeanor, radiant with the major and minor marks. That completes the second session.

There are three primary traditions—one revealed from the tantras, one extrapolated through commentarial writings, and one that appeared to the ḍākinīs.
According to the Root Tantra of Cakrasaṃvara, the veritable offering of Kulikā comprises the hexahedron of the letter E, which embodies the five syllables of great emptiness, and the letter VAṂ, which embodies the six syllables of the vital essence.[239]
This text also alludes to the blossoming of the lotus of the profound abodes—outer, inner, and extraneous—and the experiential guidance of the view that regards the stroke of the letter a, the ashé (Tib. a shad), as the naked intrinsic face of Vajravārāhī.[240]
It then describes Cakrasaṃvara in coemergent union, in whom the profound coemergent union previously mentioned in the context of the father tantras and the channels, winds, and vital essences elucidated in the context of the mother tantras are combined. Through this profound essential that relates to both the father tantras and the mother tantras, the coemergent union that directly sees the buddha body of reality is disclosed.[241]
Also, the text explains that just as the one hundred sacral aspects are mentioned in the father tantras, the empty vital essence is also said to comprise one hundred syllables.[242]

Contrary to that presentation [of the Root Tantra], in the Supreme Tantra of Clear Expression, the syllable vaṃ embodies the five syllables of great emptiness, and the syllable e embodies the six syllables of the vital essence.
When these letters are subsumed in the imperishable [vital essence] of the heart cakra, there also emerges the union of Heruka {176} and Vajravārāhī that derives from the Tantra of the Emancipation of Śrīheruka, the face-to-face union of Vasantatilaka mentioned in the Tantra of the Adamantine Sky-Farers, the innate state of rest that derives from the Tantra of the Habitual Practice of the Yoginīs, the perfect elucidation of the five stages mentioned in the Tantra of the Emergence of Cakrasaṃvara, the acquisition of the three yogas mentioned in the Tantra of Great Magical Emanation,[243] the perfection of the four pristine cognitions mentioned in the Buddhakapāla, the acquisition of the four yogas mentioned in The Four Adamantine Seats,[244] the acquisition of the six branches mentioned in the Ocean of Sky-Farers, the guidance on the path of the Great Seal mentioned in the Coalescent Union of the Four Yoginīs, and the profound path of guidance mentioned in the Adamantine Garland.
Next, there are the [commentarial writings] on these tantras, which include Luipā’s Perfection Stage of Great Yoga, Kṛṣṇacārin’s Vital Essence of Spring,[245] Ghaṇṭāpāda’s Five Stages,[246] Kukuripā’s Extremely Unelaborate [Perfection Stage], Saraha’s Introduction to the Innate, Āryadeva’s Guidance on the Four Yogas, Śabaripā’s Six-Branch Yoga, and Ratnarakṣita’s Practical Guidance on the Five Stages.

The female consort Vajravārāhī may have an assemblage of thirty-seven female deities; or fifteen, thirteen, nine, seven, or five female deities; or else she may take the form Sahajā.[247]
For each of these deities there are different perfection-stage practices. For example, there are three perfection-stage practices dependent on the Innate White Cakrasaṃvara, according to Jowo Atiśa, Abhaya, and Paṇchen Śākyaśrī of Kashmir;[248] and there are other perfection-stage practices dependent on Innate Blue Cakrasaṃvara, according to Ghaṇṭāpāda, Prahevajra, and Abhaya.[249]
Lastly, as for the aural lineage of the ḍākinīs, there are modes of experiential cultivation that arise from thirty-seven distinct methods of guidance in the context of the mother tantras, including the texts retained by Tilopā and those of Nāropā, Nigumā, and Sukhasiddhi.[250]
As above, there now follows the standard description of Cakrasaṃvara: When the visualization is established, Cakrasaṃvara has four faces and his right leg is extended. He is embraced by the female consort Vajravārāhī. On examination, the face to the rear is bright yellow, shining yellow, diffusing a yellow light. His eyes are wide and slightly quivering, and he has an extremely sensuous demeanor. This completes the third session.

The primary texts are the Root Tantra of Hevajra, the Two-Chapter Tantra of Hevajra, the Tantra of the Adamantine Tent, the Tantra of the Vital Essence of Union, and the Ārali Trilogy that Gayādhara received from the yoginī of Siṅghala. {177} The last mentioned are also called the “three lesser tantras,” and they are arranged as a supplement to the experiential cultivation of the higher empowerments.
In general, the practices of the perfection stage derive from all these tantras, but [more specifically] there are sixteen methods of guidance that derive from the Two-Chapter Tantra—namely, (i) the guidance of the three purities;[251] (ii) the guidance of the three coemergent states; (iii) the continuous guidance of the profound and illuminating river; (iv) the guidance on the view that equipoises existence and quiescence;[252] (v) the guidance that introduces the meaning of the four innate states; (vi) the guidance on secret conduct with respect to the central channel by means of coercion; (vii) the guidance combining three concealed exegeses of the introductory narrative; (viii) the guidance on the six-branch yoga—composure, concentration, breath control, apprehension [of the complete deity], subsequent recollection, and meditative stability; (ix) the guidance on the three aspects of mingling, transformation, and discriminative awareness; (x) the guidance on the means of separation from attachment;[253] (xi) the guidance of the alluring messenger; (xii) the guidance on the balancing of the generation and perfection stages; (xiii) the guidance on the perfection stage in which the body appears as a deity; (xiv) the guidance on the final thoughts of clinging to the generation stage; (xv) the attainment of the three roots combined; and (xvi) the guidance on devotion and the vitality of the teacher.[254]

Once the perfection stage has been entirely comprehended, all the profound crucial points of the entire generation and perfection stages revealed in the Tantra of Hevajra are arranged as the path of the four empowerments; and the [related instruction on the] ground, path, and fruition greatly surpasses the sixteen just-mentioned modes of guidance. These are said to include the path and fruition that are the nondual enlightened intention of the Tantra of the Vital Essence of Union,[255] the infinite yoga of the vital essences derived from the Tantra of the Adamantine Tent, the twenty-nine visualizations of self-consecration according to the Tantra of the Vital Essence of Union,[256] and the inestimable yoga of the subtle vital essences that derives from the three subsequent lesser tantras.
Although there have been an inconceivable number of masters in India and Tibet who commented on the meaning of the Tantra of Hevajra, their subcategories may be condensed in a single tradition; and when they are examined in detail from the perspective of the pith instructions, all these modes of guidance are combined together. Here the experiential cultivation refers to the experiential cultivation of glorious Hevajra himself, the lord of all the tantras.
According to the essence of this text, {178} it is taught that on the basis of the guidance on Hevajra, the gist of the three other foregoing sessions of practice [on Vajrabhairava, Akṣobhya, and Cakrasaṃvara] may be subsumed herein. In that case, it entails four aspects—namely, (i) the view that concerns the three essential natures, (ii) the philosophical tenet that cyclic existence and nirvana are indivisible, (iii) the practice that resurrects at the time of death, and (iv) the fruition that is the innate deity.

Among these aspects, the three essential natures—the imaginary, the dependent, and the consummate—are to be known respectively in terms of (i) the objects of meditation, all the apparent aspects of consciousness that are coarsely visualized; (ii) the act of meditating, the skillful means of the symbolic generation stage concerning the deities, their faces, arms, [and so forth]; and (iii) the [fruitional] entry into the state of pristine cognition. That is to say, once the path of provisions according to the [tantras of] unsurpassed yoga have been perfected through this spacious, uncontrived path, you will acquire the fruition that is free from the ordinary body, speech, and mind.
It is taught that the very perception that nakedly realizes the intrinsic face of the inseparable generation and perfection stages is also a magical vision of skillful means, applied on the basis of the three essential natures. For when the form of Hevajra with eight faces and sixteen arms is visualized, that denotes the dependent nature. The consideration of oneself as ordinary, with one body and two arms, denotes the imaginary nature. The natural expression untainted by the stains of positive and negative attributes denotes the consummate nature.
When this same analysis is applied to the fundamental state of the abiding nature, the consideration of bewilderment in respect of the innate nature of mind denotes the imaginary nature. The freedom from extraneous conditions that characterizes the innate state denotes the dependent nature. The innate state that has never been tainted by bewilderment denotes the consummate nature.
Having definitively understood this, you should visualize the attributes of innate pristine cognition where the generation and perfection stages are indivisible as the deity and meditate on this coalescent essential nature that is empty of the imaginary.

When this visualization is established, you should visualize yourself as blue, resembling the color of Hevajra’s body and primary face. The right face is white, and the left one is red. The two remaining faces are black, and the upper face is smoke colored. He has twenty-four eyes, and the crown of his head is marked with the crossed vajra. He has sixty arms, four legs, and is in union with his female consort. His essential nature, endowed with three imperishable pure essences [of channels, winds, and generative fluids], resembles the reflection in a mirror. {179}
On examining each of these features in turn, you should consider and meditate that the primary face is the color of turquoise, the right face is the color of the moon, the left face is the color of coral, the upper face is the color of smoky clouds, and the remaining faces are smoky colored. His body is adorned with the skulls of an elephant, horse, donkey, ox, camel, human being, śarabha deer, cat, earth deity, water deity, fire deity, wind deity, moon deity, sun deity, Yama, and Vasudhara. Beneath his two extended right legs, he stands upon a mat formed of Brahmā and Rudra, and his two left legs, which are drawn in, stand upon a mat formed of Indra and Upendra. In his lap there is the female deity Nairātmyā, holding a knife and skull. Her calves entwine the male consort, and she is of youthful appearance. Both the male and female have a crown of five dry skulls. They have a necklace of fifty skulls—dry in the case of the female and moist in the case of the male. Their hands are adorned respectively with six and five hand emblems, and they wear skirts of tiger hide.

At this time, guided by the appearance and emptiness of the deity’s body, the mind is at ease, as if meeting an old acquaintance—it is joyous and happy; and when you settle in that state, like the moon’s reflection in water, this is meditative concentration. By experientially cultivating that without dichotomy between equipoise and postmeditation, all appearances are then known to be the natural glow of the mind—devoid of appearance as a divine form, emptiness, sameness, or nonconceptuality.
When this examination has been perfected, you should not consider anything at all. You should not think, examine, or conceive of anything at all, but relax in that effortless disposition. After establishing mind training in the view that is beyond the intellect and free from extremes, you should experientially cultivate this in an integrated manner: OṂ ĀḤ HŪṂ KĀYA VĀG CITTA VAJRA SVABHĀVĀTMAKO’HAM. The entire environment becomes the celestial palace. All its sentient inhabitants become male and female deities. This intrinsic nature is spontaneously actualized.

With regard to the guidance on buddha body and the guidance on buddha speech, this entails the yoga of breath control, including gentle breathing, moderate breathing, and strong breathing. {180} This practice should precede the branch of meditative concentration.
As breath is inhaled, you should recite OṂ. As it is held within, you should recite ĀḤ. And as it is exhaled, you should recite HŪṂ. In the practice of moderate breathing, after inhaling as long a breath as you can, you should push out the abdomen as far as possible and settle both the upper wind and the lower wind directly there. After that, you should inhale, fill the channels, and disperse or breathe out, emitting the breath like an arrow.
Next there is the yoga of the vital essence, whether independent of the cakras or dependent on the cakras. Here you should rely on the crucial points of the pith instructions. According to this Hevajra tradition, the conclusive path of the secret empowerment entails experiential cultivation of the eighteen yogic exercises focusing on the fire within the channel of fierce inner heat.[257] You should also be encouraged [by restrictions on] diet and regimen, and combine all the crucial points for achieving success, dispelling obstacles, and so forth.
In addition, you should experientially cultivate the Yogic Exercises of the Thirty-Two Activities[258] and the ninety-six that may be practically applied either sequentially, in reverse order, or randomly.

Then, in the context of the path of the third empowerment, there is also the four-stage adamantine reality of the Wheel of Time. There are twelve [distinct] traditions of guidance that have contributed to the vitality of this path, namely, those of the four earlier translators—Gyijo, Dro, Ra, and Chodrak of Dingri; those of the four who appeared in the intervening period—Menlung Guru,[259] Tarpa Lotsāwa, Orgyanpa Rinchen Pel, and Vibhūticandra; the first, second, and final transmissions of Śabaripā; and the short lineage of Vanaratna, which was the last to reach Tibet.[260]
This [instruction] is a condensation of the profound crucial points contained in six different cycles of the six-branch yoga according to Buton Rinchen Drub and twenty-six different cycles of the six-branch yoga maintained among the Sakyapa and so forth, which, according to Lama Dampa Sonam Gyeltsen, were previously nonexistent modes of experiential guidance.[261]
The teaching traditions that expound the two branches entitled apprehension [of the entire deity] and subsequent recollection should be discerned separately in their [appropriate] instructions of direct guidance.
Directly combining all these crucial points, this practice should be properly completed in a single sitting of meditation.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should visualize yourself as Amitāyus, with fervent devotion to the emanation [Barawa Gyeltsen Pelzang], lord of your enlightened heritage, who is seated before your piled hair. Visualize that from the syllable HRĪḤ in the teacher’s heart, rays of light are diffused, summoning your vitality, and that the alms bowl in your hands is consecrated with a flow of nectar.
The same consecration should be enacted in respect of all the condensed elixirs of the four lower elements:[263] You should recite the mantra OṂ AMARAṆI JĪVANTI YE SVĀHĀ as the light rays of HRĪḤ are again diffused, accepting the consecration of the condensed elixir of the earth element. You should recite it as the light rays of HRĪḤ are again diffused, accepting the consecration of the condensed elixir of the water element. You should recite it as the light rays from HRĪḤ are again diffused, accepting the consecration of the condensed elixir of the burning fire element. You should recite it as the light rays from HRĪḤ are again diffused, accepting the consecration of the condensed elixir of the wind element. You should recite it as the light rays from HRĪḤ are again diffused, accepting the consecration of the condensed vitality of the entire world. And you should also recite it as the light rays from hrīḥ are again diffused, accepting the consecration of the condensed blessings of the conquerors and their heirs. You should make these recitations, absolutely determining that your own body is the adamantine reality endowed with five pure essences,[264] without birth or death.

Then, in the center of your heart, upon a moon disk the size of a split pea, you should visualize an ashé (the stroke of the letter a), indicative of life breath, clear and bright, diffusing a pale-red light. The rays of light diffused from it form a garland of OṂ syllables, indicative of the elixir of immortal life, which enters through your left nostril and dissolves into the ashé within your heart.
Gentle breathing causes the short syllable A to emit light in the form of a garland of HŪṂ syllables, which thoroughly cleanses and expels the impure obscurations of enmity associated with the aspect of degenerate wind, including all the winds within the body, as if sweeping them clean with a brush.
You should then count the OṂ syllables during inhalation, ĀḤ during the retention of breath, and HŪṂ during exhalation.
In the navel cakra, the ashé then assumes the form of red Amitāyus, {182} and in the crown cakra HAṂ assumes the form of white Amitāyus. The anal wind in the form of YAṂ then causes fire to blaze at the triple intersection [below the navel]. It causes the contents of the vase in the hands of Amitāyus at the navel cakra to boil, and the vapor then rises upward within the central channel, to touch the body of Amitāyus within the crown cakra. It transforms into the red female consort Pāṇḍaravāsinī, who draws the lower winds upward and breathes in the upper winds. The place where these winds make contact is naturally warm, causing the contents of the vase in the hands of Amitāyus at the crown cakra to boil and the stream of nectar to flow downward within the central channel. It touches the body of red Amitāyus within the navel cakra, it transforms into the female consort red Pāṇḍaravāsinī, and they embrace. The upper winds should then be forced downward, and again, from that male-female union, the white and red vital essences distinctly fill the navel cakra of emanation and the crown cakra of supreme bliss; and similarly they fill to the brim the heart cakra of the phenomenal wheel and the throat cakra of perfect resource.

You should then visualize that your own body is transformed into the natural expression of light, with the [upper and lower] winds united. From the vase in the hands of [Amitāyus within] the navel cakra nectar rises upward to be transformed into the sun at the heart cakra, and from within the vase in the hands of [Amitāyus in] the crown cakra nectar flows downward to be transformed into the moon [at the heart cakra]. At the union of sun and moon, within the central channel, intrinsic awareness appears in the form of a pale-red HRĪḤ, secured within a cross formed by the vowels and consonants.
Then you should visualize that within each of the two ring fingers, there is a red HŪṂ, diffusing fiery light.
When you have meditated on this sequence of visualization for twelve months, it is said that the life span will definitely be prolonged for ten years. You should therefore prolong the life span of this innate luminosity and rest in a state of natural energy that is fresh, naturally glowing, relaxed, and without hope or doubt.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should rest timelessly in the disposition of ultimate enlightened mind and reverse impure perceptions through the blessing of the intrinsic nature that comes about simply through the transformation of the mental faculty. In this way, the uncontrived mind becomes manifest.
You should then visualize that from the syllable BHRŪṂ, the inhabited world becomes a celestial palace of pure crystal, at the center of which light rays are diffused from the syllable TĀṂ, upon a lotus seat. These absorb all the accomplishments of long life in their entirety, transforming them within an imperishable, permanent, and steadfast svāstika motif that embraces all cyclic existence and nirvana. Instantly there then arises the body of immortal Tārā in the form Cintāmaṇicakra, white as the moon, clear as a crystal gem, diffusing taintless light rays of five colors. She has a most peaceful and smiling face, and seven eyes that are wide open like the petals of an udumbara lotus. Her right hand is in the gesture of supreme boon, and her left hand holds the stem of a white lotus between her thumb and fingers. She has a sensuous and attractive demeanor, has beautiful full breasts, and wears ornaments, the foremost of which are white pearls, an upper robe of white silk, and a skirt of multicolored silk. The topknot of her tresses that are tied back is swaying, her youthful body is seated in a dignified manner in the adamantine posture, and she has the moon disk as her aureole. Within her heart there is a wheel marked with the seed syllable TĀṂ, and on the crown of her head, upon a lotus and moon cushion, there is the lord of her enlightened heritage, Amitābha. On her left side she is adorned with a crescent moon of the first day of the lunar month.

Aroused by the light of her heart cakra, light is then diffused from the alms bowl of Amitābha, the lord of her enlightened heritage. It absorbs {184} the phenomena of the inhabited world and its sentient inhabitants together in the form of nectar, and reenters her body from the crown of the head. You should remain as long as you can in the intrinsic face of that effortless, naked state, beyond the intellect, the immortal and innate expanse that, owing to its auspicious circumstances, is imperishable for an aeon by any conditions whatsoever. The crucial point is that while you repeatedly recall this appearance of White Tārā, you should practice the yoga of the associated mantra recitation.[266]

The mental faculty of delight
Endowed with all the attainments of long life.[267]
This instruction has originated from the stream of the oral teachings.
[In the context of the inner attainment, there are fourteen attributes of the inhabited world and its sentient inhabitants that constitute cyclic existence and nirvana]:[268] (i) youth that is unaging, (ii) brilliant luminosity that is without conditioning, (iii) power that is without effort, (iv) energy that is endowed with strength, (v) accomplishment that is uncontaminated, (vi) merit that is balanced, (vii) glory that is extensive, (viii) majesty that is uncovered, (ix) vitality that is unagitated, (x) life breath that is immortal, (xi) life span that is unchanging, (xii) mind that is unimpeded, (xiii) inspired speech that is transformative, and (xiv) virtuous signs triumphant over all directions.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should rest your mind in the unfabricated and uncontrived state. From that disposition, there arises the syllable HŪṂ, its protective circle forming a canopy of vajra prongs, dense with the flames of pristine cognition.
Within that expanse you should then visualize a syllable HRĪḤ, from which there arises a celestial palace of blazing lotuses, encompassing the inhabited world. And in its midst upon a seat comprising lotus, sun, and moon cushions, Amitāyus instantly arises. His body is white in color, and upon his two hands in the gesture of meditative equipoise he holds a vase filled with nectar. He is adorned with silks and ornaments of precious gems, embellished with the major and minor marks, and seated in the adamantine posture, within an aureole of blazing light.
Above the protuberance of his head upon lotus, sun, and moon cushions, there is your teacher {185} with the syllable bhrūṃ in his heart. Through its rays of light, the glow of the four elements that form the inhabited world of both cyclic existence and nirvana, along with its sentient inhabitants, and all the general and particular accomplishments of their long life, merit, and pristine cognition are completely absorbed in the form of white and red rays of light. This constitutes the attainment of the [visualized] being of commitment.
The flow of nectar present within the vase [of Amitāyus] then manifests within your mouth. As it mingles in a single savor at your throat, your mind is imbued with bliss. Let your uvula suck it. Nurture its essence in your individual intrinsic awareness. From the throat it then fills [the central channel] as far as the heart and the navel cakras.
Next, in conjunction with an exhalation of breath, its rays of light strike the inhabited world, comprising both cyclic existence and nirvana. The actual nature of the material elements should then be absorbed completely in conjunction with an inhalation of breath, and you should firmly maintain this with the vase-shaped breath, hammering in the spike that secures a life span that will not perish for an aeon, due to any condition whatsoever.

Again you should engage in the exercises that cause the luster of the secret wind to arise as HŪṂ. All the generative fluid is inducted from the secret cakra, through the navel, heart, and throat, as far as the crown cakra, and the body of adamantine reality is thereby attained. At the upper extremity of the central channel, this movement is blocked by a white vital essence in the form of BHRŪṂ. Then you should exhale and inhale as before, completely absorb all the life spans [of all beings] of cyclic existence and nirvana, coarse and subtle, and hammer in the spike that secures an imperishable life span. Finally, you should cross both your arms and compress your shoulders. Let your uvula suck the nectar. Your body of adamantine reality will then merge with the essential nature of this melting and pouring [nectar]. Remain in meditative equipoise in this innate, deathless natural state, without effort and beyond the intellect. Without pursuing thoughts of conditioned perception, relax and rest in this disposition. By nurturing the practice in this manner, you will train in higher and higher extraordinary levels that are the essential nature of buddha body, speech, and mind, endowed with adamantine life span and immeasurable pristine cognition. {186}
At the conclusion of this session, you should learn by word of mouth in the context of this actual guidance on Amitāyus the secret procedures through which those whose physical constituents are fully developed may enter into union with a female mudra who has the appropriate signs.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should visualize a white syllable a in your own heart, the light rays of which absorb the inhabited three world systems and their sentient inhabitants; and these then dissolve into yourself. Consequently, intrinsic awareness, devoid of objects to be grasped, manifests in the form of a lotus and moon cushion, from which the seed syllable HRĪḤ appears, and therefrom there arises a lotus, marked with that same seed syllable. Visualize that therefrom you yourself appear, standing upright, in the form of Jowo Mahākāruṇika. The three syllables [OṂ, ĀḤ, HŪṂ] are arrayed at their three respective places [forehead, throat, and heart], with the syllable HRĪḤ inside the heart. You should then invite the sublime [being of pristine cognition] resembling yourself and let it dissolve into that visualized form. Meditate that the teacher [is present above the crown of your head] as the lord of enlightened heritage, in the form of Amitābha, and recite MAṆI as often as possible.
Afterward, you should visualize the world systems of the six classes of living beings and generate strong and immeasurable compassion for their sufferings, repeating the words “My Mother!” After that, rest in a disposition free from conceptual elaboration.
Then in postmeditation you should make the dedication of merit and recite aspiration prayers. While eating, getting dressed, sitting, and sleeping, you should act within the disposition of enlightened mind that entails altruistic thoughts.
When practicing consciousness transference, you should absorb all phenomenal existence into yourself and your intrinsic awareness into the syllable a. Repeating “A A,” visualize that the syllable a vanishes, as it were, into a rainbow in the sky.
When practicing the yoga of the intermediate state, you should carry sights onto the path as the meditational deity Avalokiteśvara, sounds as the MAṆI PADME mantra, and thoughts of recollection as emptiness and compassion.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should visualize that from the disposition of emptiness, in which all things are without inherent existence, there appears the syllable HRĪḤ upon a lotus and moon cushion, and from that there arises an eight-petal lotus, shining like pure gold and marked with HRĪḤ. Therefrom you yourself manifest in the form of Mahākāruṇika, with one face and four arms; the syllables OṂ, ĀḤ, HŪṂ are arrayed respectively at the brow, the throat, and the heart. Through their rays of light the being of pristine cognition is invited from Potālaka and dissolves therein. You should think that you are empowered by the five enlightened families and that, as a sign of this empowerment, you are crowned by the teacher in the form of Amitābha. At the heart on a lotus and moon cushion there appears HRĪḤ, surrounded by the MAṆI syllables. Reciting this as many times as possible, you should ascertain that the abiding nature of reality is originally present in the expanse of quiescence, and so you should let things be consumed without grasping them. Maintain the natural state of the luster of compassion.
During postmeditation, while eating, getting dressed, and sitting, you should be mindful and act with divine pride. When sleeping, you should focus awareness on HRĪḤ at the heart.
When practicing consciousness transference, you should eject the HRĪḤ like an arrow through the passageway of the central channel into the heart of the teacher [above your head].
For practicing the yoga of the intermediate state, it is said that you should train right now through the three deportments [of buddha body, speech, and mind],[272] in order to change your resolve.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should visualize that from the awakening of emptiness among the five awakenings,[274] the seed syllable HRĪḤ indicative of buddha speech arises within your own heart, which resembles an upright eggshell, upon a seat comprising lotus and moon cushions. From that seed syllable there then arises a white lotus, the hand emblem of buddha mind, marked with HRĪḤ; and from that you yourself appear as sublime Avalokita, completely perfect in body, white in color, with one face and four arms. The first pair of hands is placed together at the heart, a rosary of one hundred and eight beads dangles from the second right hand, and he holds a white lotus in the second left hand. His legs assume the adamantine posture. He has an upper robe of white silk, an antelope hide tied across his chest, and a lower robe of multicolored silk. His crown of braided hair is embellished with all sorts of precious ornaments, and white rays of light are diffused in the ten directions from the pores of his skin. He has a moon disk aureole, with the syllable oṃ at his brow, ĀḤ at his throat, HŪṂ above his heart, and HRĪḤ upon a lotus and moon cushion at his heart.
Light rays are then diffused from these syllables, inviting all the meditational deities without exception, who are then dissolved [within your body, assuming the form known as the] “Gathering of All Meditational Deities.” Also, empowered by your own root teacher, Avalokita is present in the form of Amitābha, above the crown of your head, and all the gurus [of the lineage] dissolve therein, [assuming the form known as the] “Gathering of All Gurus.”
At the periphery of the HRĪḤ within the heart, the HRĪḤ is encircled by the six-syllable mantra, {187} from which rays of light are diffused. You should visualize that all expressed meanings of the eighty-four thousand sections of the sacred doctrine are absorbed therein, and that there is an Avalokita present within each of the eighty-four thousand animalcules in your own body, within its twenty-one thousand hairs and its thirty-five million pores. Then visualize that these all simultaneously chant MAṆI.

After reciting this mantra as much as you can, in terms of the ground, you should maintain the view that is uncontrived and innate. In terms of the path, you should maintain the integrated cultivation of calm abiding and higher insight, refining meditative concentration that is relaxed and naturally liberated, and meditative stability that is undistracted.
After sealing this practice with the dedication of merit, during postmeditation you should then visualize that at mealtimes the inhabited world and its inhabitants are blessed by the three syllables, that you make offerings to the Gathering of All Gurus on the crown of the head and to the Gathering of All Meditational Deities within your own body, and then you may partake of food. The same is applicable in the case of clothing. Meditate that your residence is a pure land and that the six classes of living beings are Avalokita.
As for [the practice of] yoga during sleep, at the center of the being of pristine cognition within the heart, you should focus on the teacher, lord of your enlightened heritage who is present.
When practicing consciousness transference, you should meditate that within a light azure hexahedron at the navel, the mind is present in the central channel as a bluish-red vital essence, the thickness of a cane, with five rays of light; that the meditational deity is present within the heart, an inch in size; that at the upper extremity of the central channel the fontanel is blocked by a blue HAṂ, indicative of the hook of compassion; and that the teacher is present on the crown of your head in the form of Amitābha, with his right and left legs in the posture of Maitreya, placed upon the fontanel, and his back resting against your crown of braided hair. From that vital essence within your navel, you should then visualize that a bluish-red vital essence of intermingled wind and mind, the thickness of a pea, breaks upward, swiftly encircles the meditational deity within the heart three times, and dispels the HAṂ at the crown of the head. Rising to the tip of the hook of compassion, it just touches the heart of the teacher, before reversing. After repeating this four times, {188} finally the vital essence vanishes into the heart of the teacher, and the teacher suddenly departs.
When practicing the yoga of the intermediate state, you should resolve that sights are the deities, sounds are the mantras, and recollected thoughts are emptiness.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: Your own mind should simply be aware of the present, without falling into extremes of past and future. Visualize that from the HRĪḤ upon a lotus and moon cushion there appears the lily hand emblem, marked with HRĪḤ, {190} and that therefrom you yourself manifest as the body of the sublime Avalokiteśvara with one face and four arms. The face has a rosy complexion, the first pair of hands assuming the gesture of equipoise, the [second] right hand holding a rosary of pearl, and the [second] left hand holding a white lily. His legs assume the adamantine posture, and he has a crown of piled hair. Covered in scarlet silk, he is adorned with silks and precious gems. His eyes gaze no farther than a double arm span, and he maintains a smiling, decorous demeanor. The head is crowned by the teacher in the form of Amitābha.
You should recite the six-syllable mantra, and then finally rest in the view of genuine reality, the nonarising fundamental nature that is the intrinsic face of Mahākāruṇika, the disposition that is resplendent in lustrous compassion. This same disposition should arise in all the phases of yoga—eating, getting dressed, sitting, and sleeping. When practicing the yoga of the intermediate state, you should be aware that sights are deities and sounds are mantras. Emptiness is the essential for experientially cultivating confidence through which you will understand that the mind is groundless and without foundation.
This definitively presents in writing
All the assertions of direct guidance according to Kyergangpa,
Combining with a delightful mind the essential
Experiential cultivation of supreme liberation.
This was compiled from the instruction manual of Choku Śākya Rinchen.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should visualize that from the awakening of emptiness among the five awakenings, within your own heart that resembles an upright eggshell, and upon a seat comprising lotus and sun cushions, there arises a blue seed syllable HŪṂ and a five-pronged vajra hand emblem, marked at the center with HŪṂ. From these there then appears the completely perfect body of Cakrasaṃvara, blue in color, with one face, two arms, and three eyes. His two hands, holding the vajra and the bell, embrace the female consort Vārāhī. Surmounting his dreadlocks is the wish-fulfilling gem, on the left side of which there is the crescent moon of the first lunar day, and above his fontanel there is a crossed vajra. Standing within a blazing fire of pristine cognition, he wears a skirt of tiger hide and is adorned with a garland of bones and human heads. {191}
From the syllables OṂ, ĀḤ, HŪṂ, which are respectively at his brow, throat, and heart, light is diffused, and with [the resonance of] the syllables JAḤ HŪṂ VAṂ HOḤ, all the hosts of deities associated with the four classes of tantra are transformed into the Gathering of All Meditational Deities. [This deity] is empowered by your teacher, who then manifests [above the crown of the head] as the lord of enlightened heritage. All teachers without exception dissolve therein, and the Gathering of All Gurus becomes manifest.
You should clearly visualize your own twenty-one thousand hairs and three and a half million pores, and all sentient beings of the three world systems as the deity, and simultaneously you should recite the mantra OṂ HRĪḤ HA HA HŪṂ HŪṂ PHAṬ as much as possible, chanting it with conviction.

The four protections comprise the protection of engagement, the protection of self, the protection of environment, and the protection of life breath. The three purifications comprise the purifications of death, the intermediate state, and rebirth.
(i) The protection of engagement denotes the setting of the mind on aspirational enlightenment for the sake of sentient beings.
(ii) As for the protection of self, light is diffused from the syllable HŪṂ on a sun cushion at your heart. It invites the meditational deities and buddhas who enter through the point between your eyebrows. The light from the HŪṂ then penetrates sentient beings, causing them to melt into light; and it penetrates the buddhas, causing them to melt into light; and these are then absorbed into yourself so that extraneous thoughts are abandoned. The light diffused from the HŪṂ then causes your body to disintegrate, and your awareness is visualized as HŪṂ so that thoughts of self are abandoned. Next, you yourself become manifest from the HŪṂ in a wrathful form, upon a lotus cushion, with a tent pitched above in the form of a lotus. At your heart, throat, and crown, respectively, are the three syllables HŪṂ, ĀḤ, and OṂ, so that thoughts of ordinary names and clans are abandoned. This denotes the protection of self.
(iii) As for the protection of environment, you should visualize that fire issues from the HŪṂ, and encircling flames blaze within range of your [upraised] hand, in the standing posture of Vajrapāṇi Mahācakra.
(iv) As for the protection of life breath, during inhalation of breath, consciousness is absorbed in the form of a blazing HŪṂ, and the three purifications ensue—the light from HŪṂ purifying death, the mere letter HŪṂ purifying the intermediate state, and the wrath of HŪṂ purifying rebirth.
You should then focus on the body [of the deity] as a magical display, reciting OṂ VAJRA PĀṆI HŪṂ and acting with divine pride.

The perfection stage is endowed with four blessings, pertaining respectively to body, speech, mind, and real nature.
(i) The blessing of body concerns the essential attributes within [the subtle body of] Vairocana. That is to say, the cakra of emanation at the navel, from which phenomenal existence has been created in [the dichotomy] of soul and egocentricity of primal matter,[280] has sixty-four branches, the cakra of the heart has eight, the cakra of the throat has sixteen, {194} and the cakra of the head has thirty-two.[281] The syllable HAṂ is at the upper end of the central channel, and the syllable OṂ at the lower end. Their thickness is that of a straw of wheat. The head of the OṂ at the navel slightly protrudes into the central channel. HŪṂ is at the heart, ĀḤ at the throat, and HAṂ at the crown.
(ii) The blessing of speech concerns subtle energy, where OṂ represents the aspiration of sound, HAṂ represents its articulation, and AṂ represents the wind of past actions. You should visualize that, in conjunction with the sound of OṂ, a warm sensation rises upward inside the central channel. Penetrating HAṂ at the crown, it exudes warmth. Then, from HAṂ, in conjunction with the sound of HIK, a cooling sensation occurs, flowing down inside the central channel where it penetrates the AṂ at the navel, exuding coolness. The syllables AṂHAṂ should then be recited one hundred times.
(iii) The blessing of mind concerns the essential nature in the form of a vital essence. Visualize that the letters AṂ and HAṂ melt and become the size of a mustard seed. The bliss that is thereby experienced is the exemplary pristine cognition, which descends successively through the crown, throat, heart, and navel, where it generates respectively delight, supreme delight, absence of delight, and coemergent delight. The practice is then applied in reverse sequence, from the bottom upward, in respect of the pea-sized vital essence below the navel. The focusing of the mind on the vital essences in that manner is termed the blessing of the mind.
(iv) The blessing of real nature concerns the lustrous, clear, nonconceptual, and taintless space, which manifests through the power of cultivating emptiness. Here appearances are unimpeded and clearly experienced.

The crucial points of this meditation are that wind is mostly located in the navel, and in the morning, bile is mostly located at the crown. In the afternoon, if your consciousness is restless, you should cultivate nonconceptualization, but if it is torpid, you should focus on bliss. When you have meditated accordingly, [experiences resembling] smoke, mirage, fireflies, burning lamps, and cloudless sky will occur. These are indications that you will attain supreme spiritual accomplishment.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: {195} (i) With the pride of Vajrapāṇi who appears to the minds of living beings as a sentient being,[283] you should yourself resolve to eliminate the film of ripening propensities that obscure the intrinsic essence, so that you do not recognize it.
Reciting the mantra OṂ SVABHĀVA ŚUDDHĀḤ SARVADHARMĀḤ SVABHĀVA ŚUDDHO’HAṂ, when your own perception, free from the dualistic perception of the subject-object dichotomy, becomes like a cloudless sky—that is the Vajrapāṇi of genuine reality.
When you meditate that from this disposition, upon a lotus and sun cushion, awareness suddenly appears in the form of HŪṂ, burning with fire—that is the Vajrapāṇi of symbolic letter.
When light is diffused from that HŪṂ, scattering in the ten directions the celestial demonic forces and planetary divinities, the subterranean demonic forces and nāgas, and the terrestrial demonic forces and elementals who may all lead you astray, and pursuing them in the manner of windblown feathers, and when the HŪṂ is then transformed and from it a nine-pronged vajra of meteorite manifests, its base planted firmly on a solid seat, its tip spontaneously facing upward to the sky, and its center marked with the progenitor syllable HŪṂ, burning with fire—that is the Vajrapāṇi of emblematic material form.

(ii) Next, you should visualize with great clarity that through these rays of light glorious Vajrapāṇi who appears to fruitional minds as a buddha,[284] the lord of all the secret mantras and gnostic mantras, is invited from the supreme abode of Alakāvatī, surrounded by an entourage of ninety million vajra-holding bodhisattvas, and that these all dissolve [into the aforementioned symbolic form].
(iii) Instantaneously you then become glorious Vajrapāṇi who appears to the minds of those on the path as a sublime being.[285] His essential nature is that of the buddha body of reality, his demeanor is that of the buddha body of perfect resource, and his embodiment is that of the buddha body of emanation. With the appearance of a sixteen-year-old, his body is azure blue in color, like a clear and lustrous sky, untainted by particles, the hair of his head, eyebrows, and beard bristling upward like the spreading red clouds of daybreak or dusk and emitting sparks of fire. He has three eyes, red and round; the shoots of his teeth are snarling, grinning, haughty, and jovial. His right hand brandishes a vajra; {196} his left hand holds a bell while embracing his female consort. He is adorned with snakes and a skirt of tiger hide, tied at the back, and he is in a standing posture, with his right leg contracted and left leg extended.
In union with him[286] is the female consort Vajracaṇḍālī, bluish-green in color, youthful, holding a knife and skull, and embracing the male by the neck. Her left leg is contracted and the right leg extended, entwined around the male. She has three eyes, reddish-yellow hair that hangs downward, a crown of skulls, and bone ornaments. The vajra and lotus are in union, and both deities are present in the midst of the blazing fiery mass of pristine cognition.

You should focus one-pointedly on the aspects of the deity, without impediment: In your own heart, upon a sun disk visualize a resplendent HŪṂ, the color of aquamarine, from which one hundred HŪṂ syllables, one thousand HŪṂ syllables, ten thousand HŪṂ syllables, one hundred thousand HŪṂ syllables, and immeasurable HŪṂ syllables extend outward, increasingly wearing away your own body so that it resembles gristle filled with air, its inside distended by HŪṂ and consecrated by the entire power and might of glorious Vajrapāṇi. Cracked by the force of HŪṂ, it disintegrates exclusively into the form of HŪṂ. You should then visualize that the world systems in their entirety are filled with the sound of HŪṂ, and that all the buddha fields of the ten directions are pervaded by its thunderous resonance, so that beings are aroused to contemplation. Think that it reaches the ears of demonic forces and all those who may lead you astray, filling them with fear and terror. Thereupon your awareness will be invigorated and the optic nerve will be heightened. As consciousness is intensified, the louder the intonation of HŪṂ, the more you will develop the power to resonate it from the throat, without moving the base of the tongue. At first, this should be done gently, but having acquired experience, it should be recited more loudly.
When settling into a session of meditation, the fruitional form of that mantra recitation should be absorbed into the HŪṂ within your heart. Next, you should visualize repeatedly the billion pores and the twenty-one thousand hairs {197} of your body as HŪṂ. Without wavering from the lustrous and clear body of the deity, resembling the stars reflected on a lake, there then ensues the transformation into the nasal chanting of a single seed syllable HŪṂ.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: Initially you should display a painted icon nearby and make an incense offering of consecrated flesh to it. You should then meditate, focusing without distraction on the exemplary painted icon. If your eyes feel uncomfortable, close your eyes and meditate on a mental object similar to the painted icon.
With regard to the posture of this deity, kurmapādā (rus sbal zhabs) means “turtle feet.” She is so named because she assumes a posture resembling that of a turtle.
The visualization should be maintained since, by meditating in that manner, there is no difference between a painted icon and a mentally present image.
Next, you should meditate that within your navel cakra, at the center of a white lotus with four petals or a multicolored lotus with eight petals, black Bhairava with one face and two arms is lying face downward, holding a curved knife and a skull and wearing a skirt of tiger hide and a moist human hide with bone ornaments. Upon him stands the Venerable Vārāhī, her body yellow in color, with one face and two arms, her right hand stretching downward and holding a curved knife, and her left hand holding a skull at the heart. The disheveled hair of her head hangs down, and she wears a garland of moist human heads. Her legs assume the dancing posture, and she wears the five symbolic regalia,[288] blazing with light rays like the fire at the end of an aeon. Her consciousness is wild, {198} her body trembling, and her body hairs standing on end. Having impeded external thoughts, it is as if she cannot move. If you meditate in that manner, you will obtain the supreme accomplishment of the Great Seal in this very lifetime.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should visualize yourself as the deity Kurukullā. At her navel cakra, the channel branches of enlightened attributes resemble a reclining dog [on all fours].[290] Supported upon that, the channel of enlightened attributes faces upward, and growing from it, in the manner of an open peppercorn, is the heart cakra, where the channel branches associated with the eight modes of consciousness resemble an open lily with eight petals.[291] At its center you should visualize the syllable HRĪḤ, the color of the rising sun, in which the channels, winds, and vital essences are combined, and recite the garland of mantra syllables just as they encircle it.
Next, you should visualize that the deity who is your object of attainment is in front. The three vertical channels are also present within her body, with the syllable HRĪḤ in her heart cakra and its eight channel branches marked with the eight short vowels. You should meditate that these are similarly present within your own heart. Then the essential nature of all the long life and glory embodied in [the heart of] the deity who is the object of your attainment arises as the corresponding long vowels, in which similar letters are exemplified as before, but in long form.
With divine pride, you should strongly recite OṂ KURU KULLE HRĪḤ SVĀHĀ. Consequently, summoned from the HRĪḤ within your heart, eight ḍākinīs with the power of proud spirits, in the form of red bees, emerge from your right ear, and via the notch on the lily-covered arrow in your hand, they enter through the ear of the deity who is your object of attainment. You should visualize that not long after, the vitality and sap of the vowels [of your own heart] are isolated and extracted, and the lily withers, but that vitality is then restored to the short vowels within your own heart via the previous pathway, enabling the corresponding long syllables to be recited. {199} After completing this mantra recitation, you should equipoise the mind in the meaning of the following verses:[292]

You should make the proper arrangements, including a darkened room and a platform, and then you should adopt the standard posture, with the two hands in the earth-subduing gesture,[294] and successfully expel all sorts of poisons associated with subtle energy.
After that, as far as the essentials of the physical body are concerned, you should assume the adamantine cross-legged posture and position the supine or downward-facing fists of the hands upon the channels of the thighs, with both arms straight and aligned with the sides of the rib cage, and the spine erect. Alternatively, if that is impossible, you should adopt the bodhisattva posture, with the hands forming the gesture of meditative equipoise, the upper body stretching backward and the neck slightly bent, the chin almost touching the Adam’s apple, the tongue touching the palate, and the lips resting in their natural position. You should maintain these essentials of the physical body, without swaying forward or backward, right or left.
As far as your gaze is concerned, you should focus one-pointedly and unwaveringly on the space sixteen finger widths from the tip of the nose, and then settle your mind in a nonconceptual disposition, eradicating and not welcoming thoughts of the past or future, and without even allowing your present awareness to diffuse or disintegrate. Maintaining the three isolations of body, speech, and mind in that manner, there are four things to disregard, among which [in this preliminary context] you should disregard physical, verbal, and mental resources.[295]

Nonconceptualization arises [naturally], either after ascertaining the time when the wind of the earth element is in motion,[296] or even through the [extraordinary] circumstance when the movement of the wind of the right nostril accords with the phase of the dissolution [of the elements, thereby absorbing impure perceptions into the expanse].[297] You should therefore meditate at such times. You should also meditate at twilight and at dawn, and in the morning and in the afternoon. You should, however, rest at noon, at midnight, and at the monkey hour,[298] because these are the times of mental dullness and agitation.
You should adopt the essential posture of the body, as previously indicated, in conjunction with the expulsion of the poisons associated with subtle energy and, as far as your gaze is concerned, focus without distraction and directly in front, sixteen finger widths from the space between the eyebrows. Then let the wind of speech settle in its own natural position, and, above all, let the mind settle into a nonconceptual state. If at that time conceptual thoughts are slightly diffused, you should train your awareness by means of gazing. It is important to let your awareness settle one-pointedly, concentrating the mental faculty, the eyes, and the wind in a one-pointed manner. If even at that time conceptual thoughts should continue to circulate upon the basis of the sense objects, you should cut off those of both the past and the future and settle in the uncontrived awareness of the present. If awareness is aroused through the tension of these methods of mental settling, you should let go of that tense effort and let your awareness relax. Even so, you should still be somewhat watchful, with unwavering mindfulness.
When practicing daytime yoga [in contrast to the foregoing yoga of darkness or nighttime], in a place where the sky appears expansive in the east and the west, and there is no dazzling white [phenomenon] such as snow, and when there are no clouds or breezes, you should direct your gaze toward the west in the morning and toward the east in the afternoon. The essential posture of the body and the settling of the mind should be maintained in the aforementioned manner.

At noon you should interrupt the session.
If there is a predominance of mental dullness at the time when those two yogas of the pith instructions [of the daytime and the nighttime or darkness] are practiced, you should adopt a cross-legged posture, covering your knees with your hands, and control the wind slightly while maintaining that essential posture. Then strongly exhale the wind from both your mouth and nostrils. If, however, there is a preponderance of diffusion and mental agitation, you should visualize the body transformed into a ball of light, {308} and then, as it becomes gradually smaller and subtler, it becomes imperceptible. In this way mental agitation will be dispelled.
By the power of having one-pointedly persevered in those [daytime and nighttime] yogas, the subtle energy and mind should then enter into the central channel from the pathway of the vajra (penis), and then you will extensively perceive the appearances of luminosity. Indeed, there are four signs indicative of that luminosity that will manifest during the night—namely, smoke, mirage, the appearance of fireflies in the sky, and [a phenomenon] resembling a burning lamp. And there are also six signs indicative of that luminosity that will arise during the day—namely, (i) the burning yellow appearance of blazing fire, (ii) the moon, (iii) the sun, (iv) the multifarious black shapes of an adamantine eclipse, (v) the supreme phenomenon resembling a flash of lightning, and (vi) the appearances of a blue sphere and so forth. Although these are established to be the principal signs associated with [the yoga of] the daytime and [the yoga of] the nighttime, [their actual manifestations] will be uncertain.[299] Through cultivation of [these yogas] in that manner over a long period of time, in the middle of that [just-mentioned] sphere, emptiness in all its finest aspects will manifest as form; and it will be experienced as [anything] from the unconquerable echo of sound to the vibration of touch.[300]

With regard to the reason for the appearance of such signs: Since these signs are also said to derive from the dynamic winds entering the central channel during the phase of dissolution [of the elements at death] and during the generation stage, one might think that the manifestations of these signs will definitively arise as and when the winds of the coarse respiration cycle gradually dissolve and become invisible. But, on the contrary, you should reflect that right now, by the power of nonconceptual mind, the subtle wind, riding on consciousness, reverses the movement of speech, and as it blocks any conceptual thoughts of dualistic grasping, the movements of the winds of the five elements dissolve sequentially and enter [into the central channel].
Those forms of emptiness are perceived by the eye of flesh, although the eye that perceives them is not itself ordinary. Moreover, it is exclusively explained that the manifestation of that faculty is a defining characteristic that approximates the actual manifestation of a yogin’s unbewildered nonconceptual pristine cognition. {309} It is said that these signs and [the yogins] who possess them are known to be certain or definitive; and one should also understand that these signs are finely differentiated from the many diverse and uncertain signs that may appear in [ordinary] dream experiences, such as vases, woolen cloth, and yak woolen fabric.

Here, the mind one-pointedly abides in the forms of emptiness that were perceived during the previous branch of composure. This entails five ancillary aspects: (i) Discriminative awareness is the knowledge that, though the forms of emptiness at first arise diversely, their intrinsic nature is emptiness. You should be certain that if there is movement of conceptual thought, the forms of emptiness also move, and that when the mind is not diffused, they do not move. (ii) Ideation is that which simply apprehends the appearance of entities while they are empty. (iii) Scrutiny is that which definitively arises, along with certainty, with reference to all appearances—not solely the forms of emptiness. By these methods, you should avoid being tainted by attachment due to the mind totally abiding in those forms of emptiness or even by attachment that would grasp those objects as mental concepts. (iv) An extraordinary joy will then arise in the mind by experientially cultivating these [forms of emptiness] without error, and through the repeated experience of previous [states of joy], the mind and the forms of emptiness will merge, as it were, in a common savor. (v) The bliss of extreme physical refinement will then arise. This is called the unmoving bliss or the immovable bliss. If you persevere with these five ancillary aspects of meditative concentration,[301] the forms of emptiness will become stable.
If, on the one hand, the forms of emptiness are unclear when the eyes are closed, you should gradually establish during daytime yoga that the appearances of the aforementioned signs do arise in the sky. That is to say, you should focus your gaze one-pointedly upon any entities that appear on the basis of past actions, and by controlling the mind, block those things that appear in whatever form on the basis of past actions {310} so that the [appropriate] signs will then arise, merging with those appearances. If, on the other hand, the forms of emptiness are clear when the eyes are closed, the abiding aspect of mind will become stable, particularly if you control the mind in the central channel, at the triple intersection of the channels [below the navel].

Also, you should visualize the movement of the winds and the forms of emptiness in tandem directly in front, sixteen finger widths from the nostrils, and consequently you will perceive the colors of the winds and also accomplish the rites of pacification and enrichment. Then you should prepare a comfortable bed with a high pillow and adopt the essential physical posture of the reclining lion. Leaving the movement of the winds unchanged, and settling the mind in a nonconceptual disposition, you should fall asleep, such that no sorts of dream phenomena are present, and after waking up, your mind will abide in the coalescence of radiance and emptiness. This will put an end to dense confusion and your sleep will become extremely refined. That is to say, the forms of emptiness will indeed clearly arise, resembling phenomena that appear as white within darkness.
You should persevere in these practices by gradually merging meditative equipoise and postmeditation. The appearances of the signs associated with the previous branch of composure will become clear and extensively arise, perceptions of sound and smell and so forth will also arise, and a vital essence with five properties—diffused in diverse colors, subtle, shining, trembling, and hard to disintegrate—will also become manifest. In its midst the body of the buddha will appear, endowed with three certainties,[302] along with its [black] outline. You will obtain the five extrasensory powers of divine clairvoyance, clairaudience, miraculous abilities, knowledge of the minds of others, and the recollection of past lives; your channels will be purified; and you will accomplish the body of adamantine reality.[303]

The descent of vital breath moving from above into the right and left channels should be blocked, and then exertion—the procedure through which it is inducted into the central channel—should be applied when there is movement of wind from the left side. {311} Mainly you should stay in a darkened room and adopt the essential physical posture—blocking the channel of the vajra (penis) and the rectum with the heel of the right foot while extending the left leg comfortably in front. You should position the crossed palms of the hands just upon the thighs and secure the posture of the [six] opposing stoves [of the hands, feet, and elbows][304] or else execute the gesture of the fist[305] in an embracing manner. As far as your gaze is concerned, you should look directly in front, sixteen finger widths from the place between the eyebrows, and then while contracting the abdomen, you should exhale about twenty-one times. At that time the wind will be expelled from all the channels of the body, the channels also will be perceived to straighten out kinks, the right and left channels will be balanced, and you will attain accomplishments, as appropriate, in accordance with the practical application.
Thereafter the pith instructions that are to be experientially cultivated are entitled the Six Adamantine Verses and descended through the lineage from Paṇchen Śākyaśrī of Kashmir.[306] According to this text, once the pathways of the channels have been refined by the adamantine recitation [of the preliminary practices],[307] (i) the wind is inducted into the central channel through the filling and release of gentle wind.[308] (ii) The wind that has been inducted into the central channel is then secured through the rough vase breathing.[309] (iii) If the induction and securing of wind by these means is not effected, there is said to be the “forceful method of rough breathing.”[310]

The practice begins as follows: In the morning when the stomach is empty and so forth, you should assume either the bodhisattva posture or the adamantine posture. [You should examine the place from where the wind is moving].[311] When the wind is flowing from the left nostril, you should place your right fist upon the kidney channel and the breast of the left side and press it with the left elbow. You should then turn your face toward the right, slightly draw in the lower wind, and block the right nostril with the extended index finger of the left fist. Inhale strongly from the left nostril and compress the abdomen. After completing that, you should turn your face toward the left side, release the blockage of your index finger on the right nostril, and then block the left one, forcefully exhaling wind from the right nostril.
Similarly, when wind is flowing from the right nostril, you should press the left fist against the kidney channel and the breast of the right side. {312} You should turn your face toward the left, draw in the lower wind, and block the left nostril with the [extended] index finger of the right fist. Then after inhaling from the right nostril, you should turn your face toward the right side, block the right nostril with the [extended] index finger, and exhale from the left one. After alternating in this manner seven times and so forth, you should be able to practice this in a flow of equilibrium, and at that time you may rest.[312]
During these exercises of breath control, you may have a headache, feel the heart being compressed, and see hallucinations such as a wheel of light. If, thereafter, you see that same hallucination becoming more prominent at its zenith, you should interrupt the session for a while and revert to meditation on [the aforementioned yogas] of composure and meditative concentration.[313] The techniques of mingling the vital breath with the downward purgative wind and savoring the nectar of the uvula are both explained in addition.[314]

Having mingled the vital breath with the downward purgative wind, you should next meditate on the branch of retention by dissolving the elements—earth into water, and so on, up to space into pristine cognition—in the middle of each respective cakra. The essential physical posture is as in the [aforementioned] vase breathing, or, alternatively, if the wind moves mainly through the left channel, you should compress the lower gate with the heel of the right foot, with the left leg extended slightly in front, in the posture of left-sided royal ease. If, however, the wind moves [mainly] through the right channel, you should do the reverse. The two hands should cover the knees, and the gaze should be as before.[315]
First, you should draw the lower wind upward and conduct the upper wind with the resonance of the long syllable HŪṂ, so that it is exhaled from both nostrils. Then inhale again and let the breath enter the abdomen with the short syllable HŪṂ, so that you can visualize the mingling of the vital breath with the downward purgative wind. Next, you should push out the abdomen several times and strongly conduct the secret wind upward with the short syllable HŪṂ. The eyes should be turned toward the space between the eyebrows, the tip of the tongue raised to the palate, and the lower wind drawn upward through mindfulness of the syllable PHAṬ.[316]

Then visualize the central channel in the middle of the body and meditate that the navel cakra has four, eight, twelve, and so forth channel branches, {313} all of which have both inner and outer edges, and outside these are sixty-four channel branches, yellow in color.[317] Within the central channel you should visualize upon a moon disk a white OṂ with its crescent, biṇḍu, and vibration. You should draw the downward purgative wind upward and conduct the upper wind, as in the [aforementioned] phase of the harsh wind, and then do the vase breathing. Imagine that your mental faculty dissolves into a vital essence and focus upon it one-pointedly. Experiencing that, you should meditate that the forms of emptiness and your mental faculty merge together in a single savor. If you think that the wind is insufficient, you should release it slowly and then earnestly apply this exercise. You should then dissolve the channels, winds, and vital essence of the navel cakra into a single savor, draw in the downward purgative wind, and unite it with the upper wind. Then, focusing one-pointedly on the heart cakra, you should slowly release the upper wind.[318]
The three applications of [gentle, harsh, and forceful] wind are similar in the case of the remaining cakras.[319] In this regard, the visualization at the throat cakra is of four, eight, sixteen, and thirty-two channel branches, the outer layer of which is red in color and dissolves and so forth, as before, in a single savor with the channels, vital essence, and winds of the heart cakra.[320]
At the forehead there are four, eight, and sixteen channel branches, the outer layer of which [dissolves] in a single savor with the channels, vital essence, and winds of the throat cakra.[321] At the crown cakra there are four blue channel branches that [dissolve] in a single savor with the channels, vital essence, and winds of the forehead.[322]

At the secret cakra you should visualize that there are six, ten, and sixteen channel branches, the outer layer of which, green in color, dissolves inseparably with the channels, vital essence, and winds of the crown cakra.[323]
With respect to all these cakras, you should also apply the one-pointed meditative concentration that merges [your mental faculty] with the forms of emptiness.
Since the order of the first two branches and the middle two branches [of the six-branch yoga] is fixed, the sequence of meditation on these six cakras, commencing with the navel cakra, accords with that order. However, in the case of yogins [of lower, average, and superior capacity] whose generative fluid is respectively thin, slightly thick, or extremely thick, it is also explained that as a method of retaining it and so forth, they should engage respectively [with the three seals], starting from [those of lower capacity] who engage with the action seal.[324] {314}

Here, by contrast, supreme yogins should make the forms of emptiness into the path of the Great Seal. By realizing the unchanging great bliss of inner awareness, they will become accomplished without [the need for] consciousness transference, whereas those of average and lower capacity should experience the melting innate bliss dependent on two [other] seals.[325] In this way, the seminal fluid is transformed as if into a bond of mercury and the unchanging great bliss is actualized. So yogins should practice in accordance with this sequence.
You should visualize, as before, the central channel in the middle of the body, reaching the place between the eyebrows at its upper extremity, and with the six cakras. The two right and left channels that are located in the navel cakra commence from the crown of the head. That is to say, they connect with the central channel directly at each of the respective cakras and diverge to the right and left between the six cakras. From the secret cakra [downward], the central channel proceeds to the right, the rasanā (right channel) to the left and the lalanā (left channel) is in the middle; and it is therefrom that the feces, urine, and seminal fluid are respectively excreted. Therefore you should meditate in conformity with this framework of the channels.

You should then visualize that in the middle of the navel cakra there is the syllable HOḤ, from the transformation of which the fire of the fierce inner heat blazes upward—red, subtle, and sharp, four finger widths in size, its light rays permeating entirely the upper and lower extremities of the central channel. Then you should hold the mind steadily for a long time, either in conjunction with the gentle vase breathing or focusing on the fire alone. The generative fluid of the crown cakra or forehead cakra then moves in the form of the syllable HAṂ or else in the form of a vital essence. You should meditate that it sequentially permeates the minor channels also and that it reaches the central channel, from where it generates delight in the forehead and throat cakras, supreme delight in the heart cakra, extraordinary delight in the navel cakra, and the experience of coemergent delight in the secret cakra and the vajra (penis). Alternatively, it generates delight when passing from the crown to the forehead, supreme delight when passing from the throat to the heart, {315} absence of delight or diverse delight when passing from the navel cakra to the secret cakra, and the conclusive coemergent delight when passing from the secret cakra to the vajra. You should experientially cultivate these aspects that are the means to accomplish the body of pristine cognition—the deathless, supreme bliss.[326]

Depending on that sequence [of meditation] in which the generative fluid is not ejaculated, you will obtain twenty-one thousand six hundred instances of bliss, and you will also commensurately block the [twenty-one thousand six hundred] winds of temporal conjunction.[327] On that basis you will become a mighty lord of the twelfth level. That is to say, dependent on the vital essence being stable at the tip of the vajra (penis), you will obtain the first instance of unchanging bliss. This is the start of meditative stability, and you will block a single cycle of respiration.[328] That will commensurately increase to 1,800 instances [of bliss], and you will block an equivalent number of respiration cycles. In succession you will then obtain the first and second levels in the secret cakra. It is demonstrably established that you will also attain the [corresponding] instances of bliss in the navel, heart, throat, forehead, and crown cakras, and that by this same method of blocking the winds of temporal conjunction, two levels will be obtained [in each of these five cakras]. The conclusive fruit, the body of pristine cognition, is unsurpassed buddhahood.[329]

After you have taken refuge and set the mind on enlightenment, then, in accordance with the following stanzas concerning the Great Seal:[331]
At first since one is devoid of effort and attainment, [the body and mind] are inwardly relaxed.[332] Next, since one is devoid of hesitation, the mind rests in its uncontrived [and fresh] state. Finally, one should know that all occurrences and sensations are nonarising.
And in accordance with the stanzas of the Total Liberation through Singular Knowledge:[333]
You should rest in the profound reality. You should analyze the mind. With regard to the expansive nature of mind, you should nurture the natural glow of reality.
In any sutra, tantra, pith instruction, or treatise that is experientially cultivated, where realizations are offered and introductions to reality are made, there may be verbal instructions on both mind and the nature of mind, and on both phenomena and reality; and verbal instructions that differentiate words and thoughts.

The three aspects of prayer constitute the threefold request that the teacher might confer on oneself the blessing of realizing the abiding nature of the Great Seal. The first aspect is the object of the meditation, the second is the ritual, and the third is the actual prayer. That is to say, the first is expressed in the words “my teacher,” the second in the words “Great Seal,” {200} and the third in the words of the prayer “May the guru confer on me the blessing so that the emptiness and compassion of the Great Seal may arise in my mind!” This should be brought about through the auspicious connection of the four empowerments.
Then you should aspire that the mind [of the teacher] and [your ordinary] mind intermingle and become unchanging. Afterward, you should recite the wrathful mantra [of Kālacakra] and pray as follows:[334]

Oh, this unique buddha body of reality
Is the realization that henceforth connects dualities,
The sole essential nature of the bewildered and unbewildered,
Not holding that living beings have two natures of mind.
Listen now, Vajrasattva!
Given that Samantabhadra, naturally originated awareness,
Is without words and letters, he has no master.
Given that he teaches himself, he is a master.
Given that he is intrinsically aware of himself, he is the buddha body of reality.
There is nothing to be observed
Apart from things expressed by the mind.
There is no need to search for or flee from external signs.
The enlightened intention of the buddhas is present in the mind.
The inspection of this by yourself in your own nature
Is like finding the proverbial wish-granting gem.
When analyzed according to skillful means,
There are one hundred and fifty writings.
When these are subsumed, they are gathered in thirty writings.
When these are again subsumed, they comprise five writings on great emptiness,
And when these are further subsumed,
They comprise two writings of skillful means and discriminative awareness.
When these are further subsumed,
They comprise the single writing that is most secret.
On the throne endowed with the pure ten signs,[335]
There is a sun cushion with the pure vowels,
A moon cushion with the pure consonants,
And a vital essence with the pure [form of] Rāhu.
In the letter [A] representing pure reality,
The pristine cognition that permeates all knowledge is present.
Aroused by this adamantine sound,
In a celestial palace of five pure lights,
Pristine cognition, intrinsic awareness, becomes radiant,
Arising as the spontaneously present body of supreme bliss.
Homage to the precious nature of mind!
The vital heart mantra of adamantine reality takes form
When recited for twenty-one thousand six hundred [breaths].[336]
Those who know the melody of the bees that is nonarising
Do not interrupt the spontaneous presence of the three buddha bodies. {201}
Homage to the precious nature of mind!
In the tent of the precious heart,
Extremely translucent, one-hundredth of a horse’s tail hair,
The long syllable a, endowed with five colors, resounds,
And all knowable things are clear, as on a mirror.

According to those outside the path of liberation
This is a radiant great pervasion, mingling outer and inner aspects;
But it is the supremely unchanging great bliss
Purposefully conferred on yogins.
Homage to the precious nature of mind!
The syllable a transcends emptiness and nonemptiness.
As for its abode, it abides in nonarising.
As for its expression, it is expressed without interruption.
As for its pervasion, it permeates all living beings.
As for its sight, it is not seen by anyone at all.
As for its teacher, it is revealed by the genuine teacher.
Homage to the precious nature of mind!
Within the translucent vital essence of conclusive great emptiness,
There is a black outline, one-hundredth of a horse’s tail hair,
And within it radiate the indefinite phenomena that fill the three world systems,
Including matter and the forms of the six classes of beings.
Diffusing taintless light, the form endowed with all finest aspects
Becomes Vajrasattva, the body of the conquerors of the three times.
Homage to the precious nature of mind!
Without [notions of] mine, me, myself, by me, for me,
I have, I lack, and I am not,
Lay down a mat of uncontrived freshness
And suddenly make freshness your pillow.

Lie down naked and complete twenty-one thousand six hundred [breaths],
Whereupon you yourself will become Vajrasattva.

In addition to the first three poisons, pride is added for those of great arrogance and jealousy for those of great rivalry, and these are said to be called the “five sibling frailties.”[337]
All that the teacher sees in terms of all the three poisons is the mingling of buddha mind and ordinary mind. All that the teacher sees of the sacred representations [of buddha body, speech, and mind] is consecration. All that the teacher sees of sentient beings is compassion. All that the teacher hears of the deceased is the forty-nine-day ceremony. All that the teacher sees of appearances is the mingling of the expanse and awareness.

Here, I, of supreme liberation, in a few words,
Have with delight excellently condensed and committed to writing
The aural transmission of Kālacakra,
Which comprises all the instructions of Menlungpa [Sonam Pel].
This partially presents the reliable [points of instruction] that I gleaned from the words of a disciple of Chojé Khewang [Rinchen Zangpo], from which the unoriginal vestiges of the Nyingma scriptural transmission of the Tantra of [Heruka] Galpo and so forth had been removed.

You should meditate in a darkened hermitage on the channels as the adamantine reality of buddha body, practicing the three postures.[339] Meditate with the shoulders stretched out, the back straight, the neck bent, the tongue rolled back, the mouth and nose slightly taut, the ears closed, and the eyes gazing upward without focusing on any object of reference.[340] Thoughts of desire should be expelled. You should rest simply, without distraction. Rejecting the nutrients of the five sensory gates, you should be filled internally with the primary and ancillary winds. Then [the nonconceptual state will arise and] signs such as smoke will be seen.[341]
When forcing the winds upward,[342] [you should purify defects of the posture of the upper body and let the individual winds rest in their natural place. To that end,] you should adopt the posture of the lower body, which requires you to block both the lower orifices below the abdomen with your two feet and tighten [the abdomen] all over. Then you should focus the gaze [of Vairocana] downward.[343] Next, you should adopt the posture of the upper body, which will dispel the defects of the lower posture.[344] {203} [After you invigorate the postures of the upper and lower body, the winds will not remain constant there without your mastering] the posture of the middle body. To that end, you should bend the knees slightly, push out the abdomen, and eliminate all obstacles associated with the postures of the upper and lower body.[345]

You should meditate in the morning and afternoon with the sun and the breeze to the rear, but not at midday. You should meditate in a place where a clear cloudless sky can be seen under a veranda. During the daytime, six signs may be observed, and there are four signs that may be observed during the nighttime, as the winds of the [four] elements are retained [within the central channel]. The latter include: smoke, which is the sign that the wind of the earth element has been retained; mirage, which is the sign that the wind of the water element has been retained; fireflies, which are the sign that the wind of the fire element has been retained; and lamplight, which is the sign that the wind of the wind element has been retained. In addition, a [cloudless space] like the sky is the sign that the wind of the space element [has been impeded]. The aforementioned daytime signs include blazing firelight, moonlight, sunlight, dense eclipsing darkness, lightning, and an extremely subtle vital essence in the middle of which the buddha body of perfect resource is seen.[346] However, the six signs that occur during daytime are uncertain, for there are an inconceivably vast number [of others], including vases, blankets, ropes, and so forth. In addition, you should make this examination in accordance with the threefold experience, that is to say, with the experience of the body, the experience of the mind, and the experience of dreams.[347] Such are the ten signs.
The five ancillary aspects of meditative concentration—namely, discriminative awareness, ideation, scrutiny, delight, and unmoving bliss—will also be observed, and the five extrasensory powers will arise.[348]

This concerns the framework of channels, the resource of vital essences, the mastery of the winds, and the abiding of awareness on the supports [of the generative essences, the presence of which is prerequisite for life].[349]
You should expel the residual wind. Then the inhalation of breath is accompanied by OṂ, retention by ĀḤ, and exhalation by HŪṂ.[350] This recitation is undertaken after you have abandoned bead counting.[351]
Afterward, without confusing the winds, you should meditate on the five applications of the winds [of the elements]: The wind of space that arises is without sensation; it is gentle and evenly retained. The wind of fire is strong, short, and retained with gasping. The wind of water whistles through the closed teeth and is retained with sound. The wind of earth is slightly stronger than the wind of space and is retained with or without sensation.[352]
You should then meditate on the seat of the lower purgative wind and [above it] the stacked letters of the elements. At the navel there is the syllable E, triangular, blue, and clear like the sky. Upon it [stacked one above the other] are the bow-shaped black syllable yaṃ from which the maṇḍala of wind emerges, {204} the triangular red syllable RAṂ from which the maṇḍala of fire emerges, the circular white syllable VAṂ from which the maṇḍala of water emerges, and the square yellow syllable LAṂ from which the maṇḍala of earth emerges. And upon that is the seat of pristine cognition, green and circular. Rāhu, the sun, the moon, and Ketu (comet Enke) are circular, corresponding to the element of tangibles.[353]

Then, through the application of the upper wind, the garlands of vowels and consonants on the seats of these elements emerge as follows: You should visualize that the vowels and consonants [in association with the wind of the earth element] emerge yellow in color and in a string. As they alight on [the seat formed of] Ketu, all becomes yellow. When releasing that breath, you should meditate that the seed syllables rise upward [in association with the exhalation of breath]. Next, you should visualize that the vowels and consonants in association with the wind of the water element emerge pale gray and in a string. As they alight on the seat formed of the moon, all becomes white. Next, the vowels and consonants in association with the wind of the fire element emerge red in color and in a string. As they alight on the seat formed of the sun, all becomes red. Next, the vowels and consonants in association with the wind of the wind element emerge black in color and in a string. [As they alight on the seat formed of Rāhu, all becomes black. Next, the vowels and consonants in association with the wind of the space element[354] emerge aquamarine in color and in a string]. As they alight on the seat of pristine cognition, you should visualize that all becomes blue.[355]
At the start of every session of meditation, you should adopt this perspective, and by focusing on these [winds of the elements] respectively, you should retain the middle wind while relaxing the upper and lower winds.[356]
The seed syllables then suddenly rise up in the forms of their respective hand emblems—the blue vajra, the black sword, the red gemstone, the white lotus, and the yellow wheel. Visualize that these in turn rise up in the form of their respective deities, as Kālacakra [or Cakrasaṃvara] in male-female union.[357]

As for the observations associated with this subtle energy, the lower wind pertains to [the clear visualization of] the lower part of the deity’s body, the middle wind pertains to [the clear visualization of] the deity’s waist, and the upper wind pertains to [the clear visualization of] the deity’s face and eyes.[358] The precious wind also generates the physical constitutions of fire, water, and earth. Thus, when wind arises in the pathways, a sensation of heat is felt at the navel of the deity that has the constitution of fire, and this fire causes [the generative fluids in the form of] the vowels and consonants to descend from above, from the seed syllable HAṂ [in the cakra of] supreme bliss, and permeate the body.[359]
If at that time the great rites are practiced, the fourfold union[360] of the wind of the water element denotes the rite of pacification. Here the deity is visualized as having the constitution of the water element, and the subtle energy of water is inducted into the central channel. Then the following mantra is recited: OṂ MĀMA KĪRIKĪRI so and so (che ge mo) ŚĀNTI KURU NAMAḤ.[361]
The fourfold union of the wind of the earth element denotes the rite of enrichment. Here the deity is visualized as having the constitution of the earth element, and the wind of the earth element is inducted into the central channel. Then the following mantra is recited: OṂ LOCANĀVAŚUDHE[362] so and so (che ge mo) PUṢṬIṂ KURU SVĀHĀ.[363]
The fourfold union of the wind of the fire element denotes the rite of subjugation. Here the deity is visualized as having the constitution of the fire element, and the wind of the fire element is inducted into the central channel. Then the following mantra is recited: OṂ PAṆḌARAVĀSINĪ SARATA so and so (che ge mo) VAIṢAṬA.[364]
The fourfold union of the wind of the wind element denotes the rite of wrath. Here the deity is visualized as having the constitution of the wind element, and the wind of the wind element {205} is inducted into the central channel. Then the following mantra is recited: OṂ TĀRE TUTTĀRE TURE so and so (che ge mo) MĀRAYA HŪṂ.[365]

Moreover, in the case of those practicing the twelve great rites[366]—which include ritual separation, paralysis, obfuscation, alleviation of poison, expulsion, affliction through fever, and the thrusting of the ritual spike—the deity is visualized as having the constitution of the space element, and the wind of the space element is inducted into the central channel. Through your meditating that the object of the attainment disappears, it does disappear. Through such experiential cultivation, the subtle energy of life breath is inducted into the vital essence and then retained.[367]

You should adopt the essential physical posture [as above]. Within the empty space of your own body, the central channel, with the thickness of an average reed, is the life-giving axis of the six cakras. At its upper extremity there is a white vital essence in the form of HAṂ, and at its lower extremity there is a red vital essence in the form of HOḤ, which resembles lightning. OṂ is at the brow, ĀḤ at the throat, HŪṂ at the heart, and KṢA at the secret cakra. A gentle, long breath should be refined, igniting the KṢA and burning propensities within the channels at the secret cakra and thereafter at the navel, at the heart, at the throat, and at the brow. From the HAṂ, generative fluid then arises, filling the channel branches [of the crown cakra] with fire. Then gradually it fills the throat, the heart, the navel, and the secret cakra. Recognizing this uncontaminated state, you should focus one-pointedly on the absence of thought, expelling the ocean [of thoughts], and do not block the wind but leave it in its natural place. Then you should push the upper and lower winds below the navel. Do not inhale the life breath. Mingle the three winds—upper, middle, and lower—and prolong them repeatedly. The lower wind should then be pushed out, and the subtle energy of life breath should be pushed into its natural location.

Although the sufferings of cyclic existence are inconceivable, when subsumed they comprise the suffering of suffering, the suffering of change, and the suffering of conditioned existence.[370]
As to the first of these, the suffering of suffering,[371] the hot hells comprise {206} (i) the reviving hell, (ii) the black line hell, (iii) the crushing hell, (iv) the howling hell, (v) the great howling hell, (vi) the heating hell, (vii) the intense heating hell, and (viii) the hell of ultimate torment.[372] The cold hells comprise (i) the blistering hell, (ii) the blister-bursting hell, (iii) the hell of groans, (iv) the hell of lamentations, (v) the hell of chattering teeth, (vi) the hell of lily-like cracks, (vii) the hell of lotus-like cracks, and (viii) the hell of large lotus-like cracks.[373] In addition, there are the ephemeral hells and the neighboring hells, the last of which are located in each of the four directions of the eight hot hells. They comprise (i) the pit of burning embers, (ii) the swamp of putrefied corpses, (iii) the plain of razors, (iv) the forest of swordlike leaves, and (v) the hill of iron shamali trees.[374]
The anguished spirits comprise (i) those who suffer from external obscurations, (ii) those who suffer from internal obscurations, and (iii) those who suffer from obscurations about food and drink.[375]
The animal realm comprises (i) those living in the ocean depths and (ii) those who are scattered elsewhere.[376]
You should reflect that you have no choice but to avoid being born in these lower realms.
As for the suffering of change:[377] Cyclic existence is impermanent and pointless. Having been born as Śakra, one will again fall to earth. Having been born as a universal emperor, one will be reborn as the lowest of servants. Having attained the realms of the gods, one will be reborn in the hells. The sun and moon will enter into darkness. The wealthy will become impoverished. The strong will become weak. Enemies will become friends. Friends will become foes. If one considers people who are natives and migrants, they were not so in the past, but gradually their circumstances came about through change.

As for the suffering of conditioned existence:[378] Even after the aged have died, they will have no satisfaction, and even after acting through a succession of lives, their karma will not be ended. By reflecting in this manner, if you think decisively that wherever you may be born as a sentient being, there will be no happiness, by all means you will gravitate toward the sacred doctrine. The freedoms and advantages are hard to find. They are of great benefit, but such opportunities will not last for long. The basis on which these are attained is this very human body that is endowed with freedoms and advantages.
As for the freedoms and advantages: Among the latter there are five individual advantages and there are five circumstantial advantages.[379] Though they are hard to find, at times when these are obtained, you should take on board the essential points; for at such times as this the celestial realms of the next life, the nirvana of the lower vehicles, {206} and even omniscient buddhahood can all be attained. These freedoms and advantages that are hard to find are impermanent phenomena, so the opportunity will not last for a long time. This is because the life span of the beings of Jambudvīpa is uncertain. There are many disharmonious conditions, and the harmonious conditions are rare, so one does not know when one will die.
You should have confidence in causes and their results. Reflect on nonvirtuous actions, virtuous actions, and neutral actions. By engaging in the ten nonvirtuous actions to a greater, middling, or lesser extent, you will be reborn in the three aforementioned inferior realms. Since suffering arises from nonvirtuous actions, you should instantly desist from them. Through the maturation of having practiced the ten virtuous actions, the result is that you will be reborn in the blissful realms. You should consider that the three degrees of enlightenment[380] will be attained and that there are advantages in virtuous action. There are also neutral motivations that are not retained by any thought of virtue or nonvirtue, so whatever aspects of the actions of body, speech, and mind you might practice, these should be retained by enlightened mind.

In terms of experiential appearances:[381] You should cultivate, in common, loving-kindness, compassion, and the altruism of enlightened mind. For ordinary friends and foes you should cultivate loving-kindness. With regard to compassion, you should rejoice in sentient beings who encounter happiness and the causes of happiness: “Pity those designated as sentient beings who suffer due to fundamental ignorance, even though sentient beings are established to be without self! Pity those who engage in the causes of suffering! Pity those sentient beings who suffer due to attachment to the notion of an individual person and to phenomena, even though these are established to be without genuine inherent existence!”
Then you should reflect, “Would that I, aspiring to enlightened mind, might attain buddhahood for the sake of all sentient beings! Like the thirsty who desire water, I should achieve whatever sentient beings may desire because they have been my mother!” Visualize sentient beings in front and abandon your self-cherishing. “May all the negative actions of sentient beings be ripened in myself! May my own happiness and virtuous actions be ripened in sentient beings!”
After making such reflections, {208} you should train in austerities—assuming the burdens of others and so forth. You should determine decisively that the happiness of yourself and the suffering of others, which are respectively the subject and object to be exchanged, are the perceptions of your own mind. They are nonexistent, that is to say, empty. You should hone this realization to the correct standard.
Then, once you have entered into the profound uncommon path, the experiential appearances that may arise are inconceivable. However, when these are subsumed, they number fifteen—the three paths, the three experiences, the three auspicious circumstances, the three aspects of warmth, and the three meditative stabilities.[382] You should meditate, thinking that since these attributes originate dependent on the auspicious circumstances of subtle energy, there is nothing harmonious that they should like, and there is nothing disharmonious that they should dislike.

You should meditate, thinking that innumerable enlightened attributes such as these are acquired through the experiential cultivation of the path.

At this point you should receive empowerment, which is the causal basis [or ground] among the three continua [of ground, path, and result]. After that, when you examine outer [appearances] and inner mind, outside there is nothing at all, and [internally] also, the mind is radiant in its essential nature and empty in its natural expression. When it is radiant, it is empty; and when it is empty, it is radiant. You should establish decisively and without wavering that the integration of these two [radiance and emptiness] indivisibly is the essential nature of mind. At that time, if thoughts are diffused, do not prolong them. Let any thoughts that arise be equipoised in that integrated disposition.[384]
Due to a misunderstanding of the three attributes [radiance, emptiness, and unity] that are present here and now, there are twenty-seven coemergent factors through which beings then roam in cyclic existence.[385] But mind is a magical display, without inherent existence, and there are four principal examples and four ancillary examples through which this nature of mind is established.[386] First, sleep and perception should be intermingled, and any distinction between dreams and the present waking state should be experienced. You should develop the certainty that fact is fiction. Then, afterward, the merit should be dedicated {209} with compassion for unrealized beings, and you should remember always the examples and their meanings.[387] That is to say, you should develop certainty according to the first example[—namely, sleep—] through the three phases of preparation, main practice, and conclusion. Even if this takes a long time, you should not transfer your focus to the second [visualization] onward. Next, you may also connect the [aforementioned] nine factors[388] with the remaining examples. To point out the essence of these [remaining] examples, they concern substances, illnesses, evil spirits, double vision, blurred vision, whirling fire, and rapid spinning. You should cut off conceptual elaboration, determining that, dependent on these examples, this world of appearances has not been created by chance, or by mighty Īśvara, or by indivisible particles and so forth, but is the emanation of your own mind.[389]

Next, to establish that mind is a magical display, there are the four principal examples—namely, magical display, mirage, the moon reflected in water, and lightning; and there are four ancillary examples—namely, Hari,[390] gandharva spirit towns, clouds, and rainbows. Through these examples you should cut off conceptual elaborations, determining that in mind itself there is no genuine inherent existence, and that transformations in relation to the nature of mind arise dependent on diverse causes and conditions.[391]
Next, there are four principal examples of dependent origination—namely, oral recitations, lamps, mirrors, and seals; and four ancillary examples—namely, magnifying fire crystal, seeds, sour tastes, and echoes. The point of these examples is that the causes and conditions of a magical display [and so forth] are without any genuine existence at all, that causes do not at all come into being as results, and that results do not at all arise dependent on causes, so that there is no coming or going, and no arising or ceasing.[392]

Next, there are four primary examples of the inexpressibility of mind—namely, the laughter of a child, the dreams of a mute, the tickling of a sensitive spot, and the bliss of the sexual organs; and there are four ancillary examples—namely, the pristine cognition of the third empowerment, union with a secret consort, waves of enjoyment,[393] and the circle of the maṇḍala. Although certainty arises that all things are dependently originated, you should remain equipoised in the absence of expression because [a specified] “this” cannot be expressed.[394] {210}
Once you have established the meaning of mind by means of thirty-two examples in that manner, these are then reduced to the four principal examples. The four points are individually established in accordance with their respective four examples, and [the nature of] mind should then be established. That is to say, these four examples concern magical display, the moon reflected in water, the seedling of dependent origination, and the tickling of a sensitive spot indicative of inexpressibility; and they respectively convey certainty with respect to the nature of mind, magical display, dependent origination, and inexpressibility. These should be intermingled with perception and experientially cultivated.
When these four are then reduced to a single example, certainty is developed as follows: The coemergent pristine cognition arises dependent on the “wave of enjoyment,” and it should be established according to the [same] four attributes: the nature of mind, magical display, dependent origination, and inexpressibility. So this [practice of the “wave of enjoyment”] should be experientially cultivated in the aforementioned manner [of the four examples].[395]
You should meditate strongly and for a short session, without letting ordinary thoughts interrupt the generation stage of meditation. Finally, the middle eye [of a deity representing pristine cognition] becomes clear and the nature of mind is apprehended. Then slightly relax your effort. If there is no clarity, you should look at the middle eye of a painted icon and it should become clear. Then you should meditate, focusing on all its eyes. After that, you should meditate as before on the entire head and the entire body [of the deity], and so forth, together with the maṇḍala of seats, the celestial palace of the deity, and the protective circle.[396]

Next, after receiving instruction on consciousness transference at the time of death by means of globes of light,[398] you should enter into the path of the secret empowerment. {211} [Here, meditative concentration emphasizes the path of the fierce inner heat, and there are seven initial steps through which it can be activated—namely, (i) adamantine recitation on the path of breath control, (ii–iv) the three pith instructions concerning exhalation, (v–vi) the two pith instructions concerning inhalation or filling, and (vii) the union of the upper and lower winds that makes the pausing of breath into the path.][399]

At first you should begin with breath control, since this is analogous to the dispelling of defects. Focusing on the right side of the tip of the nose, you should be mindful that you are exhaling while exhaling, inhaling while inhaling, and pausing while the breathing is slightly paused. Having focused one-pointedly on this breathing, if extraneous thoughts do not move, that is the path that will dispel the [involuntary] inhalation.[400] In order to achieve success, you should [gradually] invigorate breath control.[401] To that end, the exhalation should be lengthened and the inhalation and pausing of breath shortened. You should then let meditative stability arise and begin with mindfully inhaling, pausing, and exhaling the vital breath. While inhaling you should visualize the syllable OṂ, while pausing visualize ĀḤ, and while exhaling visualize HŪṂ.[402]
As an ancillary practice contingent on that, the inhalation should then be lengthened and the exhalation shortened, and commensurately the mental faculty should also be mindful of lengthening the inhalation, pausing, and then shortening the exhalation.[403]

Next you should cease that exertion and apply the pith instructions concerning exhalation. To that end, you should raise the head slightly and focus on the tip of the nose or else on the left nostril. Then you should block the [right] nostril with the raised [middle finger of the right hand] forming the gesture of menace, inhale a long breath, and then exhale forcefully through the left nostril. This is in order to dispel defects, [giving rise to the nonconceptual meditative stability].[404]
Next, exhale your breath vigorously through both nostrils, focusing consciousness on the hair ringlet between the eyebrows. Strengthen its passageway through the two nostrils, the vital places of wind, and forcefully exhale it from the body.[405] You should maintain this exhalation as long as possible and then focus the vital wind on the space in front, about the distance of one cubit, and after that focus it about the distance of one double arm span, then about the length of a spear, then about the distance of a wide valley, then about the distance of a journey, then the distance of the four continents, then the distance of the trichiliocosm, and finally the entire space occupied by the world systems.[406]
Last, when exhalation is accompanied with sound, {212} you should clench the teeth and focus the vital mind on the space forming the horizon, about one double arm span in extent. Then focus on the sound of si and exhale the vital wind between the teeth with the sound of si.[407]
As indications of success [in these three branches of exhalation], there will be a wind similar to the smoke of incense that will emerge from the rectum, and you should be aware that it circulates about one cubit below [the rectum]. Then you should compress the upper wind as much as possible and slightly draw in the lower wind. At that time also you should not allow the abdomen to swell.[408]

You should then cease that exertion and fill [the central channel] with vital breath. Visualize that the wind moves softly downward to the navel cakra within an eggshell-like globe that is white on the outside and yellow on the inside. Soundlessly swallow the spittle on which the wind rides and compress the wind as much as possible. It is said that the experiences of a mighty lord of yoga will indeed arise through this practice.[409]
Next, you should visualize that all the winds move softly downward to the navel cakra within a blue hexahedron. Open the mouth and soundlessly inhale a long and slow breath of wind through the mouth. On completing this, you should swallow the spittle soundlessly and shake the head.[410]
Last, you should focus on both of these visualizations in common, and immediately thereafter, in the navel cakra, which is the focal point of the meditation, you should visualize a fire, two or four finger widths in length. Within the navel cakra the hexahedron extends in size, commensurate with the earth. By compressing the wind, the hexahedron increases in size and finally it covers the entire earth. You should meditate that the wind enters within its empty interior and that it is indeed profound and deep in the manner of an ocean.[411]

There then ensues the union [of the upper and lower winds]: You should visualize that at the navel cakra, the fire of the channel of fierce inner heat in the shape of an ashé (the stroke of the letter a) is subtle, hot, sharp, and volatile.
First, draw in the lower wind slightly, and without a sound gradually draw in the upper wind with exertion, so that it almost reaches the head, and meditate that all this wind then dissolves into the fire at the navel cakra. {213} Once this [movement of] the upper wind is completed, you should swallow some spittle. Then strongly draw in the lower wind, unite the upper and lower winds in the navel cakra, and squeeze the stomach against the spine. The abdomen should be slightly pushed out, the Adam’s apple slightly compressed, and the wind held as long as possible.[412]
The pith instructions of the fierce inner heat [that are not contingent on the cakras] are respectively named (i) sustaining the lamp flame, (ii) the lightning bolt of the fontanel, (iii) the yoga of the channels, (iv) the wheel of the kindling sticks, (v) the union of sun and moon vital essences at the heart cakra, (vi) the solitary hero at the navel cakra, (vii) the vital essence of bliss at the secret cakra, and (viii) the seed of white hair at the ūrṇa.[413] [In the case of those pith instructions that are contingent on the cakras] the practice will be sharp if it is contingent on one cakra, swift if contingent on two cakras, and stable if contingent on four cakras.[414]
There are seven phases [of this fierce inner heat practice] according to the key points of the pith instructions: (i) the pale-red fire, (ii) the blazing fire, (iii) the battle of the [white and red] vital essences, (iv) the visualization of the [fire at the navel] cakra, (v) the intensely blazing fire, [(vi) the greatly blazing fire,] and (vii) the totally blazing fire.[415]

When engaging in the path according to [the empowerment of] discerning pristine cognition, there are three phases: the preparation in which blessing is conferred by means of three perceptions; the main practice, which concerns the recognition of the descent and retention [of the vital essence]; and the conclusion, which concerns the preservation [of the vital essence] without diminution, by means of its reversal and distribution.[416]

When you engage in the path according to the fourth empowerment, this entails the practice named “waves of the physical body.” Here you should adopt the [appropriate] physical posture. Cover the knees with the hands, straighten the waist, press the stomach against the spine, induct the upper wind by means of three exhalations and three inhalations, and compress [the lower wind] below the right and left buttocks, alternately contracting it gently and then drawing it in forcefully. If it were contracted forcefully, its strength would be dissipated. When you release these winds, the lower wind should be released first.[417]
Next comes the practice named “calm and intense waves of vocal inhalation.” [In the case of calm vocal inhalation,] you should adopt the [adamantine] physical posture and cross the hands at the heart in the gesture of the adamantine fist. You should hunch the body forward without quite touching the ground. Then, with the intonation of the syllable i, inhale the wind through the teeth without making a sound. As the inner wind is drawn upward, you should slowly draw it in through the mouth as much as you can, {214} and in tandem with that you should gradually but strongly contract the base of the small intestine along with the lower wind. Finally, you should raise your head and cast the eyes upward. You should compress the winds as much as possible, and practice this three times in front, three times on the right side, and three times on the left side. Having experienced that, you should emit a sound like that of a flute.
In the case of the intense vocal inhalation, the vital points of body and speech should be positioned as before, but here you should inhale more and more intensely, in conjunction with the sound hūṃ. At the conclusion, you should emit a sound like that of a brass horn heard from a distance.[418]

Last, there is the practice named “waves of the mind.”[419] Here you should be instantly equipoised by means of three perceptions that are dependent on the seal of pristine cognition.[420] So it has three aspects, as follows:
[Firstly, there is the purification of the mental continuum of those endowed with skillful means:] Once the generative essences of both the male and the female appear at the extremity of the central channel, they are transformed into rays of light. Moving from the right channel they appear at the navel cakra—[the white vital essence] causing the navel cakra to vanish like darkness at the break of day, and [the red vital essence] causing it to radiate like the rising sun, while [the wind] causes it to swell like an inflated lung.
Again, moving from the right channel, the vital essences appear at the throat cakra, whereupon you are mindful of possessing the [same] three attributes [of whiteness, brightness, and inflation].
Again, moving from the right channel, the vital essences are diffused from the right ear in the form of rays of light, and from the entrance to those rays of light the maṇḍala of your preferred deity is emanated. Then the four empowerments are conferred in the mental continuum of sentient beings. The inhabited world is transformed into the celestial palace and its sentient inhabitants into your preferred deity. Then the entire inhabited world and its inhabitants are transformed into rays of light. Mingling with the rays of light that are [already] diffused afar, these are transformed into the elixir of nectar and enter through your fontanel. At the crown cakra you are mindful of possessing those three attributes [of whiteness, brightness, and inflation], at the throat cakra there is the splendor of one thousand suns, and, appearing at the heart cakra, these are transformed into five-colored lights as a sign that your own mental continuum has been transformed into the five buddha bodies.
You should then visualize that the pathway of the pure channels originates from the navel cakra {215} and that [the vital essences] abide as before in the secret cakra of the female consort. Thereby apprehended conceptual thoughts subside, the right channel is brought under control, and power is obtained over the [lower] wind of exertion. You should simply determine that signlessness, the gateway of liberation, has been actualized.

<d e="2">
Then in the same manner you should repeat this practice from the left channel. Thereby the apprehending conceptual thoughts subside, the left channel is brought under control, and power is obtained over the [upper] wind of life breath. You should then visualize that aspirationlessness, the gateway of liberation, has been actualized.
Similarly, you should repeat this practice from the central channel. Thereby subtle conceptual thoughts of both aspects of the subject-object dichotomy subside, the central channel is refined, and power is obtained over the location of the winds. You should then visualize that emptiness, the gateway of liberation, has been actualized.[421]
Secondly, there is the purification of the mental continuum of those endowed with discriminative awareness: Here the visualization that refines the three channels of the female consort should be undertaken as before, but in this case, apart from [the vital essences] simply moving from the right and left channels to the orifices of both the left and right ears, there is no external diffusion. Whether or not these are diffused from and absorbed into the fontanel, this is said to be the case.[422]
Thirdly, there is the purification of disparate mental continua: Here the pure generative essence emerges from the central channel of the male consort in the form of light rays and vanishes into the supreme protuberance. The pure generative essence of the female consort similarly vanishes. Then you should simply be mindful that both of these become spontaneously present as the five buddha bodies.
It is said that there is no need for these experiences to occur in tandem with the rising and induction of the upper and lower winds, and that there is no need for the precision of the four [daily] sessions of meditation. At that time, you should spontaneously nurture whatever imprecise experiences arise. Consequently, the experience of the four delights ascending from below,[423] the view that is the utterly pure real nature of all things, will arise within your mental continuum. This is the instruction on the path of immaculate and innate pristine cognition, for those who are most lethargic.[424]

This is the first of the Eight Further Cycles of the Path. After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment, you should hone the vital points of body, speech, and mind. After meditating on the teacher and cultivating divine pride, you should train outwardly, taking space as an exemplary model. Focus your own consciousness on the space that is up to four finger widths from the tip of your nose, and meditate, concentrating with both body and mind. After that, you should again train in the same manner, focusing on the space that is up to eight finger widths distant, and also in the same manner, focusing on the space that is anything from sixteen finger widths up to a double arm span distant. You should maintain [your concentration] in this manner, whatever experiences arise in the mind. For the most part, you will experience the emptiness of inherent existence.[426]
Then, in order to achieve success, you should focus your thoughts on the eastern direction, starting from a double arm span in distance and continuing as far as the limits of space. Whatever experiences of limitlessness, feebleness, or attachment to splendor might arise, you should maintain [your concentration] in this [uncontrived] manner. Then you should similarly train, focusing your thoughts on all the other directions of space, starting from the south.[427]

When you train in that manner [there then ensue the three equipoises in the nature of reality]: (i) you will be united in the inconceivable nonarising of names, which resembles the hatching of an egg; (ii) you will be united in the inconceivable nonarising of meanings, which resembles the release from a trap; and (iii) you will also be united in the inconceivable nonarising of meditative stability, which resembles the breaking open of a cocoon.
As to [the first of these], the thoughts that the yogin might grasp as names dissolve into the nature of mind, and the experience of unceasing luminosity arises. As for the inconceivable nonarising of meanings, you should meditate that intrinsic awareness, in the manner of space, does not arise, whether in terms of its initial causal basis,[428] its presently abiding nature, or its conclusive cessation. Then, as for the inconceivable nonarising of meditative stability, internally you should let [the mental faculty] rest without grasping, {217} and externally you should let [consciousness] relax. You should lighten your body and mind, and simply be mindful that consciousness is introverted. But if it does become diffused, you should let the sensory gates relax, and, free from attachment, the supreme coalescence of bliss and emptiness will arise.[429]

Then, with regard to the supportive ancillary practices,[430] you should place a flower at a suitable distance in front, and train in the four ancillaries that comprise the unchanging support, the unmoving body, the unclosing eyes, and the nongrasping mental faculty. You should recognize [pristine cognition] through sights, and, similarly, you should then also train with reference to [other sensory objects] such as sounds.[431]
At first when you meditate, objects will sometimes be harmful and sometimes beneficial, owing to their conditions. But when they arise as subtle appearances, they will be neither beneficial nor harmful; and [for those of highest capacity] as soon as an object and its conditions are encountered, supreme realization will internally arise.[432] These three phases are respectively known as the time when appearances arise as a spiritual mentor, the time when outer and inner phenomena are both intermingled [in a common savor], and the time when the five poisons are cognized as medications.[433]
Then you should eliminate dullness and mental agitation that are obstacles to meditative concentration. That is to say, you should eliminate the dullness and mental agitation that are purposeful, the dullness and mental agitation that arise through conditions, and the dullness and mental agitation that arise implicitly.[434] [Should these occur during the first session of meditative concentration,] they may be eliminated through regimen, through diet, or the power of mind.[435]

As for the instruction of Padmavajra, which is the second of the Eight Further Cycles of the Path: After refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment, there are nine pith instructions concerning the retention of the mind—namely, {218} (i) mental placement, (ii) perpetual placement, (iii) integrated placement, (iv) intensified placement, (v) control, (vi) calmness, (vii) quiescence, (viii) one-pointedness, and (ix) absolute placement [or meditative equipoise].[439]
(i) [As to the first, mental placement:] you should concentrate and meditate with utmost effort, starting from the yoga of reemergence until [the visualization of the deity] is secured in accordance with the lord of your enlightened heritage.[440]
(ii) Then [as for perpetual placement]: At the outset you should focus your mind on the central eye [of the deity]. If it is clear, even though it is clear, you should then discontinue the visualization. If it is unclear, even though it is unclear, you should discontinue the visualization. For [in both cases] the [distracting] defects of meditative concentration will arise. If, even following that discontinuation, the visualization should again become vibrant, [your meditative concentration] will be defective, so let the mind wander to another object such as a vase or a blanket, and then resume the meditation. Once again, if the visualization is clear, even though it is clear, you should discontinue it; and if it is unclear, even though it is unclear, you should discontinue it and let your mind wander. Through your meditating in this manner, the visualization should [gradually] be established.

If, however, such [distracting] defects of meditative concentration continue to arise, and even after repeated experience the visualization does not become clear, then you should cultivate the “visualization that follows speech.” This has two aspects, among which the first is visualization by means of your own speech. Here you should say, “The central eye [of the deity] is the primary eye, red in color and wrathful,” and then you should meditate while the defects of meditative concentration arise as before. If the visualization does not become clear even on that basis, you should have someone else say, “The central eye [of the deity]…” and meditate on that while the [distracting] defects of meditation arise. If the visualization does not become clear even on that basis, you should cultivate “visualization by means of observation.” Draw an extremely beautiful central eye and look at it. Then meditate while the [distracting] defects of meditative concentration arise. These constitute the oral instructions of perpetual placement.[441]

(iii) As far as integrated placement is concerned, if your consciousness is diffused outwardly, {219} it can be swiftly drawn back if you think, “My consciousness has become agitated.” In this way, the mind will quickly find its placement in the visualization.[442]
(iv) As for intensified placement, you should meditate with a single visualization that the defects of the mind in each session [of meditation] resemble the protuberance of the head, a crossed vajra, or the fangs in the face [of a wrathful deity]. This should be meditated on in conjunction with exhalation of breath.[443]
(v) As for control, you should know that meditative stability is endowed with innumerable enlightened attributes, and even at the time of engaging in conduct, although the visualization is not clear, you should control the mind by always recalling the form of the deity.[444]
(vi) As for calmness, if conceptual thoughts are diffused, at the time when the mind is displeased, the mind should be relaxed and calmed on the basis of that visualization.[445]
(vii) As for quiescence, when nonvirtuous thoughts arise, including malice, these should be made quiescent dependent on that visualization.[446]
(viii) As for one-pointedness, if the mind is present without [thoughts] being outwardly diffused, on that basis placement in one-pointedness is achieved.[447]
(ix) As for absolute placement, here meditative stability will arise without being purposefully achieved, on the basis of those visualizations.[448]

Through this oral instruction that holds the mind on a single facet of the body [of the deity] according to the generation stage of meditation, you should also transfer the visualization to other facets of the deity’s body once the mind has been stabilized in the [initial] single facet of the deity’s body. That is to say, during the first session [of the first day], you should meditate on the central eye [of the deity]. In the second, you should visualize the three eyes [of the deity]. In the third, [you should visualize] the wrathful frowns. And in the fourth, the nose [of the deity]. On the second and third days [of the retreat], you may also meditate in a clear manner on the three eyes [of the deity]. In brief, you should maintain steadfast visualization until the three eyes [of the deity] become clear if you want them to be clear, and invisible if you want them to be invisible.

In addition, during the first session of the second day, you should visualize the fangs [of the wrathful deity Hevajra]; {220} in the second session, the ears; in the third, the face; and in the fourth, the white right arm. During the first session of the third day, you should visualize the primary face and the right-sided white face. During the second session of that day, you should visualize the red left arm; in the third, the second face of the right side, which is black; and in the fourth, you should visualize the second face of the left side, which is black, and the upper face. During the first session of the fourth day, you should visualize the eight faces; during the second session, the protuberance of the head, the yellowish-red hair of the head, and the crossed vajra. During the third session of that day, you should visualize the ornaments of the head, including the wheel of bone and the earrings. During the fourth session, you should visualize most of the deity’s body including the neck ornaments. During the first session of the fifth day, you should visualize the heads and most of the deity’s body. During the second, you should visualize the eight right arms and their hand emblems. During the third, you should visualize the eight left arms and their hand emblems, along with the body ornaments, including human heads, and the [peripheral] mountain of fire. During the fourth, you should visualize the legs that suppress the four demonic forces. During the first session of the sixth day, you should visualize the principal deity [Hevajra] along with Gaurī; during the second, Caurī; during the third, Vetālī; and during the fourth, Ghasmarī. During the first session of the seventh day, you should visualize, in addition to the group of five comprising the principal deity and that entourage, Pukkāsī. In the second session of that day, you should visualize Śabarī; in the third, Caṇḍālī; and in the fourth, Ḍombī.

In the second session of that day, you should visualize the charnel ground; in the third, the protective circle; and in the fourth, the three world systems—the inhabited environment and its inhabitants, along with the wheel of the maṇḍala. All these constitute the visualizations of the generation stage.[449]

Next you should focus also on the perfection stage, which resembles the tip of a flame.[450] [The aforementioned visualization,] from the three world systems to the wheel of the maṇḍala, is dissolved in succession; {221} and you should then meditate on the vital essence as a mass of light. If that is clear, you should focus your mind on the tip of a lamp flame; and if that is clear, on a line the thickness of a horse’s tail hair; and one-hundredth of a horse’s tail hair; and finally on emptiness, in the manner of warm breath evaporating on a mirror.[451]
Having undertaken clear visualizations in that manner, starting from then, when you want to place [the mind in meditation], you should commence the sessions of meditation on emptiness with the dissolving of the three world systems, and you should continue to dissolve them until they are empty. If you want to arise [from meditation], you should adopt [a postmeditative state] with pride that chiefly derives from the disposition of emptiness. You should recollect virtuous actions and recite adamantine songs and pure prayers of aspiration, and abide in accordance with the yoga of conduct.[452]

As for the instruction of Ḍombipā, which is the third of the Eight Further Cycles of the Path: After you have taken refuge and set the mind on enlightenment, there are two methods by which individuals may attain the path—through the [outer] way of austerities and the [inner] way of Buchung.[454] In both of these there are three things not to be squandered—that is to say, resources should not be squandered, the physical body should not be squandered, and the mind should not be squandered. The first of these requires that resources should not be squandered due to fire, water, foes, or demonic forces, and instead they should be dedicated to the three precious jewels and to the ḍākinīs. The second requires that the physical body should observe the three vows—namely, the vows of individual liberation, those of the bodhisattvas, and those of the awareness holders. The nonsquandering of the mind refers to the two aspects of enlightened mind—namely, the outer aspect, where the relative enlightened mind comprises aspiration and application[455] and the ultimate enlightened mind denotes the absence of conceptual elaboration; and the inner aspect, where the relative enlightened mind comprises the generative essences and the ultimate enlightened mind denotes the [coalescence of] bliss and emptiness.[456]
Next there is the method of instruction on the path by means of the threefold coemergence: {222} (i) the coemergence of the causal basis naturally abides, (ii) the coemergence of skillful means denotes the methods that generate the three meditative experiences, and (iii) the coemergence of the result denotes the three gateways of liberation and the arising of the three buddha bodies.[457]
Confronting this coemergence are internal obstacles that are coemergent with the three humoral disorders and external obstacles that are coemergent with the three demonic forces. Among them, the former comprise disorders of wind, disorders of blood and bile combined, and disorders of phlegm. The three demonic forces comprise the class of male demons, the class of female demons, and the class of nāgas.[458]

The first aspect of the threefold coemergence, the coemergence of the causal basis, is the nonarising abiding nature—the actual nature of mind. The second, the coemergence of skillful means[—namely, the path—] denotes two methods of practice that accord with two sorts of individuals. That is to say, once individuals practicing austerity have first entered upon the path,[459] they should initially be mindful of the teacher on the crown of the head and cultivate the precious enlightened mind; and after that, they should be instantaneously mindful of deity yoga.
[Common to both the way of austerities and the way of Buchung,] there are twenty-seven pith instructions on the meditative experiences associated with physical exercises, dependent on which joy and bliss arise in the mind, harsh speech and so forth will arise, and you will suddenly cry out. Such is the meditative stability named “pervasion of body, speech, and mind with great desire.”[460] When bliss arises, if consciousness is clear and light, and great compassion emerges, that is meditative stability.[461]
Next, since hatred is a culmination of radiance, hatred is also transformed into the path. It arises as the culmination of radiance due to the condition of unpleasant objects.[462]
Also, since there is no awareness and no conception of any object at all, this is [a state of] great fundamental ignorance. In this way, delusion, the afflicted mental state, arises on the path.[463]
Through the twenty-four ancillary pith instructions that accord with these [three primary pith instructions], the experiences of the coemergence of the path will develop.[464]

You should let the visualizations of the generation stage dissolve [into the syllable HŪṂ within the heart cakra, and finally] Vajravārāhī also dissolves into the syllable AṂ [within the navel cakra].[467] When light has emerged from that aṃ, you should then visualize the two active cakras and the four higher cakras in descending order;[468] and then you should visualize the three channels—the right and left channels blocked by their [respective] seed syllables.[469]

The wind of the rectum causes the fire of the triple intersection to blaze, and this ignites the syllable AṂ at the navel cakra. You should then gulp in the upper wind, along with spittle, and meditate that it is compressed as much as possible. Visualize that the fire of AṂ burns uncontrollably, and then, without drawing in the lower wind, the fire continues to blaze uncontrollably.[470]
Moving in association with the right channel, [at the heart cakra] this fire will burn the five lords of enlightened heritage and their five female consorts,[471] and then, exiting from the right nostril, it will be diffused. You should do this initially only once, and then increase the practice from ten times and one hundred times to an inconceivable number of times. The fire should then gradually enter through the left nostril of the Tathāgata, [seated] in the space [above your head], and several times reverse upward or downward. In this way, it will cause the four cakras of the Tathāgata and the nectars of the elements to melt together, and these are then drawn along in the manner of blood drawn by a leech. The nectar flow enters through your own left nostril and strikes the syllable AṂ at your navel cakra, which is strongly aroused. Opening the central channel, it melts the syllables HŪṂ, AṂ, and HAṂ [which are located at your heart, throat, and crown respectively].[472]

The vital essence of generative fluid [thus formed] becomes stronger and stronger, and then from the crown of the head this generative fluid descends and falls to the tip of the vajra (penis), and the experiences of bliss, radiance, and nonconceptualization are perfected through the four aspects of delight that are subsumed within delight, the four aspects of delight that are subsumed within supreme delight, {224} the four aspects of delight that are subsumed within absence of delight, and the four aspects of delight that are subsumed within coemergent delight.

As for the instruction of Acyutakāṇha, which is the fifth of the Eight Further Cycles of the Path: after first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment, you should be seated on a comfortable mat and be mindful of your meditational deity.[476]
Then you should practice the yogic exercises: Place your hands on the knees, forming the gesture of the adamantine fist. Turn the eyes upward, let the tongue touch the palate, close the teeth, and open the mouth. Then you should unite the upper and lower winds, press the abdomen strongly toward the spine, and then gradually raise the hands above the knees so that the elbows almost reach the knees. If the calf muscles are taut, they may slightly tremble, but the wind will be secured. Whenever you do this practice, whether counting the sessions or not, as soon as you have performed that yogic exercise to some extent, you will progress toward the meditative stability of radiance and emptiness, and thereupon you will have completed [the first yogic exercise].[477]
In order to stabilize this practice [there are other yogic exercises]: Place your left fist upon the heart, raise the right fist, and then unite [the upper and lower] winds. Then, reversing that, you should raise the left fist.[478]
Also, you should position the right and left hands as if stretching a bowstring; or else raise both hands toward the sky, or meditate, securing the gesture of the closed fist, with the arms crossed at the heart.[479]
In whatever manner you secure these yogic exercises, the ineffable meditative stability will arise in your mental continuum {225} and you will reach the conclusion of this practice.[480]

As for the instruction of Indrabhūti, which is the sixth of the Eight Further Cycles of the Path: After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment, you should undertake the yogic exercises of the physical body: Cover your knees with both hands, cast the eyes downward toward the tip of the nose, and draw in the lower wind strongly. Then you should drag the syllable hūṃ, slow and long, from the chest and compress it. At that time, if you have a pain in the perinephric area, you should shake the abdomen, sit up,[482] and tie soft material such as silk around your waist. If you have a headache, you should shake your head. If you have a pain in the upper part of the body, you should rock it. If you train in this manner for one week, a fortnight, or twenty-one days, you will acquire control over the downward purgative wind to some extent.[483]
Until then, you should initially maintain the view that is imbued with the following four defining characteristics: permeation of material entities in the abiding nature, imperishability due to formative conditioning, unchangeability through the three times, and understanding of the natural expression of all fields of knowledge.[484]
If you engage in this experiential cultivation, all phenomena will be radiant in the essential nature of your own mind, and empty when they are examined without impediment; this is termed the inseparability of radiance and emptiness. Alternatively, this radiant nature will be intrinsically aware and empty when examined experientially; this is termed the inseparability of awareness and emptiness. Alternatively, your physical body will arise in the form of supreme bliss, and all appearances will arise as supreme bliss, but these are indeed empty when examined; this is termed the inseparability of bliss and emptiness. These should be known, initially through study and reflection, {226} and then they should be nurtured spontaneously and the application of the winds should be refined.[485]

Having refined the winds in the above manner, you should then attain accomplishment dependent on the seal of pristine cognition. You and your female partner should, contingent on the pride of the meditational deity, consecrate the vajra (penis) and lotus (vagina) as a cross (bsnol ma). That is to say, the practitioner should visualize a hexahedron that derives from the syllable E within the lotus of the female consort and, within it a red lotus with eight petals and anthers that derives from the syllable A, each petal of which is marked with A. The visualization should then be stabilized by mantra syllables: [the female] should visualize the five-pronged vajra of the male marked with HŪṂ, and meditate that it has a gemstone derived from OṂ; a jewel crest derived from SVĀ; and at its orifice both a downward-facing dark blue HŪṂ and an upward-facing dark red PHAṬ, which meet at their extremities. The visualizations should be stabilized by those mantra syllables.[486]
Next the very nature of desire comprising ordinary attachment is made into the path, and gradually the very nature of ordinary desire is transformed into the generative essence, aroused and motivated by great compassion. You should reflect that thereby sentient beings may attain buddhahood.[487]
Here the pith instructions that are crucially retained are fivefold: (i) the vital essence of the generative fluids should descend, (ii) it should be retained, and (iii) there should be meditation on bliss; (iv) it should be reversed and made to permeate [the channels]; and (v) it should be conserved, without diminution.
You should gaze upward with the eyes open, let the tongue touch the palate, compress the upper wind, and focus on pushing it down from the lower gate, which resembles a vase with a leaking base. You should then imagine that it is drawn back by the upward-facing PHAṬ and the downward-facing HŪṂ, and then you should actually draw it upward by means of twenty-one slow and long HŪṂ syllables, and so forth.[488]

[In order to enhance bliss,] the lower wind should be slightly contracted, and then, with the eyes open, the breath should slowly and over a long time be drawn upward. {227} It should then be exhaled through both nostrils. Thereby the entire body will be permeated with the meditative stability of bliss and emptiness.[489]
You should then experientially cultivate the method of the sixteen aspects of delight, stabilized from below.[490] When the generative essence is reversed from the very tip of the vajra (penis), the reversal should be made in accordance with the six aspects of transformation. That is to say, you should undertake the visualization while contracting the two thumbs and the two big toes; you should press the abdomen against the spine, turn the tongue inward, intone the long syllable HŪṂ followed by HIK, let the HŪṂ of meditative stability draw in the syllable PHAṬ, and carry it to the crown of the head. Since there will be a residue of generative essence, it should be drawn upward in this manner for a second or third time.[491]
Then you should undertake the practice of permeation. If the generative essence does not spread through the body, you may fall ill and the like. Therefore, you should allow it to permeate in the following manner: shake the head, rock the upper body, turn the waist, wave the arms, dance, or cry out, and so forth. In these ways the generative essence will be carried to its natural place.[492]
You should not abandon your female partner in the manner of the pious attendants. If she were abandoned, your vital essence would not increase, just as when a cow is not milked, its teats will dry up. Therefore, if the vital essence is milked, in the manner of a cow, it will increase; and buddhahood will emerge on the basis of the vital essence.[493]
You should not ejaculate the generative essence in the manner of ordinary persons. If it is ejaculated, all the defects mentioned in the tantras will emerge. Therefore, by means of the descent and reversal of the vital essence, you should visualize that the coemergent pristine cognition is actualized, and so attachment is rejected. Filled with the vital essence, the meditative stability of bliss and emptiness will be uninterrupted.[494]

As for the instruction manual of Vagīśvarakīrti, which is the seventh of the Eight Further Cycles of the Path: After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment, you should meditate on your teacher at the crown of your head. Then visualize the meditational deity and hold the mind by the rope of recollection, wherever it goes. Do not let it escape elsewhere. Nurture this very visualization and retain it without searching for the past or future.[496]
If you cannot retain it, focus on the tip of a [previously consecrated] wooden stick or focus on the sun and moon. If even through that technique you cannot retain it, you should turn your gaze from the tip of the nose or the eyebrows to the navel and refocus the mind. Thereby the mind will be focused.[497]
If you cannot focus the mind with mindfulness, conceptual thoughts will revolve, and finally you will lapse. If that were to happen, you would become a pious attendant, so propel your mind toward a pillar, vase, or some other object, and after withdrawing from that, focus it elsewhere. In brief, when you have control over the mind’s abiding nature and restrain its diffusion through mindfulness, it will be disciplined.[498]
When you see a mirage and mistakenly take it for a lake, while going toward it you should think, “There is no water; it is a mirage,” and when you reach it you will not apprehend anything. You should similarly have certainty concerning the enemies, conflicts, allies, and friendships that may manifest in dreams.[499]
If strong hatred arises, you should realize that it is fictitious, and think that thoughts of hatred are without inherent existence. This is the Great Seal devoid of letters. Letters and conceptual thoughts are inexpressible. The inexpressible is the Great Seal.[500]

In the sky in front, you should offer to the teacher and meditational deity your enemies, friends, and even your own body, and train in the thought that these too are mind, that mind is a magical display, and that this magical display is without inherent existence.[501] As for the sufferings of being roasted and burned that denizens of hell in the underworld experience, these too are mind; that mind is a magical display, and that magical display is without inherent existence. Then again, {229} you should observe the buddha fields of the ten directions—including the east, south, west, and north—with Buddha Vairocana above, gazing upon the one hundred thousand buddhas below; these too are mind, that mind is a magical display, and that magical display is without inherent existence.[502]
You should intermingle this practice with afflicted mental states such as hatred. In one of those directions, for example, you should be attentive that hatred is a magical display or a dream, and realize spontaneously that all appearances and sounds, cyclic existence and nirvana, are at one and the same time the Great Seal devoid of letters and without inherent existence.[503]
When you practice without distinguishing between meditative equipoise and postmeditation, when appearances arise as the master, when afflicted mental states are carried on the path, when conceptual thoughts arise as pristine cognition, when the abyss of the six realms is cut off, and the citadel of the six classes of beings is subjugated, at that time you will realize that the Great Seal is the real nature, devoid of letters, transcending sounds and conceptual thoughts. This is reminiscent of effortlessly meeting a former acquaintance, without ideation or scrutiny.[504]

As for the instruction of Nāgārjuna, which is the eighth of the Eight Further Cycles of the Path: After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment, you should let the mind rest—relaxed, fresh, loose, naturally clear,[506] and uncontrived. Do not search for any virtuous or nonvirtuous actions and so forth that the mind may have acquired. Your mind should be focused thereby, but if it is not focused, post a sentinel and allow it to stray. In this way, your mind will [naturally] return. By practicing in that manner, it will be the norm that you focus on the innate state, in the manner of a hand that is placed wherever a gift is given.[507]
So, in this modality of uncontrived placement, you should inspect your own mind and be mindful that since it has neither beginning nor end, it resembles space; {230} since it has neither birth nor death, it resembles space; since it has neither going nor coming, it resembles space; and since it has neither middle nor extremes, it resembles space.[508]
If the mind does become diffused, you should not search for the past, you should not welcome the future, and you should be mindful of encountering the present. The essential instruction is that you should cultivate certainty in the absence of conceptual elaboration where the three times are without arising, ceasing, or abiding; and juxtapose the experiences of meditative equipoise with conduct during postmeditation.[509]
Here I have set forth in writing this quintessential crucial instruction
That is to be cultivated with confidence,
That generates delight in one’s own mind, in all respects,
And that reveals supreme liberation from bondage.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should refine the essential physical posture by means of meditative stability and clearly visualize your ordinary mental associations as your [meditational] deity.[511] The seed syllable within your heart is then diffused and absorbed, and its rays of light, through their upward diffusion, are offered to the sublime beings [at the crown of your head], entering into their hearts and then returning, so that the blessing of nondual pristine cognition enters into yourself. Through the outward diffusion of these rays of light, you should also visualize that the entire inhabited world is refined as the celestial palace, and its sentient inhabitants as male and female deities. You should then meditate on the teacher [on the crown of your head] and let [all the deities] dissolve therein.[512]
Then, confounded with great astonishment, you should inspect phenomenal existence and profoundly develop the certainty that all things of phenomenal existence are fictitious, like a magical display. You should not immediately contrive anything but determine absolutely that your doubts have been naturally pure from the beginning. You will then become resplendent in natural radiance, dissolved in natural liberation. This is termed the liberation in the buddha body of reality, without duality of cyclic existence and nirvana.[513]
Next, you should develop compassion for those who do not know and have not realized this. {231} The indivisible nature, so designated because it is the disposition of reality’s expanse, is said to be “imbued with the essence of emptiness and compassion.”[514]

Thereby you will effortlessly traverse the supreme path with natural momentum that is the essential meaning of the path. When definitively appraised from top to bottom and dynamically assessed from bottom to top, this comprises (i) the path of provisions, including the virtuous actions that are cultivated and retained; (ii) the path of connections that elucidates and determines general concepts dependent on the appropriate mental states of meditative concentration; (iii) the path of insight that is actualized thereby; (iv) the path of cultivation in which the propensities of afflicted mental states and the subtle impulses of the obscuration of knowledge subside due to that experience; and (v) the path of conclusion in which each subtle stain also becomes quiescent in reality’s expanse, the enlightened attributes of renunciation and realization are perfected, and enlightened activities emerge spontaneously for the sake of sentient beings.[515]
This path should not be bestowed on those of feeble intelligence, who cannot connect with the meaning of the abiding nature. It should be retained by spiritual mentors and bestowed on those who understand the nature of cyclic existence, have abandoned the egotism of this life, and engage in practice in a concentrated manner.[516]

This instruction derives from the cycle of the Dispelling of the Three Obstacles. After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should meditate on yourself as the deity, and from the syllable HŪṂ within your heart, light rays are transformed into a vajra, the center of which is marked with hūṃ, and then diffused, densely filling all the pores of the body. With powerful resonance you should repeatedly intone hūṃ, long and strong, and visualize that the light again is diffused, forming an adamantine wall in all the ten directions. {232} Then you should continue to intone hūṃ. This is the best protection from the three sorts of external demonic force, for the mind does not waver from reality’s expanse.[518]

This instruction derives from the cycle of the Dispelling of the Three Obstacles. After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should visualize upon a moon cushion in the case of fevers of the upper body and on a sun cushion in the case of colds of the lower body, a five-pronged vajra within an enclosure formed by the central channel that is the axis of vitality, and within which there is a vital essence, the size of an average pea, at the center of which there is a sealed syllable hūṃ, the size of a barley grain, or alternatively your root teacher, as appropriate.[520]
Next, you should exhale the stale air three times [and unite the upper and lower winds]. If you meditate for approximately a single session with clear and precise focus that [the wind] does not encircle the HŪṂ or your teacher but encircles the vajra and the vital essence, there is no doubt that this will protect against and alleviate all illnesses that agitate the physical elementals.[521]

This instruction derives from the cycle of the Dispelling of the Three Obstacles. After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: The originally pure nature of your own mind constitutes the four seals. That is to say, it constitutes the commitment seal (samayamudrā, dam tshig gi phyag rgya), in which radiance and emptiness are indivisible. Here, “commitment” (dam tshig) implies the nontransgressing of radiance that is its defining characteristic, “hand” (phyag) suggests natural purity, and “seal” (rgya) suggests pervasion. “The nature of your own mind” also constitutes the phenomenal seal (dharmamudrā, chos kyi phyag rgya), in which appearances and emptiness are indivisible—appearances being the “attributes” (chos) of mind. It constitutes the action seal (karmamudrā, las kyi phyag rgya), in which bliss and emptiness are indivisible—“action” (las) implying contaminated bliss. {223} Lastly, it constitutes the Great Seal (mahāmudrā, phyag rgya chen po), in which all things are intrinsically empty—“great” (chen po) implying all things of radiant appearance and phenomenal existence. It is impossible for yogins who knows this to die [prematurely] because they are without obstacles.[523]

After you have taken refuge and set the mind on enlightenment, there are five profound essentials: (i) the profound essential for cultivating the innate truth is ascertainment of the meaning of the continuum [of the mind]; (ii) the profound essential for those who have not focused the mind is internal focus; (iii) the profound essential for success in maintaining [this stability] is skillful means; (iv) the profound essential for cutting off dangerous passageways of the mental faculty is decisive determination;[525] and (v) the dedication of merit, free from the poisons, is the profound essential for all.[526]

[The first of these five profound essentials] concerns the three sorts of suffering. With respect to the nature of cyclic existence, when the innate mind is perceived, if you understand the nature of the suffering of suffering, you will attain the buddha body of emanation. If you understand the nature of the suffering of change, you will attain the buddha body of perfect resource. If you understand the nature of the suffering of formative predispositions, you will attain the buddha body of reality. By understanding that all things are without inherent existence, you will be liberated from the three obscurations and attain the buddha body of essentiality.[527]
[As far as the experiential cultivation of this profound essential is concerned,] all that appears and exists, cyclic existence and nirvana, is mind. In terms of the skillful refinement of its radiance and emptiness, emptiness [is the nature of mind]. You should purify the poison of appearances, aware that appearances are the uncontrived innate mind, just as the sky and its clouds are indivisible. However all things without exception may appear internally and wherever all things without exception may appear externally, they are indeed of a single savor.[528]

[As for the second of the five profound essentials:] You should focus the mind on the vital essence upon a moon cushion at the heart cakra and observe [the nature of the unelaborate mind]. During the day, bliss and emptiness or awareness and emptiness will arise; and during the night, you should focus on luminosity.[529]
Then you should focus the mind on the vital essence at the tip of the nose. During the day, radiance and emptiness or appearance and emptiness will arise; and during the night, you should focus on dreams.[530]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should be seated comfortably, with your body adopting the [sevenfold] posture of Vairocana completely. Then meditate on yourself as the deity, with the teacher on the crown of your head. After paying respectful homage, you should then dissolve [the visualization of the teacher into yourself].[534]
Next, after exhaling three stale breaths, [you should visualize yourself as] the supporting maṇḍala [of the celestial palace] and the supported maṇḍala [of the deities]: The soles of your feet are the adamantine ground and the crown of your head is the crest of the crossed vajra. Your rib cage is the adamantine tent, the pores of the skin are the network of ramparts, the nails are the burning volcanos, the open legs are the maṇḍala of wind, the channel of triple intersection is the maṇḍala of fire, the navel is the maṇḍala of water, the heart is the maṇḍala of earth, the spine is Mount Meru, the four joints of your double arm span are the symmetrical four corners of the walls, the eyes are the five bands [forming the walls], the teeth are the swags and half-length swags, the tongue and the lips are the platforms of the offering goddesses, the eight legs are the eight pillars, and the movements of the winds of the four elements from the four directions of the channel branches of the heart cakra are the four gates.[535]

At the secret cakra is green Amoghasiddhi, holding a sword and a bell—his female consort holds a curved knife and a skull, and they have an entourage of thirty-two female deities. At the navel cakra is yellow Ratnasambhava, holding a gemstone and a bell—his female consort holds a curved knife and a skull, and they have an entourage of sixty-four female deities. At the heart cakra is blue Akṣobhya, holding a vajra and a bell—his female consort holds a curved knife and a skull, and they have an entourage of eight female deities. At the throat cakra is red Amitābha, holding a lotus and a bell—his female consort holds a curved knife and a skull, and they have an entourage of sixteen female deities. At the forehead is white Vairocana, holding a wheel and a bell—his female consort holds a curved knife {235} and a skull, and they have an entourage of thirty-two female deities. At the protuberance is white Vajradhara, his legs in the adamantine posture, his hands in the gesture of teaching the sacred doctrine and holding a vajra and a bell—his female consort holds a curved knife and a skull, and they have an entourage of four female deities. The eyes are Kṣitigarbha, the ears are Vajrapāṇi, the nose is Ākāśagarbha, the tongue is Lokeśvara, the body is Nivāraṇaviṣkambhin, and the mental faculty is Samantabhadra. In sequence, these [male bodhisattvas] are embraced by the [corresponding female bodhisattvas], from Rūpavajrā to Dhātvīśvarī.[536]
All of these deities do not need to be generated from their [respective] seed syllables. They do not need empowerment, invitation, or a request to be present. You should recollect that they are naturally present, and from them there arises the pristine cognition of appearance and emptiness. That is to say, the vase empowerment will have been conferred.[537]
Next, the fire of the rectum blazes forth in the form of the short syllable a. The fire is radiant, the heat is empty, and it blazes with three attributes.[538] The deities are radiant like a lamp penetrating darkness. You should meditate on [the uniting of the upper and lower] winds, and then there will arise the pristine cognition of radiance and emptiness. That is to say, the secret empowerment will have been conferred.[539]

Next, the fire melts the syllable HAṂ. You should meditate that it flows [vertically] like the thread of a web, and there will arise the pristine cognition of bliss and emptiness. That is to say, the empowerment of discerning pristine cognition will have been conferred.[540]
Lastly, all phenomena of impure cyclic existence become the pure deities and the celestial palace. You should not meditate but simply remain with unwavering mindfulness, cognizing the innate state in the nature of the Great Seal where all things—appearance and emptiness, radiance and emptiness, and awareness and emptiness—are intrinsically empty. Then the pristine cognition of intrinsic emptiness will arise. That is to say, the fourth empowerment will have been conferred.
Such are the pith instructions concerning the meditation on the four empowerments conferred in a single sitting.[541]

When all external and internal entities are examined, there exists neither space nor time, {236} and no singularity is established in respect of the external and internal aspects of space and time. When there is no singularity, multiplicity will not arise. Their presence will not be established because there is neither singularity nor multiplicity, and when there is nothing that is present, neither will their absence be established in relation to that. Therefore, you should meditate, determining without doubt that all things are the natural expression of mind, free from conceptual elaboration.[543] You should also meditate thinking compassionately of sentient beings who have not realized that.[544] After meditating in that manner, you will not be inclined toward erroneous views, and the supramundane pristine cognition will arise.[545]

Next, you should meditate on the generation stage, which concerns the purity of an individual deity, alone [and without consort], in the manner of a solitary hero. You should vibrantly visualize that the appearance of this deity is without inherent existence, in the manner of the reflection in a mirror. You should visualize with your focus on the central eye [of pristine cognition] in particular, and then meditate, as before, on all three eyes, the entire head, the entire body, and the seat. Having developed the clear and expanded visualization of the deity, you should meditate that this comes to permeate all worlds; and after that, you should gradually visualize that the deity contracts smaller and smaller, within a space the size of a mustard seed. By accomplishing that visualization, you will perfect the generation stage.[546]

To that end, you should refine the nine branches of meditative concentration.[547] [Specifically, when wind is refined in meditative concentration,] there are seven steps: [(i) You should meditate on the winds of exertion and life breath that regulate inhalation, pause, and exhalation.][548] [As for exhalation:] (ii) you should block the wind of exertion and exhale the wind of life breath,[549] (iii) you should exhale forcefully through both [nostrils],[550] and (iv) you should exhale noisily from the mouth.[551] [As for filling the channels with wind:] (v) you should block [the nostrils alternately] with the wind of exertion and fill [the central channel] with the wind of life breath,[552] and (vi) you should fill the central channel, breathing silently through the mouth.[553] Lastly, (vii) you should unite the [upper and lower] winds.[554]
For the practice of the fierce inner heat, your body should adopt the crouching posture, and you should secure the sealing gesture of the opposing stoves. Four finger widths below the navel, the fire of the channel of fierce inner heat is subtle, resembling one-hundredth part of a horse’s tail hair. You should meditate that it has a fierce heat measuring half a finger width. Then you should compress the upper wind and bind the lower wind. If you cannot do this, breathe in slowly, and then by your practice of that meditation, a degree of warmth will arise. Once this has been perfected, {237} the warmth will arise without interruption and bliss will arise throughout the body.[555]

With regard to the yoga of the vital essence: Within the heart cakra, upon a moon disk the size of a round nail, you should focus on a white vital essence that is round, the size of a pea. Having experienced that, you should meditate as before on the vital essence in the space between the eyebrows. Having experienced that, you should meditate on a red vital essence within the secret cakra, and having experienced that, you should connect those three vital essences with a subtle thread of light. Next, when breathing out, you should meditate that the power of [the vital essence of] the secret cakra comes to rest in the heart cakra, and when you breathe in, the power of [the vital essence] of the space between the eyebrows comes to rest in the heart cakra. Thereupon you should meditate that the power of [the vital essence of] the heart cakra extends throughout all the elements within the ancillary channels of the physical body.[556]
[There then follows the method of meditating diversely on these three yogas of the winds, fierce inner heat, and vital essence:] Dependent on the cakras, within the physical body, there are three channels: the central channel, which is subtle; the right channel, which is red; and the left channel, which is white. Visualize that at the center of the sixty-four channel branches of the navel cakra there is a syllable A,[557] at the center of the eight channel branches in the heart there is a HŪṂ, at the center of the sixteen channel branches in the throat there is an OṂ, and at the center of the thirty-two channel branches in the crown there is a HAṂ.[558]

Next, you should arouse the wind, so that the blazing fire moves from the right channel and incinerates the cakra of the heart. It then also incinerates the cakra of the throat. Then the fire exits [your body] via the crown of the head and enters the feet of the Buddha [seated above your head] via the right ankle. Drawn by the power of the fire, the Buddha’s generative essence then descends via the crown of your head, entering your left channel, and penetrating your crown and throat cakras and the syllable a of the navel cakra, from which subtle rays of light then enter within the central channel. From the syllable HAṂ at the crown cakra visualize that a subtle vital essence then flows downward. The crucial point is that it should permeate the channels and seed syllables within your body. Then the upper and lower winds should be united.[559]
The signs that this has been perfected are that the wind can remain to a certain extent within the channels, it can be exhaled at will to a certain extent, that ailments of the upper and lower body can be expelled respectively from within the upper and lower body, that the vital essences will increase, that the extrasensory powers will emerge, that the complexion is excellent, that miraculous abilities can be revealed, that wind and mind can be controlled, {238} that the supramundane pristine cognition will arise by refining the path of the third empowerment, and that the path may be traversed as far as the buddha level.[560]
Having absorbed all that is within the three purities,

After taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: The first essential visualization is of the fierce inner heat. You should visualize yourself as the deity according to the generation stage. With the vital points of your physical body, you should adopt the crouching posture, with both arms embracing the knees, and the head should be suitably positioned—neither too high nor too low. Next, at the middle of the navel cakra there arises a red AṂ, and in the middle of the heart cakra a blue HŪṂ. The channel branches are without any arrangement of letters, but these two cakras are connected via the subtle central channel. You should compress the wind and meditate that the fire of the AṂ burns, melting the HŪṂ.[562]
The second essential visualization is that at the middle of the cakra of emanation in the navel there is a syllable AṂ, with four stacked letters in the channel branches of the four cardinal directions and a single syllable in each of the four intermediate directions. Meditate that all these nine syllables assume the form of fire, and then compress the wind.[563]
The third essential visualization is that at the middle of the cakra of emanation in the navel there is a syllable AṂ, with two vowels in each of the [eight] channel branches. These assume the form of fire, and then you should compress the [upper] wind. Finally, [the peripheral vowels] should be dissolved into the AṂ.[564]
The fourth essential visualization is that at the middle of the four cakras are respectively the syllables AṂ, HŪṂ, OṂ, and HAṂ, with the eight phonetic sets of syllables on the eight channel branches. [The four main syllables are respectively] white, blue, red, and white. When breathing out, you should visualize that they rise; when breathing in, you should visualize that they fall; and when pausing, you should meditate that the [peripheral sets of syllables] dissolve into their respective [central] seed syllables; and then you should compress the wind.[565]
The fifth essential visualization is that at the middle of the cakra of emanation in the navel there is the syllable AṂ, with the eight phonetic sets of syllables on the eight channel branches. You should compress the [lower] wind and meditate, visualizing that the seed syllables are moving [upward].[566]

The sixth essential visualization is that at the middle of the navel cakra of emanation there is the syllable AṂ, at the heart cakra of the phenomenal wheel there is VAṂ, at the throat cakra of perfect resource there is LAṂ, and at the crown cakra of supreme bliss there is YAṂ—their colors corresponding to the four respective elements. You should dissolve the wind into the AṂ and compress [the upper wind] as much as possible.[567]
The seventh essential visualization is that at the middle of the navel cakra of emanation there is the syllable AṂ with A, KA, CA, ṬA, TA, PA, YA, and ŚA at the eight channel branches; and at the middle of the heart cakra of the phenomenal wheel there is the syllable HŪṂ. [When breathing in,] you should dissolve the wind into the AṂ, {239} and [when breathing out,] you should clearly visualize and meditate on the HŪṂ.[568]
The eighth essential visualization is that at the middle of the heart cakra of the phenomenal wheel there is the syllable HŪṂ [or AṂ],[569] with A, Ā, AṂ, and aḥ in the four cardinal directions, adorned with vital essences, and Ṛ, Ṝ, Ḷ, and ḹ in the four intermediate directions. You should meditate that when the wind is inhaled, it should be dissolved into the syllable HŪṂ or AṂ.[570]
The ninth essential visualization is that at the middle of the heart cakra of the phenomenal wheel, upon a moon disk the size of a split pea, there is the white syllable HŪṂ, the size of a mustard seed. You should compress the [upper] wind and meditate on that.[571]
The tenth essential visualization is that at the middle of the four cakras are respectively AṂ, HŪṂ, OṂ, and HAṂ, while the channel branches are without any arrangement of letters. You should meditate on [the contraction of the lower] wind and visualize that the fire [of pristine cognition] blazes forth, melting the syllable hūṃ.[572]
The eleventh essential visualization is that at the middle of the navel cakra of emanation there is the syllable AṂ, its channel branches without any arrangement of letters. [When you breathe out,] the AṂ blazes as fire, which is inverted upward from the heart cakra, opening the space between the eyebrows and opening the vital points of the Tathāgata’s body [above the crown of your head]. A stream of generative fluid then emerges and is absorbed into the AṂ at your navel. Then the upper and lower winds should be united.[573]

The twelfth essential visualization is that at the middle of the navel cakra of emanation there is the syllable OṂ, and its eight channel branches each have two of the sixteen seed syllables beginning with RA and HA, which then rise upward [to the heart cakra]. You should compress the [upper] wind and meditate on that.[574]
The thirteenth essential visualization is that at the middle of the heart cakra [of the phenomenal wheel], you should meditate that there is the syllable HŪṂ, with five channel branches, [marked] with the white syllables RA, HA, SA, YA, and E. Then you should compress the wind.[575]
The fourteenth essential visualization is that at the base of the uvula on the palate there is a four-petal lotus at the center of which is the syllable OṂ, with the red syllables RA, HA, SA, and YA on the four channel branches. During exhalation, the wind should be absorbed into these [five] seed syllables, so that it is not permitted to reenter.[576]
The fifteenth essential visualization is that A, KA, CA, ṬA, TA, PA, YA, and ŚA are arrayed at the branches of the heart cakra of the phenomenal wheel, and at its center there is a white vital essence. You should meditate that as the wind of life breath is inhaled, these move downward and that they are drawn upward by the wind of exertion.[577]
The sixteenth essential visualization is that at the middle of the navel cakra of emanation, at the middle of conjoined moon and sun disks the size of a split pea, there is a white vital essence the size of a mustard seed. When the breath is exhaled, you should meditate that the yellow wind of the earth element [is diffused, and during inhalation it] is absorbed into that vital essence. Similarly [during exhalation], the white wind of the water element, the red wind of the fire element, and the green wind of the wind element are diffused [and during inhalation they are absorbed into that vital essence].[578]
The seventeenth essential visualization is that at the middle of the heart cakra of the phenomenal wheel, you should visualize a white vital essence the size of a mustard seed. When breath is inhaled, it is absorbed into the left side [of that vital essence]. Then the [upper] wind should be compressed.[579]

The eighteenth essential visualization is that {240} at the middle of each of the four cakras you should meditate on a vital essence, and then you should compress the [upper] wind.[580]
The nineteenth essential visualization is that at the four cakras are the syllables AṂ, HŪṂ, OṂ, and HAṂ, which are [yellow,] blue, red, and white. When the breath is exhaled, rays of light are diffused through the two nostrils; and when it is inhaled, you should meditate repeatedly that [it is dependent on] those syllables.[581]
The twentieth essential visualization is that you should visualize the primordially abiding maṇḍalas of the four elements, draw in the [lower] wind, and meditate that the wind causes the fire element to burn, that that in turn causes the water element to boil, that the earth element melts, and that its vapor causes the syllable HAṂ at the crown cakra to melt.[582]
The twenty-first essential visualization is that at the navel cakra of emanation there is the syllable AṂ, with A, KA, CA, ṬA, TA, PA, YA, and ŚA at its channel branches, and with, at their periphery, two sets of [the sixteen] vowels [that rotate counterclockwise] and thirty-two consonants, minus HA and KṢA, [that rotate clockwise]. At the heart cakra of the phenomenal wheel there is the syllable HŪṂ, with Ā, Ī, U, and E in the four cardinal directions and YA, VA, RA, and LA in the four intermediate directions. At the throat cakra of perfect resource, there is the syllable OṂ on the inside with A, I, U, and E on the periphery, excluding the neuter vowels. At the crown cakra of supreme bliss there is the syllable HAṂ, with two sets of vowels on its channel branches. You should also visualize the two side channels. Then you should draw in the lower wind, and this causes fire to blaze. The syllable AṂ is set on fire, and the two cakras [above it] are incinerated. The fire is inverted three times, so that the syllable HAṂ [at the crown] is incinerated and a flow of generative fluid descends, causing the seed syllables to revive. [On contacting] the AṂ, it reignites, and in a most subtle form it burns through the central channel, causing the HAṂ to melt. Then you should unite the [upper and lower] winds.[583]

The twenty-second essential visualization is that you should visualize at the middle of the navel cakra of emanation the syllable AṂ. You should close the round anal orifice of the lower wind and focus consciousness on the AṂ. Finally, the AṂ ignites, causing the generative fluid [of the upper cakras] to emerge at the navel.[584]
The twenty-third essential visualization is that at the heart cakra of the phenomenal wheel there is the syllable HŪṂ, with the syllables OṂ, TRAṂ, HRĪḤ, and KHAṂ in the four cardinal directions. You should dissolve the wind into those five seed syllables and compress [the upper wind].[585]
The twenty-fourth essential visualization is that at the heart cakra of the phenomenal wheel there is upon a moon disk the white syllable HŪṂ. Your inhaled breath should be absorbed into the HŪṂ, the upper wind should be compressed, and the HŪṂ then ignites. Finally, the naturally originated pristine cognition will arise.[586]
The twenty-fifth essential visualization concerns the yoga of the vital essence. At the fontanel there is a downward-facing white HŪṂ upon a split-open moon disk, and below it there is a downward-facing white SUṂ. When exhaling breath, you should visualize that from the SUṂ {241} nectar descends like a stream of milk. It should be reversed at the uvula and savored.[587]

The twenty-sixth essential visualization concerns the vital essences of the ten orifices.[588] You should visualize that at the heart cakra there is a white HŪṂ upon a moon disk, the light of which, when exhaling breath, penetrates all the nine orifices—ten including the space between the eyebrows—like a lamp penetrating darkness. You should then meditate that [when inhaling breath,] the rain of vital essence again flows down.[589]
The twenty-seventh essential visualization is that at the heart cakra of the phenomenal wheel there is a moon disk. When you exhale breath, [its light] illuminates the thirty-two [channels]; and when inhaling breath, you should meditate again and again that all the channels are filled with the vital essence of generative fluid.[590]
The twenty-eighth essential visualization concerns the vital essence of the fontanel. There is a white HŪṂ on a moon disk at the heart and a white HAṂ at the fontanel. When you exhale breath, [the light of the HŪṂ] touches the HAṂ, and you should meditate repeatedly that nectar flows from the HAṂ.[591]
The twenty-ninth essential visualization is that the AṂ at the navel cakra of emanation and the downward-facing HŪṂ at the heart cakra of the phenomenal wheel are connected through the extremely fine [central channel]. The AṂ causes the fire to blaze, and you should then focus on [the generative fluid] dripping from the HŪṂ. After that, you should meditate, [arousing the lower] wind [to some extent].[592]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should prepare [an anal plug in the form of] a cone, made of clay, two thumbs in width and four digits in height, with a slightly tapering top, wrapped in silk, and so forth.[594] Then, resting on a pillow, your body should adopt the posture that resembles the ear of an elephant.[595] You should position the aforementioned plug directly below your anus, support it with your thighs alternately, and draw in the lower wind. [Then, after closing the anus, you should rest upon the plug.][596] If this is uncomfortable, you should reduce its size; and if it is comfortable, you should hold it in place.[597]
Next, you should visualize yourself as Hevajra, with your lungs assuming the form of a white lotus with eight downward-facing petals, your liver a dark red lotus with upward-facing petals, and from the place where these two lotuses virtually overlap at their tips, there appears the celestial palace. {242} At its center, the knot of the three channels [is marked with] HŪṂ, the essential nature of compassion, and from the HŪṂ you should simply visualize that there arises blue Vajraheruka, with bared fangs and three eyes—the right one like the sun, the left one like the moon, and the central one like Rāhu. With his right leg he oppresses the sun, not permitting the blood (rakta) of the right channel to spill; and with his left leg he oppresses the moon, not permitting the generative fluid of the left channel to spill. The transcendent lord is seated in the central channel, which is the pure nature of Rāhu, and in the midst of a blazing fire of pristine cognition, which is the pure nature of Ketu. His two hands hold the vajra and bell, crossed at the heart, inducting the winds of the sun and moon side channels into the central channel. The protuberance of his head holds together the three channels of the sun, moon, and planetary divinity [Rāhu], and he has six ornaments, symbolizing the six transcendent perfections.[598]

Next, you should cover your knees with your hands, shake the abdomen, rest the tongue against the palate, open your eyes slightly, draw in the upper wind with HIK, and compress it with the hissing sound of SIB.[599] Then you should draw in the lower wind and meditate, nurturing this practice by means of the appropriate diet and regimen. Externally appearances will then become completely white;[600] warmth and bliss will arise within the body, and your mind will directly reach the initial absorption of the sensory elements,[601] which is free from the subject-object dichotomy.
After one month, signs such as smoke will emerge. After three months, your body will become as light as a sheet of cotton and your mind will be free from the subject-object dichotomy. There will be no distinction between meditative equipoise and postmeditation, and you will directly reach the middling absorption of the sensory elements. Then appearances will arise as deities and the deities of the five palaces will become radiant. You should maintain nonconceptual meditative stability during meditative equipoise and during postmeditation; all sorts of extrasensory powers will emerge. In this way, you will reach the final absorption of the sensory elements. The path of insight will then arise through the power of that auspicious circumstance, in the manner in which the eyes are opened by a cataract scalpel.[602]

If one digit of the aforementioned plug is absorbed [into the anus], bliss will arise. If two digits are absorbed, the bliss will exceed that. If three digits are absorbed, there will be greater and greater bliss. And if four digits are absorbed, the path of insight will arise, but the plug should not be absorbed up to five digits because that would cause obstacles to the life span. {243} It is said that this plug will cause the penis to contract of its own volition.[603]
With regard to occasional activities: (i) After meals, you should refrain from meditating for a while, until the residue of the meal reaches the stomach. (ii) Then you should support the sides of your kidneys in accordance with the pith instructions. (iii) [In addition,] for the practice concerning the crown of the head, you should secure your head on the ground with your legs raised upward, and then repeatedly raise up and contract the legs. (iv) In order to enhance the physical constituents, you should cross your feet at the nape of the neck. Or else you should cross your ten toes at the nape of the neck. The eyes should remain wide open, and the upper and lower winds should then be united. It is important to turn the head to the right and left, with the eyes focused upward.[604]

(i) [As for the main practice, you should first determine in accordance with the view of discriminative awareness] that mind is a magical display, in accordance with a single example—the moon’s reflection in water—[and establish that] it is an inexpressible, auspicious circumstance; and then you should meditate, associating the four [aspects of empowerment] with that single example.[607]
(ii) Then, in order to experientially cultivate that view through skillful means, you should meditate that the vase empowerment, the secret empowerment, the empowerment of discerning pristine cognition, and the fourth empowerment are conferred in the maṇḍala of the physical body, comprising either 157 deities, or five palaces, or the central male and female deities. The diffusion and absorption of the light rays within their hearts cause the inhabited world and its sentient inhabitants to appear respectively as the maṇḍala and the deities.[608] In accordance with the four verses that concern the receiving [of empowerment] in the middle-length empowerment [of Hevajra], you may perfectly receive [all four] empowerments in a single stream of generative essence.[609]
Specifically, in the case of the secret empowerment, you should meditate on (i) the seven applications of wind, or on (ii) the adamantine recitation and (iii) the eighteen yogic exercises focusing on the fierce inner heat; or, alternatively, you should meditate on (iv) the yoga of the channels according to the method of refining the pathways of the channels, (v) the four cakras according to the three complete methods of the fierce inner heat,[610] {244} (vi) the four applications of the vital essence according to the method that brings success, and (vii) the intense blazing of fire according to the method of eliminating obstacles—these seven steps. Alternatively, you may meditate exclusively on the burning and dripping [of the syllables] within the central channel.
In the case of the empowerment of discerning pristine cognition, according to the extensive path of the application of the wind of pristine cognition, in the main practice you should arouse the consort of pristine cognition [and apply] the four phases of the descent, retention, reversal, and pervasion [of the vital essence].
In the case of the fourth empowerment, the recitation should be undertaken, whether peaceful or wrathful, for seven moments of time, or for three moments of time, or for a single session of meditation.[611]

(i) According to the extensive approach, the preliminaries comprise three focuses: one combining both accumulation and refinement; one combining the three refinements [of body, speech, and mind]; and one combining the remainder [of the preliminaries]. The determination [of doubts] by means of the view comprises thirty-seven aspects. The vase empowerment has seven aspects, including one for the generation of mindfulness, one each for the five palaces, and one for the ancillaries. [As for the secret empowerment,] the yogic application of wind has seven aspects, and the fierce inner heat has eighteen aspects. [As for the empowerment of discerning pristine cognition,] the melting bliss has eight aspects, including one for the refinement, five for the training, one for the union in equipoise, and one for the arousal. [As for the fourth empowerment,] the adamantine wave of blessing has nine aspects, including two for the peaceful and wrathful recitation and seven for the moments of time. So the extensive approach altogether has these eighty-nine aspects.
(ii) According to the middle-length approach, the preliminaries have three aspects, the view has four, the vase empowerment has three, the application of wind has seven, the fierce inner heat has seven, the melting bliss has four, and the wave of blessing has five, making altogether thirty-three aspects.
(iii) According to the abridged approach, the preliminaries have three aspects, the view has one, the vase empowerment has one, the application of wind has one, the fierce inner heat has one, the melting bliss has one, and the fourth empowerment has one, making altogether nine focuses.
As far as these three approaches—extensive, middle-length, and abridged—are concerned, without being rigidly [inclined toward] a single approach, you should understand that they are all magical transformations, like the eyes of a Chinese mask.[612]

The yoga of adamantine buddha body entails the isolation of the ordinary body:[615] In the context of this instruction, the main practice concerns either the single enlightened family that is most secret or the one hundred sacral aspects. For ease of understanding, the last mentioned comprise the five outer sense fields, the five inner sense fields, the five aggregates, the four elements—nineteen aspects, each of which is fivefold, making ninety-five aspects, and, with the inclusion of the five pristine cognitions that are universally pervasive, the number totals one hundred sacral aspects.[616]
You should meditate that, with regard to matter, shapes such as square, round, long, short, and so forth are Vairocana. The forms that appear as the dichotomy of self and others are Ratnasambhava—the precious origin of Vairocana. The material colors including blue and yellow are Amitābha—the boundless light of Vairocana. The luminous forms of sunlight, moonlight, and so forth are Amoghasiddhi—the successful accomplishment of Vairocana. The nonapperceived forms that manifest as objects of the mental faculty when the eyes are closed are Akṣobhya—the immovability of Vairocana.[617] Then you should examine this summarily, substituting “sound” and so forth for “matter.”
When these one hundred aspects[618] are subsumed, they may be gathered in the following five groups: (i) [sights,] the sense faculty of the eyes, the aggregate of physical forms, and the earth element are associated with the enlightened family of Vairocana; (ii) sounds, the sense faculty of the ears, the aggregate of feelings, and the water element are associated with the enlightened family of Ratnasambhava; (iii) odors, the sense faculty of the nose, the aggregate of perceptions, and the fire element are associated with the enlightened family of Amitābha; (iv) tastes, the sense faculty of the tongue, the aggregate of formative predispositions, and the wind element are associated with the enlightened family of Amoghasiddhi; and (v) tangibles, the sense faculty of the body, the aggregate of consciousness, and the space element are associated with the enlightened family of Akṣobhya.

When these five are subsumed, they are gathered into the three adamantine realities of buddha body, speech, and mind; and when these three adamantine realities encompassing all appearances as body, speech, and mind are further subsumed, they are gathered in Vajradhara, the sixth enlightened family. Body and speech may also be gathered in mind, {246} so that there is a single enlightened family that is most secret.[619]
You should meditate that all things that appear as the dichotomy of self and others within the inhabited world and its sentient inhabitants are instantly and perfectly recollected as Vajradhara, with his three faces—blue, white, and red—and six arms—those on the right side, holding a vajra, wheel, and lotus; and those on the left, holding a bell, jewel, and sword. When you meditate on yourself as Vajradhara, if the visualization is unclear, you should generate the visualization and meditate while looking at an icon. If it is still unclear, you should place an extremely clear mirror in front and display an icon of Vajradhara behind you, with its faces and the right and left arms inverted. Its reflection should then arise on the mirror, and you should make the visualization and meditate on it, looking at that reflection. Through your having meditated in that manner, the entire inhabited world and its sentient inhabitants will actually appear as Vajradhara. Thereby all ordinary conceptual thoughts will be reversed.[620] This meditation does not refer to any specific ritual of the generation stage, and it is not included in any specific aspect of the generation or perfection stages. As such, it resembles the borderline between mountains and plains.[621]

The yoga of the adamantine buddha speech entails the isolation of ordinary speech.[622] To facilitate its understanding, briefly stated, wind generally has three phases: inhalation, pausing, and exhalation. The five primary winds comprise the life-sustaining wind, the ascending wind [associated with the vocal cords], the fire-accompanying wind [associated with digestion], the descending purgative wind, and the pervasive wind [associated with metabolism and muscular movement]. Their respective locations are the heart, the throat, the navel, the secret cakra, and the joints of the body. Their respective natures are the water, fire, wind, earth, and space elements. Their respective colors are white, red, green, yellow, and unclear azure blue. The names [of their respective enlightened families] are vajra, padma, ratna, karma, and [tathāgata, which is that of] the protector-lord Vairocana. Their respective dynamic functions are movement, precise movement, genuine movement, intense movement, and definitive movement. [Their respective orifices are] the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, and the genitals. [Their respective sense objects] are sights, sounds, odors, tastes, and tangibles.[623]
In brief, in the course of a single twenty-four-hour day, wind has twenty-one thousand six hundred movements. These comprise twelve major cycles or twenty-four minor cycles {247}—each minor cycle with nine hundred movements.[624]
Since these are subsumed in inhalation, pausing, and exhalation, the experiential cultivation is as follows: You should be aware of the resonance of the syllable HŪṂ while exhaling, of OṂ while inhaling, and of ĀḤ while pausing.[625] You should count the number of breaths without error. Having understood that the winds and their nature are inseparable and without conceptual elaboration, you should then train according to the four-session yoga.

When you perceive the places from where the winds arise and their corresponding colors, the wind named Amoghasiddhi, arising from the navel, is exhaled through the left nostril and moves in a greenish-yellow color. The wind named Amitābha, lord of the padma family, arising from the throat, is exhaled through the right nostril and is red. The wind named Ratnasambhava, lord of the ratna family, arising from the secret cakra, is exhaled through both nostrils and is whitish yellow. The wind named Akṣobhya, lord of the vajra family, arising from the heart, is exhaled through both nostrils, without any escaping, and is white.[626]
So it is that there are four cycles of movement—one cycle from each of the left and right nostrils, one cycle from both nostrils, and one minor cycle of slow movement from both nostrils. In the course of a single day, this cycle will occur six times; and since each of these four winds moves six times per day, each of them has twelve major cycles, and when each of these is subdivided in two, it has twenty-four minor cycles.

Once you acquire familiarity with this, the winds of the four female deities are as follows: The two hundred and twenty-five downward movements of wind from the left nostril, pale green in color, denote Māmakī—the wind of the water element. The upward movements of wind from the left nostril, reddish-green in color, denote Pāṇḍaravāsinī—the wind of the fire element. The direct movements of wind from the left nostril, greenish-yellow in color, denote Buddhalocanā—the wind of the earth element. The shadowy[627] movements of wind from the left nostril, dark green in color, denote Tārā—the wind of the wind element. You should experientially cultivate the inhalation, pausing, and exhalation of these winds in this manner, without error. Similarly, there are four movements of wind from the right nostril—respectively, red, extreme red, yellowish-red, and dark red—respectively moving downward, upward, directly, and in the shadows; and they respectively represent the water, fire, earth, and wind elements. You should then experientially cultivate the [former] four that emphasize the earth element and the [latter] four that emphasize the water element, estimating the colors, as before.[628]
You should accomplish the four winds without impediment, {248} and the wind of the earth element will be impeded. With the proverbial strength of Nārāyaṇa, the wind of the water element will be impeded. Unburnable by fire, the wind of the fire element will be impeded. Impervious to water, the wind of the wind element will depart into space.[629]

The yoga of the adamantine buddha mind entails the isolation of ordinary mind:[630] You should meditate in sequential order on luminosity, the spread of luminosity, and the approximate attainment of luminosity; and then you should meditate on these in reverse order.[631]
[With regard to luminosity:][632] You should visualize yourself as Vajradhara, with a solar disk in the heart. Upon it, there is an eight-petal red lotus, and at the navel there is a white AṂ.[633] Meditate on aṃ. Light is diffused from the AṂ; it penetrates the HAṂ at the crown and causes a stream of nectar to dissolve into the AṂ. Luminosity resembling sunlight will then appear and bliss will arise.[634]
With regard to the yoga of the spread of luminosity:[635] You should meditate on yourself as Vajradhara, with a solar disk in the heart. Upon it there is a red five-pronged vajra. At the navel you should visualize the syllable ĀḤ, with its visarga. Visualize that a hot red light from the ĀḤ penetrates the syllable HAṂ [at the crown], causing nectar to appear and dissolve into the AṂ. Luminosity resembling moonlight will then appear and bliss will arise.[636]
With regard to the yoga of the approximate attainment of luminosity:[637] You should visualize a red ĀḤ in the heart. From it there issues a faint ray of light that penetrates the syllable HAṂ [at the crown], causing it to dissolve into nectar. Intense great bliss will then arise, and once the luminosity has vanished, it will resemble darkness.[638]
Next, you should visualize the luminosity associated with the reverse sequence. The spread of luminosity will then arise from the preceding approximate attainment; and then from the spread of luminosity that resembles sunlight, the luminosity will arise. You should meditate that that is transformed into the red ĀḤ and the white OṂ.[639]

Once the three isolations of ordinary body, speech, and mind have been perfected in that manner, you should experientially cultivate [the illusory body] as follows:[640] Meditative equipoise is a magical display, postmeditation is a magical display, and dreams are a magical display.[641] You should instantaneously and perfectly recall white Vajradhara, materialized simply from subtle energy. In terms of appearance, he is existent; and in terms of the subsequent [dissolution of the visualization], he is nonexistent. You should instantaneously visualize his body like the reflection in a mirror. {249} Each part of his body is fully perfected in a single facet of rainbow light. It is permeated by reflections, like the reflection of the moon that arises in water, like that of a full moon reflected in a lake, pool, river, or some other body of water. During postmeditation, whatever appears is that buddha body of magical display.
After that, you should apply the experiential cultivation of magical display with respect to dreams. That is to say, once you have familiarized yourself with the recollection of magical display in all circumstances of meditative equipoise and postmeditation, when lying down to sleep, you should fervently reflect that you will recognize the consciousness that is aware of dreams. When dreams indistinctly arise, you should recall the luminosity of the reverse sequence [that you previously practiced].
Others integrate with this practice the transformation of the path [of dreams] according to Nāropā, visualizing the letters A, NU, TA, RA in the throat cakra, but that does not accord with our own tradition of the Secret Assembly. By meditating in this manner, you will apprehend the movement of [dreamlike] appearances.

You should next meditate on the respective phases [of luminosity known as] “encompassing” and “dissolution”:[642] To achieve the dissolution of the adamantine buddha body, there is encompassing of the syllable OṂ in the heart. Light rays are diffused from the OṂ, and the inhabited world and its sentient inhabitants melt into light. The adamantine buddha body then dissolves into the OṂ, in the manner of an eclipse.[643] With regard to both the adamantine buddha speech and the adamantine reality of buddha mind, you should undertake the corresponding encompassing and dissolution practices in the correct manner, from the syllables ĀḤ and HŪṂ respectively.[644]
Next, you should meditate on the encompassing [and dissolution] of the three adamantine realities and on the encompassing [and dissolution] of the five enlightened families. Visualize that upon a red lotus on a moon disk at the navel cakra, there is the short syllable A. When the wind is exhaled, it brings forth the sixteen vowels and thirty-four consonants to the tip of the nose. When it is inhaled, it brings them forth [in reverse] from KṢA[645] to ĀḤ visarga, and when it pauses [it brings them forth] from a to KṢA. The syllable kṣa at the end also vanishes, as it were, into rainbow light.[646]

In the case of the encompassing and dissolution of adamantine buddha speech, you should meditate on the vowels in the heart cakra where, upon a sun disk, there is a red eight-petal lotus with its perimeter; and in the navel cakra where there is a red ĀḤ with its perimeter. Light is diffused from the ĀḤ, and the inhabited world and its sentient inhabitants dissolve.[647]
In the case of the encompassing and dissolution of adamantine buddha mind, within the body in the central channel, {250} white in color, there is a coalescence of emptiness and radiance. Light is diffused from the central channel and dissolves into your own central channel, like a rainbow vanishing into the sky. In the dissolution phase, the inhabited world and its sentient inhabitants are dissolved by the light of the central channel.[648]
In the case of the encompassing and dissolution of the five enlightened families, there are five aspects: There are two encompassings and dissolutions associated with Vairocana, Amitābha, and Akṣobhya—these three—based as before on the syllables OṂ, ĀḤ, HŪṂ. There are two encompassings and dissolutions associated with Ratnasambhava, with another modulation based on the [aforementioned] syllables of the illusory body and so forth. There are two encompassings and dissolutions associated with Amoghasiddhi, with another modulation based on the syllable HAṂ.[649]

Having meditated in that manner for a long time, when luminosity and emptiness are realized, finally you will arise from luminosity in the body of coalescence; and the luminosity of the sequential and reverse phases arises as Vajradhara, materialized simply from subtle energy and adorned with the major and minor marks. This is the coalescence of the buddha body of perfect resource.[650]
Next, from your heart there emanates the consort embodying the awareness of pristine cognition. Consecrated by her secret cakra, you should enter into meditative absorption and then the maṇḍala perfectly arises from the vital essence within the secret cakra of the female consort. This is conducted into her heart cakra and diffused outward. Dissolving into yourself, it is then transformed into the adamantine reality of hatred.[651] The foregoing constitutes the coalescence [of the paths] of learning. When that continuum has been experienced and engaged, there ensues the coalescence [of the path] of no-more-learning.
So it is that in accordance with the practices of (i) singular recollection, (ii) isolation of the body, (iii) isolation of speech, (iv) isolation of mind, (v) illusory body, (vi) luminosity, and (vii) coalescence, you should know the number of procedures that the visualization entails and refine them energetically.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should visualize yourself at the center of the protective circle {251} as Mañjuvajra. Within his body are the three channels and the four cakras.[654]
Focus your mind within the heart cakra on the being of pristine cognition, similar to your visualized self, and then within his heart cakra on the being of meditative stability, which is in the form of the syllable MAṂ, resting upon the handle of a sword.[655] Next, you should meditate that the MAṂ melts and becomes a red vital essence, the size of a small pea, emitting light rays of five colors, and that within it there are the vital essences of the supporting celestial palace and the supported deities. Smoke and other such signs will appear.[656] As a successful outcome, light will be diffused from the vital essences, and at its point the maṇḍala is emanated. It will fill the worlds of the ten directions, causing them to melt, and then it should dissolve.[657]
Your mind—the essential nature [of pristine cognition]—should then be equipoised in the vital essences:[658] There are sixteen white vital essences, and you should visualize that these are the sixteen vital essences present within the foundational physical body in the forms of the sixteen vowels. That is to say, you should visualize the syllable a on the base of the two big toes, Ā on the two calves, I on the two thighs, ī on the genitals, U at the base of the abdomen, Ū on its upper part [i.e., the diaphragm], Ṛ on the breasts, Ṝ on the hands, Ḷ on the throat, ḹ on the lips, E on the cheeks, AI on the eyes, O at the base of the ears, AU on the crown of the head, and AṂ and ĀḤ on all the joints. All these should be transported by the light of the heart cakra’s vital essence, and they dissolve therein.[659] After that, [the light rays of the vital essence of the heart cakra] should summon the nectar of the buddhas, which also dissolves therein.[660]
[Next, there are the methods of the principal and conclusive meditations:] You should repeat the same visualization as before, from the sword handle up to the foundational physical body. The maṇḍala emanated from the point of the rays of light traverses infinite buddha fields and enters the mouths of the conquerors. Intermingling with nectar, it should then dissolve into the primary vital essence of the male from the right nostril and of the female from the left nostril. Finally, all phenomena should be absorbed within the mind.[661]

You should then be one-pointedly equipoised, exclusively on the vital essence of the mind, and home in on the imperishable vital essence. Light will blaze as before within the vital essence of the genitals and the vital essence of the heart, and then the three attributes of energy, dullness, and lightness[662] will flow down from the right, left, and central channels respectively. At the tip of the penis (nor bu) there is a vital essence, the thickness of a white mustard seed, [resting] upon the hand emblem—the handle of a blue sword, the size of a barley grain, endowed with light rays of five colors. {252} Within it, you should focus one-pointedly on the three-tiered principal beings [of commitment, pristine cognition, and meditative stability], in such a way that the vital essence is not enlarged and the maṇḍala is not diminished.[663]
To ensure a successful outcome, if the mind becomes sluggish or overactive, the vital essence will be ejaculated from your lower extremity. Therefore you should focus mindfully upon it as it descends toward the lower extremity of the female. Once sluggishness and overactivity have been purged,[664] you should focus on the primary vital essence, and consequently five signs of success will appear, including mirage, smoke, fireflies, burning lamps, and a cloudless sky.[665]
As far as [the phase of] recollection is concerned, you should generate the visualization of the deity without relying on a specific ritual and enter into meditative equipoise, having [instantly] recalled the buddhas of the five enlightened families, the four female buddhas, the wrathful deities, and so forth. You should then meditate on the melting vital essence [resulting from that visualization]. This is most profound. You should meditate on the lower extremity of the central channel and apply the particular methods of retaining the wind and of absorbing the subtle energy and mind.[666]
In the forehead, the throat, the heart, and between the breasts, there are [respectively] the buddha body, speech, and mind, along with the being of pristine cognition and the corresponding maṇḍalas of the wheel, lotus, vajra, and sword; as well as the maṇḍalas of wind, water, fire, and earth elements. At their centers, upon a moon disk, there are [respectively] white OṂ, red ĀḤ, blue HŪṂ, and maṃ, in a form that neither goes, comes, or pauses.[667]

You should then undertake the yoga of the four elements and their recitations, and in this regard, persevere with the three phases of exhalation, inhalation, and pausing of breath in relation to the three seed syllables—inhalation with OṂ, pausing with ĀḤ, and exhalation with HŪṂ. Then, when [this visualization] has been internally absorbed, it should dissolve into the imperishable [vital essence].
The stabilizing wind[668] is located in the right channel, the life-sustaining wind in the left channel; the ascending wind is associated with the two water elements, and the descending purgative wind is associated with the two fire elements. You should make the adamantine recitations [of the seed syllables corresponding to these elements]. Specifically with regard to the wind located at the forehead [which is identified with the wind of the wind element], you should recite [OṂ, ĀḤ, HŪṂ respectively] in conjunction with the exhalation, inhalation, and pausing of breath.[669]
Then, from the seed syllable KṢUṂ, which represents the radiant aspect of the apperception of luminosity, and around which the letters KA, ṢA, RA, U, AND MA are gathered,[670] light rays emerge, causing the three maṇḍalas [of water, fire, and earth] or the single maṇḍala [of wind] to melt in a coalescence of emptiness and radiance. Equipoised therein, you should focus principally on the aspect of radiance. Next, the vital essences should be gradually absorbed, and you should focus on the coalescence of appearance and emptiness, which resembles the maṇḍala of space; {253} and at
this point you should focus principally on profound [emptiness]. Next, you should be equipoised in the disposition where the light rays of the coalescent vital essences, the three maṇḍalas, profound and radiant, are inseparable, like the moon reflected in water; and at this point you should focus principally on the nonduality of profundity and radiance.[671]

There is a saying to the effect that those who have perseverance will attain buddhahood in this lifetime, those who are indolent will attain buddhahood in the intermediate state, and those who have obstacles will attain buddhahood through the course of their rebirths.[672] To that end, you should block the nine orifices—navel, eyebrows, crown of the head, eyes, ears, mouth, nose, anus, and urethra—with the syllable HŪṂ.[673] You should focus on a nine-pronged vajra fashioned of various precious gems and metals on the crown of your head; and at its center, there is another white five-pronged vajra representing your own mind. Both are upright. At the center of the five-pronged vajra, on a moon disk, there is a yellow vital essence, the size of a small pea. At this point the aspect of radiance is brought forth.[674]
Next, all appearances of the inhabited world and its sentient inhabitants should be absorbed into the vital essence of your own heart, radiant in the form of Mañjuvajra. Your mind then enters into the central channel and emerges unimpededly from the “golden orifice” (gser sgo) of the anterior fontanel on the crown of the head. The prongs at the lower end of the two vajras penetrate your central channel and should be absorbed in the vital essence at the center of the five-pronged vajra. Focusing in that manner, your own body is absorbed into the nine-pronged vajra, that in turn is absorbed into the five-pronged vajra, that in turn is absorbed into the vital essence, and that vital essence then is ejected to a distance of seven palm trees [through the anterior fontanel]. Then the vital essence becomes subtler and subtler, and finally it will be absorbed into luminosity. The buddha body of reality in which all conceptual elaboration is quiescent is actualized; and, simultaneously, you should be attentive to the buddha body of perfect resource in which the major and minor marks are radiant and perfect, and the buddha body of emanation that, in the perception of ordinary beings, demonstrates the way of the twelve deeds.[675]
This definitive framework of consciousness transference is not clearly revealed in the father tantras, except in The Oral Transmission of Buddhajñānapāda.[676]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should visualize that from a syllable HŪṂ in the middle of an ordinary protective circle in the sky in front, upon a seat comprising a lion throne with lotus and sun cushions, and a red buffalo, your precious root teacher manifests in the form of red Mañjughoṣa Yamāntaka.[678] Encircling him on the periphery, on seats of precious gems with lotus and moon cushions, are the teachers of the lineage, the assemblage of meditational deities, buddhas, bodhisattvas, sublime pious attendants, hermit buddhas, heroes, ḍākinīs, and the hosts of doctrinal protectors. Through the light rays emanating from your teacher’s heart, all sentient beings of the three world systems are transformed into meditational deities and established on that aforementioned periphery.[679]

[After making those offerings, you should be equipoised in the unelaborate] state in which the body, speech, and mind of the teacher and your own body, speech, and mind are indivisible. Within this disposition, whatever suddenly arising consciousness manifests, at its very first initial appearance your mind should intimate to your own mind from where it has come, how it now abides, and where it will finally cease. Although from the start this consciousness has not come from anywhere at all, does not now abide anywhere at all, and in the end will not cease anywhere at all, it still appears to come, it appears to abide, and it appears to cease. At that very instant, you should be guided to conviction through certainty.[684]
The conceptual thoughts that you find by searching in that manner, whether subjective or objective, should be induced into your body through its nine orifices [in the manner of a storm]. Consequently, there will be a flash of light that resembles either the clear and radiant tip of a butter lamp flame or lightning, and finally, an opening will suddenly be breached from within the heart cakra. In the manner of an arrow fired by a [powerful] archer, [your bundle of thoughts] will reach the limitless shore of the great outer ocean. Your body, assuming the very form of Yamāntaka, will be light and mobile, like the leaves of a tree stirred by the wind, and you should then take your place alongside Amitābha in Sukhāvatī. OṂ ĀḤ HŪṂ! You should consolidate your mind, the essential nature of awareness, with the pristine cognitions of empty space, and let it be present, free from grasping.[685]
[Then, as far as postmeditation is concerned, there are two aspects, comprising the methods of setting the mind on enlightenment and the attributes that dispel obstacles. The former includes the six yogas,] which are as follows:[686]

After meditating that Mañjughoṣa Yamāntaka is actually present in the form of the teacher on the crown of your head, from the very depths of your heart, in words imbued with strong and fervent devotion, you should say, “I pray to the precious teacher, essential nature of all the buddhas of the three times!” After you pray with concentration, the teacher will dissolve into yourself, and you should remain equipoised in that disposition.[687]

Here, you should meditate, focusing on any sort of harmful enemy or obstructor. {256} That is to say, you should meditate, thinking, “How beautiful it is that over this and my many lives I have associated again and again with parents, siblings, and friends, and we have achieved mutual benefit! How pitiful are those harmful and injurious deeds that we inflict even now like a madman, aroused by past actions! May all those malign thoughts be calmed!”[688]

This may be uniquely exemplified by your own experience of toothache; for the loving-kindness that assumes the suffering of other sentient beings experiencing a similar sort of pain is not contrived.

Here, your own outer form manifests as Yamāntaka—empty inside, like an inflated red silk bag.

Next, your own body should be clearly visualized as Yamāntaka. Visualize that the teacher seated on the crown of your head melts into light and that the central channel, from the space between the eyebrows to the penis, is filled with the bluish-red wind of life breath and imbued with light rays of five colors.[692]
Seventh [in addition to those six unions or yogas], there are also the nails that dispel obstacles: You should take responsibility, as before, for familiarizing yourself with the transmitted teachings, scriptures, and pith instructions of the extremely unelaborate phase. Then, from that very disposition, you should resort to the crucial points of carefree and extensive conduct and bring forth the successful outcome of your former meditative stability. Should your mind waver toward objects due to thoughts of circumstantial appearance that may arise, and not hit the object of meditative concentration, you should accept these circumstantial appearances as a spiritual accomplishment and {257} pray one-pointedly by maintaining the union with the teacher who confers blessings, which is one of the aforementioned six methods of setting the mind on enlightenment, thereby transforming the appearance of the teacher into a deity. Finally, the teacher and your own mind will intermingle, and you should settle into that relaxed, open, and carefree mode.
Those of highest acumen should maintain their natural position, without wavering from their direct focus. Those of average acumen should cultivate settling into that basic position with respect to any conceptual objects that arise. Those of lowest acumen should carry whatever arises onto the path, prolonging it without foundation.

Furthermore, if the arising of masses of conceptual thoughts should occur without ceasing, then you should hold in your right hand the sharp sword of pristine cognition that appears from who knows where, and with that you should cut the arrogant conjectures that cherish the physical body into hundreds and thousands of pieces until not even the slightest remains. Offer these freely to harmful elemental spirits, so that they obtain satisfaction and unsurpassed joy. Imagine that all the venomous enmity of your mindstream, without exception, is pacified and that you possess the mind of enlightenment, endowed with spiritual and temporal well-being. Saying OṂ ĀḤ HŪṂ, you should then enter into meditative equipoise.[693]
If conceptual thoughts should suddenly resurface, then with regard to any actual painful thoughts that might occur, as in the aforementioned pith instruction on the luminosity of conceptual thought, you should distinguish between the supporting body and the supported mind and imagine that your own intrinsic awareness in the manner of the tip of a butter lamp flame dissolves into the heart of that deity of terrifying appearance [Vajrabhairava] and is turned toward the essence—the actual nature of mind. Then you should enter into meditative equipoise.[694]
If conceptual thoughts should suddenly arise yet again, you should focus from afar on the actual essential nature of the thoughts that arise, without wavering, and say, “If I myself am nondual pristine cognition, how should I regard you thoughts!”[695] In the manner of someone personally experiencing that it is a mistaken perception to see a multicolored rope as a snake and that it is actually a rope, your bewilderment will become groundless and baseless. You will triumph in battle with obstacles. {258}

The first of the four yogas is entitled “the yoga of form.” This has three phases: (i) the self-consecration of the generation stage, (ii) the consecration of appearances, and (iii) the consecration of the coalescence.[697]
(i) With regard to the self-consecration of the generation stage: commencing from the central eye of the deity, you should focus on the whole body of the transcendent lord Yamāntaka, male-female in union.[698]
(ii) With regard to the consecration of appearances: You should clearly visualize the transcendent lord Yamāntaka, male-female in union, and imagine that there is a red syllable YA in his heart. Light is diffused from that, causing the entire inhabited world to melt into red light. Then visualize this very world as his celestial palace. Imagine that light is repeatedly diffused from it, penetrating its sentient inhabitants, so that all sentient beings become the body of the transcendent lord Yamāntaka, male-female in union.[699]
(iii) With regard to the consecration of the coalescence: You should meditate on the celestial palace and the body of the transcendent lord Yamāntaka, in whatever manner they are recalled, [arising] from the very perception of this inhabited world and its sentient inhabitants as they commonly appear. Since they are without inherent existence although they appear in that manner, they resemble the reflection of the moon in water. Such is the consecration of the coalescence.[700]

The second of the four yogas is known as the “yoga of mantra.” With regard to the sequence of the mantras, you should exhale wind from the mouth, intoning the three HA syllables one thousand times, and then you should exhale wind from the nose, intoning the three HŪṂ syllables. Next, you should hold the upper surfaces of your feet with your hands and visualize the three channels. Meditate that wind enters from the right channel into the central channel, where it is retained and secured. Similarly, wind enters from the left channel into the central channel, where it is retained and secured. Once these winds have entered into the central channel, you should aim to hold the wind as long as you can.[701]
With regard to consciousness transference [which is a subsidiary of the yoga of mantra]: You should visualize that the essential nature of your own mind is the red syllable HŪṂ. Below it is ĀḤ, {259} below that is HRĪḤ, and below that are two green YA syllables, back to back. Your nine orifices, including the eyes, are blocked in succession by two conjoined HŪṂ syllables. In front of you, on the crown of the head, like an open window, there is a palm tree that reaches as far as Tuṣita. Above it you should meditate that your own root teacher is seated, radiant in the form of the transcendent lord Yamāntaka, male-female in union. Then wind arises from the two YA syllables within the heart, drawing in the hrīḥ, and that in turn draws in the ĀḤ, and that in turn draws in the HŪṂ, so that they all then merge from the crown of the head. Visualize that they penetrate the heart of the transcendent lord, your teacher, who is in front. Afterward, you should visualize that that same syllable HŪṂ is again present within your own heart cakra. Then recite HIK,[702] and visualize that the fontanel on the crown of the head is blocked by a [stabilizing] crossed vajra.[703]

The third of the four yogas is known as the “yoga of consecration”: Here the coalescence of bliss and emptiness is realized through the skillful means of the female mudra, commencing with those of the conch type.[704] Far from being a contaminated realization, this method actually effects the consecration in an uncontaminated manner.[705]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment, you should visualize yourself as Vajrabhairava, in the form of a “solitary spiritual warrior,” without consort.[708] His horns are clear blue, wrinkled at the base, crooked in the middle, and sharp and tapering at the top.[709] They are translucent and radiant, like the interior of a beryl gemstone. Within the tip of each horn there is a shining, white vital essence, in the shape of a dewdrop. At his heart, upon a lotus and moon cushion, there is Mañjughoṣa, according to the Indian tradition (rgya’i ’jam dbyangs), reddish yellow, the color of saffron, shrouded in a mass of light. You should visualize that his right hand brandishes the sword level with his shoulder {260} and the left hand holds a book upon a lily. His feet are in the adamantine posture. He is adorned with silks and ornaments, the major and minor marks are clearly complete, and he has a smiling demeanor. His topknot of matted hair is adorned with ornaments and a garland of flowers. Having generated this visualization, you should settle into meditative equipoise.
Next, from the left and right vital essences in the tips of Vajrabhairava’s horns, generative fluids, of the nature of bliss and the thickness of a spider’s web, flow down and crisscross his cheeks, in the manner of threads fashioned of white or crystal rainbow light in a clear sky. From the throat they come together and enter into the heart through the central channel, where they dissolve into Mañjughoṣa, so that there then manifest the appearances of one hundred thousand solar rays. These outwardly diffuse from all your pores one million trillion points of light.

Consequently, you yourself become radiant as the deity Vajrabhairava, with a form perfectly radiant, like a torch raised aloft in a dungeon. From the broad nostrils of his buffalo face—fearsome, awesome, and wrathful—bluish-red life-sustaining breath swirls like a cloud of smoke. The frowns of his face are closely furrowed, like the waves of an ocean. His three eyes are bright, staring and open, and his eyelashes and eyebrows flash like lightning moving throughout the ten directions. The hair of his head is tawny yellow, blazing like fire, and at the tips of his hair intense flames are diffused—flickering and spreading forth. His incisors are white and his other teeth—sharp, tapering, and covered with blood—are snarling. His mouth is wide open, and its interior, with quivering tongue, incinerates malignant spirits and obstructors with a vortex of hot wind, resembling fire. His body is stout and short, with the folded muscles of a thick lingam. His abdomen is round, and his fingernails and toenails draw in enemies and obstructors with their hooklike forms. His two hands {261} hold a knife and a skull at the heart. His left leg is extended, standing upon a lotus and moon seat in a haughty manner. He is adorned with a whitish neckband with bone ornaments, a crown of dry skulls, and a necklace of human heads, dripping with blood. He wears a cross-band of poisonous snakes and stands in the midst of a burning fiery mass of pristine cognition.

Having visualized the body of Vajrabhairava in that manner, without wavering from supreme pride, naked and holding a knife and skull, around midnight you should, along with a female partner, refine the dance movements [of Vajrabhairava] in a place measuring up to seven steps. Consequently, you will attain the miraculous ability to move unimpeded through walls and barriers. At that time, you should frequent charnel grounds and so forth.
Furthermore, when your physical body is filled with luminosity from the body of Mañjughoṣa within the heart and with the vital essence from the horn tips, which are of the nature of generative fluids, and you have become like the sky permeated with white rainbow light, points of light will emerge gradually from the orifice of the thick lingam, in the manner of incense smoke, and your entire physical body, without exception, will be covered by that mist-like white semen. Consequently, pale-blue rays of light will be diffused, and the vital essence, resembling a globule of mercury, will become radiant as the deity. You should then meditate, focusing with one-pointed attention on bliss and emptiness.
It is said with regard to this instruction that it is to be investigated whether the seed syllables of the four cakras, the five enlightened families, the four female buddhas, and the eight female bodhisattvas commencing with Lāsyā are to be established in the channels and the cakras.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should adopt the adamantine posture and the gesture of meditative equipoise and then focus directly on the navel. In the navel cakra {262}, upon a moon disk the size of a split pea, you should visualize the vital essences comprising the winds of the five elements—blue in the center, yellow in the east, green in the south, red in the west, and white in the north.[711] Seven times you should induce the breath to movement, and then unite the upper and lower winds with a single rotation of the knees (pus mo la bskor ba) and a single finger snap.[712] When you are resting, you should undertake five short sessions during that period of rest, without rising from your seat, and after that you may engage in activities. Over a twenty-four-hour period, you should undertake altogether thirty short sessions, adding a single rotation [of the knees] and a single finger snap to each short session. The best will acquire the power of the fire element within three days, the average within seven days, and the feeblest within fifteen days.[713]

Next, you should be firmly established as the deity [Cakrasaṃvara]: Within your navel cakra, you should visualize that upon the syllable AṂ[714] there is a red vital essence. It is connected via the central channel with a white HAṂ in the crown cakra.[715] The wind of power at the back focuses on the vital essences at the lower extremities of the right and left channels, and at their upper extremities it penetrates the nostrils. The wind at the soles of the feet ignites the fire of the triple intersection channel and causes the lower gate to open and close. Consequently, the syllable AṂ ignites and, passing from the right and left channels, it strikes the wind [of power] at the back.[716] The flame is then conducted downward [through the central channel] from the white and red KṢUṂ located within the anusvāra above the syllable HAṂ, [which is known as] the “luminous fierce inner heat”; and the fire blazes upward from the dark red KṢUṂ located within the anusvāra of the syllable AṂ in the navel cakra, [which is known as] the “ordinary fierce inner heat.” These two fires then collide together at the heart cakra, and in this way the upper and lower winds are intensely united.[717]
Next, you should visualize that the [four] primary elements and Mount Meru are present below you and your female mudra, who embodies pristine cognition. You manifest radiantly as Cakrasaṃvara, and at the tip of the vajra (penis) there is the syllable byāṃ. Your female mudra manifests radiantly as Vajravārāhī, and at the tip of her lotus anthers (vagina) there is the syllable DHYĀṂ. In the central channel of your own body there is a multicolored vajra with three upper and lower prongs. The generative essences derived from the meditative union of male and female then travel [upward] from their respective pathways of the central channel to their supreme location [at the crown of the head]. They are guided into that location with the resonance of the syllables ha, sib, hriṃ, rniṃ, and HŪṂ, and the pathways of the upper and lower winds are refined.[718]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment:[722] You should meditate on your teacher at the crown of your head, visualize an awesome protective circle of mantras, and practice the generation stage, along with the Arraying of the Physical Body with the Four Empowerments of Khecarī.[723]
Securely sealed with this armor, and mastering the vital points of the physical body, you should then meditate that in the navel cakra, the channel in the center, where the wind of the space element moves, resembles the cutting blade of a curved knife. The channel in the east, where the wind of the wind element moves, resembles a staff. The channel in the south, where the wind of the earth element moves, resembles a visarga. The channel in the west, where the wind of the water element moves, resembles a plow. The channel in the north, where the wind of the fire element moves, resembles a circular sphere. You should meditate that these all resemble minute drops. Then you should draw in the lower wind slightly and compress the upper wind slowly. Then draw in the lower wind strongly and hold it with the vase breathing. After that, you should focus on the channel in the center.
Over twenty-four hours you should undertake six sessions of this practice, including three during the daytime. Once five sessions have been completed, during the first session of the following morning you should snap a finger and desist from holding the [vase breathing] further.
In terms of the [division into] short sessions, each short session also ends with a finger snap, so that, incrementally, in the next morning session there will be five finger snaps; and in the next middle session of the day, there will be five finger snaps, making ten; and in the next evening session, there will be five finger snaps, making fifteen altogether. Until the following dawn there will be a further fifteen, making thirty. On the second day [of the retreat], this will become sixty; and on the third day, ninety. Adding these and refining the practice in that manner, those of superior acumen will develop the sensation of warmth within three or five days, those of middling acumen in seven or ten days, and those of lowest acumen {264} in fifteen days.
You should recognize the various adverse circumstances that may occur, such as pains in the channels, pains in the wind, an increase in afflicted mental states, and feelings of hunger and thirst, and you should take care.

Here you should visualize that the wind is in the soles of the feet, the fire is in the triple intersection channel, the short vowel AṂ (with anusvāra) is in the abdomen, and the downward-facing HAṂ is at the center of the crown of the head, directly in front of the space between the eyebrows. These two syllables are connected by the central channel, resembling a spider’s thread, and to its rear is the wind of power. The right and left channels simply cannot be tolerated by the eyes, their roots converging at the syllable OṂ [between the eyes]. They then directly reach the base of the HAṂ, where they curl at their ends and enter the nostrils.
Next, the fire should be intensified by the movement of the wind; and from the AṂ in the navel, the wind that has the appearance of fire and the property of warmth enters from the pathways of the right and left channels, so that the pathways of the channels are refined. Compressed by the wind [of power] at the back, it is slowly inhaled from the nostrils, thereby reversing the fire of the right and left channels. Pressing down slowly on the syllable aṃ causes it to combust, so that an extremely minute flame from the syllable AṂ passes upward through the central channel and the upper and lower winds are united. Sparks are diffused from the physical body, and vital essences are diffused like stars and reabsorbed. Such are the sorts [of experiences] that may occur. That concerns your own superior state of abiding.

Next, you should visualize that in the navel cakra, within its sixty-four channel branches, the fifty primary vowels and consonants encircle in groups of eight with the six short vowels in the middle.[724] In view, within the anusvāra circle of the short syllable AṂ there is a rough and strong dark red KṢUṂ, and on the crown of the head there is a similar KṢUṂ within the anusvāra circle of the syllable HAṂ. You should visualize that the fire is aroused, as before, by the wind, so that an extremely subtle flame deriving from the KṢUṂ passes upward from the heart. The wind is exhaled slowly from the nostrils, so that the tailwind is increased, and the HAṂ rubs against the KṢUṂ. Then they descend within the central channel and intermingle.
Holding the wind, the main practice concerning the opening of [the central channel] is as follows: you should visualize that a burning lamp is released and the generative essence descends, flowing downward like a spider’s thread, from the HAṂ, so that the AṂ is revitalized and the upper and lower winds are united.
With regard to the number of visualizations in this practice, there is one corresponding to the action of the wind, one corresponding to your own superior state, {265} one corresponding to the opening of the central channel, one corresponding to the main practice, or else two corresponding to the opening [of the central channel].

You should instantly visualize yourself clearly as the deity [Cakrasaṃvara]. The female consort, in the form of light, dissolves into the syllable a in the navel cakra. You should pay homage and pray with devotion to your teacher; then focus on a pale-red vital essence, the size of a mustard seed, resting upon a moon disk, the size of a split pea, in the heart cakra. After that, you should focus your awareness on the white vital essences in the two eyes, the blue ones in the ears, the yellow one between the nostrils, the red one in the channel of the tongue, and the green one at the tip of the genitals. Above the aforementioned pale-red vital essence of the heart there is a pale-blue one. Each of these is, as before, resting upon a moon disk. The sense faculties associated with these vital essences should then be diffused toward their corresponding sense objects and engaged with them. If they do not become diffused toward the six sense objects, you should focus exclusively on the heart cakra. That is the first stage conjoined with the seed syllables.[726]

Next, you should meditate on the winds of the sun and moon in association with the right and left nostrils, with nothing in between the nostrils. You should visualize that when the wind is exhaled, it resembles the mist at the end of a mountain range; and when it is inhaled, it has the form of light that fills the physical body. If it is diffused toward the gates of the sense faculties, you should act as before; but if it is not diffused, it is said that there will be no error. Self-consecration is undertaken here without the seed syllables. The wind is exhaled and inhaled three times, after which you should visualize a crossed vajra on the crown of your head, its hub reflecting the colors of the [four] directions, with a hexahedron motif. Within that there is a pale-red vajra, at the center of which there is a moon disk with a blue HŪṂ, from which rays of light are diffused. These should dissolve into the buddhas and bodhisattvas. If it becomes diffuse, you should repeat this training in the heart and navel cakras, and [in the other orifices] from the eyes to the genitals. If the wind moves from the right nostril, you should visualize a sun disk on the ūrṇakeśa; and if it moves from the left nostril, you should visualize a moon disk. Above that you should visualize the vital essence {266}—blue in the center, white in the east, green in the north, red in the west, and yellow in the south. Meditating on this subtle energy constitutes the second stage—the crossed vajra, in which the seed syllables are absent.[727]

Next, with regard to the commitment seal, you should meditate on yourself as the meditational deity in male-female union, and visually generate the lotus (vagina) and vajra (penis) associated with the secret cakra. At their tips, you should visualize the generative essences in the form of HŪṂ, and then enter into meditative absorption. If the action seal is physically present, the visualization is the same. With regard to the phenomenal seal, you should focus your awareness on the white HŪṂ at the orifice of the vajra, which is of the nature of a vital essence. When you have obtained bliss, it should be inducted upward through the secret channel, the navel, the heart, and the throat, to the crown of the head. With regard to the Great Seal, the bliss is established without contrivance, naturally descending and free from limitations. That constitutes the third stage in which the “gem” is filled.[728]

Next, you should meditate as before that within the secret cakra there is a pale-red hexahedron within which there are five vital essences, resembling five clusters.

Next, you should focus upon a moon disk in your own heart, resting on which there is a white HŪṂ.

The vibration of that syllable also becomes like a vanishing cloud. You should then be equipoised in luminosity, where all things are empty.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should develop certainty, thinking that you yourself have been inducted into the maṇḍala by your teacher, and that the external appearance of your physical body is Cakrasaṃvara, with four faces and twelve arms; and the deities within this maṇḍala number sixty-two. You should meditate that the boot of your teacher rests on the crown of your head, develop devotion, and then dissolve that visualization. The inhabited world and its sentient inhabitants, assuming the form of the deity and the celestial palace, are then absorbed into you. Your faces are absorbed into the primary face, your arms are absorbed into the primary pair of arms, and the female consort Vajravārāhī, too, assuming the form of a red light, is absorbed into the syllable a in the navel cakra.

You should meditate that the dark green maṇḍala of wind at the entrance to the anus resembles swirling smoke. Above it there is the triangular red maṇḍala of fire—the dark red blazing fire of the syllable kṣa. In the middle of the navel cakra, there is the syllable aṃ. Forming an inner circle around it are the eight syllables A, KA, CA, ṬA, TA, PA, YA, and ŚA. Outside these are the sixteen vowels, the thirty-four consonants, and the six long vowels. In the four cardinal directions of the heart cakra are the four short vowels A, I, U, and O; and in its four intermediate directions are YA, RA, LA, and VA. Within the throat cakra are the four encircling syllables Ā, Ī, Ū, and AI, with OṂ in the middle; and on an outer circle, on twelve petals, are the twelve vowels with the exception of Ṛ, Ṝ, Ḷ, and ḹ. In the crown cakra, in the middle there is the syllable HAṂ, and on its petals two sets of the sixteen vowels. The syllable AṂ [in the navel] and HAṂ [in the crown] are connected via the central channel. In the right and left channels the vowels and consonants are multiplied. The fontanel of the head is blocked by the syllable OṂ, and the lower orifice by the syllables HŪṂ PHAṬ. That constitutes the first stage of the continuum to be known.[732]

Flames burst forth from the point between the eyebrows and enter you via the legs of Cakrasaṃvara, the essential nature of your teacher, in whom all the tathāgatas of the ten directions are gathered. {268} Then the nectar of his body is invited [into your body], and the sixteen delights are individually enhanced in your crown, throat, heart, and navel cakras.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment, then with the words ŚRĪHERUKA AHAṂ (“I am Śrīheruka!”), you should adopt the skillful means whereby your awareness, clear and unimpeded, definitively assumes the form of the four buddha bodies. As such, you arise as Innate Cakrasaṃvara, the color of the moon, and the interior of your body resembles an inflated bag of white silk. In the middle [of that divine form] the three channels, including those to the right and left of the central channel, are filled with pure essences and with semen and blood in the form of the vowels and consonants. The maṇḍala of the wind element is at the anus and the maṇḍala of the fire element is at the triple intersection. In the middle of the navel cakra with its sixty-four branches there is the syllable AṂ. In its inner circle there are the eight letters representing the eight sets [of consonants and vowels], and outside these are all the vowels and consonants. At the heart cakra, in the middle there is the syllable HŪṂ, and in its four cardinal directions, the syllables BHRŪṂ, ĀṂ, JĪṂ, and KHĀṂ, and in the four intermediate directions, the syllables LAṂ, MAṂ, PAṂ, and TAṂ. At the throat cakra, in the middle is the syllable OṂ, and on its branches are the sixteen vowels. In the crown cakra there is the syllable HAṂ, with two sets of vowels. Here you should meditate that the letters are inside the channels.
Next, the fire is ignited by the wind, and the fire of the syllable AṂ incinerates the cakras. After training in the blazing and secretion [of the vital essence] that is warmed by the nectar of HAṂ, as a successful outcome you will be introduced to the eight sacred places of the maṇḍala of buddha mind with PU JĀ O A GO RĀ DE MĀ; {269} to the eight sacred places of the maṇḍala of buddha speech with KĀ O TRI KO KA LA KĀ HI; and to the eight sacred places of the maṇḍala of buddha body with PRE GṚ SAU SU NA SI MA KU—that is to say, you will be introduced to all the primary sacred places of the twenty-four lands.[738]
Finally, you should develop confidence in the level imbued with the seven aspects of union.[739]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should generate the visualization of yourself as Jñāneśvarī. You should visualize that in order to mature the seed syllables, at all the orifices of the body there are triangular hexahedrons fashioned of bone, and within [each of] them at the triangular channel knot there is a vital essence of generative fluid in the shape of a half-moon. You should meditate that these vital essences of generative fluid are virtually spinning around.[741]
Next, the four delights known as “delight,” “supreme delight,” “absence of delight,” and “coemergent delight” are experientially cultivated [with reference to the four cakras], along with their four [corresponding subtle perceptions]: the subtle perception [of whiteness], the grand subtle perception [of redness], the approximate subtle perception [of blackness], and [the subtle perception of] coemergence.[742]

As for the pith instruction entitled “cow’s udder”: In the navel cakra there is a channel resembling a coiled nāga (nagendrakuṇḍalinī, klu dbang ’khyil ba). Below it, at the triple intersection channel, there is a hexahedron, within which there is a yellow KṢUṂ with the property of fire. In the sole of each foot there is a syllable KṢUṂ. Within a red lotus in the heart cakra, resembling the “hoofprint of a bull,” there is a vital essence of generative fluid, the size of a thumb. In its center there is a white HŪṂ, where the upper and lower winds clash. In the navel is the place where the wind of past actions gathers.
The fire then blazes from the yellow KṢUṂ, and it also blazes from the two soles of the feet. Everything within the channels burns with a reddish-yellow glow. Next, your mind should be concentrated on the crown of the head, where it dissolves into the syllable HAṂ. This is the coalescence—the nonduality of magical display and emptiness. Through your having meditated in that manner, the nine orifices of buddha body should be blocked, the four orifices of buddha speech should be blocked, and the two of buddha mind should be opened.[743] {270}

Next, with regard to the pith instruction called the “hoofprint of the bull”: You should meditate, as appropriate, dependent on either thirteen syllables or a single syllable. In the former case, there is a vital essence upon the open lotus of the heart cakra that resembles the hoofprint of a bull, and at its center there is a white syllable AṂ inserted within a vital essence, surrounded at its extremity by the twelve vowels, commencing with a. From the vital essence there arises on the right side a red hot wind, with the properties of fire and wind; and on the left side, there arises a white cold wind with the properties of earth and water. You should meditate that these two intermingle and collide, with the result that the vital essences alone spin, while the seed syllables do not spin.[744]
In the latter case, where the practice is dependent on a single syllable, you should meditate that upon the open lotus of the heart that resembles the hoofprint of a bull, there is a single white syllable AṂ. You should visualize that it starts to spin due to the conflict between the hot and cold winds, as above. The burnt offering of the flames should be dissolved in the white syllable a of the navel and the heart, and then the syllable a dissolved into the external body. It is said that this experience resembles the higher aspiration toward emptiness.[745]
Next, with regard to the central channel that resembles the awn of a plantain, in the heart cakra there is an eight-petal lotus. Opening on its right side there is an egg-shaped vital essence, with the properties of water, heavy and cool; and in its center there is a white HŪṂ. This egg-shaped vital essence opens in the manner, for example, of fruit that opens due to three conditions—warmth, seasonal moisture, and wind.[746]

In this context, you should visualize the coiled nāga at the navel, and below it a yellow KṢUṂ appears with the properties of fire and wind. It blazes within the central channel and melts the generative fluid. That fire then melts the syllable HAṂ, resembling the leaf of a tree. It flows down from its vital essence to the place between the eyebrows and is thereby rendered efficacious. Via the central channel, it then gradually dissolves into the white HŪṂ of the heart cakra and fills the body. You should then visualize that its whiteness extends from all the pores. You should visualize that, at this point, it does not diffuse outwardly, for at the heart cakra resembling the dome of a stupa, in the central channel resembling the awns of a plantain, the vital essence fills the inwardly opening eight-petal lotus [of the heart cakra]—the dome of the stupa, with the savor of bliss. On its four cardinal petals are the syllables A, A, AṂ, and A, {271} and on the four intermediate petals are the four neuter syllables. These are filled with the light of that vital essence, which outwardly permeates whiteness. You should meditate repeatedly in that manner.[747]

As for the pith instruction on consciousness transference, when the outer and inner signs of death appear, you should endeavor to deceive impending death. But when you are definitely about to die, first you should cultivate the vase breathing twenty-one times, again and again. The orifices should be blocked in the following manner: the blue HŪṂ is at the two eyes; the white suṃ is at the palate; the stacked syllables saṃ maṃ RAṂ YUṂ are at the throat; the stacked syllables HAṂ MAṂ RAṂ YUṂ are at both shoulders; the stacked syllables YAṂ MAṂ RAṂ YUṂ are at the heart; the stacked syllables KṢAṂ MAṂ RAṂ YUṂ are at the navel; HŪṂ is at the lower orifice of the urethra; and KṢUṂ is at the anus.[748]
Then you should fill [the abdomen with wind], as if filling a vase, and array six blue YUṂ syllables in the following six places: the two kidney cavities, the two armpits, and the two soles of the feet. You should meditate that the syllable HŪṂ in the middle of the heart cakra is surrounded at the periphery by four blue syllables, and that from the navel to the crown of the head twenty-one lotuses are vertically stacked, in the manner of a string of dongtsé coins.[749] You should meditate that in the middle of the navel cakra there is the syllable a, and on the crown of the head the syllable KṢUṂ at the orifice of the anterior fontanel. These last two are connected by a line of light that resembles a spider’s thread. Saying hik, you should meditate that the syllable a is drawn upward, as if being pulled by a rope, and it reaches the top of the [first] lotus. As you say HIK a further twenty-one times, that syllable a is drawn by the KṢUṂ all the way up to the lotus of the crown cakra. You should know that this resembles the drawing of water from a well. It is said that you should focus on the desirable place for rebirth by means of meditative stability, and then breathe HIK twenty-one times, before transferring consciousness from the crown of your head. By this means you will obtain the body that you desire—an awareness holder, the body of a god, and so on.[750]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment, you should sit cross-legged upon a comfortable mat {272} with both hands in meditative equipoise. You should focus the mind and meditate that in the right channel are the consonants, ranging from top to bottom, and in the left channel are the vowels, ranging from bottom to top. Below the navel cakra, at the triple intersection of channels, upon a hexahedron, the fire is ignited by the wind. You should visualize that the syllable A is warm and hot to the touch. You should be mindful of this experience in each vertebra, and meditate without wavering.[752]
Having mastered this stability, through the movement of the vowels and consonants in the right and left channels, you should then meditate focusing on the letter a in the navel cakra, which has the properties of the fire and wind elements and is present within A white chamber of light formed by the hexahedron. A subtle flame burns noisily, incinerating the syllable HAṂ at the crown of the head, so that the generative fluid flows down, coats the extremity of the flame, and dissolves into the syllable A. You should meditate on that.[753]

[As far as the three phases of yoga are concerned:] From the perspective of the yoga of conclusive attributes, the complete path comprising all the three phases—lower forms, profound mantra, and conclusive attributes—is without error. But, even though you may have sequentially practiced first the lower forms, next the profound mantra, and finally the conclusive attributes, it is said that that sequence is not definitive.[754]
You should block the right and left channels with the garlands of vowels and consonants. a is in the navel cakra, HŪṂ is in the heart, AṂ is in the throat, HAṂ is in the crown of the head. The three higher syllables have the properties of the water element, while the syllable a in the navel has the properties of the fire and wind elements. From the syllable a the fire burns noisily. It penetrates and melts the syllables HŪṂ, aṃ, and HAṂ, which then directly flow down, forming a coating, and dissolve gradually into the syllable A.

[More specifically, the pith instructions based on the vital essences are threefold, including the meditation on the upper extremity, the meditation on the lower extremity, and the meditation on the middle of the body.][756] [First] you should practice the yoga of lower forms [which accords with the generation stage]. Then [with regard to the meditation on the middle of the body]:[757] The crown of the head has the properties of the wind element, the heart has the properties of the earth element, the navel has the properties of the water element, and the genitals have the properties of the fire element. The three higher syllables have the properties of the water element.
As the wind moves toward the crown of the head, it causes the generative essence to appear at the syllable HAṂ, and subsequently that wind causes the white generative fluid to appear prominently in the heart, in the navel, and at the tip of the vajra (penis), after which it is reversed upward to the crown of the head, where it dissolves into the syllable HAṂ. [You should know that] as breath is exhaled, the vital essence appears prominently at the tip of the vajra (penis); and as breath is inhaled, it rises higher and dissolves into the syllable HAṂ.
Just as water from a single channel divides into two, at the upper extremity [of the central channel] {273} there are the right channel of the sun and the left channel of the moon. You should meditate in conjunction with the syllable OṂ when the breath is exhaled, in conjunction with the syllable HŪṂ when breath is inhaled, and in conjunction with the syllable ĀḤ when the breath is diffused at the triple intersection of channels below the navel. Bliss will immediately arise.[758]

Next, you should meditate on the form [of the deity] that accords with the generation stage, and as the eight attributes [of the eight elements] arise,[759] you will then connect with the perfection stage.
With regard to the visualization at the upper extremity of the upper gate,[760] you should meditate that at the heart cakra there is an open red lotus with four petals, and [at its center] there is a sun disk [with the properties of the fire and wind elements] and a moon disk with the properties of the earth and water elements, with a drop of generative essence between them. The sun and moon disks are conjoined around it [in the manner of an amulet]. There is a fine thread wound around them [back and front] in three strands, and on the side of the moon disk there are seed syllables wound around in three bands—with the thirty-two consonants on the upper thread and the sixteen vowels on the middle thread. On the side of the sun disk there are no seed syllables. You should focus your mind on the vital essence at the middle of this thread,[761] observing it there in a hollow in the center of the moon disk. With the sound of TOG, a syllable HŪṂ appears, piercing through the moon disk above. There is a fine thread attached to the HŪṂ, which winds around the moon disk in a circle, turning to the right, and then winds around the sun and moon disks from front [to back], thereby forming a cross. Once the HŪṂ has exited from the hollow, you should continue focusing on the vital essence. That is the form through which the deity is generated in the mantra syllables.[762]

You may then meditate on the [aforementioned] three phases of yoga[—that is, lower form, profound mantra, and conclusive attributes—] in their totality, and five signs will appear.[763]
When that vital essence is activated at the upper extremity of the upper gate, you should visualize that there is a vital essence at the center of the conjoined sun and moon disks, which resemble an amulet box, empty in the middle. At its periphery, strung by a fine thread, are the sixteen vowels, with A in the vanguard, and above that, also strung by a fine thread, are the thirty-six consonants, with KA in the vanguard. These strings of letters rotate one by one, without touching, just as gemstone beads are strung with a fine thread in such a way that they do not touch one another. You should then meditate that the wind slightly collides and breaches the top [of the amulet], so that it is loosened. KṢA, the final consonant in the string, brushes against the vital essence, and the syllable A [leading the vowels that follow it] is released, so that the KṢA is dislodged {274} and presses the syllable A inside. You should undertake this meditation repeatedly.

When, on the other hand, the vital essence is activated dependent on the lower gate, you should look for a female consort with the appropriate signs.

When that happens, you should not vigorously rub the vajra (penis) but engage in this experiential cultivation in an uncontaminated manner. Settle your mind on that, and later, even without discriminative awareness, realization will arise.[764]

There are three ways of training the breath:[765] (i) relaxed breathing, (ii) counted breathing, and (iii) vase breathing [the last of which requires forceful training].
With regard to the first method: You should examine from where the wind has come, where it goes, and what is its action. Do not let it be purposeful. Even though you want to control it, you should not. Even though you want to inhale it, you should not. You should act freely and without effort.
As to the second method: After that, you should maintain awareness of the wind, counting the breaths. That is to say, you should visualize HŪṂ in the heart cakra. As you exhale breath, you should count or estimate three cycles of OṂ, revolving like a millstone; as you inhale breath, you should count or estimate three cycles of HŪṂ; and as you pause the breath, you should count or estimate the syllable ĀḤ. You should control your breathing by counting in that manner and prolong the pauses.
As to the third method: You should vigorously perform vase breathing, bumping on the ground and exhaling about ten times. Then you should inhale and restrict the breath within, filling the area below the navel. Do not exhale strongly or you will fill the abdomen in the wrong way. You should breathe out twenty-one times and fill the abdomen while maintaining the posture of the lion’s play.[766]
You may also block the eyes, ears, mouth, and nostrils. Press the vajra (penis) between the thighs and block the anus with the heels. This constitutes the forceful method of breath control. With regard to the duration of this blocking, it should be equivalent to six finger snaps while placing the palms of the hands on the knees.[767]
Since the complete phases of mantra, form, and attributes appear in a nonarising manner, it is from the attributes that the [forms of the] deities and the mantras appear. Such are the pith instructions of the Great Magical Emanation that are unmistaken with regard to the entire path.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: {275} You should meditate that [you are present as Kharamukha Cakrasaṃvara and that] rays of light are diffused from the syllable HŪṂ in your heart cakra, absorbing the entirety of the inhabited world and its sentient inhabitants into your own body. Your female consort is also absorbed into your heart cakra from the left nostril. The visualization should then dissolve into a form in which you yourself appear as two-armed [Kharamukha Cakrasaṃ-vara], and your teacher is present on the crown of your head. With fervent devotion you should then pray, “May the genuine meditative stability grow in my mind!”[769]
Then you should visualize that within your heart cakra, there is a syllable a from which, upon a moon disk the size of a split pea, your own awareness is present as a white and red vital essence, the size of an average mustard seed. Hold this in mind! Then gradually you should gently unite the upper and lower winds. After familiarizing yourself with this practice, you should continue to hold it in mind, without letting your mental faculty be diffused elsewhere. As you abide one-pointedly, the meditative stability of bliss and radiance will arise.[770]
Dependent on that, your mind may become diffused toward other sense faculties, in which case you should undertake the preliminary practices as before. Then, with regard to the main practice, you should meditate on extremely minute white vital essences resting upon moon disks inside your two eyeballs. You should close the eyes and hold these in mind. After maintaining that practice for a while, you may then observe diverse sights, while focusing your mind on the vital essences, without permitting it to be diffused elsewhere. When you have familiarized yourself with this, the form of the vital essences will become radiant and meditative stability will arise on the basis of whatever sights you see. You should acquire some stability in this practice and meditate that those vital essences are absorbed into the heart cakra, whereupon the vital essence of the heart cakra becomes even more radiant and blazing than before. Through meditative equipoise the supreme meditative stability will then arise.[771]

Thereafter, your mind may become diffused toward the ears, in which case you should meditate on the preliminary practices, as before. Then, with regard to the main practice, you should meditate on two blue vital essences resting upon moon disks inside your two ears. You should hold in mind a direction where there is no sound. After maintaining that for a while, you may then hear diverse sounds, while focusing your mind on the vital essences, without permitting it to be diffused elsewhere. {276} When you have familiarized yourself with this, your visualization of the vital essences will become radiant and meditative stability will arise on the basis of whatever sounds you hear.

Thereafter, your mind may become diffused toward the tongue, in which case you should meditate on the preliminary practices, as before.

Thereafter, you should visualize and meditate on the mental faculty that wanders everywhere, in which case you should meditate on the preliminary practices, as before.

Thereafter, you should visualize and meditate on the afflicted mental faculty, in which case you should meditate on the preliminary practices, as before.

You should hold this in mind, in a place that is extremely isolated. After maintaining that for a while, you may then meditate on topics imbued with objects where diverse afflicted mental states arise. This movement of afflicted mental states, including attachment, {278} should then be absorbed into the blue vital essence. You should hold this in mind. When you have familiarized yourself with this, your visualization of the vital essence will become radiant and afflicted mental states will not arise, or else they will arise only slightly and even vanish of their own accord. You should acquire some stability in this practice and meditate that that [blue] vital essence is absorbed into the pale-red vital essence below. That, in turn, is also absorbed into the red and white vital essence below. That, in turn, is absorbed into the moon disk. The moon disk, in turn, vanishes like clouds dissolving into space. Through meditative equipoise supreme calm abiding will then arise.[777]

At the end, when you arise from meditative equipoise, you should instantaneously see the appearances of the moon disk and the vital essence that are gradually formed. You should look upon yourself—the Heruka—and external phenomena to be without inherent existence, just as they appear. You should meditate in that manner until the respective signs [of realization] appear. When this is perfected, the meditative stability of calm abiding that is empty and of higher insight that is blissful and radiant will arise. Through that continuum of meditative stability, the pristine cognition of the path of insight will arise, so that buddhahood will be attained.
In brief, this method of training infinitely refines the meditative stability of composure with respect to the gates of the sense faculties, and then, in the main practice, you will settle upon the expressive energy of the imperishable vital essence. Finally, you should visualize that in the navel cakra resembling the coiled Kharamukha Cakrasaṃvara, the fire of the fierce inner heat darts like the tongue of a snake, so that it fills and permeates the interior of the central channel. You should meditate persistently on the union of the upper and lower winds.[778]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: (i) You should meditate on your own body as the body of Vajravārāhī. This is the first meditation—the training in visualizing her form. {279} (ii) Next, you should meditate upon a red four-petal lotus in the navel cakra, where there is a red syllable VAṂ. That is the second meditation—the training in the seed syllables. (iii) Next, you should compress the upper wind and meditate that it dissolves into the syllable VAṂ within the navel cakra. That is the third meditation—the training in subtle energy. (iv) Next, you should meditate that, owing to the movement of the maṇḍala of wind derived from the syllable YAṂ in your feet, the fire derived from the syllable RAṂ blazes as far as the genitals; then, through the warming of the syllable VAṂ in the navel cakra, light is on the verge of blazing from the syllable VAṂ, and as light blazes therefrom, the body is transformed into a mass of light. This is the fourth meditation—the training in the body of light. (v) Next, you should meditate that this light resembles hazy clouds vanishing in the sky or rainbow light vanishing in the atmosphere. This is the fifth meditation—the training in luminosity. (vi) Finally, within the disposition of this luminosity, you should visualize that there is a downward-facing white syllable HAṂ, directly positioned at the crown of the head, as before, and that there is an upward-facing red syllable VAṂ, directly positioned at the navel cakra. You should meditate that from that syllable HAṂ of the upper gate, generative essence drips as if on a spider’s thread and penetrates the syllable VAṂ, so that the VAṂ is completely transformed, and consequently you become manifest as the coalescent female deity Vajravārāhī, in the manner of rainbow light. This manifestation arises in the nature of bliss, radiance, and nonconceptualization, but these attributes are not differentiated—they are coalesced owing to the inseparability of bliss and emptiness, and they are coalesced owing to the inseparability of radiance and emptiness. That is the sixth meditation—the training in coalescence.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should settle your body into the exemplary sevenfold posture of Vairocana.[781] You should clearly regard and maintain the notion of your body as an empty frame and all its hairs, nails, and pores {280} hollow like a sieve. You should also regard and maintain the notion of the body of [your female consort, embodying] the transcendent lady Sahajā, with the nature of an empty frame.[782]

When the core of your body is upright, you should imagine that the vertical central channel, extending from the genitals to the anterior fontanel, is straight as an arrow, hollow as straw, and radiant like a sesame oil lamp. The right and left channels both converge with the central channel at the
upper and lower gates. At the upper gate they enter into the two nostrils. The cakra of the navel has sixty-four channel branches, the cakra of the heart has eight, the cakra of the throat has sixteen, and the cakra at the forehead has thirty-two. All these have the nature of an empty frame, and the network of the channels, extending as far as the horripilation of the pores, also constitutes an empty frame. This practice is called “holding the family-endowed basis.”[783]
Next, you should expel the residual breath, and then slowly inhale breath that has the color of smoke and is directly in front, sixteen finger widths from the tip of the nose. It passes from the two pathways of the right and left channels into the lower end of the central channel. At this point you should also draw in the lower wind, and when you are ready to breathe out, you should visualize that it rises upward from the central channel through the anterior fontanel at the crown of the head. Without holding either the upper or lower wind, you should then push out your abdomen and fill it with the middle wind.[784]
Next, you should visualize that at the upper end of the central channel, which reaches the point between the eyebrows, there is a vital essence of generative fluid with four attributes—it is white, lustrous, round, and bright. As you inhale breath, at the same time you should visualize that vital essence descending within the central channel, pausing in the center of each respective cakra, and gradually appearing at the center of the secret cakra, after which it again rises upward, pale [in color], quickly reaching the upper extremity—the point between the eyebrows.[785]

Next, you should visualize that from the vital essence within the channel of fierce inner heat, an intensely burning flame spreads throughout all the cardinal and intermediate directions, along with the zenith and the nadir. This nature of fire, endowed with the four aforementioned attributes, then assumes the form of a celestial palace within an extensive and vast protective circle. {281} In this way, the channel of fierce inner heat should be transformed into your dwelling. When you are sitting and lying down, you should visualize that your seat and the ground also are of the nature of fire. In this way, the channel of fierce inner heat should be transformed into your seat. You should imagine that all the clothes that you wear are also of the nature of fire. In this way, the channel of fierce inner heat should be worn as clothing.[786]

With regard to the pith instructions concerning the illusory body, you should reflect and investigate that all the phenomena of cyclic existence, which are of the nature of suffering, and in particular the aggregates of your own body, and especially your mind, are impermanent and lacking independence, even for a single instant of time. That is to say, they are unreliable.[787]
On the other hand, since all that appears and exists has been present from the beginning in a pure cycle, you should regard your own physical body as the body of your preferred deity and develop certainty through the twelve similes of magical display. For, with regard to the completely perfect appearance of this buddha body, its lack of inherent existence resembles a reflection in a mirror. Its manifestation in any color whatsoever resembles a rainbow. Its manifestation of two from one resembles a mirage. Its formation from subtle energy and rays of light resembles an optical aberration. Its manifestation of a singular form as a multiplicity resembles the moon’s reflection in water. Its indestructibility by any entity whatsoever resembles a human shadow. Its manifestation in diverse fields and arrays resembles a spirit town of gandharvas. These seven are the similes pertaining to buddha body. Its swift transformations resemble an echo. Its manifestation of a single savor as multiplicity resembles bubbles of water. These two are the similes pertaining to buddha speech. The lack of inherent existence in its experiences resembles a dream. Its manifestation as coemergence resembles a magical display. These two are the similes pertaining to buddha mind. Its swift engagement in enlightened activity resembles lightning. This is the simile pertaining to the essentiality of all three [buddha body, speech, and mind] combined. You should develop certainty and meditate through the approaches of these [twelve similes].[788]

When the circumstances of the intermediate state arise after death, you should skillfully refine in accordance with your past experience the realization that whatever arises is pure appearance. In this way, you will actualize the buddha body of perfect resource during the intermediate state. You should abandon the sustenance of the present life and, until you grasp the next life, experientially cultivate your present circumstance as a corporeal being imbued simply with subtle energy and mind. You should also ascertain the notion that any appearances that arise at the present time contingent on past experiences in fact denote the intermediate state. In this way, the natural expression [of the intermediate state] will be actualized or else phenomena will be transformed into pure appearances.
By having naturally cultivated and experienced the appearances of the intermediate state in this disposition, you will arrive at [the true nature of] dreams. That is to say, whatever appearances of dreams might arise, they will be reminiscent of the intermediate state, and on that basis, you will refine them and take into your own hands the experiential cultivation of natural liberation.
If you have familiarized yourself with that, when the time of death arrives, the conceptual thoughts that partake of eighty natural expressions[792] will gradually dissolve, and through the phases of the three perceptions,[793] your presence in this life will yield. After you have died, when the appearances of the intermediate state arise in whatever forms, you will comprehend them according to the pith instructions that you previously experienced and, in this way, actualize the level of the buddha body of perfect resource during the intermediate state.[794]

With regard to the pith instructions of consciousness transference, you should actually visualize in the sky, about one hand span above the crown of your head, your root teacher and the meditational deity in the form of Khecarī, in her celestial palace. You should then visualize within the central channel of your body, at the location of the throat, a white syllable OṂ, encircled by A NU TA RA. Breathe in and simultaneously imagine that from the syllable OṂ of the throat cakra a blue HŪṂ breaks off and appears at the heart cakra. From that, in turn, a red ĀḤ breaks off and comes to rest at the navel cakra. You should hold your breath as long as possible, and then breathe out. {283} After that, you should visualize simultaneously that the syllable ĀḤ of the navel cakra and the syllable HŪṂ merge, and that these in turn merge with the syllable OṂ of the throat cakra. Then the syllable OṂ, with its four surrounding letters, assumes the form of a vital essence that is the essential nature of your body, speech, and mind. Emerging from the anterior fontanel, it finally merges into the heart of your teacher.[795]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should meditate on the teacher upon a lotus and moon cushion on the crown of your head, and say, “I beseech you, Precious Teacher, to assuage my ailments and demons. I beseech you to purify my negativity and obscurations! I beseech you to let extraordinary meditative stability grow in my mindstream!” You should visualize that within your own head, there is a pristine white hexahedron, resting directly upon which there is a white syllable A, from which nectar arises, filling the body and expelling negativity, obscuration, and propensities in the form of smoky liquid.[797] Then your body is transformed, as if into a crystal ball. Cooling nectar will alleviate fevers; red nectar will alleviate colds; red and yellow nectar will alleviate wind disorders, purifying them by balancing heat and cold; and nectar that resembles boiling molten bronze will alleviate demonic possession.[798] Signs of this success will arise in actuality and in dreams.[799]

As for the fierce inner heat, in the preliminaries your physical body should be visualized as an empty frame that is of the nature of fire,[800] and then you should secure the posture of the “six opposing stoves” [of the hands, legs, and elbows].[801]
Next, you should become manifestly radiant as Vajrayoginī and visualize that the interior of her body is fine and translucent, like an inflated bag of red silk, and that to the left, right, back, and front of the kidney channels there are globes of fire.[802] You should then say, “Precious Teacher, I beseech you to let the meditative stability of bliss and warmth and the meditative stability of bliss and emptiness arise within me for the sake of all sentient beings!”[803] For the control of the gentle wind, you should perform the yogic exercise of stomach rotation, and thereby imagine that the [four globes of] fire fill the abdomen and clash together, causing pale-red sparks to scatter.[804]
Next, you should practice the “consumption of the channel of fierce inner heat” and visualize that the syllable RAṂ at the triple intersection of the channels is aroused by the fire and wind, and as the central channel widens, {284} it fills it with fire. Through the yogic exercises that stimulate the body and the yogic exercise of kindling fire with a rubbing stick, the winds below the navel, associated with speech, are united, and you should then focus one-pointedly on the blazing of the fire.[805]

Next, you should undertake the ancillary practices, known as the “wearing of clothing” that covers the body with fire down to the soles of the feet; the “spreading of the mat,” through which you lie down like a sleeping dog at the gate; and the “riding of the horse,” through which the goddess of wind lifts you up from under the armpits.[806]
You should [first] refine the [fourfold] “cycle of wind” twenty-one times.[807] The empowerment of conditioned existence will then be conferred and white nectar will flow from the body of the teacher at the crown of your head, filling [by stages] your crown, throat, heart, navel, and secret cakras. You should long for the four empowerments[808] and meditate on the places of the upper body where obstacles might arise as [precious] “three-eyed gems.”[809] You should repeatedly visualize your body like a sieve and expel them. As you strongly intone the syllable HA and pound the back of your fist directly against your chest, diseases will then emerge in the form of steam.[810] As far as the lower part of your body is concerned, you should meditate that at the orifice of the vajra (penis), the generative essence wells up within the opening of the slender stem of a red lotus—the essential nature of blood (rakta)—and after adorning the soles of the feet, it is transferred to the crown of the head through the gesture of vajroṣṇīṣa. The visualization entails that the penis (nor bu) appears to be inverted upward into the small intestine, so that you focus your awareness on a red and translucent HŪṂ emerging via the pathway of the central channel as far as the anterior fontanel. Thereby ejaculations can be cut off six times. I have written this according to an oral teaching.[811]

With regard to the illusory body, you should engender a sense of disillusionment [with impermanent phenomena] and meditate on yourself as Innate Cakrasaṃvara. At the crown of your head is [your teacher in the form] Gathering of All Gurus. You should then say, “Precious Teacher, I beseech you that I might abandon self-grasping, that I might develop in my mind the sense that it is unnecessary, and that I might refine the illusory body and dreams!” The teacher should then dissolve into yourself, and thereafter, whatever appears arises as a magical display.
Those of superior acumen reinforce this during postmeditation, which is free from ideation. Those of average acumen resolutely assert that objective appearances exemplified by the manifestation of one’s own body as Cakrasaṃvara are magical displays and dreams, equivalent to those that merely appear in mind and in speech. Those of lowest acumen abandon the four challenges that concern excessive movement, excessive migration, excessive thought, and excessive chattering; and then {285} they generate compassion for the six classes of living beings who are visualized as present within a hexahedron in the navel cakra.[812]
Next, you should draw in the lower wind and gradually compress the upper wind, so that six attributes arise—namely, blissful warmth, self-control of dreams, refinement of dreams, expansion [of dreams], the appearance of objective phenomena, and the natural arising [of magical display]. You should determine that illnesses are magical displays and lure demons into the hexahedron. Through the yogic exercise that agitates them, they then suddenly depart, and without attachment, you consider them as natural manifestations of magical display.[813]

With regard to dreams, you should say, “Precious Teacher, I beseech you that I might abandon self-grasping, that I might develop in my mind the sense that it is unnecessary, and that I might control [the recognition of] dreams!” You should imagine that there is a white vital essence derived from the syllable HAṂ in the crown cakra, and a red vital essence derived from the syllable HŪṂ in the secret cakra. When these [break away] and circle at the heart cakra, the vase empowerment is conferred; when they touch, the secret empowerment is conferred; when there is bliss arising from that touch, the empowerment of discriminating pristine cognition is conferred; and when they dissolve into one another, the fourth empowerment is conferred.[814]
[For the successful practice of dream yoga] there are nine unerring essentials: the three appropriate times—dawn, daybreak, and sunrise; the three physical postures—cross-legged, crouching, and the reclining of the lion; and the three visualizations—two with ideation and one without ideation. Thereby the white and red vital essences emerge from the right and left nostrils, and at the point between the eyebrows, these are clearly visualized as the male-female Cakrasaṃvara, who then vanishes into light. After that, you should visualize the syllable HŪṂ in the heart of the teacher, at your heart cakra. As you dissolve into the teacher and the teacher into the HŪṂ, and the HŪṂ vanishes into light, you should concentrate on and maintain your singular aspiration, saying, “This is itself a dream.”[815]
With regard to the refinement of dreams, you should pray, “I beseech you that I might refine my dreams!” There are four phases of this refinement: (i) The refinement by the mind on the body is effected by visualizing Cakrasaṃvara when encountering a frightening precipice. (ii) The refinement of the mind by the body is effected by the absorption of the vital essences of the nine orifices and their subsequent vanishing. (iii) The refinement by means of Nairātmyā is effected by visualizing Nairātmyā in front, with a garland of A syllables in her lotus, and she is then invited into the adamantine gem [of the penis] in the form of blue light. (iv) The refinement by purposeful intent is effected by means of the one-pointed purposeful intent of Nairātmyā alone.[816]

With regard to the increasing of dreams, you should pray, “I beseech you that I might be able to increase them!” (i) You should increase the number of inanimate objects and sentient beings [in your dreams] from one to ten and so forth, and then reabsorb them into the originals. (ii) You should then increase the number of creatures who would train those beings, emanating cats for mice, {286} wolves for dogs, lions for tigers, cannibal ogres for human beings, and so forth, as well as garuḍas for nāgas, Vajrapāṇi for stroke-causing demons, Hayagrīva for king spirits and bewitchers, and Vajrabhairava for the lord of death; and then those beings will be tamed as you imagine they are struck with the appropriate hand emblems or incinerated by a mass of fire.[817]
With regard to the emanation of dreams, you should pray, “I beseech you for the power to emanate dreams!” and thereafter emanate whatever forms are appropriate, as before.[818]
With regard to the transformation of dreams, you should pray, “I beseech you for the power to transform dreams!” Then you may transform (i) sentient beings; (ii) subtle and gross phenomena; (iii) the diverse bodies of deities with different numbers of faces and arms; or (iv) empty appearances, free from attachment.[819]

[With regard to the perception of the objects that occur in dreams] you should pray, “I beseech you that I might determine the perception of objects!” Consequently, (i) [for those of superior acumen,] there will be clear understanding that there is no objective referent; (ii) [for those of average acumen,] there will be clear seeing of whatever is imagined; (iii) [for those of feeble acumen,] there will be the perception of the mental body flying through space; and apart from them, (iv) for those of lowest acumen, there will be perception of the objects they imagine.[820]
[As far as the last mentioned is concerned, the visualization is as follows:] Within a skull in a hexahedron at the navel cakra are the syllables OṂ, ĀḤ, HŪṂ, SVĀ, and HĀ. Therefrom Nairātmyā arises, resembling translucent crystal, emanating rays of light of five colors. At their tips the host of deities appears, resounding their respective mantras. Through your making outer, inner, and secret offerings to them, the impure inhabited world and its sentient inhabitants are refined. Then you should either (i) establish the desirable objects that you see within the heart of Nairātmyā, which is densely filled; or (ii) you should regard the objects that appear through the light visualized in the syllable A of Nairātmyā; or (iii) you should diffuse, as before, the objects appearing through the light rays visualized in the syllable A of Nairātmyā.[821]

With regard to luminosity, as before, you should engender intense disillusionment [with impermanent phenomena]. You should partake of sacramental substances and oily foods [in moderation], adopt a leisurely regimen, and abandon exertion that induces sweat. You should make a burnt offering of sacramental human flesh and human fat, and present an excellent array of communal offerings and torma offerings. Then you should pray, “I beseech you that I might apprehend the luminosity with a mind that actually sees the teachers, the buddhas!”[822]
Next, you should meditate on the translucent and radiant central channel within your own body. Settle the mind, without wavering, on the syllable A in the navel cakra. Above the cerebral membrane Nairātmyā appears, and the light of the syllable A in her heart purifies the brain, which is the natural expression of delusion.[823] Focus one-pointedly on the celestial palace, which is the cranium of the skull, and on the teacher within a radiant and translucent vital essence at the center of the heart cakra. {287} In his heart, too, there is a syllable HŪṂ imbued with the nature of a vital essence.[824]
Then you should practice the carrying of the three buddha bodies onto the path, and from within that disposition you should intermingle meditative equipoise and postmeditation through the perspective that radiance and emptiness are inseparable. You should above all develop and recognize the certainty that the coalescences of appearance and emptiness, bliss and emptiness, and radiance and emptiness are profound, calm, free from conceptual elaboration, and endowed with the two purities.[825]
You should persistently engage with the general and specific commitments, and then it will be important to discriminate the definitive dispelling of obstacles, the natural liberation of flaws, the resolution of doubts concerning the successful outcome of the practice, and the distinctions between daytime and nighttime experiences and realizations.[826]

With regard to consciousness transference, you should pray with intensity, saying, “I beseech you that I may succeed in consciousness transference!” Your own physical body then appears as a tent of blue silk. At the navel cakra within it there is a six-sided hexahedron, which cuts off the entrance to rebirth. Its three lower sides that face downward cut off the entrance to the path of the three lower realms, and the three upper sides face upward and to the right and left of the kidney channels. From within that hexahedron, the central channel rises upward to the dusty white aperture, resembling a skylight, at the crown of the head. In the navel cakra, light is diffused from a white syllable A, causing the abdomen to come into contact with the small of the back, so that the A shoots upward like an arrow through the main pathway of the central channel.
When it emerges from the skylight aperture at the crown of the head and vanishes into light, this denotes the consciousness transference into the reality of the buddha body of reality. When it dissolves into whichever meditational deity you revere—Cakrasaṃvara, Hevajra, and so forth—this denotes the consciousness transference into the coalescent meditational deity. When it enters into the secret womb of white or red Khecarī, whichever is appropriate, this denotes the consciousness transference into the unerring realm of the sky-farers. When it is transferred into the heart of the teacher, this denotes the consciousness transference of the guru’s blessing.[827]

With regard to the intermediate state, you should pray to the teacher, saying, “I beseech you that I may attain the buddha body of perfect resource in the intermediate state!” Those of highest acumen should, during the luminosity of the first intermediate state, meditate on the child [luminosity that is encountered] within the disposition of the naturally arising mother luminosity. They will acquire the confidence of recognizing and recollecting the mother and child luminosities, as if meeting someone with whom they had been acquainted in the past. Those of average acumen, through the appearance of the body as a deity, of speech as mantra, and of mind as the natural expressive power of the nonarising Great Seal, will be free from the fear and trepidation that arise during the intermediate state of rebirth due to the forms of Yama and the sounds of the reversal of the four elements that manifest as shouts of “Strike, kill!” {288}
Those of lowest acumen will consider external appearances to be the celestial palace and the sentient inhabitants within it to be meditational deities, and then they should meditate on a blue hexahedron in front. You should reflect that those who do not realize this will enter into the womb of a mother, and those who do realize it will think that this is assuredly the palace of the expanse of reality, Akaniṣṭha. You should visualize that at its center, there is a blue HŪṂ diffusing light rays of five colors, so that it purifies your former womb entrances, refines your present womb entrance, and blocks your future womb entrances, all of which lead toward the four modes of birth. From that HŪṂ you become manifest as Cakrasaṃvara, and on the crown of your head is Jetsunma. On the crown of her head your teacher is seated, embodying light rays and bliss. He dissolves into Jetsunma, and therefrom rays of light, of the nature of bliss, penetrate you yourself. You should then meditate that on the right side of the hexahedron, objects giving rise to male hatred appear as the male consort Cakrasaṃvara alone, and that on the left side of the hexahedron, objects giving rise to female desire appear as the female consort Vajrayoginī alone. By presenting and refining mentally emanated offerings, you will attain buddhahood in the buddha body of perfect resource during the intermediate state.[828]

After you have taken refuge and set the mind on enlightenment, the preliminaries concern the three natural states [of body, speech, and mind, which are as follows]: (i) Undistracted by physical activities, your body should be seated in a relaxed manner, with your legs in the adamantine posture, your spine straight, and your hands resting upon your knees. (ii) As far as your speech is concerned, you should desist from speaking but keep your lips open, without closing them. (iii) As for your mind, throughout the three times you should sever the flow of conceptual thoughts and meditate while maintaining the innate natural state, without pondering, without reflecting, and without discursiveness. You should remain focused, uncorrupted by thoughts of desire, and {289} act spontaneously, without turning your gaze toward the front, the rear, the top, the bottom, the right, or the left, and without effort. You should chant the sutras, recite the mantras, and act out of that spontaneous disposition in all your conversations. If your awareness is sluggish, you should raise the gaze of your eyes, and if it is overactive, you should lower the gaze. Again and again you should meditate and maintain your perspective through the blessing of your teacher.[830]
As for the main practice, there are four defects to be naturally liberated: (i) though [the abiding nature of mind] is too familiar, its face is not seen; (ii) since [the Great Seal cannot be exemplified and] is too profound, it is not recognized; (iii) since [its establishment] is too easy, it is not convincing; and (iii) since [the three buddha bodies] are too noble, they do not enter into your mind. Recognition will come about once you have broken through these impasses.[831]
In conclusion, the four buddha bodies naturally arise—the buddha body of reality devoid of the conceptual thoughts of the mind, the buddha body of perfect resource imbued with intrinsic awareness, the buddha body of emanation that diversely appears, and the buddha body of essentiality in which these are inseparable. The outcome will be successful through compassion, through the generation stage, through the [control of] wind, and through devotion.[832]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should meditate on the teacher, [seated] upon a lotus and moon cushion on the crown of your head. You should clearly recall the appearance of your teacher’s body just as it is, the sound of your teacher’s voice just as it is, and the understanding and enlightened intention of your teacher’s mind just as it is. With fervent devotion you should have the power to dissolve outwardly [into that visualization], and inwardly your vacillating mind should hover around the tip of your nose. Consequently, you should determine that apparent physical forms are the body of the teacher, words are the speech of the teacher, and intrinsic awareness is the mind of the teacher.[834]
Thinking that it is through this genuine teacher endowed with the defining characteristics that you will be liberated from cyclic existence—hard to endure—and that consequently cyclic existence will be rendered nonexistent through your teacher’s kindness, you should engage in the power of devotion that makes the hairs of the body stand on end and agitates the eyes with tears. {290} Then say, “I pay homage! I make offerings! I go for refuge! I pray that you turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine and do not pass into nirvana! May this virtuous merit become the causal basis for me being favored by my teacher!”[835]
In the same manner, you should meditate on the meditational deity, however that appears, and on the magical display [of appearances], however that appears; and these experiential cultivations should also be carried on the path, as above.[836]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should visualize yourself as Innate Cakrasaṃvara in male-female union. You should focus on a blue HŪṂ at the fontanel of the male deity, and the red syllable VAṂ at the fontanel of the female deity. The bodies of those deities will become lackluster owing to the blue and red radiance of those two seed syllables respectively. Then blue and red rays of light, of the nature of bliss, gradually emerge from these two syllables, exemplified by sunrise on a snow mountain peak, so that everything is filled and enveloped with the light.

Next, just as an aquamarine and a ruby covered with mud can be cleansed with water, that external radiance [of the syllables] transforms into the nature of internal radiance. You should visualize that at the top of the matted hair of the male deity there is a wish-granting gem, and on its left side a moon disk of the first lunar day. Just above the fontanel there is a crossed vajra supported on his matted hair, and on the black locks of his matted hair there is a circlet of bone and dangling bone ornaments. Between the crown ornaments comprising five dry skulls there are transverse vajras. He has the silken ribbons of a spiritual warrior and three red eyes—blue in the middle and pale at the periphery. The bridge of his nose is high, his brow large, his mouth closed, his earlobes long, his face smiling, and the tips of his upper and lower teeth and incisors are just about visible. His throat is bulbous, his upper body is broad, {291} and his two hands hold the vajra and the bell, embracing his female consort. All of his bone ornaments—the choker, earrings, necklace, shoulder bands, bracelets, waistband, and anklets—are completely white, and his tiger-hide garment is loose at the back. His right leg is drawn in and the left leg extended, pressing down upon lotus and sun cushions and [mats in the forms of] Bhairava and Kālarātrī. The female consort is smiling, wrathful, and energetic, the hair of her head disheveled; and she holds a curved knife and a skull, embracing the neck of the male. Her bone ornaments are shining white, her breasts prominent, her right leg extended, her left leg contracted, in union with the male; and they are sealed within an amulet of blue and red light.[838]
Consequent on that visualization, you should develop the conviction that your own mind is immortal, untainted by the stains of birth and death. You should equipoise your mind in the body of the deity that appears but lacks inherent existence.[839]

With regard to the practice of the fierce inner heat, you should secure the six stoves [of the hands, feet, and elbows] and visualize in your own navel cakra a four-petal lotus with five syllables. Next, you should focus on the wind of the rectum, which ignites the fire of the navel cakra, causing the syllable A in the center and the surrounding four syllables HA, RI, NI, and SA to blaze with fire—red and brilliant. Your body will be filled internally with the light of the fire. Then you should mentally repeat HA RI NI SA and maintain the union of the upper and lower winds.[841]

With regard to the practice of the illusory body, you should visualize that below the lotus of the navel cakra there is a hexahedron containing all sentient beings of the six classes. You should cultivate compassion, and the light of the seed syllables will purify the obscurations of sentient beings. The light itself will then emerge from your own fontanel, with a white radiance in the case of divine goddesses: {292} azure blue in the case of gandharvas, pale yellow in the case of brahmins, pink in the case of human beings, whitish yellow in the case of nāgas, and dark brown in the case of outcastes. These beings have an epicanthus on the eyes and an epicanthic fold on the lips. Below the navel, the lotus of their naked, secret cakra is extensive, with bristling anthers from which a stream of blissful generative fluid is released. It enters through the crown of your head and fills your body internally. You should imagine that bliss will then grow, and you should maintain this natural state of the illusory body.[842]

With reference to dream yoga, you should focus awareness on the natural experience of blissful warmth in the lotus of the navel cakra, and on the spinning of the letters. You should recognize that dreams are dreams and repeatedly practice their recognition, emanation, and transformation. Objective appearances will then reach the pathway of light that derives from the syllable A, in consequence of which you may see them, just as you wish.[843]

With reference to the practice of consciousness transference, you should visualize the four syllables of the lotus petals as the four elements, and through the sequence of the dissolution of the elements, dissolve them into the syllable a.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should visualize yourself as the body of Nairātmyā. You should meditate that on each of the twenty-one articulations of her spine there is an inch-sized miniature representation of Nairātmyā and that in the middle of the body are the three channels, among which the right and left channels depend upon the central channel, just as creepers entwine around a tree. On the four-petal lotus in the navel cakra, the syllables HA, RI, NI, and SA surround the syllable A—pale blue on the front side, red on the right, yellow on the left, white on the rear, and green in the center. On the crown of the head, inseparable from Virūpa, is Hevajra, with one face and two arms, assuming a dancing demeanor. In the sky in front is Dampa Gyagar, {293} the lower part of his body covered in a woolen cloak. You should meditate that in his hands he holds a reed flute and he is facing toward you. Pray one-pointedly, and say, “Virūpa HŪṂ, Sukha ĀḤ, Dampa Gyagar OṂ!”[848]
Then you should visualize that from the syllable a resting within the navel cakra an arrow also in the form of the syllable A breaks off, and, dependent on the bow of the central channel, it is propelled by the whip of subtle energy and mind combined and moves upward. You should turn your body alternately toward the right and the left, with your legs in the adamantine posture, and your hands placed upon your pulse of vitality at the wrists. Your eyeballs, too, should move gradually upward. At that time, you should train the pathway of the central channel with the [tightening] noose of the right and left channels, and then the syllable A will emerge some distance above the crown of the head. There you will be blissfully transformed into Nairātmyā, inseparable from Sukhasiddhi, and embrace black Virūpa. You should imagine that the stream of generative fluid arising from this union then descends via the spine, filling the twenty-one aforementioned miniature representations of Nairātmyā, and finally from the navel—the fertile ground of the body—it permeates the entire body.[849] Your complexion will be invigorated, your optic nerves will be raised up, your consciousness captivated, and you will refine the empty nature of space, devoid of awareness as well as the fundamental nature of mind endowed with awareness. Having trained in this fundamental nature, you should be relaxed. By being relaxed you will achieve your goal. Such are the crucial points.[850]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should meditate clearly on your teacher in the maṇḍala of your heart. In front you should position a slender stick and stare directly at it without closing the eyes and without moving. You should indeed focus your awareness lucidly on that object, but not settle on it with constraint. {294} Nor should you hold the object in esteem. Instead, without permitting awareness to wander, you should focus for that moment simply on a support where the mind is undistracted and let awareness rest completely in that state, relaxed in its natural modality.
It is important to distinguish quality in meditation. To enhance this state of abiding, you should take a break and rest for a while, before resuming your meditation. After undertaking many short sessions of this sort, you should engage in the four-session meditation. In all the intervals between sessions, you should not lose that disposition but act continuously and constantly with mindfulness. Your eyes may also gaze upon the tip of your nose, but not for long. All modes of activity—moving about, sitting, and so forth—should be undertaken [slowly], like the actions of an invalid.
Next, in the space between the eyebrows, you should visualize a white vital essence, the size of a pea, and focus your awareness upon that for a moment. In that disposition, let the mind relax into its natural modality. To enhance this state of abiding, take a break and rest for a while. After undertaking many short sessions of this sort, you should engage in four-session meditation. In all the intervals between sessions you should not lose that disposition but act as above [continuously and constantly with mindfulness].
Next, you should meditate briefly on a round black vital essence, resting upon a seat, and focus your awareness upon that for a moment. In that disposition, let your mind settle into its natural state of abiding.

In the course of these [visualizations], if you do not focus on [the tip of] the nose upon which [the mind] rests, you will incur the obstacle of having a mind that does not rest. All your thoughts will freely escape, and at that time you will be impeded by conceptual thoughts. So, from the start, you should recognize these thoughts without obstacle. You should grasp the crucial point of not being vexed by meditating, and thereby you will develop a focus on ever more subtle thoughts. By whatever means, you should then let all tarnished thoughts and all other thoughts that arise in the above manner relax directly, and permit all those thoughts that are present to move within a disposition in which the rope of mindfulness is not severed. You should regard them, however many they are; and without allowing even a single one to escape, you should recognize the first one that arises, you should recognize the second one that arises, {295} and you should recognize all those that subsequently arise. Thereby, through your focusing on those thoughts, the continuum of conceptual thoughts will be interrupted. Once conceptual thoughts have been interrupted, the state of abiding will be enhanced and the continuity of occasionally present [thoughts] will be rendered nonexistent.

If the strength of your constitution is impaired when your awareness is agitated due to many ephemeral thoughts, you should recuperate and rest just for a day, and then by resuming the meditation from the beginning you will recover. It is important to partake of nutritious food.
Now, you should meditate similarly, without any referential focus or support for meditation. Here your mind should relax at ease in its own modality, and you should meditate, looking gently wherever it arises, uncontrived, without ownership, and without supervision. Let your mind settle steadily into its natural state. You should for a moment maintain mindfulness of its state, simply without wavering. Otherwise, let it settle into its natural modality, without meditating at all. As far as the sessions are concerned, these should be shorter than before. You should remain calm, take a break, and rest for a while before resuming the meditation. You should meditate in this manner over four sessions, and in all the intervals between sessions you should act continuously and constantly with mindfulness. You may engage in activities in the aforementioned manner. When arising from meditation and taking a break, you should ask yourself how the mind is present, so that whenever you take a break it does not move anywhere; and whenever you stand up, your awareness is slow, relaxed, languid, hazy with regard to perceptions, and loose, without effort. If your awareness does not intentionally engage with objects, and it is said to be present without differentiating anything, the state of calm abiding will arise.
At this point, in order to stimulate your awareness somewhat, you should let it be lucid and vivid. Without wavering in this disposition, you should be mindful of it for a moment, clear and calm, and then take a break and rest, before resuming the meditation. You should meditate accordingly over four sessions, and in all the intervals between sessions you should act without losing that state. You may also engage in activities in the aforementioned manner.

After interrupting the abiding continuity of thoughts in that manner, {296} now, at this time when the quality of meditation is enhanced, you should regard the essential nature of mind with greater intensity. You should observe how the essential nature of mind is present, and you should observe any proper determination that it itself makes concerning itself. Then you should refrain completely, and rest for a while before resuming the meditation. When observing any [proper] determination, you should observe, with regard to yourself, whether recognition is present in your mind, whether emptiness is present without recognition, whether something is present entirely without emptiness, whether from the disposition of emptiness a naked radiance is present, or whatever. You should carry any such experiences [onto the path].
All the crucial points of instruction are contained in this practice: You should ask yourself in what manner the essential nature of mind is present; and consequently, if it is said that an emptiness is present, you are seeing simply one side of it and cannot be introduced to the essential nature of mind. If it is said that no emptiness at all is present, or that a lucidity and vividness is present, you should observe this properly. Until you recognize that state, you cannot be introduced to the essential nature of mind. If it is said that awareness is lucidly present without recognition, you have not seen its essential nature.

Therefore, with regard to this introduction: In general, meditation includes both calm abiding and higher insight. Calm abiding and higher insight are technical terms, the former denoting that a state of abiding is present and the latter denoting that a radiance or luminosity is present. But these alone are not beneficial. Instead, we great meditators must experientially cultivate the naked awareness directly. If that is introduced to you right now, when your mind settles in a relaxed manner into its natural modality, thoughts will subside and be calmed right where they are. If your mind is calmly present in its natural modality, this is said to be genuine calm abiding. Most persons who receive the oral instructions or great meditators should now meditate on that alone. If, on the other hand, you are proud and in addition have too many teachers, you will not be able to meditate, even a little. Yet without that practice there will be no way at all to progress. Within the disposition of genuine calm abiding {297} nothing remains that is deluded, indeterminate, nonsensical, or indifferent. When it is said that “the essential nature of mind is like this,” there is indeed no recognition of anything that should be verbalized in speech, conceptualized by the mental faculty, scrutinized by the intellect, or expressed in words. While there is no such recognition, there should come to you a radiant and unimpeded awareness—exposed, trembling, stark, and distinct, seeing that which has not yet been seen and experiencing that which has not yet been experienced. And then if there is no lack of recognition with regard to this radiance that cannot be verbalized, this is said to be genuine higher insight.
As far as the terms calm abiding and higher insight are concerned, even though these two have a temporal sequence, you should actually meditate on them without differentiation. It is said that no fault will arise from meditating on them completely in that very instant of time. Since you are without all sorts of superimposition, you will not fall into the extreme of eternalism, and since you are intrinsically aware and accomplished through experience, you will not fall into the extreme of nihilism.

Now that you have calmed conceptual thoughts right where they are by relaxing the mind in its natural modality, the [formerly] unrecognized consciousness that is clear, sharp, intrinsic awareness, stark in its natural radiance, is said to be the enlightened intention of the mind of the buddhas. It is said to be the defining characteristic of the mind of sentient beings. It is said to be the abiding nature of all entities. That which is called your own mind is this [formerly] unrecognized, radiant, and sharp awareness, which is introduced by teachers and then cognized by disciples. So, that which was formerly unrecognized is said to be the mind that is now recognized. This is the case for those who attain buddhahood, for those who roam in cyclic existence, for those who have likes and dislikes—in short, for all those who engage with the phenomena of existence and quiescence. Having formerly been obscured by conceptual thoughts, they did not recognize the essential nature of mind, but now, cutting off the continuity of conceptual thought, they do recognize it. Even when the recognition of the essential nature of mind is entirely absent, it is still the intrinsic nature of mind. Even when radiance and vibrancy are absent, they are still the defining characteristics of mind. {298} In the essential nature of empty and radiant awareness, sharpness and clarity are the essential nature. You should achieve a stark recognition of this. Such is the introduction to the coemergent nature of mind.

After you have taken refuge and set the mind on enlightenment, there ensues the fivefold experiential cultivation of (i) the enlightened mind, (ii) the meditational deity, (iii) the teacher, (iv) the Great Seal, and (v) the dedication of merit.
During this session, you should meditate sincerely, saying, “I will charge my body, speech, and mind to engage in virtuous action!” You should meditate that you instantaneously become Cakrasaṃvara in union with female consort, with a radiant form and steadfast pride. You should then pray, saying, “I pray to Vajradhara, precious teacher of all sentient beings and essential nature embodying all objects of refuge, seated upon a lotus, moon, and sun cushion on the crown of my head!”
Finally, Vajradhara dissolves into yourself and his buddha body, speech, and mind blend together with your own body, speech, and mind. In that state, from within a disposition devoid of sluggish and overactive thoughts of anything at all, you should settle the mind clearly and starkly, without becoming diffused toward anything at all; and you should then secure this by means of the dedication of merit.

The mind in the beginning is without point of origin, primordially empty and baseless. In the middle it is nonabiding, and its movement is empty of movement. In the end there is nowhere that it goes; {299} its movement is naturally liberated, and it is neither obstructed nor does it exist at all. Uncovered by the flaws of cyclic existence, it is primordial buddhahood.[854]

There are six methods of establishing the nature of mind: Your body should assume the sevenfold posture of Vairocana and then: (i) You should be established without laborious effort in the uncontrived, innate disposition of mind, like a mighty garuḍa soaring in the sky. (ii) You should be established in the unwavering disposition of mind, like an ocean devoid of waves. (iii) You should be established in equipoise imbued with radiant space, like a cloudless sun. (iv) You should be established in unimpeded luminosity without grasping, like a small child looking at a temple. (v) You should be established in recognizing all the sensations that arise to be the nature of mind, like the waves of water. (vi) You should be established in awareness that leaves no tracks, like a bird flying in the sky.[855]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should visualize yourself upon a lion throne with lotus and moon cushions, from the four corners of which Brahmā, Indra, Upendra [Viṣṇu], and Rudra appear, with heads bowed, as emanational supports, embellished with divine sacraments, clothing, and gems. Upon it you are seated in the form of Munīndra, {300} golden colored, adorned with the major and minor marks, wearing the three religious robes, the hands in the earth-touching gesture and the gesture of equipoise, and the legs in the adamantine posture. Commencing from the protuberance at the crown of the head, he has a hair ringlet at the forehead, a glorious śrīvatsa at the heart, and the entirety of his body radiates the [eighteen] distinct attributes of the buddhas.[860] Even to the extent of the hairs of his head, he is present throughout the three times. From his body, rays of light are diffused, transforming the inhabited world into a pure land and its sentient inhabitants into the body of the Conqueror. These then enter through the billion pores of your own body, so that you appear as the glorious lord-protector of living beings endowed with sight, hearing, memory, and awareness. This constitutes the introduction to the spontaneously present natural expression of the buddha body of emanation.[861]
Also, you should visualize yourself in the form of Avalokiteśvara, the buddha body of perfect resource, seated upon a lion throne with lotus and moon cushions, with one face and four arms—the first pair of hands in the union of meditative equipoise, the other right hand holding a crystal rosary, and the other left hand holding a lotus. His legs are in the adamantine posture, and in the front of his crown of matted hair there is Amitābha. He has a jacket of antelope hide, and the pores of his skin are filled with buddhas and bodhisattvas from whom light rays are diffused, resembling sunrise on a snow mountain. The inhabited world and its sentient inhabitants are then purified, and you are transformed into the buddha body of perfect resource, endowed with the five certainties.[862] This constitutes the introduction to the buddha body of perfect resource.[863]

Also, you should visualize yourself in the form of Vajradhara, the buddha body of reality, seated upon a throne endowed with excellence—azure blue, like the sky uncovered by clouds, with one face and two arms, holding a vajra and bell that are crossed at the heart. His legs are in the adamantine posture, and the major and minor marks are radiantly perfect. All the parts of his body, which is adorned with silks and gems, are filled with the maṇḍalas of the four classes of tantra, and therefrom rays of light are diffused and absorbed, purifying the inhabited world and its sentient inhabitants and then being reabsorbed into yourself. Your own manifestation also dissolves into this disposition of luminosity and bliss, phenomena are exhausted, and the conclusion is reached. This total withdrawal into the natural state, without verbalization, conception, or expression, which is profound, calm, unelaborate, and uncreated by the intellect, {301} constitutes the introduction to the buddha body of reality.

After you have taken refuge and set the mind on enlightenment: (i) There ensues the indivisibility of subtle energy and mind during the generation stage. Here, having abandoned differentiations between subtle energy and mind, you should nurture mindfulness, without distraction, of the innate personal experience of bliss associated with the body of the deity that manifests in and of itself.
(ii) Next, without [distinguishing between] meditative equipoise and postmeditation, and with certainty that the innate inner state is attained in the vitality of the subtle energy of fierce inner heat, clad in the fire that blazes from the ashé (the stroke of the letter a) of the navel cakra, you should control this wind in the manner of a man riding a horse, an analogy which some from our school of practice employ to describe subtle energy and mind.[865]
(iii) When control has been achieved, you should instantaneously nurture the naturally occurring radiant and abiding aspects of the original nature of mind and intermingle the perception of fire with the abiding aspect. Whatever arises then becomes the [coalescence of] appearance and emptiness devoid of attachment, the incontrovertible disposition of the illusory body in which subtle energy and mind are indivisible. You should be open and at ease, without discouragement even when under the sway of ill health and at the time of death, and you should develop the conviction that fervent devotion to the teacher alone constitutes the vitality of the path.[866]
(iv) Next, when you apply consciousness transference at the time of death, the subtle energy and mind will be indivisible. A blue and red vital essence, the size of a pea, in which subtle energy and mind are intermingled, will rise upward from the secret cakra and pass directly from the pathway of the central channel, upward through the anterior fontanel, and settle in the disposition of the abiding nature.[867]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should establish the scope of the view concerning the meditations of the Fifteen Scrolls,[869] [which conclude with the liturgy of] the protector of the transmitted teachings Kholpo Dartochen and so forth; and after that, you should focus on the three phases of essential visualization, {302} focusing on the conquerors of the five enlightened families, in whom the five poisons are the essential nature of the five pristine cognitions.
At the time when dark hatred arises, it is ascertained that the unchanging pristine cognition of reality’s expanse and Akṣobhya are manifesting. Do not enter into the pathway of hatred. If you do enter, the prince will be without a father. Do not impose an antidote upon hatred. If you impose one, the prestige of the prince will be diminished. This is the intrinsic face that appears as hatred. You should establish its entirety, with corners unbroken and sides undamaged, to be the defining characteristic of the adamantine reality of hatred. Without your abandoning hatred, its inherent purity is the Great Seal. That is to say, you should meditate on the scroll that concerns the adamantine reality of hatred.
Then, modulating this according to the [other] enlightened families, pride is [inherently] pure as the pristine cognition of sameness and miserliness as Ratnasambhava, desire as the pristine cognition of discernment [Amitābha], jealousy as the pristine cognition of accomplishment [Amoghasiddhi], and delusion as the mirrorlike pristine cognition [Vairocana]. You should experientially cultivate these in the above manner. The implementation of the respective scrolls concerning these five poisons is sequentially established.

Then, at the conclusion of [the scrolls concerning] the six doctrines [of the perfection stage], there are the essential points concerning consciousness transference and resurrection:[870] You should smear the inside of a skull possessing the appropriate defining characteristics with black ink, and directly in the middle of that blackened skull you should inscribe a shining white HŪṂ, which is the seed syllable of the meditational deity. Entering retreat at an auspicious time when the ḍākinīs gather, you should hold a communal offering in general, and particularly on behalf of the ḍākinīs of Oḍḍiyāna and the ḍākinīs who undertake the devouring rites. Tormas adorned with human flesh, incense of human fat, and lamps of melted human fat are the three sacraments of commitment that it is improper to be without.

Once the ḍākinīs have gathered in the above manner, you should present these offerings and then meditate on yourself innately as Cakrasaṃvara or Hevajra, whichever you prefer. You should count [the corresponding mantra] HRĪḤ HA HA OR DEVA PICU, as much as you can. Then, in an isolated grass hermitage, facing west in the morning and east in the evening, you should place the skull with its plinth nearby and in front, and train your gaze upon the syllable HŪṂ inside that skull, settling the mind without wavering. Consequently, {303} after a greater or lesser number of days commensurate with your resources and capacity, light will be diffused from the HŪṂ within the skull, and if smoke billows out, if it shakes or trembles and so forth, these are all signs of accomplishment. Thereupon you should wrap the skull in fine silk and venerate it. You should then cast a torma in the western direction and complete the concluding rite. As a test, you should place on the palm of your hand the corpse of a fly that has fallen into your meal, immediately after it has died. Then you should meditate on the deity and recite the [corresponding] mantra. Focus your own awareness, which was formerly focused on the syllable HŪṂ, directly upon the corpse [of the fly]. If it emits a buzzing sound and flies off, shaking and quivering, you should train repeatedly in that practice, not just once or twice, and then you will succeed [in resurrection]. Formerly the Venerable Marpa in the emanational form of an accomplished master performed this rite of resurrection on behalf of pigeons, lambs, and so forth. Apart from that, since it is difficult even for those who can perform consciousness transference on behalf of animals to reverse [the process], it will be important to exercise judgment.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should experientially cultivate the essentials without abandoning the three poisons that are the basis of cyclic existence. This is achieved through the essentials that intermingle desire with the pristine cognition of empowerment, hatred with the generation and perfection stages, and delusion with luminosity.
As far as the original abiding nature is concerned, in the case of all sentient beings, natural luminosity denotes the buddha body of reality, the intermediate state denotes the buddha body of perfect resource, and birth denotes the buddha body of emanation.
As far as the modes of appearance [of all sentient beings] are concerned, their maturational body is present during the interval between birth and death, their body of propensities is present during the interval between sleeping and waking, and their mental body is present during the interval between the obstruction of the rebirth process and birth.[872]
As far as the modes of bewilderment [of all sentient beings] are concerned, these comprise {304} perceptions during the intermediate state from birth to death, propensities during the intermediate state of dreams, and the bewilderment of past actions during the intermediate state of the rebirth process.
As far as the modes of liberation [of all sentient beings] are concerned, those of superior acumen are liberated at the time of death when the two sorts of luminosity are mingled together.[873] Those of average acumen are liberated in the intermediate state after death when the three magical displays are present in the mental continuum.[874] Those of inferior acumen are liberated in the Great Seal during [the intermediate state] of this life, that is, in their modes of birth.

With regard to the modes of experience that arise on the path: bliss and radiance of the generation stage are refined on the path in the context of daytime appearances, luminosity is refined on the path during nighttime sleep, and aspiration is refined on the path during the intermediate state.
With regard to the modes of actualization in terms of the sense objects, desire is purified through the male-female union of the teacher, hatred for one’s parents from whom one acquires rebirth is purified through the manifestation of that [union], and delusion embodying all fundamental ignorance is purified through the lamp of naturally radiant intrinsic awareness.
Commencing from the foregoing essentials concerning the intermingling [of the three poisons], when death occurs, those of highest acumen transfer consciousness into luminosity, those of average acumen transfer consciousness into the illusory body, and those of inferior acumen transfer consciousness into the grasping of birth. That is to say, if through the power of yogic experience you intrinsically recognize the luminosity of the ground, that will resemble an encounter with an old acquaintance. You may also, at will, transfer consciousness into a pure land where appearances resemble a magical display, or into the womb of a noble family, with parents who act in accordance with the sacred doctrine.
This indeed is the essential point of the aural lineage [of Ngok]—the cycle concerning intermingling and transformation—that is an instruction belonging to the four pronouncements.[875]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should practice according to the first of these four scrolls, which concerns the conclusive meaning of the Hevajra Tantra and was the quintessential oral instruction of Nāropā. It teaches (i) the movement of the ashé by which one progresses from the level of sentient beings to buddhahood, (ii) the movement of the ashé from the navel cakra via the pathway of the central channel, and (iii) the movement dependent on the short path of skillful means that engages the winds of vital breath and exertion.[877] That is to say, you should visualize your own body as the deity and meditate on the ashé in the navel cakra, which resembles the moon reflected in a deep well and is the essential nature of awareness, the nature of mind. {305} Next, you should explore its passage through the subtle energy of life breath. Finally, the ashé passes directly upward from within the central channel, in the manner of a shooting star, and at the crown of the head settles into the Great Seal, the nonreferential abiding nature [of reality]. That is the first [of the four scrolls].
The second scroll concerns the conclusive meaning of the Tantra of the Secret Assembly, and it was the quintessential oral instruction of glorious Jñānagarbha. It teaches (i) the magical display of appearances, (ii) the luminosity of mindfulness and awareness, and (iii) the dissolution of the three phases of mind.[878] That is to say, the inhabited world and its sentient inhabitants resemble a dream or a magical display, mindfulness and awareness are the nonarising luminosity, and conviction is then found in the midst of bewilderment in your own experience of the three [phases of dissolution at the time of death]—namely, appearance, increase, and attainment.[879]
The third scroll concerns the conclusive meaning of the Tantra of Great Magical Emanation, and it was the quintessential oral instruction of Kukkurāja. It teaches the severing of conceptual elaboration. By severing the mass of intellectually generated conceptual elaborations in the unchanging essential nature, where ebbing and flowing are naturally liberated, you will be separated from the ebbing and flowing of the subject-object dichotomy, and then, entering into the genuine, innate middle way, your awareness will attain buddhahood in the buddha body of reality.[880]

The fourth scroll concerns the conclusive meaning of the Tantra of the Four Adamantine Seats, and it was the quintessential oral instruction of the yoginī Kadalīmañjarī. It teaches (i) the yogin’s arrival at the time of death, (ii) the manifestation of convincing immediate signs [of death], and (iii) the absence of doubt concerning the attainment of buddhahood at the time of death. That is to say, when the general outer and inner signs of death have been ascertained, and in particular when the natural sound of the ḍākinīs of the three abodes who have gathered in the secret cave has faded, you should with certainty fix the time [of impending death] at no more than seven days. Then, from the citadel of the navel—the cakra of the coiled nāga, the offspring of awareness will fly, entering through the great pathway of the authentic central channel and come to linger just in front of the throat. On that support you should strongly inhale the outer breath through the two nostrils, and instead of compressing it downward, you should propel it upward. You should turn your eyeballs upward and, above all, bend back the occiput, pressing it with your fingers {306} as you draw the subtle energy upward. Focusing your awareness on that, you will consequently experience a sharp pain as a symptom at the anterior fontanel, and finally the fontanel will become swollen like the egg of a goose. You should then insert a blade of straw within it and achieve confidence [in this practice]. It is said that a yogin such as this will attain buddhahood at the time of death, penetrating pristine cognition to the core, and untainted by negativity and obscuration.[881]

The method of igniting the fierce inner heat is as follows:[883] You should first focus on the ashé. At the triple intersection of the channels [below the navel], the needlelike ashé is extremely red and hot and propelled by the wind from the right and left pathways. Concentrate your body and mind within the central channel where the ashé is warmed by the crackling heat. Then you should adjust the visualization as follows: From wind blowing on the ashé, which has the essence of fire, {316} the fire slightly combusts, so that it becomes larger and larger, four digits in height, and then eight digits. It has four defining characteristics, in that it is hot to the touch, sharp at the tip, gentle, and pliable.[884] You should refine this practice, generate the warmth, and at that time wear a cotton robe.
Next, at the crown of your head there is a white downward-facing syllable HAṂ. As the ashé blazes with fire, owing to its light, a cooling generative fluid then emerges from the white HAṂ, permeating everything with whiteness. You should not be distracted from that visualization.
Next, you should become familiar with the three seed syllables of adamantine recitation—HŪṂ during exhalation, OṂ during inhalation, and ĀḤ during the pausing of breath; and you should train in the five buddhas according to their respective colors.[885] The earth element is dependent on the bridge of the nose, the water element is dependent on the two lips, the fire element is dependent on retrograde motion (phyi log), and the wind element is dependent on upward motion (steng). Earth is yellow, water is white, fire is red, and wind is blue. Muscle tissue and complexion arise through the earth element. Oiliness of the body arises through the water element. Metabolism arises through the fire element. Lightness of body arises through the wind element. Absence of sensation in the entire body arises through the space element.

On the successful outcome [of this practice], there follows the magical display [of the illusory body], which resembles the alchemical transformation of gold: The nature of mind is a magical display, since it arises as the diverse causes and fruits of virtuous and negative actions, dependent on the diverse appearances of the propensities of past actions. Just as an illusionist can cause many phenomena such as a horse, an ox, a house, and so forth to appear dependent on material objects such as a pebble or a ceramic tile, but these are actually fictitious, in the same way you should refine the certainty that all things of cyclic existence appear but are without inherent existence, in the manner of a magical display, until this [refinement] arises resplendently from the depths [of your experience].[886]
Next, [you should refine the introduction to pristine cognition] through the light of the sun and moon. This includes [refinement] at times of transition, [introduction to the rays of sun and moon, and establishment of appearances as fictitious in accordance with the twelve similes of illusion].[887] Next, [you should untie the fictitious knots of] disparagement and praise.[888] Next, all appearances will arise as evanescent experiences, and you should rely on a strong motivation to carry daytime perceptions into the dreams of the night.[889]

You should recognize your room and your bed. Retention ensues by refining your motivation. When dreams are retained, they are retained by your recognizing that they are dreams. While refining this practice, you should train your dreams by transforming larger appearances into smaller ones, and smaller ones into larger ones. There are four pervasions that are experienced in relation to dream yoga—namely, the pervasion of forgetfulness, the pervasion of wakefulness, the pervasion of bewilderment, and the pervasion of continuity.[891]

After completing the training in dream yoga, you should enter into luminosity during deep sleep.[892] While you are sleeping, you should have affection for and devotion to the teacher. Focus your mind on the heart cakra and rest in a disposition that is without distracted perception and without grasping. Thereby awareness will become radiant without any external reference and without being objectively recognized. Free from the covering of obscuration, the meditative stability of luminosity will emerge. You will awaken from sleep and all your present perceptions will become radiant, without being objectively recognized. You may then train without interruption in the disposition of the Great Seal and thereby traverse the path.

[With regard to the intermediate state after death:][894] Having practiced this in detail during dream yoga, at the time of death you will encounter luminosity, like a calf meeting its mother.[895] Once your awareness has awakened from obfuscation, it will become radiant, without being objectively recognized. The natural expression of the five lights will be perfected, without their intermingling.[896] Then, when the first weeks of reception and reconnection [with the propensities of your past life] have been completed,[897] at this time you should recall the following instruction that you formerly received [concerning the appearance of the mental body]:
Having the bodily form of one’s past and emergent existences,
Complete with all sense faculties, and the power of unobstructed movement…
Visible to those similar in kind and through pure clairvoyance…[898]
You should then meditate during this life[899] where the threefold intermingling of beings, similar in kind within cyclic existence, occurs,[900] {318} and starting from now, you should cut off doubts, such as wondering whether buddhahood may be attained. You should know that this is the way of the six doctrines through which you may experientially cultivate the path that escorts all things to their finality.

After you have taken refuge and set the mind on enlightenment, there then ensues the [nine cycles of] instruction that the melodious voice of Nirdehaḍākinī [the disembodied ḍākinī of pristine cognition] imparted [to Tilopā].[902]
(i) The first instruction is as follows: “You should untie the knots of the mind through maturation and liberation.”[903]
In this regard, in the path of provisions, the two provisions [of merit and pristine cognition] are carried on to the path. In the path of connection, the focus is devoid of attachment. In the path of insight, whatever arises is a facilitating instruction.[904] In the path of meditative cultivation, afflicted mental states are carried onto the path. In the conclusive [path of no-more-learning], there are the instructions that introduce the fruit.[905]
In order to sever attachment to the path of provisions, the path of connection has a focus devoid of attachment. In order to sever attachment to the path of connection, the path of insight carries as facilitators all desirable attributes of the senses that appear. Even simple attachment to those facilitators will be severed on the path of meditative cultivation by carrying afflicted mental states onto the path. This completes the first instruction: “You should untie the knots of the mind through maturation and liberation.”
(ii) The second instruction is as follows: “The commitment is that you should look into the mirror of your own mind.”[906]
In this regard, there are commitments concerning things to be prevented, commitments concerning things to be established, and commitments concerning things that are neither to be prevented nor established.
[Among the first of these categories,] you should not explain the empowerments and sacred doctrine to the immature. You should not reveal the higher paths to unworthy recipients. You should not reveal[907] sacred representations in inappropriate locations. You should not explain the sacred doctrine to those lacking devotion. You should not induce those without faith to engage in the path of provisions. You should not accept as a disciple one who is without commitment. You should not revere Hanuman as a teacher.[908] You should not befriend messengers. You should not cultivate instructions that rely on words.[909]

<d e="2">
[Among the second category,] you should rely on teachers who are endowed with the lineage. You should cultivate the meditational deities that are the inheritance of your past actions. You should make offerings to the ḍākinīs who dispel obstacles. You should associate with friends who are of harmonious view and conduct. {319} You should cultivate the aural lineage that is the lineage of accomplished masters.[910]
[Among the third category,] you should not abandon afflicted mental states. You should not rely upon antidotes. You should not cultivate the attributes of the real nature. You should not search elsewhere for the fruit.[911] This completes the second instruction: “The commitment [to look into] the mirror of your own mind.”
(iii) The third instruction is as follows: “The sacraments of the commitments bask in the sun of realization.”[912]
In this regard, there are sacraments of commitment that give rise to cyclic existence, which is the basis of bewilderment, and those that are opposite, basking in the sun of nirvana. In general, the former include sacraments of commitment that generate the three poisons, sacraments of commitment that accumulate negative deeds, and sacraments of commitment that give rise to cyclic existence. Contrary to these are sacraments of commitment that abandon the ten nonvirtuous actions and do not give rise to the lower realms, and in addition to these, there are sacraments of commitment that engage in the ten virtuous actions and attain the higher realms [of gods and humans].[913]
As for sacraments of commitment that bask in the sun of nirvana, they include those that rely on the object of refuge, those concerning the actions and fruits associated with the vows of individual liberation, those concerning the altruistic mind of enlightenment, and those concerning the introduction to the way of Secret Mantra.[914] This completes the third instruction: “The sacraments of commitment bask in the sun of realization.”
(iv) The fourth instruction is as follows: “In conduct you should strike water with a sword.”[915]
In this regard, there is (i) conduct associated with the threefold vows of Samantabhadra,[916] (ii) conduct endowed with the commitments of secret practice, (iii) conduct that retains awareness with carefulness and mindfulness, and (iv) conduct associated with the central channel that is without referential object.

<d e="2">
[As to the first of these categories,] you should engage in external conduct symbolizing circumstances that have arisen, you should engage in internal conduct through which the three media [of body, speech, and mind] block the entrances to the three lower realms, you should engage in secret conduct that carries the three poisons onto the path, and you should engage in authentic conduct that introduces bliss and radiance.
In addition, you should engage in physical conduct that pertains to the buddha body of emanation and the vows of individual liberation, verbal conduct that pertains to the buddha body of perfect resource and the bodhisattva vows, and mental conduct that pertains to the buddha body of reality and the vows of the awareness holders.
Furthermore, you should not turn the wheel of attachment and hatred associated with the three poisons. You should not profit from conduct that stockpiles merit. You should not run after this life[917] that is preoccupied with the eight worldly concerns. You should not disparage the sacred doctrine on account of your own opinions. You should not deprecate others on account of your own positive desires. You should not engage in study or reflection out of desire for cyclic existence. You should not serve as a household priest for friends or foes. You should not cling to isolation in the borders of your native land. You should not scatter the storm[918] of bias, including factionalism. You should not forsake [lowly] sentient beings out of pride. You should not draw the bowstring of enmity toward equals. You should not fire the arrows of jealousy upward.[919] {320}
[As for the second category,] secret conduct includes the physical conduct of nudity and loose hair; the conduct of wearing ornaments such as human ash and bone ornaments; and the conduct of holding hand emblems such as a khaṭvāṅga, bell, and ḍamaru drum.[920]
As for [the third category, which concerns] the conduct of awareness: you should act in the manner of a lion that is fearless and solitary, in the manner of a tiger that is unimpeded and without exhaustion, in the manner of an ox that is intrepid, in the manner of a dog or pig that is without impurity, and in the manner of a child who is without reflection or meditative cultivation.[921]

As for [the fourth category, which concerns][922] conduct associated with the central channel: you should engage in conduct that is without attachment to magical appearances; you should engage in conduct concerning the inexpressible luminosity of the nature of mind; you should engage in conduct that is nondual and free from activity, transcending the intellect; and you should engage in conduct of conclusive meditation that is free from temporal limitations.[923] This completes the fourth instruction: “In conduct you should strike water with a sword.”
(v) The fifth instruction is as follows: “You should spin the wheel of the network of the channels and winds.”[924]
This instruction comprises (i) the essential nature of the cakras of the channels and winds, and (ii) the activities pertaining to the network of the channels and winds.
[The former includes the channels, winds, and vital essences; and among these, the channels are explained in terms of their shapes, number, and location.] As for their shapes, they resemble a parasol, a rooftop, an amulet, or a lily. As for their number, the outer channels number seventy-two thousand; the inner channels number one hundred and twenty; the secret channels number thirty-two; and the authentic channels number three, which, when condensed, number one. As for their location, the outer channels are located in muscle tissue and skin, the inner channels are located in adipose tissue, the secret channels are located in bone tissue, and the authentic channels are located in secret places. [Among the outer channels,] the longer are a double arm span in length and the shorter are the size of a barley grain or needle, and they are all present within the network of physical channels. The inner channels pertain to conceptual thought, and the secret channels to bliss and emptiness.[925]
As far as the winds are concerned, these are of three types, resembling kings, ministers, and subjects. There are five primary winds that resemble kings, five ancillary winds that resemble ministers, and hundreds of thousands of winds that resemble subjects. The internal winds arouse the material elements. The secret winds regulate motion. And the wind of pristine cognition actualizes the three buddha bodies.[926]

As far as the vital essences are concerned [they are also of three types: outer, inner and secret]. Among them, the outer vital essences are the contaminated vital essences present within each of the channels, which number the same as the above [that is, seventy-two thousand]. When these are condensed, urine flows from the left channel, blood from the right channel, and generative fluid from the central channel. The inner vital essence is the naturally arising awareness, and the secret vital essence is the nondual pristine cognition.[927]
The arising [of the fruition] ensues when [their unelaborated nature] has been experientially cultivated.[928] {321}
[In terms of the natural unelaborate state:] the chyle of blood takes the form of light, the chyle of breath is present as the warmth in wind, and the chyle of the vital essences is clear and transparent.[929]
[In terms of the experiential cultivation of the path, there are four sorts of motion:][930] The first sort is the motion that derives from the winds of the five lights. The second is the motion that derives from the winds of breath. The third is the motion that derives from the winds of attachment. And the fourth is the motion that derives from the winds of the sense faculties.
As far as the [four] motions of consciousness indicative of past actions are concerned: the first is the motion that derives from the substratum consciousness, the second is the motion that derives from the mental consciousness, the third is the motion that derives from the afflicted mental consciousness, and the fourth is the motion that derives from the consciousnesses of the five sensory gates.[931]

As for the “lamp of the light of ideation and scrutiny,”[932] the thickness of its channel is one-tenth of a horse’s tail hair, and its vital essence is the thickness of a white silk thread. The motion of its wind has five aspects: attachment is red, hatred is white, delusion is black, pride is yellow, and jealousy is green. In its center, giving rise to mindfulness, the light that is the support of the generative essence is present as nondual pristine cognition.[933] The pristine cognitions then arise [from the five poisons] in the following manner: The mirrorlike pristine cognition arises from hatred, the pristine cognition of discernment arises from attachment, the pristine cognition of reality’s expanse arises from delusion, the pristine cognition of sameness arises from pride, and the pristine cognition of accomplishment arises from jealousy.[934]
In terms of their [fruitional] manifestation, the channels are the buddha body of emanation, the winds are the buddha body of perfect resource, [and the vital essence is the buddha body of reality].[935] This completes the fifth pith instruction: “[You should spin] the wheel of the network of the channels and winds.”
(vi) The sixth instruction is as follows: “You should retain the precious [generative essence] according to the teachings of supreme bliss.”[936]
This instruction includes (i) the disclosure of empowerment on the path of maturation, and (ii) the generation of the lamp of skillful means on the path of liberation. [As to the former,] empowerment is conferred on a female “action seal” endowed with the defining characteristics that enhance the mantras, and then [her body becomes the deity, her speech becomes mantra, and] her mind becomes innate [pristine cognition].[937]
[As to the latter,] this concerns the male-female union endowed with the three aspects of authentic perception.[938] The female is Vārāhī and the male is Cakrasaṃvara. The vajra and the lotus should be consecrated and slowly rubbed together. [The main practice then has five parts:] (i) the generative essence should descend; (ii) it should be diffused, absorbed, and retained by means of yogic exercises that constitute the elixir of the three buddha bodies; (iii) it should be reversed through essential practices of three sorts; (iv) it should be intermingled, descending to the apertures of the channels; [and (v) the method of introducing pristine cognition should then ensue].[939]

That is to say, the descent [of the generative essence] should be controlled because it comes of your own power. For retention [of the generative essence], there are yogic exercises in which the body resembles a contracted tortoise, the vomiting of a grunting tigress, and a shooting star. For its reversal, there is the great nail of the syllable HŪṂ [as well as mantra recitation and meditative stability]. As the generative essence intermingles at the apertures of the channels, it has the [white] color of the moon or Vairocana; [and the channel through which it is reversed resembles] a tree or an opened parasol.[940] {322} This completes the sixth instruction: “The precious [generative essence] should be retained according to the teachings of supreme bliss.”
(vii) The seventh instruction is as follows: “Awareness is the lamp of the pristine cognition.”[941]
In this instruction [there are five aspects]: (i) the lamp that seeks conventional methods, (ii) the lamp that reveals the illustrative meaning, (iii) the lamp that unravels the symbolic meaning, (iv) the lamp that inspires experiential realization, and (v) the lamp of self-originating consecration.[942]
[The first of these lamps has two functions:] it illuminates the extremes of being and nonbeing, and it generates the lamp that transcends the intellect.
[In terms of the former it has four attributes:] (i) it is a material entity because it seeks to attain accomplishment through awareness, (ii) it is within perceptual range of the scriptures because it has contradictions, (iii) it is within the range of hearing because it illustrates the meaning of words, and (iv) it is conceptual because it is examined through discriminative awareness.

[In terms of the latter,] its generation of the lamp that transcends the intellect [has five attributes]: (i) it is not an object of awareness because it is devoid of refutation and proof; (ii) it is not within perceptual range of the scriptures because it is without contradiction; (iii) it is not within the range of hearing because it does not pursue words; (iv) it is not conceptual because, on examination, it is not found; and (v) it is revealed to be realized through the oral instructions of the teacher because it derives from essential [reality]. [This realization, in turn, has three aspects:] (i) realization that comes about when blessings are present, (ii) realization that comes about when there is conviction, and (iii) realization that comes about when there is experiential cultivation. Here, there is no realization[943] that comes about through scriptural authority because that to which one is attentive would be subsumed within the three world realms.[944]
As for the [second] lamp that reveals the illustrative meaning, [this also has five attributes:] (i) it may by exemplified by the knot of a snake that naturally uncoils, (ii) it may be exemplified by a natural bubble of water, (iii) it may be exemplified by clouds that naturally arise, (iv) it may be exemplified by crystal that is naturally clear, and (v) it may be exemplified by the horns of a hare that surpass intellectual understanding.[945]
As for the [third] lamp that unravels the symbolic meaning, this [has five aspects]: (i) symbols that realize the view, (ii) symbols that experience meditation, (iii) symbols that are blind and unseen, (iv) symbols that are dumb and soundless, and (v) symbols that are crazy and without attachment. [Among these, symbols that realize the view include] symbols that are pointed out but untouched, symbols of the sword that does not cut, symbols of the shoulder that does not stretch, and symbols of the fire that does not burn.[946]
As for the [fourth] lamp that inspires experiential realization, this [has two aspects]: experiential realization that is without attachment and unrecognized; and experiential realization that is naturally liberated, beyond the intellect.[947]

In this instruction [there are three aspects: (i) the meditation that roams the mountain hermitage of the sky], (ii) the meditator who enacts the dance of the son of a barren woman, and (iii) the object of meditation that is [the ritual application of] the Great Seal. {323} The last of these [entails eleven procedures]: (i) you should prepare a formless fire pit; (ii) you should arrange [within it] a self-originating effigy; (iii) you should cut the firewood for the rite of Jarokpa; (iv) you should visualize the divine form of the original buddha; (v) you should induce the ritual summons with the blindfold; (vi) you should maintain an unsurpassed focus; (vii) you should scatter the ritual charms of turtle hair; (viii) you should thrust the ritual spike fashioned of the horn of a hare; (ix) you should combust the fire of the end of time; (x) you should offer the flowers of space; and (xi) with lion’s milk as rakta, you should receive the spiritual accomplishment of the kingdom of the mental faculty.[950] This completes the eighth instruction: “The Great Seal is naturally liberating.”
(ix) The ninth instruction is as follows: “Common savor is the mirror of external appearances.”[951]
In this instruction [there are four parts: refinement of visualization, examination of ailments, the experience of common savor, and the expulsion of ailments. Among these, the refinement of visualization is as follows]: the wind of the upper gate and the wind of the lower gate are [separately] present, like heat and cold, or horses and yaks. Pristine cognition should then melt the two sorts of afflicted mental states frozen within the central channel, so that the wind of the upper gate and the wind of the lower gate are fused together.[952]

[As for the examination of ailments, if you are ill, you should undertake massage, unblock the winds, and sit up straight as an arrow.] You should circulate [the wind] in the manner of a wheel, attract it in the manner of a hook, and elevate it in the manner of the sky. If you are in pain, you should disrupt it by adopting the posture of the lion’s play.[953] If you are lethargic, you should secure the lower gate. If you are overactive, you should inflate the base of the small intestine. If the wind is retained within, pristine cognition will arise. If it is dispersed externally, nothing at all will transpire.[954]
As for the experience of common savor, if the earth element indicative of the lower wind is excessive, you should dispense wind for the earth element and strongly practice the ascetic discipline of physical exercises. If the water element indicative of the upper wind is excessive, you should dispense fire for the water element, focus consciousness upward by means of yogic exercises, and ignite the fire from the syllable HAṂ that emerges from the mouth of the ogre (srin po’i zhal nas).[955] If the fire element indicative of the upper wind is excessive, you should focus on the female action seal and elevate the vital essence. If the wind element is excessive, you should dispense earth for the wind element, place the palms together at the crown of the head, stare into the distance, and partake of bone soup. If the fire and water elements are excessive, you should suppress the upper wind. And if the earth and water elements are excessive, you should ignite the lower winds. You should then dispense wind for the earth element, you should dispense earth for the wind element, you should dispense fire for the water element, you should dispense water for the fire element, you should dispense nonarising [space] for the wind element, you should dispense emptiness for bliss, and you should dispense bliss for emptiness.[956] This completes the ninth instruction: “Common savor is the mirror of external appearances.”
Among these Nine Doctrinal Cycles of Nirdehaḍākinī, the first four cycles were arranged by Marpa {324} and the last five by Rechungpa, in accordance with the teachings of Tipuwa.

After you have taken refuge and set the mind on enlightenment, there follows the consecration in the symbolic method that pertains to body, speech, and mind:
(i) You should instantly meditate on your meditational deity and ask yourself if the visualization is clear or not. If you say it is clear, you should ask yourself whether that vision was present a short while ago, or whether it was not. If you say it was not, you should then ask yourself whether it may be interrupted or not interrupted. If you say it may be interrupted, then it consists of adventitious thought. It is merely a fleetingly instantaneous support.
Then, again, you should meditate on a color in front. You should ask yourself if that patch of color clearly appears. If you say it does, you should ask yourself if it was present a short while ago, or whether it was not. If you say it was not, then that color is adventitious and fleetingly instantaneous. All phenomena are like that.
(ii) Furthermore, the buddha fields above, the fields of the hells below, and the intellect that apprehends those fields have been fabricated by the mind. These have arisen through conditions, but all thoughts present within the mental faculty are groundless and baseless.
(iii) With regard to the symbols that pertain to speech, you should ask yourself whether you can hear the bodhisattva Caryāmati residing in Cindhona, the citadel of Vajravārāhī.[958] If you say you can hear him, you should place your palms together toward him and ask whether you can hear his words. If you say you can hear them, you should ask whether you perceived Caryāmati a short while ago or did not. If you say, with your palms together, that you did not formerly perceive him, then that is an adventitious thought, without inherent existence.
Again, when it is said that the mighty lord of the gods Śakra is present in the divine assembly of Dharmabhadra in Trāyastriṃśa, you should understand that there is one example indicative of this that pertains to speech—namely, when the syllable PHAṬ is discerned in the sky. You should ask yourself whether your sense faculties will [later] not become oblivious to that. If you say that it will be repeated owing to a subsequent instance of that sound, then this is but an adventitious thought. {325} All sights and sounds are like that.

In brief, since there are many indefinite modes of physical conduct that are revealed, they arise through the condition of adventitious thoughts and so they are fleetingly instantaneous, essentially empty, indefinite, groundless, and baseless.
Illustrated by such diverse symbols, naked perception is directly introduced. All that appears is introduced to be adventitious, without inherent existence, like a dream, like a magical display, and like the sky.
If you ask how the five buddha bodies and pristine cognitions abide in relation to that, they are without any ground or basis: The buddha body of reality is nonarising, the buddha body of emanation arises through dependent origination, the buddha body of perfect resource is essentially empty and does not differentiate appearances and emptiness, and the buddha body of essentiality is their inseparability. Apart from their having simply and spontaneously experienced these four buddha bodies, there is no separate fruit that can be obtained by those who have refined a path and so forth. This constitutes the symbolic introduction to the direct path of the Great Seal.

Just as ordinary visual consciousness engages with sights, the yogin should maintain composure with regard to any apparent signs and objects that arise. Just as two distinct thoughts are not assimilated simultaneously because, when [visual consciousness] is distracted by sights, the sound of a conch is not heard, the yogin should one-pointedly rest the mind on the very inception of anything that appears, so that the mind abides right where it is, uncaptivated by [extraneous] sensations due to past actions and perceptions, its disposition omnipresent, engaging with minimal sensations.

Next, you should apply meditative concentration on smoke and other such [signs of meditative experience that arise], in association with the five sensory consciousnesses, and then direct your ideation and scrutiny imbued with joy and bliss, and your unmoving discriminative awareness, toward the inception of whatever arises. You should maintain composure and meditative concentration, integrating calm abiding and higher insight, in the manner of a mother and child meeting face to face. {326}

Next, you should go back and forth between breath control and adamantine recitation, uniting the sun and moon of the right and left channels and intermingling both subtle energy and mind. Without a sound, you should mentally recite the syllables HŪṂ, OṂ, and ĀḤ that arise from the power of their respective places [in the heart, forehead, and throat]. While maintaining that, you should forcefully induce the union [of the upper and lower winds] in the central channel by means of the vase breathing. In addition, with regard to the upper wind, you should repeatedly apply [the yogic exercise] named “wave of perfect rapture,”[960] blocking the movement of the winds of action from above and below and uniting them in the amulet of breath control.

Finally, meditative stability that blocks the perception of suffering will naturally and abundantly arise. Since your body is permeated with chyle, you will actualize miraculous abilities and effortlessly overwhelm external appearances.
Glorious Kālacakrapāda has said, “Those of highest acumen initially acquire realization through the tantra.”[961] This implies that there is a secret bond of firsthand guidance and innermost advice. By contrast, it is an essential point that those of inferior acumen will certainly develop the activated fierce inner heat[962] within seven days. The successful outcome of this practice was actually granted him by the ḍākinīs at Śītavana.
Accordingly, you should visualize yourself as the meditational deity. In the fireplace of the navel cakra, you should visualize your teacher in the form of the fire of pristine cognition, one inch in size, and the place where your teacher appears is vividly clear. You should fervently imagine that he or she embodies all the objects of refuge—buddha, sacred doctrine, and monastic community.
Then you should sit cross-legged, secure one hand with the other [in the gesture of meditation], bend your neck, straighten your spine and waist, stretch your shoulders,[963] and expel the residue of wind [three times]. After that (i) you should inhale gently, long, strongly, and completely, forcing the wind downward.[964] (ii) Next, you should hold and fill the upper and lower winds in equilibrium, circulating them back and forth, and filling [the abdomen] with wind. (iii) Next, you should expel this wind [from the abdomen to the apertures of the channels] and shake the body, visualizing that the body is permeated by wind. (iv) Next, you should exhale the wind actually through the nostrils {327} while visualizing that it exits from the tips of the pores.[965]

[There are seven phases of visualization that then ensue:][966] (i–ii) Firstly, you should concentrate your mind, as if inserting a thread into the eye of a needle, upon the fire at the navel cakra, the size of a pea, which diffuses sparks of flame and is imbued with warmth that can virtually burn the body.[967]
(iii) Consequently, the sunlike rakta derived from the pathway of the pea-sized vital essence that is of the material of fire blazes and darts in the form of a flame, four digits in height, resembling the tongue of a snake. You should one-pointedly focus on its movement that resembles the tip of a flame flickering in the wind. The tip of the flame then opens the aperture of the central channel. You should let your mind rest without wavering on this flame that is endowed with four attributes[968] and that resembles an upstretched yarn of red silk within the clear and transparent central channel, as if a thread were inserted within a crystal.
(iv) Next, you should visualize that from the top of the central channel a bluish-green smoke resembling the smoke of incense emerges from the crown of your head and billows like an open parasol upward into the sky, but you should continue focusing your visualization on the actual fire within the navel and meditate diligently.
(v) Even when that smoke covers your body in the manner of mist descending on a mountain, you should continue to meditate one-pointedly, honing your visualization on the fire burning within the body.[969]
(vi) Next, you should focus your mind on the twisting flames that emerge from both the crown of your head and your rectum, coiling like a noose and forming a ball of light. You should control this strongly with wind.
(vii) Lastly, you should mentally focus that from within the central channel, all the channel apertures of your body will be filled with fire; and the fire of the mighty disk of the sun outside your body in the four directions will virtually burn your body. Once the rays of the sun encounter the firelight diffused from your body, a conflict between the fiery rays will ensue, so that the outside and inside of your body will crackle with warmth.[970]
Then you should tense your calves and forearms and fill your body forcefully with wind. Do not pay attention to the freezing cold! Meditate that you are smitten by warmth, heat, and the light of one thousand suns![971]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should adopt the essential physical posture, straighten the joints, and adopt the gesture of meditative equipoise, with the eyes focusing on the tip of the nose. You should then ascertain the entrance [to this practice] through the symbolic empowerment of Vajravārāhī, which focuses on the three poisons; and relying on spiritual mentors who are free from two of the four conditions,[973] you should comprehend the defining characteristics of your own mind by means of discriminative awareness. That is to say, there is no possibility of arising or ceasing, and the four buddha bodies transcending the intellect are spontaneously present from the beginning. The defining characteristics of all things transcend their illustrative basis. The fish of meaning is caught from the river of words. Through your knowing the sameness of all things, the buddha bodies are fully perfected because all that arises is enjoyed as the shifting display of the buddha body of reality.[974]
The five distinctive paths, commencing with the path of provisions, should be refined, and in conclusion, you must comprehend through skillful means and discriminative awareness the thirty-seven factors conducive to enlightenment. These include the four applications of mindfulness, the four correct trainings, and the four supports of miraculous ability that derive from that path—their causal basis being based on faith, their path based on mindfulness, and their facilitator being the three modes of perseverance.[975] They also include the five powers, the seven branches of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path, which are the fruits of meditative stability.[976]
When in that manner conceptual thought is carried on the path by means of the armor of the view:[977]

The defining characteristics of the mind are unknown,
Just as [the extent of] the space element cannot be examined.
One harboring positive and negative thoughts regarding illusory forms is mistaken,
Like a small child grasping at a reflection as real.
Both meditative equipoise and postmeditation wear each other out.[978]
Cyclic existence and nirvana are indivisible,
Alike in the nature of the buddha body of reality.
All phenomena are the miracles of space.
If one knows one’s own shortcomings
There will be no need for liberation from fetters.
While nonexistent, appearances are a miraculous display of space.
By knowing this, you will be liberated, as if awakening from a dream. {329}
Diverse appearances are the flowers of space.[979]
Are the joys and sorrows of children at all true for the ageḍ
They are without advantages, natural manifestations of illusion.
You should examine them, knowing them to resemble this spectacle of space.
From physical forms to omniscience, all things are drawings of space.
Whatever arises is without acceptance or rejection in the expanse of reality.
Since all things are exaggerated and deprecated, they are exposed as fiction.
All meditators determine exaggeration and deprecation to be mind.
You should realize the sole point
That nothing is to be renounced or adopted.
This is the supreme modality of undeviating liberation.
You should look at yourself and know your own shortcomings.
Do not grasp anything at all that arises!
There is nothing elsewhere higher than this supreme path.
These imperceptible, multifarious appearances conforming to habitual propensities
Are the seeds of mental concepts that can all be grasped by the intellect.
Look! Look! You should observe nothing at all!
Look at the one who cuts and severs the doubtful mind!
[And]:[980]
All hopes and doubts, cyclic existence and nirvana are quiescent in the expanse.
Thereby you will reach upward to the reality of entities.
Always examine this, as if awakening from a dream.
The genuine expanse is itself without speech, thought, and expression.
That which is free from the intellect is held to be the Great Seal.

Next, there is the path of skillful means, which concerns the fierce inner heat:[981] Your physical body should assume the empty frame of your meditational deity, and you should adopt, above all, the essential physical posture. The eyes should be concentrated in that manner, and you should meditate that, with the teacher present above your head, your three channels and four cakras are clear and transparent, and that the wind is moving from the left side. You should practice the fourfold application of wind, which entails inhalation, filling, crushing, and elevation, and thereby control the subtle energy and mind, commencing with the ashé (the stroke of the letter a) that is associated with the navel cakra.
You should develop certainty in the bliss and warmth as the fire, expanding from four digits to twenty in height, is progressively inducted through the navel, heart, throat, and crown cakras and throughout the entire body. The successful outcome of this practice is that [the vital essence] will blaze and drip down [through the central channel], like a bristling strand of hair.
To that end, you should rest for a longer time in meditative concentration, at the limits of nonconceptuality, and then chain all the winds together. During inhalation you should not rest. The RAṂ syllables are visualized in proximity to the two kidneys, with the red lotus of the fire element in the navel cakra, and at its center an ashé, which has the nature of fire. {330} You should expel the wind of the right and left channels [into the central channel], and as the fire increases to four, eight, and twelve digits in height, it fills the navel, heart, throat, and crown cakras with fire that is gross and subtle. The subtle and coarse[982] vital essence of the melting syllable HAṂ then descends, like a distended thread, so that it fills the cakras in succession.
You should construct this visualization without attachment. As for the method of refining this practice: You should focus on the blissful warmth that burns more intensely and engage in experiential cultivation that combines together the three phases of fierce inner heat—the activated fierce inner heat, the [experiential] fierce inner heat, and the supreme fierce inner heat.[983] The melting bliss of the five female buddhas, including Buddhalocanā, will then arise on the basis of subtle energy and mind.

With regard to the method of attaining buddhahood through the illusory body: The preliminaries are as in the practice of the fierce inner heat. (i) You should then meditate on yourself and all appearances as a magical display. (ii) Next, you should praise and criticize your reflection in a mirror. When it evokes neither pleasure nor displeasure, at that moment you should absorb the reflection into yourself and engage in praising and criticizing yourself. As in the case of your reflection, it is certain that no thoughts of pleasure or displeasure will arise. (iii) Next, you should go to a market or a similarly busy place and examine [the praise and criticism you receive] in the aforementioned manner. (iv) If these are rendered nonexistent, you should then have an image of your meditational deity and so forth reflected in a mirror, and once its reflection has appeared, you should absorb it repeatedly into yourself. When you have visualized your own body clearly as the deity, you will have refined the pure illusory body. (v) By refining that, you will attain the supreme accomplishment, if there is no distinction between meditative equipoise and postmeditation. If, however, that distinction persists, you will attain buddhahood during the intermediate state after death.

To practice apprehending dreams, your head should face toward the north. (i) You should actually perceive the Buddha as your teacher, above the crown of your head, and pray that you might apprehend your dreams. Set your mind on aspirational enlightenment, so that all sentient beings might attain the level of an adamantine holder by means of the illusory body. (ii) You should then visualize a red lotus with four petals in the throat cakra, and at its center, as the essential nature of your teacher, is the syllable OṂ. On its four petals the syllables A, NU, TA, RA—respectively, white, yellow, red, and green—are spinning, revolving in a forward motion. You should repeatedly intensify your aspiration to apprehend your dreams. (iii) Next, you should focus your awareness on the syllable a, and you will come to apprehend your dreams while you are asleep, late at night, at midnight, or at dawn. (iv) If you do not apprehend them, you should do so by focusing your awareness upon a glistening pea-sized red vital essence in the space between the eyebrows. {331} (v) If you apprehend and understand your dreams to be dreams, you should then prolong and nurture them. You may increase them from one to two, transform them, apprehend fearful and hazardous situations [as dreams], leap around, and so forth.

For the practice of consciousness transference: Lie down on your right side, with your head pointing north. If you transfer consciousness from within that former disposition of luminosity, those of highest acumen will attain supreme accomplishment, and at the very least, you will acquire a human body inclined toward the sacred doctrine.
You should visualize your own body as the deity, and the central channel the thickness of a bamboo cane. The inhabited world and its sentient inhabitants become radiant as appearances of light, and then melt and dissolve into yourself. You, in turn, are absorbed into the syllable HŪṂ, and then, in the manner of a shooting star, that dissolves into the heart of your teacher, in the form of Vajradhara, who is upon the crown of your head. You should then rest in meditative equipoise. This practice should be refined many times.
Those of highest acumen will master luminosity, those of average acumen will master the illusory body, and those of inferior acumen will transfer consciousness into the human body that they desire.

On the other hand, if you are attached to the past deeds you have accumulated, the reality is that you will wander into the intermediate state after death. So, after approximately three days have passed, the three signs of death will arise.[985] Your movement will not be impeded anywhere, with the exception of the Adamantine Seat and the womb of your next rebirth.[986]
To block your entrance into that womb, you should clearly visualize yourself as the meditational deity and block it by resting in luminosity. Alternatively, you may block that womb entrance by meditating on yourself and all appearances as your teacher in male-female union. You should refine this practice [of blocking the womb entrance] from now onward.
In addition, those in whom attachment arises when they encounter their [future] parents in sexual union should respectfully venerate those two as their teacher or meditational deity in male-female union. Through your making offerings and praying to them, the womb entrance will be blocked. Alternatively, those who are at fault due to harboring attachment or hatred [for their future mother or father] may block the womb entrance by reflecting that this is merely discrimination (dbyed ri she snyams pa).
If, even then, it is not blocked, you should visualize yourself and appearances as the deity, and the body of the deity as a rainbow-colored magical display. You should then intermingle that with luminosity. That is to say, you should rest your mind in the Great Seal, without apprehending clarity or radiance. Thereby it will be impossible for the womb entrance not to be blocked. It should be blocked thereby within the first week, and it should effortlessly be blocked also within the subsequent [six] weeks [of the intermediate state].[987] {332}
It is important to persevere in the roots of virtuous action for the sake of deceased persons, and you should emphasize the Great Seal itself, the all-pervasive luminosity that has previously been revealed. There is evidently nothing else apart from these essential points.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment [you should understand the following forty-seven supplementary points]:

(ii) [Some say that the sacred doctrines and philosophical systems of the buddhas are different, but in this tradition it is stated that the vehicles and] the philosophical systems are the auspicious circumstances [of the buddhas].
(iii) [Some hold that] the eighty-four thousand sections of the sacred doctrine [amount to a single ox load and so forth, but in this tradition it is stated that they] are antidotes for the eighty-four thousand afflicted mental states.
(iv) [Some hold that] the twelve branches of the scriptures are different, but [in this tradition it is stated that] all of them are complete in each one.
(v) [Some hold that] the five excellences are [not] completely present in teachings [that are noncanonical],[989] but [in this tradition it is stated that] the entirety of cyclic existence and nirvana is subsumed in the five excellences.[990]
(vi) [Some hold that] the three scriptural collections are [un]connected with each other, [but in this tradition it is stated that] all three are completely present in each one.
(vii) [Some say that, in general, the excellence of the sacred doctrine is not completely present in the introductory chapters of all the scriptures, but in this tradition it is stated that all five excellences are completely present to their fullest extent in all the teachings.][991]
(viii) [There are many opinions concerning] the Vinaya, [Sutras, and Abhidharma, but in this tradition it is stated that the teachings of] the common sutras[992] and the Cittamātrins are [included within the scriptural compilation of the] Abhidharma.
(ix) [Some hold that the truth will be seen] by entering into the ways of the extremists and the Bonpos, [but in this tradition it is stated that] there is no opportunity for them] to see the truth.
(x) [Some hold that] the extremists and the Bonpos [have nothing at all that is conducive to liberation, but in this tradition it is stated without contradiction that they] do have some elements that are conducive to liberation.

(xxix) [Some hold that the primary commitments are granted through the secret mantras in all their four phases,[997] but in this tradition it is stated that] there is no opportunity to grant the primary commitments through the [secret] mantras [in all their four phases].
(xxx) [Some say that one cannot engage with the meditational deity from the very beginning and that one has to engage gradually, but in this tradition it is stated that immediate engagement, or] nongradual engagement, with the [meditational] deity is the profound essential point.
(xxxi) [Some hold that] the number of recitations in ritual service is important for [stabilizing] the generation stage, but [in this tradition it is stated that] one should know accomplishment to emerge through a host of auspicious circumstances that concern the [meditational] deity.

(xlii) Some hold that the Great Seal is obscured by both virtuous action and nonvirtuous action, but [in this tradition it is stated that] the buddha body of reality cannot be obscured by the essence of virtuous actions.

(xlv) Some hold that the fourfold action of breath control [and so forth] is profound, but [in this tradition it is stated that] the profound essential is not to hold the breath but to leave it relaxed.
(xlvi) Some hold that consciousness transference denotes the transference into the heart of the teacher [or meditational deity] dependent on [recitation of] HŪṂ or seed syllables, {334} but [in this tradition it is stated that] the supreme consciousness transference should engage with the luminosity of the teacher.
(xlvii) Some hold that when a buddha has entered nirvana, this resembles a fire that has run out of firewood, as if the wood were exhausted and the fire exhausted; but in this tradition it is stated that nirvana is the natural form of enlightenment, the essential nature free from extremes.
The points explained here should be imparted as incremental steps in respect of the Revered [Wheel of Vitality] and The Fivefold [Great Seal]. That is to say, they are to be experientially cultivated.

After you have taken refuge and set the mind on enlightenment, the practice of the fierce inner heat is differentiated according to both lower and higher methods.[1001]
(i) [As to the former,] the wind of past actions should be compressed [by yogic exercises,] and there will be a gradual increase in the appearances [of heat, bliss, and nonconceptuality].[1002] The sessions of visualization are short but there are many essential points. You should diligently try to secure the physical posture known as the “six opposing stoves.”[1003]
The inception of postmeditation is then taken as an example of the impure illusory body. From the time of its appearance its modality is empty of inherent existence.
Also, if you do not waver from the aspiration that arises when you lie down to practice dream yoga, the fierce inner heat associated with the wind of past actions will become the basis of your meditative equipoise and the impure illusory body will become your path of postmeditation. For the aspiration associated with dream yoga is an attribute that facilitates perception during the night.
(ii) The higher method, distinct from that, applies the four-session yoga and it emphasizes the fierce inner heat associated with [the wind] of pristine cognition. Here, the upper and lower winds should be united through breath control. The vital essence will then descend from the crown of the head to the [fire in the navel cakra] in the form of an ashé, and the experiences of bliss, radiance, and nonconceptual mind will then follow.
[In this higher method] the primordially pure expanse is the Great Seal, and the natural expressive power of its appearance is the innate fundamental state—the pure illusory body where [pristine] objects are atemporally present.

These pith instructions are the foundation of excellent remedies, resembling the alchemical transformation [of base metal] into gold. As for their practical implementation, once delusion, which resembles that base metal element, has been transformed, it is termed luminosity. Whatever the experiences of bliss and emptiness that arise may be, at that very moment they are spacious, without fabrication or contrivance. The luminosity [that is subsequently experienced] at the time of death is known as “the meeting of mother and child.”
Those who would assume the dance of the mental body [in the intermediate state after death] should be attentive to consciousness transference {335} and recite hik.[1004] The arrow and the bow of subtle energy and mind are the devices that direct this visualization. Consciousness transference through[1005] the syllable HŪṂ is the short path that subsumes the enlightened intention of the Six Doctrines.

You should experientially cultivate the essential instructions that conceive of the teacher as the three buddha bodies of reality, perfect resource, and emanation. Rising when dawn covers one-eighth of the sky, you should array the visualization in the sky in front of yourself. That is to say, you should conceive of your teacher seated upon a particularly sublime ornate throne, as Prajñāpāramitā, the consort of the conquerors—the natural grace of the uncontaminated buddha body of reality. While verbally chanting the verses of the Fourfold Cycle of the Mother of Space,[1007] you should complete one thousand prostrations with your five limbs touching the ground, precisely and without mistaking the number, and then finally you should dissolve the great mother Prajñāpāramitā, who is the essential nature of the teacher, into yourself. Consequently, you should nurture the natural descent of naked intrinsic awareness, however it abides, as the buddha body of reality free from conceptual elaboration, uncovered by the stains of the trichotomy between subject, object, and interaction. You may then attend to [mundane] activities, such as eating at the end of the session.
Next, while conceiving of your teacher as Vajradhara, the buddha body of perfect resource in whom the major and minor marks are perfectly radiant, embodying all the lineage holders, you should do one thousand prostrations as before, and after dissolving that visualization into yourself, you should nurture the unimpeded natural glow of the buddha body of perfect resource that manifests in and of itself.

Next, with devotion you should conceive of your teacher as the buddha body of emanation, Śākyamuni, diffusing light rays in the ten directions, and do one thousand prostrations as before. After dissolving the visualization into yourself, you should hone your own awareness within the disposition where you yourself are the buddha body of emanation, effortlessly acting for the benefit of living beings. Then, finally, the three buddha bodies will have been perfected {336} and you should develop strong devotion and faith from the heart in your actual root teacher. Prostrate toward that teacher with your body, and with your speech recite the words, “All sentient beings who are equal to space go for refuge to the teacher who is the buddha body of reality, to the teacher who is the buddha body of perfect resource, to the teacher who is the compassionate buddha body of emanation, to the teacher who is the buddha body of essentiality, to the teacher who is the precious buddha, and to the venerable lord of the sacred doctrine who is the gracious buddha!”[1008]
With your mind you should completely abandon [all activities], out of regard for the expression “You know what is to be done!” You should concentrate your body, speech, and mind one-pointedly and be particularly strict while in retreat. In the night you should practice [dream] yoga while sleeping, and thereby you will perfect the provisions, purify obscurations, and forcefully draw the blessings of the body, speech, and mind of the teacher into your own mind, so that meditative experiences and realization gush forth and you become like a son who has followed in his father’s footsteps.[1009]

As for the guidance that determines auspicious circumstances,[1010] you should ascertain [the nature of] fundamental mind and not incite mental obfuscation through a multitude of unnecessary activities. That is to say, you should develop the [commonsense] understanding that vomiting or indigestion are gastric ailments that may occur if you overeat.
Just as [a farmer at the end of] the four agricultural seasons and a trader who has obtained a favorable price for tea may idly rest, after encountering the face of mind you should rely on the common savor without engaging in any activity.
Just as a herdsman on the high plateau is vigilant, wondering whether any enemy, thief, or wolf may approach or not approach his livestock, you should concentrate on the strength of awareness with unwavering vigilance.
Just as a wild ungulate sticks to its own habitat, you should meditate in the manner of a solitary juniper growing on a cliff in a snow range or forest.
You should move about and sit with your body, speak with your voice, and with your mind you should avoid all elaborations. You should not resort to agricultural activities.
Starting with a secluded house or remote dwelling, you should even erect a partition screen around your own bed.
You should cut off the continuity of speech, but when you do speak out, extol your teacher, the sacred doctrine, or spiritual siblings.
You should refine these four pith instructions concerning contentment, renunciation, dispassion, and withdrawal.[1011] {337}
If, in addition, you guard the three commitments of unwavering body, speech, and mind, auspicious circumstances will spontaneously emerge, like flies gathering on meat.

As far as the guidance on the common savor is concerned, you should pray fervently to your teacher. This direct liberation without grasping is profound. [Specifically, there are six pith instructions to be observed:][1012]
(i) The pith instruction of bringing negative views to the precipice that carries conceptual thoughts onto the path: Here you should discard [conceptual thoughts] with your mind, dispel hope and doubt, and precisely apprehend whatever arises. Even though thoughts might be abandoned, do not abandon them and do not pursue them. Do not rectify them. You should rest in a relaxed manner, wide-eyed and in equilibrium, and let go of egotistical grasping.
(ii) The pith instruction of transforming poison into nectar that carries afflicted mental states onto the path: In this regard, when hatred, delusion, pride, jealousy, or desire suddenly arise, you should precisely apprehend them, remain lucid, and purify them inherently, without abandoning them. You should realize them to be the pristine cognition of discernment, the mirrorlike pristine cognition, the pristine cognition of reality’s expanse, the pristine cognition of sameness, and the pristine cognition of accomplishment, which are the natural expressions of the five families [of buddhas].
(iii) The pith instruction of accepting obstacles as spiritual accomplishments that carries gods and demons onto the path: Here you should precisely apprehend the face of demonic forces and the perception of fearful thoughts when they suddenly arise, and purify frightful perceptions inherently, without abandoning them. That should clearly transpire.

(iv) The pith instruction of enlightened mind that carries the sufferings of cyclic existence onto the path:[1013] here you should cultivate compassion for sentient beings and nurture the exchanging of yourself and others, without contrivance.
(v) The pith instruction of the common savor of the elements that carries ill health onto the path: Though you may fall ill, there will be nothing other than this practical technique [that will assist]. Recognize this and abandon [obstacles or ailments] with your mind! You should dispel hope and doubt, and starkly behold the discomfort of your pain. If you probe around your seat, you will not find anything [that will assist], so rest in that disposition! The apprehension of a self is the causal basis of hope and doubt and of ill health.
(vi) The pith instruction of introducing the mother and child that carries death onto the path: Here the “mother” is reality and the “child” is awareness, the true modality of appearances. At the time of death, you should meditate on your teacher. You should recognize conceptual thoughts and act with fervent devotion. You should remain relaxed. By your recognizing the awareness of the moment of death and resting in it, in an uncontrived manner, {338} it is said buddhahood will be attained.

Here the visualization is as follows: You should one-pointedly focus on yourself as Vajrayoginī, with a body of fire. Within an aureole of a blazing mass of fire, she appears, with the soles of her feet [resting on] a sun disk below, diffusing red and shining sparks of fire, as if being burned by fire. Above, also, her body blazes as the natural expression of fire, its six ornaments[1016] fiery red, blazing outwardly and inwardly on fire. With fervent devotion, until the [molten] fluid from her head almost flows down as far as her heels, you should say, “Grant your blessing that the pristine cognition of blissful warmth may arise!”[1017]
Finally, you should continuously practice the yogic exercise named “kindling fire with a rubbing stick”[1018] and develop strength in both the control of [the winds of] vital breath and exertion. When resting you should nurture your own true nature and do this without distraction.[1019]

The five crucial procedures for vigorous breathing comprise inhalation, filling, crushing, ejection of breath in the manner of an arrow, and the union of the upper and lower winds through vase breathing. For the first crucial procedure, inhalation, you should distinguish between the defect [of not knowing] and the advantage [of knowing] the key points of inhalation. Similarly, when you practice the four subsequent crucial procedures[—filling, crushing, ejection, and union—]their practical application is revealed by the teacher in person because there is no tradition for recording these in writing.[1030]

<d e="2">
As for the red HŪṂ of consciousness transference, this is refined by training and application. [First the training is as follows:] Adopting the essential physical posture, you should meditate on the teacher at the crown of your head and imagine that the secret cakra of the teacher and your own anterior fontanel are directly level. Cultivate the utmost devotion! Then, at your navel cakra there is a red HŪṂ resembling coral. It falls freely to the secret cakra and diffuses rays of light like the sting of a bee, incinerating all impurities and filth within the physical body and transforming it, as if the cartilages were inflated with emptiness and radiance.
Next, there are interlinking HŪṂ syllables that break off individually from that red HŪṂ, and respectively block the rectum, the urethra, the navel, the mouth, the nose, the eyes, the ears, and the space between the eyebrows. You should imagine that the anterior fontanel at the crown of your head is suddenly opened and visualize that in the middle of your empty body the central channel has the thickness of a bamboo cane—at its lower extremity reaching the deepest entrails and at its upper extremity penetrating the anterior fontanel, empty and radiant. You should visualize that the HŪṂ of the secret cakra then reaches the navel cakra, shimmering red and causing it to shake and tremble.
[Secondly, the application is as follows:] From within that disposition, the HŪṂ is ejected afar in the manner of an arrow through the central channel, and it enters into the secret cakra of the teacher, so that it passes above the head of the teacher and comes to rest far off in the disposition of the Great Seal, upon the amoliṅga stone platform of Trāyastriṃśa.[1031]

Reality is nothing at all. [In general,] there is the one-sided emptiness exemplified by nonexistence in relation to existence, {340} there is the ephemeral emptiness exemplified by a vase that is empty of water, there is the emptiness of synonyms that exaggerate and deprecate emptiness and its modalities, and there is the emptiness of the mental faculty that reflects on a single object that is not intellectually established. Here, on the other hand, there is [the modality of the emptiness of the ground], which denotes the emptiness of cyclic existence and nirvana, of everything that appears and exists, untainted by the stains of such [narrow perspectives]. There is also [the modality of the emptiness of the path], which denotes the great freedom from extremes that does not fall into bias. This comprises the emptiness of views, because inclusions such as the statement “my view is this” are not established; and it comprises the emptiness of nonviews, because preclusions such as the statement “it is not this” are not refuted.
Having been transformed in accordance with [the foregoing modality of the path, the modality of the emptiness of the fruition] is neither a profound aspect of the oral instructions of the teacher nor an understanding on the part of the wisdom of the disciples. The original, uncontrived abiding nature is present as such.
The six aspects established in the context of the six [adamantine] expressions comprise these three modalities of the emptiness of ground, path, and fruition, along with the compatibility of these modalities of emptiness, the establishing of emptiness, and, lastly, the defects and advantages that may arise in relation to emptiness.[1032]

This has two aspects—namely, evil spirits that bring diseases on yourself, and evil spirits that bring diseases on others. [As to the former,] you should meditate on a thumbnail-sized blue HŪṂ in your own heart, and then, differentiated on the basis of heat and cold, you should visualize a white HŪṂ [in the case of fevers] and a red HŪṂ [in the case of colds], which are respectively cold and hot to the touch, within the upper and lower parts of your body. Just as a magnet attracts iron filings, your ailments will be gathered in one fell swoop and finally expelled afar from the crown of the head. [In the case of subsidiary diseases such as tumors,] you should visualize a blue HŪṂ in the place where there is a tumor and gather the disease, as before, expelling it from the fingertips.[1033]
With reference to evil spirits that bring diseases on others, this conforms with the [aforementioned practice] of expelling the HŪṂ in your own heart. In conjunction with vigorous breathing, you should visualize that a string of HŪṂ syllables, unbroken as a thread, enters though the nose of the invalid and fills their body. All diseases without exception should then be gathered and inhaled through your own nose, along with the string of mantra HŪṂ syllables. Finally, on breathing out clearly, you should imagine that the manifestations of disease vanish like mist in the sky. This treatment for evil spirits that bring diseases appears to resemble the extraction of a painful thorn.[1034] {341}

Since these are my teacher, I should pray to them. Since these are my meditational deity, I should request spiritual accomplishment. Since these are innate, I should rest in their disposition!”[1036]

You should visualize a reddish-yellow downward-facing syllable phaṭ at the orifice of the vajra (penis). Next, imagine that from the tip of the vajra as far as the navel cakra, a string of white HŪṂ syllables is arrayed, and that from your pores the HŪṂ syllables half protrude and half remain submerged within. Then focus your awareness on the syllable HAṂ on the crown of your head and visualize that the string of HŪṂ syllables at the orifice of the vajra surges upward within the central channel to emerge from the crown of your head by a full span.[1037]
You should guard against ejaculation at six times: (i) If you are about to ejaculate in dreams, you should meditate at the time of falling sleep. (ii) [You should meditate if you are about to ejaculate when the experience of bliss arises, and so forth.] And (iii–vi) [you should meditate at the end of all the four sessions of practice].[1038]
As for [the restricted injunctions] on guarding against ejaculation by using a device: You should tie a span-sized stick from the waist by a cord and position it upright at the occiput, which is said to correlate with the sacred place of Arbuda. You should not make the mistake of tying the cord at the neck, which is said to correlate with the sacred place of Lampāka.[1039] Then close the left channel and there will be no ejaculation. This oral instruction [when it is effective] resembles the play of children.[1040]
Then there is the guarding against ejaculation by means of sacramental substances [which is a restricted injunction: If the aforementioned device does not help,] you should make a dough combining the following substances—frankincense, which represents the authentic dreadlocks of Yama; mustard, which is the sacramental charm for wrathful rites; menstrual blood; human ash; human brain; deer fat; and human fat. You should knead this with the urine of a [healthy] child under the age of eight, prepare mustard seed–sized pills, and let them dry in the shade. If these are inserted individually into the orifice of the vajra (penis), the pain will cease [and the remedy will be effective].[1041]

After you have taken refuge and set the mind on enlightenment, whenever this body of yours engages in this practice, it is known as the “being of commitment,” but when glorious Jñānanātha becomes vibrantly radiant, the being of pristine cognition is present.
[As to the former, the visualized being of commitment:] At the navel cakra within your body, which resembles a pure and transparent crystal offering lamp, at the triple intersection of the channels, you should visualize the three deities that are naturally present. That is to say, you should meditate vividly on Mahākāla in the form Jñānanātha in the center, raven-faced Kākamukha to the right, and red Caṇḍikā to the left, standing on the channel branches that are the supporting basis of Mahākāla and his consort, and on the channels and vital essences. Next, the being of pristine cognition similar to your visualized form should arrive from the great Śītavana charnel ground and dissolve therein. After that, you should visualize your teacher in the form of the lord of enlightened heritage Innate Cakrasaṃvara, present directly at Mahākāla’s head.
Within the heart cakra of Mahākāla you should visualize the syllable HŪṂ, within the heart cakra of raven-faced Kākamukha also the syllable HŪṂ, and within the heart cakra of Caṇḍikā the syllable bhyoḥ, surrounded by their own respective mantras. Then you should cultivate devotion for the teacher and recite approximately a rosary of the seven-syllable mantra [of Cakrasaṃvara]. From the body of your teacher, Innate Cakrasaṃvara, rays of light of the nature of bliss then appear, penetrating Mahākāla and his consort, so that they are pleased to the utmost. In consideration of the being of commitment, they then diffuse doctrinal protectors resembling themselves from your ten million pores, so that your body is covered, as it were, with armor. Imagining you are protected with the adamantine body, you should then count [the mantra recitations]: OṂ VAJRA KAWUVA VAPAŚAYA MAHĀKĀLA YA HŪṂ HŪṂ PHAṬ.[1044] Aroused by the light of these syllables, Caṇḍikā and raven-faced Kākamukha then diffuse forms resembling themselves and eradicate the enemies of the Buddhist teaching, absorbing the strength, capacity, and power of the three planes of existence.

Next, you should absorb these emanations inwardly through the pores of your own body, visualized as Mahākāla, and imagine that they dissolve into one another in the four channels of the navel cakra. {343} The vital essences of the channel branches are then absorbed in the manner of globules of mercury moving in fire and dissolve as offerings into Mahākāla and consort. Next, the ritual acolytes of Mahākāla and the female deities to the right and left also dissolve into the central Mahākāla, so that Mahākāla alone is visualized, and he, in turn, is transformed into the syllable HŪṂ. The parts of that syllable then dissolve in succession, from the subscript vowel u, to the nasalized vibration (nāda), and thence into the visage of your teacher in the form of Innate Cakrasaṃvara, seated in male-female meditative equipoise. Finally, your vitality of pure essence, in the disposition of bliss and emptiness, should settle into the Great Seal.
In that same manner, you should also meditate on the three [aforementioned] deities within the four other cakras—the secret cakra, the heart, the throat, and the crown of the head—and that in succession, these also dissolve into your teacher in the form of Innate Cakrasaṃvara, the disposition of bliss and emptiness.
Next, you should meditate that the three channels are respectively white, red, and pale blue, and that vital essences are present in the five cakras, in their five colors.
Finally, visualizing yourself as Mahākāla, at the secret cakra there is a hexahedron embodying bliss and emptiness, blue on the outside, red on the inside, and in the middle is the female consort Nandikeśvarī. You should meditate that within her womb there is a dark blue HŪṂ, the natural expression of Mahākāla, glistening and endowed with five-colored rays of light, with the brilliance of one thousand suns. This is the supremely crucial point concerning the secret support that is established within the body.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should visualize the three channels and five cakras of your own subtle body, radiantly manifest as Mahākāla. Within the navel cakra of emanation there is an ashé (the stroke of the letter a) indicative of nonarising, from which Ekajaṭī then arises. She melts into light that is transformed into four vital essences, among which the upper vital essence appears as your teacher in the form of the solitary hero Hevajra. In the middle of that, where the right, left, and central channels converge with the vital essence, is Mahākāla, with his copper knife–wielding emanation to the right and Śrīdevī to the left. The syllable ya is then diffused from the heart cakra of Mahākāla and the syllable maṃ from Śrīdevī, giving rise respectively to the {344} male yakṣa and female yakṣinī. Two TRI syllables then diffuse from the male yakṣa and the syllable BHYOḤ from the female yakṣinī, and from these, in turn, Putra with his brother and sister appear.[1046]
The beings of pristine cognition should then dissolve into those visualizations, and the empowerments should be conferred. You should imagine that Akṣobhya [confers empowerment] on the teacher and Mahākāla, and that the crown ornament is conferred on the others by means of the five-pronged vajra, and that they are bound under an oath of allegiance by means of the teacher’s handheld vajra, as he says:[1047]
This vajra is the great vajra.
It has the blessings of all the buddhas.
If you transgress your oaths,
There is no doubt that this will be terrifying!

Thereafter the DEVA PICU mantra,[1048] the twelve-syllable mantra,[1049] and the RORU mantra[1050] should be recited, binding and suppressing them.
The [sequence of the] visualization is that your teacher arouses Mahākāla. Mahākāla then arouses the copper knife–wielding emanation and Śrīdevī. They, in turn, respectively arouse the male yakṣa and female yakṣinī,[1051] and they, in turn, respectively arouse Putra with his brother and sister.[1052] You should imagine that their messengers who fill the trichiliocosm eradicate enemies and obstructors. Then you should recite OṂ KĀLA YAKṢAYA KĀLĪ YAKṢISĪ YAKṢAPUTRAYE RUṬABHATRAYE RULU RAKṢASĪ HŪṂ BHYOḤ HŪṂ.[1053] Finally, the visualization is gradually dissolved; you should let your mind rest on a yellow vital essence, the size of a small seed, and maintain the gentle union of the upper and lower winds.
Next, in that same manner, you should focus on Ekajaṭī as she arises from the ashé (the stroke of the letter a) in each of the other cakras—the secret cakra, the heart, the throat, and the crown of the head—and then rest your mind respectively in the green, blue, red, and white vital essences. Finally, you should visualize the syllable HŪṂ within a hexahedron, which is the secret abode of the female deity in the navel cakra, and become established in that secret support, while meditating also according to the Ritual Application of the Razor Cut.[1054]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: [You should understand that] the entirety of cyclic existence and nirvana is the arising modality of [the nature of] mind, and apart from that there is no entity that exists. Through this mind—the agent of causes and conditions—there is nothing to be done. It is empty, nothing whatsoever, and the expressive power of its awareness is unimpeded. Form and color are similarly nonexistent anywhere. The dichotomies of singularity and multiplicity, of eternalism and nihilism, and of extremes and freedom from extremes cannot be specifically pinpointed. Anything whatsoever may appear in your own meditative experience that transcends the intellect. That is to say, the nature of mind may manifest as anything whatsoever, it is unlimited, it does not fall into extremes, it is not attached to biased perspectives, it is without exhaustion or increase, and it is without discontinuity.
You should be introduced to this nature of mind through symbols. Concentrate the mind! Do not get lost in the past, and do not get lost in the future! Rest your mind instantly in its natural state, and intensely refine [the awareness] that is without support! You should maintain mindfulness without distraction and nurture the experience of awareness. When you have become familiar with the space [of reality], you will no longer have to exercise control through mindfulness. You will no longer have to depend on antidotes. There will be no discontinuity of your meditative experience that is naturally present, transcending the intellect.

For this practice, you should first develop a strong aspiration and repeatedly remind yourself that you should understand your dreams in the [nighttime] intervals between the daylight hours. With a high pillow and a comfortable mattress, you should lie down on your right side {346} and visualize in the throat cakra a red lotus with four petals, at the center of which is a white syllable A. When falling asleep, you should have fervent recollection. After sunset, you should focus your mind on a white vital essence between the eyebrows; at dawn, you should focus on the syllable ĀḤ at the throat; and when waking up, you should understand that all phenomenal existence resembles a dream. The signs of successful recognition are that even though you are confronted by water or fire, fall into an abyss, or are pursued or killed, and so forth, you will understand this to be a dream. You should maintain this practice.
The training is as follows: you should aspire in whichever way you can, pondering in your mind whether during dreams you will jump into water, be burned in a fire, behold the domain of Trāyastriṃśa or the twenty-four sacred places, be oppressed by the sun, behold the face of your meditational deity, or listen to the sacred doctrine, and so forth. That is the training.
When training in magical display and refining dreams, if you have thoughts of fear and anxiety because you have jumped into water and so forth, you should abandon your distress, thinking, “This is a dream. This is fictitious. What is terrifying?” You should not transgress this reality.

In refining your dreams, you should understand also that whatever transpires is bewilderment, and during sleep you should then enter into luminosity. You should meditate on the syllable HŪṂ at the center of the heart cakra—with A in front, NU to the right, TA to the rear, and RA to the left. In normal circumstances you should visualize the syllable A; when gross thoughts have subsided and deep sleep has arrived, you should visualize the syllable NU; when subtle thoughts have subsided, you should visualize the syllable TA; and when sleeping at dusk, you should visualize the syllable RA. When sleep is wearing out, these should be absorbed into the syllable HŪṂ. By sleeping accordingly, you will relish sleep as emptiness, experiencing the luminosity of bliss and emptiness.

When the maturational body of the intermediate state is investigated, the mental body consisting of past propensities endures through the intermediate state of the rebirth process, until another body is acquired. {347} At that time, without generating attachment toward a beautiful female form or hatred toward a beautiful male form, you should carry [this experience] as luminosity. [To that end, you should know that] after you have died, you will faint for three days, or for up to five or seven days, as if falling asleep. After waking up, you will be fearful simply of the extent of your dreams. After you have died, the thought will arise that you exist, whereupon the propensities accrued in your past life will finally be continued through reincarnation and you will experience the suffering of the three lower realms, including the hells. Therefore, instead of lapsing into ordinary afflicted mental states of the past, it is said that you should not mistake the thoughts [of the mental body in] the intermediate state for your own mental continuum but actualize them as the buddha body of reality, which is luminosity.

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment, you should stay at an isolated hermitage. When there is sunlight, you should clearly focus on the rainbow light emerging from an egg-shaped crystal and rest [your mind] on the support of that perception. This is [known as] the “mirror of Vajrasattva” that manifests to disciples, in the manner in which Padmasambhava pointed it out to an old man with his staff and to an old woman with his finger.[1058]
Just as this light is not transformed into any existent entity but may arise as anything whatsoever on the basis of conditions, the entirety of cyclic existence and nirvana—all that appears and exists—is actually the unique vital essence that is not differentiated outwardly or inwardly; a spectacle, radiant and distinct in its rainbow lights. This unique vital essence of appearance and emptiness accommodates the fields of existence, exemplified even by this field of joyous Akaniṣṭha, the supremely secret abode. Indeed, all that may be designated as phenomena is permeated by the sameness of primordial purity and spontaneous presence, like a crystal and its light. You should visualize that though form and color together appear as the diversity of rainbow light, {348} they do not transgress these three characteristics: nonexistence, appearance, and pervasion.
In this timeless liberation, the unique vital essence is dazzling, vibrant, clear, pulsating, quivering, stark, and bright. It neither differentiates nor does it not differentiate between the expanse of reality and awareness. It is devoid of distinguished aspects and distinguishers. It emerges from the uncontrived expanse, as naturally present luminosity. Though it is present to all, there is no one at all who sees it. No one dares appraise it, just like the extent of space. It is radiant and brilliant, like the light of the sun. It is unchanging and steadfast, like Meru, king of mountains. It is profound and bottomless, like the depths of the ocean. It is untainted, like a lotus in the mud. It is intangible, like the moon reflected in water. It arises in all ways, like rainbow clouds in the sky. It is radiantly perfect, like the reflection in a mirror. It is unimpeded in all respects, like a meteorite from the sky. It is uninterrupted, like the flow of a great river. It is the substratum, like the mighty earth. Examples such as these indicate that the unique vital essence unites pristine cognition and the expanse.

Though this adamantine chain of awareness does not exist outwardly or inwardly, owing to the modalities of its appearance, it does appear outwardly and inwardly—outwardly as a precious enclosure of spontaneous presence,[1059] and inwardly as naturally radiant awareness and their offspring of pure essence. That is to say, it has three modalities: actual awareness, the natural light of awareness, and the natural conception of awareness, which correspond respectively to (i) the unchanging light of the male that resembles a vibrant painting, distinct and radiant; (ii) the channel enclosure of the female that is of luminous vital essence, radiant and empty; and (iii) the offspring that is the experience of bliss, radiance, and emptiness, born consequent on the entry of the former into the womb of the adamantine queen.
Wish-granting fruit ripens from the wish-granting tree. Waves of nectar emerge from the ocean of nectar. The rainfall of all that is desired cascades from the wish-fulfilling gem. You should not therefore pour nectar into a vase containing the vomit of suspicion that is the negative conceptualizing intellect. You should not grow poisonous fruits from medicinal seeds. {349} You should not cover the light of the sun with darkness. How wonderful! Exactly like this crystal before you, you should understand that internal awareness also has a radiant adamantine chain of light. Exemplified by the unimpeded colors of rainbow light that arise from this crystal, the luminosity of the inception [of awareness] occurs naturally, transforming the four material elements. All the self-manifesting appearances of the channels, winds, and vital essences may assume the form of smoke, mirage, fireflies, burning lamps, light resembling the moon, light resembling the sun, or Rāhu, the eclipser. All these indications that arise and these that do not arise are nonexistent. Indeed, the arising of the expanse and the liberating of the expanse are similar to the coiling and uncoiling of a snake, so you should not be agitated by the demonic forces that would grasp those signs. Exemplified by this crystal, which has no interior content but seems to manifest as appearances, you should not look anywhere apart from your own intrinsic awareness. Since all those apparent signs without exception exemplify the natural manifestation of natural radiance that is uncreated and without effort, they may be engaged without mistaking cause and result.

After you have taken refuge and set the mind on enlightenment [there then ensues the threefold guidance of buddha body, speech, and mind]:
(i) The guidance of buddha body concerns the uncommon preliminaries associated with the generation stage. You should confess acts of killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct committed by means of the body; and you should train in the acquisition of the three virtuous actions of the body. With certainty that your body has from the beginning been the body of the deity, through that disposition you should clearly visualize yourself as sublime Avalokita, the color of a stainless conch, with one face and four arms. It is said that when cultivating the generation stage, you should observe rainbows in the sky and develop certainty that appearances do exist as form but that tangible phenomena do not exist as form. {350}
Finally, there is the consciousness transference of buddha body in the manner of a mustard seed: you should visualize that the inch-sized being of pristine cognition in the heart cakra is transferred from the pathway of the central channel into the heart of the teacher, present in the sky in front, in the form of Amitābha surrounded by a host of divine princes and princesses, and is then invited onto a pathway of rainbow light, reaching Sukhāvatī.

</d>
<d e="2">
(ii) The guidance of buddha speech concerns the recitation [of mantras]. You should confess the four [nonvirtuous actions of] lying, slander, verbal abuse, and nonsensical talk, and train so that your speech is never separated from the six-syllable mantra. With a mind that understands speech to be an empty echo from the beginning, you should chant the adamantine song of the six-syllable mantra. This recitation should resemble the sound of thirty-six beehives breaking open, and you should visualize plants, mountains, rocks, earth, stones, and all that appears and exists as the sound of the six-syllable mantra. You should recite OṂ MAṆI PADME HŪṂ without interruption, day and night.
[Finally,] there is the consciousness transference of buddha speech in the manner of a seed syllable: you should visualize that the syllable hrīḥ, which is the support of awareness, the enlightened mind, in the navel cakra is instantly drawn from the pathway of the central channel through the anterior fontanel by the compassionate hook of the lord of enlightened heritage at the crown of your head, where it dissolves into the heart of the teacher, and that the teacher then ascends upward, reaching Sukhāvatī.
(iii) The guidance of buddha mind concerns luminosity. You should confess covetousness, vindictiveness, and wrong views, and develop certainty that mind is originally present as the buddha body of reality. You should adroitly determine the basis of the view that mind is spontaneous and leaves no trace. It is as if the sensations of dampness and warmth were to occur simultaneously in a tangible object, without one following the other. Consequently, you will not eat after satisfying your hunger. You will not drink after quenching your thirst. You will not put on clothes after feeling warm. And you will not search for something after finding it.
[Finally,] there is the consciousness transference of buddha mind into luminosity: this denotes the settling of the mind in the face-to-face encounter of the mother and child luminosities owing to the absence of both the object of consciousness transference and the agent of consciousness transference.

After you have taken refuge and set the mind on enlightenment, there then ensues the introduction to words [of symbolic expression] and their meaning.
First, the [words of] symbolic expression are as follows: (i) In the expanse of space, both the sun and moon arise as precious wish-fulfilling gems. (ii) The rainbow colors of the sky should be ensnared by the noose of wind. (iii) The gem of the ocean rides the supreme horse of crystal. (iv) Triumphing over sun and moon, the six classes of living beings incite the conflict[1062] of the five material elements and surpass Mount Meru. (v) The man of crystal imprisoned in the ravine of the three worlds instantly circumambulates the three worlds and goes to sleep in his own home.[1063]
The meaning of these expressions is respectively as follows:
(i) [Externally] in the expanse of space, when the gem of awareness arises as an [adamantine] chain [of light], it is perceived by both the sun and moon, which are the eyes. Internally, at the center of an aureole of light within the heart cakra, the light of the gem of awareness in the form of an adamantine chain then arises at both [optic] channels as the lamp of the empty vital essence, which is the pure essence of the eyes.[1064]
(ii) When the externally glowing chain [of light] arises in cloudless space and the internally glowing five lights of the expanse arise in the sky, you should focus awareness without distraction and interrupt the movement of wind, so that the vital essences neither quiver nor flicker.[1065]
(iii) The radiant awareness of the heart cakra then enters through a crystal tube.[1066]
(iv) It rises unimpededly above the two eyes, whereupon, owing to its nonrecognition, you would roam in cyclic existence. You should therefore not provoke the conflict of the six classes of living beings in the citadel of the five material elements.[1067]
(v) Then you will be instantly liberated through recognition of the mind, manifesting in the prison perceived as birth and death and you will go to sleep in that expanse, which is the disposition of the buddha body of reality. In brief, although your mind will roam through the three worlds, you will recognize the pure pristine cognition. {352} Fundamental ignorance will be eliminated, and you will maintain the originally secure fortress.[1068]

Although the essential nature of fundamental reality is not established in terms of cyclic existence and nirvana, the expressive power of awareness in its natural arising will arise as either cyclic existence or nirvana on the basis of whether awareness or fundamental ignorance is present. You should directly behold the awareness that is the natural expression of ultimate reality and that is unknown through words. Although there is neither increase nor decrease in the original seed of reality—the nucleus of the enlightened heritage that naturally abides—even so, because you have experientially cultivated it, the four visionary appearances will successively arise.[1069] Although there is nothing to be liberated in the fundamental nature of primordial purity, subtle energy and mind are purified in the expanse by means of these profound essentials. Although buddhahood is referenced through the vehicles in the course of time, liberation occurs instantaneously in the present. Although the aspects of meditative experience are immeasurable, their determination is made without wavering from the single essential nature.[1070]
This crucial text should be entrusted as a secret expression and concealed from those who are without good fortune.[1071]

After first taking refuge and setting the mind on enlightenment: You should develop fervent faith and devotion because this constitutes the aspiration for exclusive blessing. The esteemed expression “Great Seal” is said to denote the nature of your own mind. If it is not recognized, it becomes this [mundane] awareness harboring all sorts of fantasies. There is nothing at all to be cultivated. Let this awareness rest right where it is, naturally wide open. You should not hesitate, wondering whether this is or is not the Great Seal. From the start you should not indulge in hope for positive outcomes or doubt concerning negative outcomes. Do not pursue the myriad mists of thought. By training repeatedly in this manner, at one specific time you will recognize the nature of conceptual thoughts, and then you will clearly realize that these are without ground and devoid of basis. All attachments will be liberated right where they are. Instantly, the darkness of propensities will recede. {353} That is called buddhahood.
In this instantaneous natural dynamic of the mind, the key point is that appearances are themselves the mind. When you look directly at the essential nature of whatever arises, you are individually aware of all appearances externally, without exception, and of the mind, internally, without exception. Since their arising and liberation are simultaneous, you should focus one-pointedly on that which arises, and in that perspective, it will appear empty of the dualistic grasping and so forth, free from elaborate signs, without conceptual elaboration, empty without any experience at all, and empty without being precisely determined. And while things appear, they are empty, in a common savor in intrinsic awareness. As you abide therein without effort, abiding[1073] itself arises spontaneously. This is the yoga that is not to be cultivated.

So it is that I have here presented
Simply the gist of these one hundred and eight modes of guidance,
Complete in meaning and terse in expression,
In accordance with the writings that I myself obtained from wherever.
After the preliminaries of which all these partake,
Combining common and uncommon instructions,
The sequence of instruction in the main practices is individual and distinct,
Like the threads of a Chinese weaving.[1074]
Without entangling together the enlightened intentions
Of our predecessors, the supreme lineage holders,
My mind has emphasized the traditions from which they derive,
Without any stains of contrivance.
I have had the good fortune to hear such teachings,
Gathering all the profound essentials explained
By all the learned and accomplished masters of the past, none excepted—
The emanations of the buddhas, in India and here in Tibet.
It is wonderful and marvelous
That you may without hardship and at one time
Study the difficult points and doctrines that I acquired and searched
From each of these profound instructions.
Due to the prevalence of my former provisions [of merit],
I have passed this life in accordance with the lamp of the sacred doctrine,
Seeking, hearing, writing, and pondering;
And, finally, I have set these instructions forth in writing.
May this work nurture the propensities of the sacred doctrine
In my own future lives,
And if there are any interested in it at this time,
May it also be of benefit to them!

The one hundred and eight rivers of these distinct guidebooks
That descend from the snow peaks of their respective lineages
Fill the vast Anavatapta Lake that is my own mind.
If one were to analyze their basis definitively, it is as follows:

Here I will briefly comment on the listing of the one hundred and eight guidebooks, highlighting the definitive basis of their auspicious number. This commences from the two great pathways of the Buddhist teaching, deriving from the two traditions of Sutra and Tantra, which are both the canonical teachings of the Conqueror. To explain, first there are the guidebooks that accord with the actual teaching of the precious sutras. Next there are guidebooks based on the integration of both the sutras and the tantras. Then there are the guidebooks derived from the short path of the Supreme Mantra.

The first of these, the sutra section, includes both the experiential cultivations of those guidebooks endowed with the greatness of the lineal descent of the transmitted teachings and the experiential cultivations of those that apply the words and meanings, mother and child, without error.
Among these, the former include Parting from the Four Attachments (1), which was actually spoken by Mañjughoṣa; The Seven-Point Mind Training of the Great Vehicle (2), which directly reveals the two modes of enlightened mind; The Mind Training according to Sumpa Lotsāwa (5), which was bestowed by both Vajravārāhī and Tārā; the guidance of The Five Doctrines of Maitreya (23), which were taught by Maitreya; {357} the guidance of the consequentialist View of Intrinsic Emptiness (24), which is the oral transmission of glorious Candrakīrti; and the guidance of The View of Extraneous Emptiness (25), which is the enlightened intent of Maitrīpā.
Next, with regard to the experiential cultivations of those that apply the words and meanings, mother and child, without error, this includes The Three Sorts of Person (9); The Sequence of the Teaching (10); The Sameness of Existence and Quiescence (11); The Great Middle Way (12); The Hidden Guidance of Kadam (13); the integrated Parables of Potowa (18); The Six Descents of the Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom (20); The Five Paths of Pacification (21), which is the elixir of the mind of Dampa; and The Three Stages of Meditation—Beginning, Middle and Conclusive (22).

Thirdly, the guidebooks deriving from the short path of the Supreme Mantra comprise (i) those that are generic, revealing the tradition expounded by all the learned and accomplished masters of India and Tibet, and (ii) those that are specific, separately explaining the respective individual traditions of the Sakya and Kagyu lineages.

The first, those derived from Nāropā, include The Mingling and Transformation of the Three Poisons (89), The Four Adamantine Seats (72), and The Great Magical Emanation (73), all of which descended from Ngokpa Choku Dorjé in accordance with the teaching of Venerable Marpa; The Four Scrolls of the Aural Instructions (90), which descended from Tsurton Wang-ngé of Dol; The [Six Doctrines of Liberation through the Upper Gate, according to the] Aural Lineage of Cakrasaṃvara (91), which descended from Milarepa; The Six Doctrines according to the Sekharma Tradition (88), which descended from Marpa’s son Darma Dodé; the five supplementary instructions from The Nine Doctrinal Cycles of Nirdehaḍākinī (92), The Guidance on Amitāyus (27), and the guidance of the Fierce Inner Heat (47), all of which descended from Rechungpa; The Introduction to the Three Buddha Bodies (86), The Indivisibility of Subtle Energy and Mind (87), and The Guidance on White Tārā (28), all of which descended from the two streams of the Black Hat and Red Hat branches of the Karma Kamtsang school, originating from Karmapa Dusum Khyenpa Usé, who nurtured the enlightened intention and objectives of Venerable Dakpo Gampopa; The Cycle of Pagmodrupa Densatel (95); The Unique Enlightened Intention (96), and The Fivefold Great Seal (84), along with the Revered Wheel of Vitality, according to the Drigungpa; the cycle of The Six Doctrines according to Taklungpa (97); The [Six Primary Essentials for] Mountain Retreat (100) according to the Upper Drukpa; The Ritual Service and Attainment of the Three Adamantine Realities according to Orgyanpa (42); The Means for Attainment of the Guru, Auspicious Circumstances, and Common Savor (98) according to the Middle Drukpa; The Fivefold Capacity of Lorepa (99) according to the Lower Drukpa; and The Elaborate Guidance of Lama Zhang Tselpa Yudrakpa (93). In addition, all of the doctrinal cycles of Dakpo Gampopa each include the Six Doctrines and the Great Seal, so here I also recognize the Molten Gold of the Six Doctrines of Nāropā (76) and The Coemergent Union of the Great Seal (83), the last of which was written according to the teaching of Gyelsé Chodzongpa.

In brief, there are twenty-five ordinary instructions, twenty-five instructions common to all, twenty-five pertaining to the Sakya tradition, and thirty-three instructions pertaining to the Kagyu lineage. Altogether, this completes the enumeration of one hundred and eight.

Having in that manner devoutly touched with the crown of my head
The dust from the feet of holy beings, resembling a bank of lotus flowers,
I took from afar, as an anthill takes honey,
A fraction of their distinct doctrinal traditions.
Owing to my experience of the sacred doctrine accrued in the past,
I pondered the best of acquisitions in this life,
And so with resources, great effort, and perseverance,
I many times repeatedly sought all these profound instructions, without exception.
Unsatisfied even with all the peerless ones
Imbued with the glory of learning and accomplishment,
I was utterly exhausted searching for authentic lineage holders,
Possessing the eye of the sacred doctrine, from wherever they came.
I scorned the rest that my tired body and mind required,
And my mind indeed rejected the talk of fame elsewhere.
Without conceit, renouncing grandeur, and holding down my proud head,
For the sake of the sacred doctrine I have borne hardships.
Thus, in order to arrange each of these profound instructions,
I have again and again roamed throughout the land,
And on meeting travelers I have been bold, without trepidation,
To ask them correctly what sacred doctrine they possess.
Having stayed in colleges from the age of seven
Until the age of thirty-seven, my mind has been enriched
By these one hundred and eight guidebooks.
Rejoicing in this supreme era of ours,
My mind is happy and contented, in a disposition free from arrogance.
By virtue of the merit in this work,
Here and in other lives, may I act for the sake of others,
Abandoning disillusionment,
And may I certainly accomplish my aspiration, like the wish-fulfilling gem,
To guide beings on the path of liberation, endowed with the highest of realms. {361}

In the penultimate chapter, Kunga Drolchok begins by enumerating the one hundred and eight guidebooks in verse, intimating how he personally assimilated their meaning in his practice. In the second part, he names the one hundred and eight protector deities for which he received empowerment, headed by the diverse aspects of Mahākāla, and at the end of that section he subsumes them all in twenty-seven classes. In the third and final part, he lists more than one hundred empowerments that he received often multiple times according to the diverse classes of tantra, individually naming the teachers who conferred them.

As for the sacred doctrines that I heard from the words of my teachers
Through many efforts in this lifetime,
In the manner in which an anthill extracts honey [from hives],
The list of the titles of the one hundred and eight guidebooks is as follows.
On the basis of Parting from the Four Attachments,
I was pierced by the weapons of The Seven-Point Mind Training (1–2).
I trained my mind in equanimity through The Heart of Dependent Origination (3), The Carrying of Happiness and Suffering on the Path (4), and The Mind Training of Sumpa Lotsāwa (5),
And I cut off attachments with The Severance of Machik (6).
I relied on The Three Essential Points (7) and Resting in the Nature of Mind (8).
I was separately taught The Three Sorts of Person (9) and The Sequence of the Buddhist Teaching (10).
I applied The Sameness of Existence and Quiescence (11), the disposition of The Great Middle Way (12), The Hidden Guidance of Kadam (13), the nailing of the Four Deities of Kadam (14–17) and The Parables of Potowa (18).
Then were explained The Sixteen Spheres of the Heart (19).
I yoked the oxen of The Six Descents of the Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom and The Five Paths of Pacification (20–21).
I opened the doorbolt of The Three Stages of Meditation (22) with the key of The Five Doctrines of Maitreya (23).
I integrated the guidance of The View of Intrinsic Emptiness (24) and The View of Extraneous Emptiness (25).
The guidance of The Concealed Meanings of Yogatantra (26) illuminated all darkness.
The streams of The Guidance of Amitāyus (27), the long-life treasure of the mother White Tārā (28), the rite of attainment of White Amitāyus (29) that had been acquired by Maitrīpā, and the four sorts of The Direct Guidance of Avalokiteśvara (30–33) fell to me separately.
I obtained The Direct Guidance of Cakrasaṃvara and Hevajra (34–35)
According to the texts of Ānandavajra, {365}
Vajrapāṇi in the Form Mahācakra (36) who has an aureole of fiery light,
And Vajrapāṇi in the Form Caṇḍa (37) who bellows the sound of HŪṂ.
Through Vārāhī in the Form Kurmapādā (38) I perceived the magical display,
And Kurukullā (39) shook phenomenal existence.
Through The Six-Branch Yoga of Kālacakra (40) experiences of radiant perception and beauty naturally arose.
I leisurely pursued The Aural Lineage of Kālacakra (41),
And The Ritual Service and Attainment of the Three Adamantine Realities according to Orgyanpa (42) guided me on the path.

I examined the secret guidance of The Path and Its Fruition (43),
Along with its subsidiary instructions:
The Inconceivables (44), The Nine Profound Methods (45),
The Attainment of Coemergence (46), The Perfection of the Path of Fierce Inner Heat (47), The Straightening of Crooked Posture (48), The Path of the Female Mudra (49),
The Great Seal Devoid of Letters (50), The Determination of the Mind (51),[2]
And The Mingling of Sutra and Tantra (52),
As well as The Dispelling of Three Kinds of Obstacles (53–55),
Dispelling the Three Sorts of Suffering (56),
And The Clear Recollection of the Innate State (57).
On the basis of The Three Purities (58),
I applied The Twenty-Nine Essential Visualizations of Self-Consecration (59),
And through The Exegesis of the Concealed Path (60),
I practiced The Elucidation of the Symbolic Meaning (61).
I scaled the ladder of The Five Stages of the Secret Assembly (62),
Along with The Vital Essence of Liberation (63) and so forth.
From the expanse of The Unelaborate Practice of Red Yamāri (64),
The Four-Stage Yoga (65) then arose.
I applied The Mental Focus on the Horns of Bhairava (66)
And directed [the vital essence] upward in accordance with its nocturnal motion.
Based on the device of The Central Channel Dependent on the Male Deity Cakrasaṃvara (67),
I also brought forth The Central Channel Dependent on the Female Deity Vajravārāhī (68).
Through the path of The Five Stages [according to Ghaṇṭāpāda] (69) and The Four Stages [according to Kṛṣṇacārin] (70) I aroused the sky-farers.
White Cakrasaṃvara (71) was the deity through whom I attained enlightenment.
I also mastered The Four Adamantine Seats (72)
Which concern the spleen, [kidney] cavities, [and so forth];
The Great Magical Emanation (73), which concerns [lower] forms and [conclusive] attributes; {366}
The Kharamukha Cakrasaṃvara (74), which concerns the subtle vital essence;
And The Six Meditations of Vajravārāhī (75), which are wondrous.
I sought refinement through the primer of The Six Doctrines of Nāropā (76).
The Six Doctrines of Nigumā (77) were the essential elixir of my experiential cultivation.
From within The Amulet Tradition of the Great Seal (78)
I extracted The Three Aspects Carried on the Path (79) and [The] Deathlessness [of One’s Own Mind] (80).
I secured The Six Doctrines of Sukhasiddhi (81) with the nail of the Emanational Navel Cakra (82).[3]

I secured the mighty pillar of The Four Scrolls of the Aural Instructions (90)

That Rechungpa received through an Aural Lineage (91–92),
Along with The Elaborate Guidance of Zhang Tselpa (93),
And The Six-Branch Yoga that was the secret counsel of Ga Lotsāwa (94).
I separately acquired the enlightened intention of The Cycle of Pagmodrupa Densatel (95),
Along with the instructions of Drigung and Taklung (96–97).

The Mountain Retreat of Yangonpa (100) resembled a three-eyed gem.
From within my waistbelt the vital heart essence of Four-Armed Mahākāla emerged in the form Kurakma (101).
I also acquired Pañjaranātha (102) according to the arrangement of Drachok Yarlungpa [Sengé Gyeltsen].
From the chest of The Trilogy of Spiritual Songs (103)
I extracted The Six Doctrines of the Accomplished Masters (104).
[My mind] was opened by the secret Gradual Path of Padmasambhava (105) and The Collected Injunctions of the King (106).
I entered upon Norbu Rinchen’s Liberation by Seeing (107)
Through the [four] precious mothers and [seventeen] offspring (ma nor bu smad),[4]
And I reached the isle of guidance on The Nature of Mind: The Wish-Fulfilling Gem (108).
This complete listing of the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks
Was brought forth from the lake that is the mind of Drolchok.

As for the sacred doctrines that I heard from the words of my teachers
Through many efforts in this lifetime,
In the manner in which an anthill extracts honey [from hives],
The definitive listing of the one hundred and eight empowerments is as follows.
Initially I requested twenty-one times the empowerment and mantra recitations of Hevajra, the highest of all the profound nondual tantras, according to the tradition of the pith instructions, based on the maṇḍalas of colored sand and cotton drawings (1). That is to say, I requested it seven times from Venerable Kunga Chogdrub, seven times from Lowo Khenchen Rinpoché, once from Venerable Sangyé Rinchen, three times from Lhachok Sengé, once from Doring Kunpangpa, and once from Pakchen Pelden Tashi. In addition, I requested Hevajra according to the tradition of Ḍombipā, and obtained it from Lowo Khenchen (2). I requested Hevajra according to the tradition of Saroruha from Lowo Khenchen (3). I requested Hevajra according to the tradition of Kṛṣṇacārin, including the four maṇḍalas that are distinguished in Hevajra—namely those of buddha body (4), buddha speech (5), buddha mind (6), and the nucleus (7). I received these from Lowo Khenchen Rinpoché.
I requested fourteen times[63] the empowerment and mantra recitations of the fifteen-deity assemblage of Vajranairātmyā, based on the maṇḍalas of colored sand and cotton drawings (8). That is to say, I received it once from Venerable Kunga Chogdrub, seven times from Lowo Khenchen Rinpoché, once from Venerable Sangyé Rinchen, three times from Lhachok Sengé, once from Doring Kunpangpa, and once from Phakchen Pelden Tashi.
I requested the empowerment of Hevajra with Rudra as his seat (9) from Lowo Khenchen Rinpoché, and from Kyagom Lekpa Gyeltsen. I requested the empowerment of the seventeen-deity assemblage [of Hevajra], and Nairātmyā with an assemblage of twenty-three female deities (10), from Rabsel Dawa Gonpo.

I requested the empowerment of Hevajra with an assemblage of thirteen weapon-wielding deities (11), and the empowerments of both the Adamantine Tent (12) {369} and the Vital Essence of Union (13) from Lowo Khenchen. I requested the empowerment of Hevajra according to the tradition of Ngok (14), and the empowerment of Nairātmyā with an assemblage of fifteen female deities according to the tradition of Ngok (15) from Lodro Pelzang, who is a familial descendant of Ngok. I requested the empowerment of the Adamantine Tent according to the tradition of Ngok (16), and the empowerment of Vajratārā (17) that is enunciated in the context of the Adamantine Tent from Rabsel Dawa Gonpo. I requested the empowerment of the five-deity assemblage of Kurukullā (18) and received it from Lowo Khenchen Rinpoché. So it was that I obtained eighteen empowerments pertaining to the cycle of Hevajra.
From the cycle of the Wheel of Time, the extensive nondual tantra, I requested the complete empowerment and mantra recitations of Kālacakra, including the seven neophyte empowerments [of water, crown, silk pendant hat, vajra with bell, ascetic discipline, name, and promissory initiation] in the maṇḍala of the glorious constellations, along with the four supreme empowerments and [empowerment of] the Great Identity; and I obtained them three times based on the maṇḍalas of colored sand and cotton drawings (19). That is to say, I received the tradition of Buton from Lochen, the tradition of the Jonangpa from Paṇchen Sherab Tashi, and the tradition of Pelden Lama from Mupa Konchok Drak, according to the actual individual maṇḍalas. The one that I received from Paṇchen Sherab Tashi was based on a cotton drawing, in contrast to the other two that were based on colored sand.

I requested the Net of Magical Emanation with an assemblage of forty-three deities (29), with an assemblage of forty-five deities (30), and with an assemblage of forty-nine deities (31). So it was that I obtained altogether thirteen empowerments pertaining to [the assimilated cycle of] the Wheel of Time.
As for the father tantras, within the cycle of the Secret Assembly, I requested two times the empowerment and mantra recitations of Akṣobhya with an assemblage of thirty-two deities according to tradition of Sublime Nāgārjuna (32), {370} and I received it from Rabsel Dawa Gonpo and from Khenchen Tashi Namgyel, the former on the basis of the visualization maṇḍala made by Dorjé Chang Kunga Zangpo, and the latter on the basis of the visualization maṇḍala made by Buton. I also requested two times the empowerment and mantra recitations of the Secret Assembly according to the tradition of Buddhajñānapāda (33). I obtained this from Rabsel Dawa Gonpo based upon the memorandum of Zarjang Pukpa, and from Khenchen Tashi Namgyel based on the writings of Buton.
I requested once the empowerment of Lokeśvara (34) and received it from Lochen, who had composed a liturgy based on the visualization maṇḍala made by Hor Kabzhipa Sengé Gyeltsen.

LOSAL TENKYONG Although Kunga Drolchok had remarked that guidance should be given according to the individual guidebooks after the empowerments of Hevajra and so forth had been conferred, in later times only the chanting of the scriptural transmission survived. For this reason, Katok Tsewang Norbu during the eighteenth century introduced the so-called empowerment of the book, which transfers the blessings of the anthology—the actual volume containing the one hundred and eight guidebooks. The liturgical arrangement for this empowerment ceremony, which is the subject of this final chapter, was composed by Losal Tenkyong of Zhalu during the nineteenth century.

Regarding the procedure for conferring empowerments in respect of this anthology of the one hundred and eight guidebooks, you should present the maṇḍala offering and say three times the prayer that begins “Endowed with the aggregate of omniscient pristine cognition.”[2] The disciples should then be visualized as deities and enter into meditation. The master, holding the volume of the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks in his hand, should then say the following words:
You should visualize the master as the glorious hero Kunga Drolchok Losel Gyatsodé, who has attained the accomplishment of Mañjunātha and who embodies all the rivers of the lineage. Contingent on your faith and devotion, the garland of vowels and consonants headed by a white OṂ emerges from the OṂ in the forehead of the master, in the manner of a string of white pearls, and it diffuses lights of five colors, along with a stream of white nectar. It enters through the crown of your head and completely fills all the channel branches of the cakra of supreme bliss. All negativity, downfalls, and degenerations and all the outer and inner negativities that obstruct your visualization, meditation, and experiential cultivation by means of the body are refined and purified right where they are. This arrangement of auspicious circumstances will be known by means of the one hundred and eight distinct guidebooks at the very time when you complete the path that refines the adamantine body, including the yogic gazes, the yogic exercises, and the visualization of the aggregates, sensory elements, and sense fields as deities. {377} Having understood all these words and meanings, without exception, you should believe that your mind will acquire the great nail that is unchanging!
Then the master places the volume of the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks upon the head [of the disciple]. Incense should be lit and music played. Three times you should recite the vowels and consonants with the heart cakra as their support, and then you should scatter flowers [of offering].

Then again, the garland of vowels and consonants headed by a red ĀḤ emerges from the ĀḤ in the throat of the master, in the manner of a string of coral, and it diffuses lights of five colors, along with a stream of red nectar. It enters through your throat and completely fills the channel branches of the cakra of perfect resources. All negativity, downfalls, and degenerations and all the outer and inner negativities that obstruct your recitation of mantra, cultivation of breath control, and so forth by means of speech are refined and purified right where they are. This arrangement of auspicious circumstances will be known by means of the one hundred and eight distinct guidebooks at the very time when you complete the path that refines the subtle and gross yoga of the winds, and that commences with the saying of prayers, mantra recitation, and the breathing that dispenses [compassion to others] and draws in [the suffering of others]. Having understood all these words and meanings, without exception, {378} you should believe that your mind will acquire the great nail that is unchanging!
Then [the master] places the volume [of the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks] at the throat [of the disciple]. As before, incense should be lit and music played.
Then again, the garland of vowels and consonants headed by a blue HŪṂ emerges from the HŪṂ in the heart of the master, in the manner of a string of aquamarine, and it diffuses lights of five colors, along with a stream of blue nectar. It enters through your heart and completely fills the central channel of the cakra of the phenomenal wheel. All negativity, downfalls, and degenerations and all the outer and inner negativities that obstruct your experiential cultivation of the path of subtle and gross meditative stability by means of mind are refined and purified right where they are. This arrangement of auspicious circumstances will be known by means of the one hundred and eight distinct guidebooks at the very time when you complete the path that cultivates devotion, detachment, loving-kindness, compassion, and enlightened mind and refines the real nature of ineffable coemergent pristine cognition.

Finally, you should visualize the master as the glorious hero Kunga Drolchok Losel Gyatsodé, who has attained the accomplishment of Mañjunātha. From the three places of his body[—forehead, throat, and heart—]three replicas [are diffused], each about three thumbs in size and each enclosed within a tent of five-colored light rays. These then dissolve into your own corresponding three places. Consequently, you will experientially cultivate, without error, all the words and meanings of the one hundred and eight profound guidebooks. This arrangement of auspicious circumstances will be known at the very time when you are filled like a vase to the brim with all the transmitted teachings of maturational empowerment and all the transmitted teachings of liberating guidance, and so forth, just as Venerable Kunga Drolchok Losel Gyatsodé, embodiment of all lineages, possesses them. {379} You should believe that you will acquire the transference of his authentic blessing, in the manner of a unique lineage!
Then [the master] places the volume [of the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks] at the crown, throat, and heart [of the disciple]. JAḤ HŪṂ VAṂ HOḤ should then be recited three times, incense should be lit, and music played.

The precious garland of the one hundred and eight profound guidebooks,
The essence that churns the ocean of Sutra and Tantra traditions,
Has, as a beautiful ornament for the minds of fortunate disciples,
A stream of lineage blessings that does not vanish,
Just as the moist breath from the mouths of mātaraḥ and ḍākinīs does not fade.
Through the power of truth, may the blessing of the three supreme precious jewels,
Commencing with Jetsun Kunga Drolchok who embodies all teachers
And the trio—Cakrasaṃvara, Hevajra, and Guhyasamāja—
Embodying all meditational deities, enter into you, O fortunate disciples!
Then, while scattering flowers, you should recite the benedictions of good auspices—one quatrain of verse beginning with the words “Summit of the victory banner,”[3] one quatrain beginning with the words “Unchanging mountain,”[4] and one quatrain beginning with the words “[Without the need for] diligence and effort.”[5]
Afterward, as in general, [you should recite the verses] that begin “Just as the lord [commands].”[6]

In this context of the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks, the maturational empowerment in the maṇḍala of Hevajra—essential for the practical application of Jetsun Kunga Drolchok—should be conferred, and then after that the guidance should be given according to the individual guidebooks. In later times, however, apart from simply the chanting of its scriptural transmission, this guidance has for the most part been lost, not to mention its empowerments. Although there are one or two who proudly say they have this transmission of guidance, theirs does not appear to be authentic apart from the mere exegetical transmission. After the time of Venerable Katokpa [Tsewang Norbu], however, this [new] transmission of the empowerment of the book did emerge. To seek to acquire completely all the empowerments and guidance of the One Hundred and Eight Guidebooks through this alone would be extremely presumptuous. Even so, if one has listened to the scriptural transmission of these guidebooks completely, it may permissibly be conferred at the conclusion. Whether or not this was the intention of Venerable Drolchok himself, there is no contradiction. Having observed the correct procedure for their practical application, I have set forth this instruction in writing just as I obtained it from my own teacher.

Embodiment of timeless awareness, with consummate mastery of the noble state of wisdom, utterly transcending the limitations of conditioned existence and mere quiescence;
immutable enlightened speech, amassing the clouds of sambhogakāya through unconditional love to let fall a rain of nirmāṇakāya emanations;
enlightened mind, profound and lucid, emerging victorious in the battle with samsara through nonconceptual power, and cutting through the bonds of dualistic fixation:
I bow to the guru, Vajrasattva in actuality—sovereign lord of the hundred families of inconceivable secrets.
Foundation from which emerges the entire vast range of mandalas without exception,
actuality of evaṃ and source of mantra and tantra—
since the sublime secret delights in the dance of supreme bliss, you who create and enjoy the display, together with those in the lineages, grant us your blessings!
Like the splendor shining from the sun that gives us the day, whatever is excellent in the realms of conditioned existence and the peace of nirvana all comes always from the three precious Jewels,
and so I revere them as my refuge, with faith born of informed appreciation.
Through the inconceivable enlightened activities of the learned and accomplished,
the teachings based on scripture and realization spread completely in the holy country [1] and in Tibet;
I offer the flower of praise, extolling the life examples
of those in the great mainstream lineages of sutra and tantra who spread those teachings. [2a]
Peaceful and passionate and blazing with intense wrath,
a single reality with numerous expressions, guiding those difficult to guide—
O chosen deities, engaging in the dance of innate compassion, grant us the attainments that bring our wished-for goals to consummation.
Moving through the space of timeless awareness, delineating right from wrong,
O ḍākinīs of the three places, O oath-bound guardians and dharmapālas,
be heedful of our exacting pledge and determine the circumstances for lenience:
annihilate what causes hindrances and nurture the fortunate!
Renowned throughout the Land of Snows
are the eight great mainstream lineages of accomplishment and those who followed them;
I open here the great gateway to a marvelous treasury, never before seen,
in which the riches of all manner of profound instructions are included in their entirety.

The great Treasury of Precious Instructions (gDams ngag rin po che’i mdzod) gathers together in a single collection countless profound means of accomplishment that constitute the distilled essence of all the sacred Dharma, the teachings of the buddhas: the means that include, in their entirety, all the limitless stages for practically applying the profound import found in the sutras and tantras; that are easy to implement yet accommodate the minds of those of the three degrees of acumen (excellent, middling, and lesser); and that swiftly bring the state of supreme enlightenment into full evidence. There are five major topics in my concise catalog of this collection: (1) the purpose of compiling this great collection [2b]; (2) the processes by which these traditions developed in India and Tibet; (3) an identification of what these teachings constitute in their essence; (4) an enumeration of the teachings contained in the collection; and (5) a discussion of the lineage successions through which these teachings have been transmitted.

At a certain point during this fortunate aeon of illumination, from among all those victorious ones who will eventually have appeared as suns shining in this world,[2] there appeared the incomparable Lord of the Śākyas—our teacher imbued with supreme compassion, whose armor of motivation is far superior to others’; who is more superb than all the others who liberate those to be guided who were and are not yet liberated in these times of strife; the mere hearing of whose name frees one from the effects of harmful actions reinforced through eighty thousand great aeons; and who is endowed with the aspiration to guide all beings along the path to enlightenment without regression. It is the precious teachings of this buddha that are still alive and enduring.
From among the teachings of all these buddhas of the three times, Śākyamuni especially caused the illumination of the teachings of the secret mantra approach, the Vajrayāna, both the general and the specific, to spread—teachings that appear as rarely as the udumvara flower. Due to a very powerful reinforcement of positive forces in many previous lifetimes, and not just to random chance, those who have attained an unflawed, noble working basis of freedom and opportunity [3] and who have the good fortune to enter through the doorway of the Victorious One’s teachings have gained something that is just within the realm of possibility, like a pauper who dreams of finding a wish-fulfilling gem. At this point, in order to ensure certain benefit on a vast scale for themselves and others, they must definitely strive for, and attain, that unique enlightened dimension (kāya) of timeless awareness that constitutes the inseparability of bliss and emptiness, the consummate state of supreme enlightenment that is not confined to either of two extremes.

Timeless awareness is the quasi-subjective perceiver, [5] the facet of what is ultimately true—supreme and utterly unchanging bliss—which is the totally perfect state of utter lucidity. Emptiness endowed with the sublime capacity to manifest in all ways is the quasi-object, what is relatively true, the dimension of illusion in which suchness arises in any and all ways as what is knowable. [3a] The oneness of these as equal in taste, not subject to any division, is spoken of in Mañjuśrī: Web of Magical Illusion:
buddhahood without beginning, without end;
original buddhahood, undifferentiated . . . [6]
This is a reference to the state of primordial unity that requires no more training, [7] the enlightened dimension of innate timeless awareness, the state of the primordial lord protector, the supreme Vajradhara. This goes by limitless varieties of names and embodiments—Kālacakra, Vajrasattva, Guhyasamāja, Cakrasaṃvara, Hevajra, and so forth.
It is endowed with four aspects of transcendent perfection:
• the transcendent perfection of sacred immaculacy, in that it does not serve as a basis for the continuation of habitual patterns;
• the transcendent perfection of sacred presence in the ultimate sense, in that it constitutes the complete subsidence of all elaborations of identity or lack thereof;
• the transcendent perfection of sacred bliss, in that it is not subject to any extraneous force but is the nondual perception of all that is knowable, in which any embodiment based on the nature of ordinary mind is eliminated and in which the habitual patterns of the nonrecognition of pure awareness are absent; and
• the transcendent perfection of sacred constancy, in that, for as long as space itself endures, from the original moment of omniscient awareness onward there is no difference in its manifestation at earlier and later points in linear time.

It is endowed with three aspects of supremacy:
• a supreme state of elimination, in that all limitless aspects of adventitious distortion—the three levels of obscuration,[8] together with the habitual patterns they entail—have been eliminated;
• a supreme state of realization, in that there is realization (requiring no deliberate examination) of knowable phenomena without exception, as being similar to the images in a diviner’s mirror, an illusion, and so forth; and
• a supreme state of mind, in that there is constant awareness, without any interruption, that permeates any and all ordinary beings, without any discrimination between near and far, ensuring the benefit of limitless beings for as long as space itself endures.
In accord with the reference to buddhahood embodying the five kāyas;
sovereign lord embodying the five aspects of timeless awareness . . .[9]
it is that embodiment of the primordial unity of the five kāyas and the five aspects of timeless awareness for which alone one should strive and of which one should gain accomplishment.
If one gains accomplishment of such a state of the supreme seal (mahāmudrā), the most sublime fruition state, through one’s higher altruistic motivation, enthusiastic diligence, and stable fortitude, it is in the nature of things that all attainments—the four kinds of enlightened activity, [10] the ten powers, [11] and so forth—come about in an effortless and spontaneous manner, just as a fine harvest of grain results in chaff and straw as a matter of course.

On what means, or path, does one rely in order to accomplish such a superior goal? As is said:
The sacred Dharma is that which dispels all suffering and all obscurations.
That is, one should enter through the doorway of the precious teachings
that are still present without having waned—those of the three turnings of the wheel of Dharma by the omniscient Victorious One, who conferred these through the three kinds of miracles [13]—and, having entered, one should gain accomplishment by incorporating these teachings into one’s experience. In particular, it is not possible to gain accomplishment of the sublimely unchanging state of primordial unity through any means other than by relying entirely on the unsurpassable swift path of the Vajrayāna.
The sacred Dharma subsumes the three higher trainings as its subject matter and the Three Collections as the presentations thereof. [14] If these are to be summarized, we may cite the master Vasubandhu:
The sacred teachings of the Teacher are twofold, embodying scripture and realization. [15]
They thus can be subsumed under the two headings of scripture and realization. Of these, the aspect of the Dharma as scripture is described in the Highest Continuum:
The Dharma is that which is free of and brings freedom from attachment
and is endowed with the characteristics of the two levels of truth.
Freedom from attachment is subsumed within the truths of cessation and the path. [16]
As this passage notes, that which is free of attachment is the truth of cessation, while that which brings freedom from attachment is the truth of the spiritual path. Of these, the truth of cessation is characterized as any context that, due to a focus on suchness itself, entails the cessation of anything associated with corruptibility [17]—that is to say, the states of elimination on the paths of training and no more training, the state of nirvana that involves no residual traces, [18] and the dharmakāya of buddhahood as defined in the Mahāyāna approach. This is also referred to as the fruition state—the transcendence of sorrow (which is to say, suffering and the causes thereof) [19]—imbued with the seven attributes of peace and negating the four kinds of impermanence.

The truth of the path is characterized as the means by which that cessation is made fully evident, which constitutes incorruptible timeless awareness and its attendant factors—[4a] that is, the three paths of seeing, meditation, and no more training or (in the Mahāyāna context) the two paths of seeing and meditation. The attendant factors are the two paths of accumulation and linkage. [20]
The aspect of the Dharma as scripture is characterized as the descriptions that allow one to gain access to the aspect of Dharma as realization—that is, the twelve branches of the Buddha’s excellent speech, [21] which are appropriate causes that bring about realization of the true nature of reality.
In this regard, there are also the two aspects of the Dharma as it is practiced and the Dharma as it is explained. Of these, the former is endowed with four excellent qualities that allow the fruition state to be attained. These four excellent qualities are as follows:
• It does not entail any factors of compulsion or perpetuation, for it leads to the citadel of nirvana and does not lead to that of samsara.
• It is uninterrupted, for it connects one to nirvana without obstacles and with a continuity that is unchanging.
• It causes no harm, for it is not affected by the thieving effects of desire and attachment and so forth.
• It reveals itself in an intimate way, for it is fueled by the food of one’s delight in the Dharma.
As for the Dharma as it is explained, it is endowed with four functions that elucidate the factors of the spiritual path, for it demonstrates
• what is attended to (“This is the path”);
• what brings certainty about this (“This is indeed the path, while anything else is not”);
• what elucidates the requirements for this (“These factors, such as the four applications of mindfulness, are the causes of the path”); and
• the utter pacification of obscurations (“The obscurations of karma, afflictive states, and obstacles to longevity cause hindrances on the path”).

Concerning the Dharma as it is explained, a text states:
All the teachings of Dharma are subsumed in two categories, the Buddha’s words and the treatises—
respectively, what was spoken in an excellent manner and the commentaries on the intent of that.
Due to the power of these, the teachings of Śākyamuni will endure for a long time in this world.[22]
This is a reference to the two divisions of (1) what was “spoken in an excellent manner” in some ten ways[23] and (2) the treatises that comment on the enlightened intent of the former.

As for the first of these divisions, the Buddha’s words are concerned with both what is forever meaningful in the greatest sense and what is connected to the accomplishment of that meaning. Their function is to eliminate all the limitless afflictive mental states associated with the three realms of existence. They set forth the benefits and advantages of the fruition state of peace—that is, nirvana, the transcendence of sorrow. [4b] They derive from the enlightened deeds of buddhahood as their governing condition.[24]
They may be classified as follows:[25]
• According to the chronological order in which the Buddha spoke them, there are three cycles: the initial, the intermediate, and the final.[26]
• From the perspective of their subject matter, they concern the two levels of truth.[27]
• From that of their presentation, there are the twelve branches of the Buddha’s sublime speech.
• In accord with the categories that are associated with the antidotes they discuss—that is, the factors to be eliminated, those to be adopted, and those to be understood—there are the Three Collections.[28]
• From the perspective of the greater or lesser capacity of those who are to be guided by these teachings, there are the two approaches of the Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna, the latter further consisting of the dialectical approach (in which the path is based on causes) and the mantra approach (in which the path is based on the fruition).
• Again from the point of view of the governing conditions, there are the words of the Buddha that were communicated directly, those that came about through blessings, and those that came about through permission being granted.[29]
Given the foregoing categories, in this great Treasury are found teachings that cover the entire meaning of what is to be put into practice according to all three cycles of teachings, with emphasis on the ultimate level of truth, a focus on the category of the most extensive teachings, and a presentation most especially of the higher trainings in mind[30] and meditative absorption. They explain solely the Mahāyāna, particularly the Mantrayāna approach within that, and are based on vajra verses and other such sources that were communicated directly.

As for the treatises, the authors were those whose minds were undistracted by afflictive mental states and who explained the meaning of the Buddha’s teaching according to its vastness and profundity, so that their writings were in accord with the path that brings about the attainment of liberation. These treatises correct the ongoing experience of those who hear their teachings, turning them away from the three mental poisons and imbuing them with the three higher trainings, thus protecting them from lower states of rebirth and the suffering of conditioned existence.[31]
While there are many ways to categorize such treatises, they are described in the Categories of the Levels in nine ways according to superior and inferior kinds of writings:
Buddhist śāstras are held to be devoid of these six flaws and to have these three positive qualities.[32]
That is to say, they are devoid of six flaws found in inferior kinds of treatises, instead being endowed with meaning, being concerned with the elimination of suffering, and placing great emphasis on spiritual practice. It is with these three kinds of sublime and authentic treatises that this Treasury is filled.
In particular, the Mantrayāna approach was taught by the sambhogakāya, endowed with the seven attributes of integration[33] or (in certain cases) the sublime nirmāṇakāya.[34] In a few cases, teachings came about through blessings or through permission being granted. [5a] In such ways the wheel of Dharma was turned uninterruptedly for those to be guided—masters of awareness and hosts of ḍākas and yoginīs—in places that appeared to be different, through the echolike quality of all sound in its ineffable nature.

In the case of the anuttarayoga tantras, these were taught in an environment that transcends the scope of ordinary conceptual frameworks and characteristics: the “basic space of phenomena,” the “unchanging ultimate abode,” the “source of phenomena,” the “palace of supreme liberation,” the “immeasurable mansion of supreme and inconceivable bliss,” the “bhaga of the Vajra Queen,” and so forth. According to more relative interpretations, some were taught in such locations as Akaniṣṭha,[35] Tuṣita,[36] the summit of Sumeru, and the stupa of Śrīdhānyakaṭaka.[37] In these environments the original buddha arose in the form of the central deity of a specific mandala—as Vajradhara, Kālacakra, and so forth—so that the natural dynamic expression of timeless awareness was that of the inseparability of teacher and retinue in the nature of being as the single state of supreme bliss. This caused the turning of the wheel of Dharma to manifest within that context as a constant process without interruption through the supreme secret of the indestructible resonance of vajra sound. These teachings were collected by Guhyapati,[38] Vajragarbha, and others of the retinues (though in no way other than the teachers), so that at least a portion of them became accessible to fortunate people in the human realm. This entire vast range of the classes of tantra was elucidated in commentaries authored by powerful lords of the tenth level of realization and accomplished masters, and in the holy country of India and other regions many people of the highest acumen pursued the practice of these teachings and gained high levels of accomplishment, in turn conferring the profound meaning of the classes of tantra as advice to fortunate individuals who were to be guided. These instructions were transmitted from sublime incarnate scholars and translators over successive generations, so that they came to this land[39] at the invitation of our merit. In the land of Tibet, furthermore, there were great and holy beings who were exemplars of the excellent speech of the Victorious One and who had perceived the true nature of reality just as it is. This great Treasury brings together in a single collection much wealth that constitutes the precious and profound instructions from the majority of the most famous of these masters.

In the case of the Early Translation school of the Nyingma tradition in particular, there are three lineages:
• the lineage of the mind-to-mind transmission by victorious ones, in which the timeless awareness of the three kāyas of the teacher arises as its own natural manifestation; [5b]
• the lineage of transmission through symbols by masters of awareness (Garap Dorje, the five exalted masters of holy heritage, and others), in which the entire meaning of the teachings was completely absorbed simply through the use of something symbolic; and
• the lineage of oral transmission by human individuals, in which teachings were transmitted through speech from one person to the ear of another, in cases such as that of the king Jaḥ.
Due to the uninterrupted transmission through these three lineages, this collection contains the quintessence of the profound meaning found in the instructions of the categories of Mind, Expanse, and Direct Transmission in the ati approach (the pinnacle of the three great approaches based on skillful method that bring mastery),[40] as well as such texts as the instruction manual for the Vajrasattva cycle Web of Magical Display from the mahāyoga approach.
Concerning such precious teachings, the master Vasubandhu stated:
It is this and this alone that is to be upheld, discussed, and put into practice.[41]
That is to say, those aspects of the sacred Dharma that constitute the scriptural tradition must be upheld through the activities of explaining, listening to, studying, and contemplating them; while those aspects of the sacred Dharma that constitute the experientially based tradition must be upheld through applying training in one’s ongoing experience, practicing and meditating on their meaning.

In the holy country of India, it was the great monastic communities and such figures as the “six ornaments who adorn the human world,”[42] the “four great ones,” the “two superb masters,”[43] the “six learned gatekeepers,” and the successive abbots of Vajrāsana, who primarily guarded the scriptural tradition through the three activities of explaining teachings, debating, and composing commentaries. And it was the countless masters who appeared—as exemplified by the eighty-four mahāsiddhās, such as the venerable master Paramaśva; the Great Brahmin and his spiritual son; the three masters Lūipāda, Ghaṇṭapāda, and Kṛṣṇapāda; Kālacakrapāda the Elder and Younger; and Tilopa[44]—who primarily upheld the experientially based tradition through spiritual practice.
In this land of Tibet, moreover, the teachings of the Victorious One were guarded by the ten great pillars upholding the lineages of exegesis[45] emphasizing the profound path of the theoretical underpinnings of the teachings, and those who held the lineages of the eight great mainstream lineages of accomplishment emphasizing that of the practical application.

In general, let us consider the case of any individuals who have experienced a sense of disenchantment with the sufferings of samsara and who seek liberation from these as their goal, following the precious teachings of the Buddha and pursuing the stages of practice of the sacred Dharma.[6a] At the outset, they must rely on a mentor, who is the foundation of the spiritual path. According to the Compendium:[46]
“The teachings of the Buddhadharma depend on spiritual mentors”:
the Victorious One spoke of them as being endowed with the most sublime of all qualities.
This and other sources refer to the qualifications of a master, a spiritual mentor who is validated as such through countless reasons supported by both scripture and reasoning. There are so many such qualifications, depending on the specific contexts of higher and lower approaches, that it would be difficult to reach a point where they had been explained adequately. However, the factors that are indispensable are three: (1) intelligence based on wisdom, (2) an attitude of loving-kindness, and (3) forbearance in one’s actions. That is to say:
[1.] The qualities of wisdom are those of one being learned concerning the words of the teachings to be explained and the meaning of those words, being able to resolve others’ doubts, presenting one’s discussions in an elegant fashion, being worthy of honor due to one’s virtuous conduct, and being wise concerning the appropriate conduct or the qualifications of the recipients of teachings.
[2.] Ideally, one would have compassion that is not mere lip service but constitutes the desire to bring all ordinary beings to the state of supreme enlightenment. On a middling level, one would have the altruistic attitude of wishing to bring those who are guided by one’s teachings to the level of buddhahood. At the very least, one must definitely have the compassion to explain the teachings without regard for material gain, but with the intention that constitutes the desire that others who receive the teachings understand the meaning of what is explained precisely and benefit thereby; for without the latter one will commit the flaw of selling the Dharma.
[3.] As well, one must certainly have the forbearance not to be discouraged by difficulties encountered when explaining the teachings, the forbearance to entertain questions from students, and the forbearance to be challenged by others and be able to answer their objections.

In this collection, The Treasury of Precious Instructions, with the foregoing being taken to be the minimum requirements, one must in addition be engaged in the three levels of ordination, understand the words and meanings of the teachings to be explained, and have undertaken practice of the main points of the instructions concerned, so that one has gained some degree of personal experience.
Although there are many discussions of the characteristics of a student, principally this should be someone who does not rely on fame and profit in this lifetime, is not competitive with others, and is not simply interested in “collecting” teachings by requesting and receiving anything and everything. Rather, he or she should be someone who strives wholeheartedly for liberation, whose mind is stable in the three aspects of faith that are the foundation of all positive factors, [6b] and who puts into practice the teachings he or she has heard as much as possible in accord with his or her level of understanding. Once the interdependence between mentor and student has been established, the latter relies on the former in the appropriate manner, pleasing the teacher to whichever of the three degrees one is capable of ensuring.
Then, as the Treasury of Abhidharma states:
Maintaining discipline and endowed with study and contemplation, one applies oneself intensively to meditation.[47]
That is to say, as a basis for the development of positive qualities, one accepts whatever level of training in ethical discipline one is capable of and upholds that in the appropriate manner. It is of course the case that the more one can study the excellent teachings of the Victorious One, the better. But in particular one should study in detail the stages on the paths of the three spiritual models, which are an infallible path to integrate one’s mind with the sacred Dharma, one that involves no regression.
If the meaning of what one has heard is merely left as a superficial understanding based on a single exposure, it will have no impact on one’s ongoing experience, so investigate it in detail, reflecting on it over and over. This will ensure that one’s fixation on the perceptions and consciousness associated with this lifetime will be undermined on a deep level, giving rise to a truly extraordinary intention to strive for the definitive excellence of enlightenment in the future.

All this being the case, if we examine the majority of activities in which we ourselves and others engage, presumptuously assuming these to be spiritual practice, they prove to be cases of dharma as theory, dharma as a means of livelihood, dharma as a hobby, dharma as a way of decorating one’s life. Know that these not only are of no benefit for our future lifetimes, they can even cause harm. This will arouse a sense of enthusiasm to pursue meditation and spiritual practice of dharma in the true sense. As the exalted Nāgārjuna says:
Hearing teachings is what causes one’s intelligence to expand;
if one also contemplates, with both of these factors
one can then apply oneself intensively to meditation. Unsurpassable attainment comes from that.
Generally speaking, there are two kinds of individuals who apply themselves to spiritual practice that focuses on what is profoundly meaningful. For those fortunate ones who have already trained, it is appropriate to teach the profound path all at once. Those who lack the good fortune to practice focusing on the profound meaning at the outset, or those who are beginning practitioners, should proceed like someone climbing a flight of stairs, so it would be best to instruct them in the stages of the paths of the three spiritual models. In Lamp That Integrates Conduct we read the following:
In order for ordinary beings who are beginning practitioners [7a] to embrace what is ultimately meaningful,
these means were classified by the perfect Buddha like successive steps in a flight of stairs.
And according to the Two Sections, in consideration of those who are lacking in good fortune and difficult to guide:
At the outset, confer the ordination for spiritual renewal and training.
In such sources, there are extensive treatments of this developmental process of engagement. In addition, as is stated in the earlier and later editions of the Primer:
The greatest medicine for one who proceeds in stages would be poison for one who proceeds all at once.
The greatest medicine for one who proceeds all at once would be poison for one who proceeds in stages.
Therefore, for those with the carryover from previous training, one should present the mode to proceed all at once.
For beings who are beginning practitioners,
one should present the mode to proceed by stages.

With respect to one’s receiving the transmissions of this collection, The Treasury of Precious Instructions, in general each of the traditions of the eight mainstream lineages of accomplishment is, in and of itself, a special and profound path and the complete range of stages in the attainment of enlightenment. Thus, in accord with each person’s interest and mental ability, whatever one might desire in the way of instruction is available in each of these traditions, whether the complete transmission or selected stages. And so this collection is entirely sufficient, even though the maturing empowerments and liberating instructions constitute extractions from these traditions. And although in the case of major systems of instructions there is no way that these can be imparted before the maturing process of empowerment has taken place, one should make the distinction that in certain cases—such as teachings on the graduated path and minor instructions—the conferral of an empowerment is not necessary.
On occasions when the entire collection is being transmitted and received, the way the volumes are organized is chronological, according to the earlier and later historical periods during which these profound teachings came to Tibet. But when the transmission is being given, it must be in accord with the developmental stages of the teachings, and so the transmission begins with the Kadampa teachings on the graduated path. Following the completion of the Dorje Sumgyi Nyendrup teachings, the maturing empowerments and liberating instructions for the three categories of the Great Perfection approach are conferred. Other, more minor instructions are transmitted intermittently where convenient. It would be excellent if the instructions on longevity practice were used to bring everything to a positive conclusion.

In this regard, if there are students who are householders and, as such, hold no ordination, some form of ordination from the Individual Liberation system—such as lay ordination, or whatever they are capable of upholding— is conferred. [7b] As the initial part of the instruction in the superior spiritual model, the ordination ceremony for arousing bodhicitta is performed, from both the lineage of profound view and that of extensive conduct. As a preliminary to each of the major systems of instruction, the empowerment is conferred in accord with the respective tradition’s way of carrying this out. Instructions that require a specific number of days, such as that of Parting from the Four Attachments, are transmitted in that way.
The 108 Instructions of Jetsun Kunga Drolchok[48] must be taken as the foundation of the entire collection in general, and so before any of these transmissions the preliminary practices of these instructions and the meditation and mantra repetition of Samayavajra are explained, and during the evening session everyone participates in that meditation and mantra. For the actual transmissions, it is my lord guru’s method to confer them each in three versions: a brief presentation, an extensive explanation, and a concluding summary. So, the lineage supplication is recited at the outset in each case, the history of the specific instruction is related, and a mandala offering is performed. The teachings that are contained in the 108 Instructions are identified separately and read once, which constitutes the brief presentation. Next, the source text of the respective instruction is explained extensively. Then the 108 Instructions are transmitted once again as a series, which constitutes the concluding summary.

But in fact the order in which these are given need not necessarily be the one that is found in the text of the 108 Instructions. This can be illustrated by the fact that it would be, for example, fine to confer, in conjunction with the teachings on the graduated path, those instructions that are akin to those teachings, or the instructions on the view of the Middle Way. So the instructions that pertain to the sutra tradition can be given in conjunction with the teachings on the graduated path; those that pertain to specific mainstream traditions can be added to the transmissions of those respective traditions. As for those instructions on the stage of completion for the classes of tantra that are not included in the foregoing case, it would be fine to give them in conjunction with the Kagyu transmissions. As this indicates, one can include within the transmission of a given lineage any instructions that share some affinity with the authentic origins of that lineage, in whatever way is convenient. Once the instructions have been transmitted in their entirety, it would be ideal if one were to add the reading transmission for the text of the 108 Instructions.
As is stated in the sutra White Lotus of the Sacred Dharma, in any situation in which teachings are being transmitted and received, the preparation involves arranging offerings on the shrine, offering prayers of supplication to the Jewels, repeating mantras to put an end to negative influences, and imbuing oneself with love for the audience. Especially in cases of transmitting tantric instructions, when they are being explained it is unsuitable to transmit or receive them with ordinary ideas, so one should never lose the clear impression of the universe being a pure mandala, of the one explaining the teachings being a master of the tantras, and so forth.

During the actual transmission, one explains the teaching while embodying the six transcendent perfections. In conclusion, one prays for forgiveness of one’s errors, dedicates the virtue to the enlightenment of all, and applies the perspective of a nonconceptual state of awareness. Those hearing the teachings avoid the three flaws of a vessel, the six distortions, anything inappropriate to the activity at hand, the five flaws of incorrect retention, and so forth. With the intelligence that allows one to gain understanding, the determination to seek teachings, devotion that is devoid of pride, and one-pointed faith, they prepare by imbuing themselves with the intention to practice the teachings, engaging in conduct that expresses devotion through the three avenues of their being, and taking joy in ensuring the circumstances for them to hear the Dharma. During the actual transmission, they listen while embodying the six transcendent perfections. In conclusion, they pray for forgiveness of their errors, dedicate the virtue to the enlightenment of all, and pay homage as a thanksgiving gesture. One should act in accord with the foregoing explanations.

Generally speaking, in each of the eight great mainstream lineages of accomplishment there exists such a profound and vast range of authentic sources from the sutra and tantra traditions, and such limitless cycles of scriptures and pith instructions, that no one could compile everything. And in such cases as that of the Early Translation school (with the empowerments for the peaceful and wrathful deities and the explanations of the tantra Web of Magical Display, which is the foundation of the mahāyoga approach, and the empowerment for the Discourse of the Gathering of the anuyoga approach); of the six main scriptural sources of the Kadampa; of the “explanation to the multitude” from the Lamdre tradition; and of the teachings on Mahāmudrā and the Six Dharmas from the Dakpo tradition—in such cases, even nowdays the institutions for the transmitting and receiving of these teachings that are entirely self-sufficient are widespread and flourishing, so that one certainly need have no concern for these traditions.
There are, however, special auxiliary teachings in the foregoing traditions—instructions and ancient texts—that are rare, with barely a continuous line of the reading transmission still extant, as well as the traditions of the Shangpa, the Zhije, the Nyendrup, and so forth, in which the lines of transmission are exceedingly rare and in danger of dying out. With an altruistic desire to benefit these lines of teachings and with great diligence, I have sought out the three components of empowerments, reading transmissions, and instructions for them and compiled them so that all this will prove to be of use.
As well, in the foregoing cases I have not had to rely solely on extensive lineages that are like rotting strands of old rope on the point of breaking. My lord guru, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, received seven great modes of personal transmission. [8b] The first of these modes involved him making enormous efforts to receive the extensive transmissions of the eight great mainstream lineages of accomplishment, which he did to a consummate degree; the accounts of how he received individual direct lineages through these modes of transmission are clearly described in a separate text. I supplicated him again and again concerning all the transmissions I had not received previously, and with great delight he bestowed these on me like one vase filling another. And that was not all, for he did me the great honor of granting me a quite extraordinary authorization, formally appointing me as a master who could explain, write about, and practice these teachings. Even regarding most of the transmissions that I had previously received, I nevertheless persistently requested these from him for the purpose of receiving them as direct lineages of his blessings. So my own enthusiasm for assembling this great collection of advice—which is like a wish-fulfilling gem, flawless and yielding all that is desirable just as one wishes—has been
firmly rooted in me, and I feel this is also a way of fulfilling the enlightened intentions of my gurus and those of the lineages involved.

Let me speak briefly about the benefits and advantages of this undertaking. Generally speaking, there are enormous benefits and advantages to listening to or explaining the sacred Dharma. As we read in the compilation of teachings on the bodhisattva approach:
Through hearing teachings, one comes to understand phenomena. Through hearing teachings, one turns away from harmful actions.
Through hearing teachings, one abstains from what is meaningless.
Through hearing teachings, one attains nirvana.
As well, the master Vasubandhu illustrated the benefits and advantages of hearing teachings in three groups of five points, employing analogies. There are a great many such benefits and advantages to hearing teachings.
As for the benefits and advantages of explaining teachings, in the sutras we read the following:
One who, in order to benefit someone, presents my teachings in the appropriate manner shows me honor;
the Victorious One is not shown honor with flowers, perfumes, or lamps.
Such passages show that this is the unsurpassable offering one can make to the Buddha. Further, the sutra Maitreya, the Lion’s Roar states:
Some may fill the world with as much gold
as there are grains of sand in the Ganges and give it generously, but to speak a single verse of teachings in these evil times holds so much more benefit than that.
This and other sources indicate that explaining the teachings is far superior to any other generosity on the material level, and thus it is of the most sublime benefit.
Through generosity of the dharma, one recalls former lifetimes. [9a]
Such citations state that explaining the teachings serves as a cause for gaining the powers of complete recall and deeper discernment. The sutra Discourse That Arouses Altruistic Intent discusses some twenty benefits and advantages to being generous with the dharma without regard for material gain; as this indicates, one’s merit thus flourishes and one will attain enlightenment.

Both explaining and listening to teachings stabilize the spiritual potential of those in the three approaches, bring one erudition that others respect, uphold the teachings, and bring about the attainment of enlightenment—the benefits and advantages are truly inconceivable! The Demonstration of the Secret of the Tathāgatas states:
As for the merit of upholding the sacred Dharma, even if all buddhas spoke continuously
about this for a million aeons,
they would indeed never describe it entirely.
And in the sutra Discourse Requested by Sagaramati we read:
To uphold the sacred Dharma of the tathāgatas
is to be completely upheld by the victorious ones;
it is to be completely cared for by gods, nāgas, and kiṃnaras and completely imbued with merit and timeless awareness. . . .
through joy and mental bliss one becomes enlightened, awakening to buddhahood.
These and other such sources speak of immeasurable benefits and advantages.
The benefits and advantages of explaining or listening to the dharma of the Mahāyāna approach are even greater still. In the context of the ground state, the Prajñāpāramitā literature speaks of these activities outshining all that pertains to the Hīnayāna approach, nurturing the potential that is the fundamental constituent of our being, and so forth. In the context of the spiritual path, the Highest Continuum speaks of them eliminating all obscurations without exception and ensuring merit far greater than any other activity. And in the context of the fruition state, the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sutras explains that they make evident the state of omniscience.
In particular, it is said that there are immeasurable benefits and advantages to upholding the sacred Dharma in such times as the present day, when the teachings of the Victorious One are close to disappearing. To cite from the sutra Discourse of the One Known as the Exalted Avalokiteśvara:

Those who henceforth uphold this sutra will forever be my beloved children.
Although a million buddhas praise them, [9b] they will never be finished with that praise. . . .
More than those who show honor to thousands of buddhas (or even to hundreds of millions)
for as many aeons as there are grains of sand in the Ganges,
someone who, when the sacred Dharma spoken by the Lord of the World
is disappearing, upholds it day and night has far greater merit. . . .
By upholding the Dharma of the sublime Victorious One when it is disappearing,
one gains a very fine body, lovely to behold; is beloved of men and women and gods;
and is happy, learned, praiseworthy, and possessed of intelligence.
In whoever’s presence the divine of the divine, the Teacher endowed with ten powers,
thoroughly explained this sutra,
such a sutra as this will, in the future, come into that person’s hands.

Furthermore, as we read in Spiritual Categories of the Supreme Amassing of the Rare and Sublime:
In this regard, Śāriputra, having embarked authentically on the Mahāyāna approach, once one has perceived such intolerable, such unworthy circumstances, under which the sacred Dharma is utterly disappearing, one arouses the force of a great diligence in the following way:
One thoroughly listens to sutras such as this one, to teachings in the categories found in the collections of teachings on the bodhisattva approach. One memorizes them, one commits them to writing, one ensures that others understand them, and one teaches them on a vast scale, in an utterly authentic manner.
Moreover, one gives rise to four ideas. What are these four? “This body of teachings that I have, which I inherited from my forefathers, will utterly disappear. Since Śākyamuni, the Transcendent and Accomplished Conqueror, the Tathāgata, the arhat, the samyaksaṃbuddha, engaged in austerities for hundreds of thousands of millions of aeons for the sake of these teachings, therefore I will ensure that the teachings are not altered. I will thoroughly master them. I will uphold them. I will ensure that they do not come to naught!”
One thus arouses one’s diligence in the following way: [10a] Śāriputra, say for example that someone had a child, and that child—beloved, lovely, attractive, and in no way at odds with that person—were about to fall over a great precipice. That person would seize the child by the hand with the fixed thought, the utterly fixed thought, “May this being not fall into this hellish abyss!”
In a similar manner, Śāriputra, those holy beings who have faith in me, who would absolutely never forsake this unsurpassable Jewel of the Dharma, and who hope to attain nirvana, in those times they completely uphold the sacred Dharma, and so to them I entrust this sublime state of enlightenment.

It is thus. O Śāriputra, suppose for example that, in the midst of a great battle, for the sake of protecting many people, those who arrange themselves in front of the opposing forces turn out to be few; and furthermore, that those whose courage proves worthy of the challenge and who will emerge victorious in battle arrange themselves during that great and terrible battle in front of many people. Similarly, Śāriputra, at the point that the sacred Dharma is extremely close to disappearing, whosoever with altruistic intent desires to attain complete nirvana, and so dons their strong armor with stable courage and diligence, arouses the force of that great diligence and emerges victorious in the battle with the māras. They thus realize to at least some small degree the vital essence of such a Jewel as that of the Dharma.
Why is this so? Śāriputra, not to rejoice in the complete rejection of even a four-line verse of teaching, but to proclaim to many people “This Buddha explained this” and to help them understand it is to rejoice in what is explained in an excellent manner by the buddhas, the transcendent and accomplished conquerors of the past, the present, and the future. O Śāriputra, I would not say, “The consequences of the merit of such individuals is small.” [10b] Rather, they are endowed with an amassing of merit that is equal to space in its extent.
Why is this so? Śāriputra, such holy beings as these are rare. They can be called sublime beings. They can be called ideal beings. They can be called courageous beings. They can be called great beings. They are on the side of the Dharma of the tathāgatas. Do not speak against them or interfere with them. They are to be afforded most special honor. O Śāriputra, until death one should afford them most special honor. Until death one should completely uphold the sacred Dharma. Until death one should have a devoted interest in emptiness.

Śāriputra, if one has the four foregoing qualities, at that point, at that time—a time when the sacred Dharma is utterly disappearing, a time when the sacred dharma is on the wane, a time when many pervert the ethical standards, a time when many harken to the furtive words of rank materialists, a time when the age is degenerating, a time when beings are degenerating, a time when longevity is degenerating, a time when afflictive mental states are degenerating, a time when belief systems are degenerating—one should abide in these qualities throughout the three times. One should continue to pacify conflict thoroughly. One should not become separated from the enlightenment of buddhahood. Śāriputra, one should abide completely like this throughout the three times!
To quote again from the sutra Discourse Requested by Sagaramati:
To uphold the sacred Dharma of the tathāgatas is to repay the kindness shown by the tathāgatas.
To uphold the treasury of the victorious ones and be stable in that intent is to make offerings to buddhas in the ten directions.
One could fill with jewels many realms seen by the eyes of the buddhas
and offer these to the tathāgatas,
but at the point that these were exhausted, the amassing of one’s merit
would not have increased as it does by one’s upholding the Dharma. . . .
Although the qualities and benefits and advantages of these actions might be described by speaking without interruption for an aeon, one could never completely finish describing
the benefits and advantages of upholding the sacred Dharma.
As these and other passages indicate, this issue is spoken of on a vast scale. [11a]

Compared to the foregoing cases, the benefits and advantages of transmitting, receiving, meditating on, and practicing the unsurpassable teachings, both general and specific, of the Vajrayāna, the secret mantra approach, are significantly greater—many hundreds and thousands of times greater. For it is even rarer for the Vajrayāna to appear than for a buddha to do so. It is due only to the strength of our Teacher’s special resolve to guide beings who were not being guided in these times of strife that these teachings appeared. Otherwise, as it is said, they have not appeared, are not appearing, and will not appear in the teachings of all buddhas of the three times. This being the case, it is stated extensively throughout the classes of tantras that, for example, those who write out the profound tantras, or carry them on their person, or read them, and who meditate on their meaning are gazing on the vajra state of enlightenment itself. To give one example, from the tantra Heaped Jewels of the Early Translation school:
Therefore, people who uphold this secret tantra
gain empowerment into their respective families. Merely by carrying this tantra on one’s person, one becomes an emanation of Vajradhara.
All who read this tantra
have the entire meaning of the view arise in their minds.
All who write it out
enjoy the enlightened speech of all buddhas.[49] And from the Supreme Array of Ati:
If one makes offerings to, praises, and shows honor to this unsurpassable and most excellent secret,
both sublime and more ordinary attainments will come to one just as one wishes.
By merely carrying it on one’s person,
one possesses the oral transmission and pith instructions.
And that is not all. To have even the slightest physical contact with advanced practitioners who apply the meaning of the words of the tantras— such as seeing their faces, hearing their speech, or being touched by their hands or feet—purifies one instantly of all the effects of harmful actions amassed in the past, so that before very long one attains the state of a heruka. This situation is discussed in the source tantra of Cakrasaṃvara:

Through seeing, touching, hearing, and recalling,
one becomes freed of all effects of harmful action, right then and there, without doubt. [11b]
The supreme and timeless awareness of the glorious heruka has all the attributes of total purity.
It is the water of bliss for the practitioner. Nondual, it is nonduality itself.
Contact with one who is engaged in nonduality
is purifying, overcoming the effects of harmful actions.
Through contact or speech,
one becomes free of all effects of harmful actions.
With this freedom from all effects of harmful actions, one’s body is pure and without flaw.
One is a sublime person who is completely refined.
One attains the level of a tathāgata
who is completely pure of all effects of harmful actions.
Completely free of all effects of harmful actions,
one is born into the family of the tathāgatas
and becomes a monarch who possesses spiritual values.
The reasoning behind these statements is thus: It is said that those yogins who pursue practice are constantly being blessed by the glorious heruka, while all ḍākas and ḍākinīs—such as Heruka and Vajravārāhī—are actually present in their heart centers, engaging passionately in union with them in a state of delight and love. They therefore are born simultaneously with those yogins, so that beings who forge any connection with them—through seeing, hearing, thinking of, or touching them—amass enormous merit thereby. The same source states:
There is no doubt that one is constantly engaged in play with the great hero.
In the heart center dwells Vārāhī.
One abides in union with me
and with ḍākas and ḍākinīs and heralds.
Beings gain merit by seeing
anyone who is truly born with these.

Having studied and contemplated any sutra or tantra, in the final analysis one must integrate that by applying oneself to meditation and spiritual practice. For if one becomes distracted by merely talking about the teachings, not only will there be no meaningful result, but as the sutra Discourse Exhorting One to Altruism points out, there are a great many flaws in taking delight in such talk. And if one does not meditate on the authentic nature of reality, even though one were to embrace the teachings of the Buddha and hear and contemplate the sacred Dharma on the level of mere words, no matter how much one did so this would produce only a temporary result; [12a] one would not gain the consummate state of total freedom. This fact is spoken of using numerous analogies as, for example, in the following passage from the Array of Stems:
These teachings of the perfect Buddha
are not realized through one’s simply hearing them. To give an analogy, in certain cases a mighty river can carry off those who are weak
while others die of thirst;
the situation is similar when one does not meditate on the Dharma.
One might give food and drink to many beings
but die of hunger oneself;
the situation is similar when one does not meditate on the Dharma.
Certain physicians
may possess all medicines
but still die of some virulent disease;
the situation is similar when one does not meditate on the Dharma.
In treasure houses of riches
there may be great numbers of jewels to be counted but not even a single gem that one may own;
the situation is similar when one does not meditate on the Dharma.
One might be reborn in the court of a monarch’s palace that is endowed with all pleasures
yet not receive food and drink oneself;
the situation is similar when one does not meditate on the Dharma.
A blind artist, when selling a painting,
might be questioned about it
but be the one who cannot see it;
the situation is similar when one does not meditate on the Dharma.
A ferryman might convey many people across a great body of water
but still die that night;
the situation is similar when one does not meditate on the Dharma.
One might stand at the crossroads
and proclaim to everyone what is excellent yet still not obtain it oneself;
the situation is similar when one does not meditate on the Dharma.

In addition, if one does not meditate, one’s mind can fall under the sway of afflictive mental states, and one will fall into a lower state of rebirth, as we read in the sutra Discourse on the Complete Display:
If one has not realized the nature of mind, one falls under the influence of the conceptual thought process of ordinary mind and circles through the three realms, wandering into the six states of unenlightened being.
In these and other such passages, this point is discussed extensively in the sutras and śāstras.
The merit of meditating on the authentic nature of reality, however, is incalculable. According to the sutra Discourse Demonstrating Suchness Itself: [12b]
O Śāriputra, greater than the merit of someone who listens to teachings for an entire aeon is that of someone who for the duration of a finger snap cultivates meditative absorption focusing on suchness itself. Given that that is so, Śāriputra, you should strongly advise others about this meditative absorption of suchness itself.
And according to the sutra Discourse of the Great Uṣṇiṣa:
The merit of meditating for a single day on the significance of the true nature of phenomena is greater than that of hearing and contemplating teachings for many aeons. Why is this so?
Because it ensures that one is separated by a great distance from the path of birth and death.
And the sutra Discourse on Expanding One’s Realization states: If one engages in a single session of meditative stability,
this is more meaningful than if one were to save the lives
of as many people as would fill the three realms.
Furthermore, it is said that cultivating meditative absorption undermines one’s fixation on sense pleasures, resolves issues on which one is indecisive, arouses powers of deeper discernment and absorption, awakens supreme compassion, brings insight into the significance of the authentic nature of reality, ensures that one is capable of bringing those to be guided to enlightenment, and so forth. To cite from the sutra the Compendium:
Through meditative stability, one downplays and casts aside sense pleasures.
Once actually gains spiritual potential, powers of deeper discernment, and meditative absorption.
And according to the Ten Cycles of Kṣitigarbha:
By cultivating meditative absorption, one resolves doubts,
but without that realization, one cannot do so by other means.
Therefore, since the cultivation of meditative absorption is most excellent,
the wise will pursue it intently.

In the Authentic Consolidation of Qualities we read the following:
By resting the mind in equipoise, one will gain insight into the authentic nature just as it is. It is through seeing the authentic nature just as it is that bodhisattvas embrace a supreme compassion toward beings.
And as is stated in the Ornament of the Sutras:
It is through meditative stability, moreover, that all beings are brought to the three degrees of enlightenment.[50]
Given that all the profound teachings that are imbued with such great significance are included in this great Treasury, [13a] if those gifted with intelligence will protect the continuity of their transmission by putting them into practice themselves and explaining and disseminating them to others, this will ensure something that is enormously meaningful, in both the short term and the long term.
The purpose of the foregoing discussion can be found in Reasoning for a Detailed Explanation:
Once they have seen the great significance of the sutras, those who hear them will feel a devotion
to hearing and upholding them,
so at the outset the purpose should be discussed.

To discuss in a concise way the manner in which these teachings developed in the holy country of India and in Tibet, in general there seem to have been many lines of transmission, both major and minor, that developed in this Land of Snows as extensive lineages of accomplishment. But a summary of the principal ones, those that constitute the very foundation, consists of those renowned as the eight great mainstream traditions. The great learned and accomplished master Prajñārasmi stated:
As prophesied by the Victorious One, the lord protectors of beings in the Land of Snows,
whose principal intent was solely and entirely concerned with the teachings,
were the rulers who were the unique and divine figures among the spiritual kings of old.
The second Teacher in this land of glacial mountains and the great editor and translator Pagor Bairotsana;
the lay master Dromtön, who maintained the bloodline of the Victorious One;
the great learned and accomplished master Khyungpo Naljorpa; the great guru Drokmi, speaker of two languages;
the venerable Jetsun Marpa, powerful lord among yogins; Dampa of India, who attained the level of a siddha;
Gyijo the translator; and the learned and accomplished Orgyenpa: these eight are the great pillars who upheld lineages of
accomplishment in the northern land.
Deriving in an excellent way from glorious Vajradhara,
these eight great pillars are the lineages of accomplishment in this land of glacial mountains;
they are the legacies of siddhas of the past.
Those who desire liberation follow in the wake of these paths.
That is to say, in the succession of Tibetan rulers were those known as the three ancestral monarchs—magical emanations of the “lords of the three families.” It was due to their superb motivation and enlightened activities that the sun of the Victorious One’s teachings spread its illuminating rays throughout the darkness in the Land of Snows. [13b] The heart essence of these teachings lies in the eight great mainstream lineages of accomplishment, made up of those who upheld the extensive traditions of the Early Translation school of Nyingma, the Kadampa, the Lamdrepa, the Marpa Kagyu, the Shangpa Kagyu, the Zhije and associated teachings, the Jordruk, and the Dorje Sumgyi Nyendrub.

In the case of the first of these, as the manifest aspect of timeless awareness (the primordial lord protector Samantabhadra), the sambhogakāya Vajradhara arose as awareness’s own manifestation. The manifestation of innate compassionate responsiveness as “other” was that of the victorious ones of the five families, who revealed limitless approaches based on skillful methods of empowerment and transformation to bodhisattvas on the ten levels of realization. In the pinnacle realm of Akaniṣṭha in the immaculate abodes, the sambhogakāya appropriate to that realm taught the “approaches that lead away from the all-pervasive origin of suffering” and the “approaches that evoke awareness through ascetic practices.” The Great Perfection teachings were codified by Vajrasattva, those of anuyoga by the master of awareness Kunjara, and those of mahāyoga by Vajradharma and others. These teachings were entrusted to the lords of the three families and to the ḍākinī Lekyi Wangmo and others. Teachers and retinues in these cases abided in the equality of enlightened intent, the dharma being such that there was no sense of someone being taught distinct from someone doing the teaching, but due to its manifesting simply as a mode that derives from the dynamic energy of timeless awareness, there is the “lineage of mind-to-mind transmission of victorious ones.” The atiyoga teachings were transmitted successively to the child of the gods Adhicitta, Garap Dorje, Mañjuśrīmitra, Śrīsiṃha, Vimalamitra, and others.
The teachings of anuyoga and mahāyoga were demonstrated through mere symbols to the lords of the three families, the five exalted masters of holy heritage, and others, whereupon they thoroughly mastered these teachings. This is the “lineage of transmission through symbols by masters of awareness.”
Due to the blessings of the Lord of Secrets, the texts of the eighteen tantras actually fell onto the roof of the palace of the fortunate king Jaḥ, while volumes of the anuyoga teachings fell in a forest on the island of Śrī Laṅkā. The Lord of Secrets revealed himself to King Jaḥ in a vision and conferred empowerment on him. The transmission then passed successively to Kukurāja, Indrabodhi,[51] Siṃharāja, and other human masters of awareness. This is the “lineage of oral transmission by human individuals.”

Thus, through the foregoing threefold lineage, the profound cycles of ati, anu, and so forth were transmitted in the holy country [14a] to a few fortunate individuals, imparted to each as a private teaching without being promulgated further. The rulers, patrons, and teachers involved respected the seal of secrecy entailed and concealed these teachings at Vajrāsana and other places. During the time in which the Buddhist king Trisong Detsen was first causing the teachings of the Victorious One to spread in the land of Tibet, it is explained that there were many stages, but if we summarize the primary ones, they are six in number:
[1.] The second Buddha, Padmākara, in the perceptions of ordinary individuals to be guided, taught simply the text Pith Instructions: The Garland of Views. On extraordinary people of good fortune he bestowed the maturing empowerments and liberating instructions for the three yogas on a profound and vast scale, with the oral lineage of these teachings passing down through uninterrupted lines of siddhas and masters of awareness, such as the traditions of Nyang, Pang, Khön, Nup, Ma, Rongzom, and others. The majority of the cycles of his advice were sealed as hidden treasure teachings (termas) for the sake of future generations of those to be guided.
[2.] The great translator Bairotsana taught such individuals as the twenty-five learned ones from India; in particular, the master of awareness Śrīsiṃha received the profound teachings of the Great Perfection approach on a vast scale and caused these to be promulgated in Tibet as the five stages of the Category of Mind and uninterrupted continuum of the “heard lineage” of the Category of Expanse.
[3.] With the coming of the great scholar Vimalamitra to Tibet, those to whom he gave the cycles of teachings of the Category of Direct Transmission in the Great Perfection approach passed on lineages of continuous teachings as well as those of hidden treasure teachings.
[4.] The great master Sangye Yeshe of the Nup clan received limitless advice—such as that of the great reading transmission of the Discourse of the Gathering, the cycles of Yamāntaka, and so forth—from four masters of India, Nepal, and Gilgit; the oral lineage of the Discourse of the Gathering survives to the present day.
[5.] Namkhai Nyingpo of the Nup clan received the cycle of teachings of the glorious deity Samyak from the master Hūṁkāra and promulgated this, and as well ensured that the teachings of the Vajrayāna approach fell, as is said, “first to Nyak, following that to Nup, and finally to Zur,” such that their lineages of teachings and students became limitless. In particular, during the time of the “three ancestors of Zur,” the way in which the teachings of the secret mantra approach spread in Tibet [14b] was said to rival that of Oḍḍiyāna.
[6.] In future generations, fortunate beings who were emanations of the king and his subjects appeared in succession, bringing forth the profound teachings concealed as hidden treasure from their places of concealment, in accord with the times, so that all beings throughout central Tibet and the surrounding regions were granted unsurpassable benefit and happiness in the short and the long term.

In the case of the Kadampa tradition, the Noble Lord, the glorious Atīśa (who was renowned as being an emanation of the buddha Amitābha and having attained the third level of realization) came to Tibet. There he found that, due to the evil ruler Langdarma’s attempts to eradicate the teachings that had been established by the ancestral spiritual monarchs, the sutra tradition and the Vinaya had been undermined, while the secret mantra approach had become distorted into perverted forms of behavior. In order to ensure that the teachings of the Sage were once again elucidated, Atīśa composed his Lamp on the Path to Enlightenment, a complete overview of the stages on the paths of the three spiritual models that is based on the meaning of what is taught in such sources as the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sutras and the Stages of the Bodhisattva. He emphasized the view of the Middle Way, the conduct of the Vinaya, and the advice concerning the precious awakening attitude of bodhicitta. Atīśa established a system of teaching that allowed a single individual to experience all the words of the Victorious One arising as personal advice for awakening to buddhahood.

The foremost among Atīśa’s students were Khu, Ngok, and Drom,[52] who were emanations of the bodhisattvas of the three families.[53] Of these, Dromtön Gyalwai Jungne (who was Avalokiteśvara in the flesh) had three students who were known as the three brothers. From these three there developed three traditions:
• Putowa Rinchen Sal established the branch of the Kadampa of “those teaching mainstream sources,” that is, those such as Lang and Shar[54] (who were compared to the united sun and moon), who upheld the tradition of teaching six major sources.
• Chenga Tsultrim Bar established the branch of “those teaching advice,” transmitted by such masters as Jayulwa, who taught the four truths as personal advice.
• Puchungwa Zhönu Gyaltsen established the branch of “those teaching pith instructions,” transmitted by such masters as Tapkawa, who conferred the maturing empowerments and liberating instructions for the “sixteen spheres,” as well as the supportive transmission of the precious volumes of secret teachings.
These three branches, as well as the lineage of oral transmission from Naktso, developed extensively, spreading throughout the eastern and central regions of Tibet. In later times the centers that upheld this tradition itself waned somewhat, [15a] but the illuminating activities of the glorious Tsongkhapa Lozang Drakpa, an emanation of Mañjuśrī, in elucidating these teachings once again caused them to spread over the surface of the earth.

As for the tradition of “The Path with the Result,” Vajra Nairātmyā conferred empowerment on the powerful lord of yogins Śrīdharmapāla (“Glorious Protector of the Dharma”)[55] within a mandala that she emanated. The realization of the sixth level became fully evident to him, and he became renowned as the mahāsiddhā Virūpa, or Birwapa.[56] It was he who, relying on the tantra of Hevajra, bestowed the Vajra Lines of the Lamdre teachings for the sake of Kāṇha of the East, on whom he conferred an abridged explanation of the tantra, as well as extensive instructions on the Path with the Result. To Ḍombipa he granted an extensive explanation of the tantra and abridged instructions. From these two the transmissions were passed down through lineages of successive masters of accomplishment. Among the translators in Tibet during the later spread of the teachings were three who served as authentic sources of the secret mantra approach, or Vajrayāna: Mar, Gö, and Drok. One of these, Drokmi Lotsāwa Śākya Yeshe, received a complete range of mainstream sources and advice from Gayadhara and Vīravajra. He also received the “eight later cycles concerning the path,” such as the instructions of the mahāsiddhā Saroruha. In Tibet he conferred these teachings on his students: the seven siddhās, the seven students who received a complete transmission of the primary sources, and the four students who received a complete transmission of the pith instructions.[57]
From these four there developed in the Lamdre tradition three lineages of the sons who were students. Among these, from Sekar Chungwa[58] there further developed three lines through those who received from him an ideal, a middling, and a lesser transmission. The middling transmission was propagated through the Zhamas,[59] from whom some seven traditions developed. The ideal transmission came through Zhangtön Chöbar, from whom Sachen Kunga Nyingpo received it. There were the traditions of the earlier spiritual son Pakmo Drupa and Chegom, and both extensive and more direct lineages came to the later sons.[60] As well, Gyijo Lotsāwa studied with Gayadhara, which led to a lineage succession. 
There came to be what were renowned collectively as the eighteen traditions of Lamdre. From these, the Sakya tradition itself has endured as the most widespread in terms of activity. [15b] With respect to that tradition, moreover, Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo studied with the mahāsiddhā Buddhaśrī, which led to the lineage succession of the Ngor tradition: the “explication for the assembly.”[61] The Dzong tradition of Lamdre is that of Dorje Denpa Kunga Namgyal and is the lineage that came from Ngakchang Zungkyi Palwa. And Tsarchen Losal Gyatso studied with Doring Kunpangpa Chenpo and passed this transmission on to his two heart sons,[62] who were compared to the sun and moon, which led to the lineage of the Tsar tradition: the “explication for disciples.”[63] All of these are still living traditions.

Generally speaking, the great guru Drokmi Lotsāwa received personal transmissions of the exceptional instructions renowned as the “nine cycles of the path.” The first of these, the cycle of the Path with the Result, compiled by the lord of yogins Birwapa, has just been discussed. As for the “eight later cycles concerning the path,” six are concerned with the stage of completion associated with the three cycles of Cakrasaṃvara, Hevajra, and Guhyasamāja, while two are commentaries on the tantra classes in general.
They are:
[1.] Ensuring the Innate State, a text on the stage of completion according to the “commentarial tradition” of Hevajra, authored by Ḍombi Heruka on the basis of the Two Sections;
[2.] Saroruha’s Sādhana, based on the tantra Vajra Pavilion, for which the instructions are those referred to as “like the tip of a candle flame” and those on the nine profound methods of the stage of completion, authored by the master Padmavajra and known as the Hevajra tradition of Saroruha, the Lake-Born One;
[3.] The six mainstream sources of Kṛṣṇa, authored by Kṛṣṇacāryavajra on the basis of the explanatory tantra of Cakrasaṃvara, of which the practical application of the Olapati is “the complete path of caṇḍalī”;
[4.] The pith instruction for “straightening the crooked,” authored by the master Ucitāmara, which is the practical application as a root summary of the Droplet of Spring;
[5.] Commentary on Bodhicitta, authored by the glorious lord protector Ārya Nāgārjuna on the basis of the Guhyasamāja Tantra, the practical application of which is the pith instruction of “achieving a decisive state of mind in the presence of a stupa,” that is, the stage of completion associated with Guhyasamāja Akṣobhya;
[6.] Treatises authored by the great scholar Vāgīśvarakīrti, such as Illuminating the Seven Branches, which emphasizes the enlightened intent of the glorious Guhyasamāja cycle, [16a] the practice of which is the Mahāmudrā without Letters, connected with the tradition of the venerable Jñāna;
[7.] The pith instructions on the “stages of the inconceivable,” authored by the mahāsiddhā Kuddāla, based on the Well-Sealed Locket; and
[8.] Successive Levels of Empowerment, authored by the Buddhist monarch Indrabhūti on the basis of the entire anuttarayoga class of tantras, the practice of which is the “Completion of the Four Seals.”
As well, once Drokmi Lotsāwa had finished his study and training and was preparing to return to Tibet, he established a connection with the six erudite gatekeepers of Vikramaśīla, requesting and receiving an instruction from each, collectively known as the spiritual connections with the six gatekeepers. These and other instructions and reading transmissions have endured without interruption.

With respect to the oral lineage of the lord Marpa, the great and glorious Tilopa established an extensive lineage in receiving individual transmissions from the mahāsiddhās Ārya Nāgārjuna, Ḍombipa, Lūipāda, and Sukhasiddhi; these became the pith instructions associated with his four personal transmissions. He practiced for a long time, training in the realizations associated with the spiritual path, until he became a great and powerful master among siddhās, actually cared for by Vajradhara and Vajrayoginī, who conferred on him the treasury of the four classes of tantra. After the great scholar Nāropa had trained with him, engaging in twelve great hardships, Nāropa gained attainment, mastering the meaning of the teachings in its entirety simply through symbols and words.
Marpa Chökyi Lodrö journeyed to the holy country of India three or four times, studying a limitless range of sutras and tantras with many learned and accomplished masters, Nāropa and Maitrīpa foremost among them. In particular, during his earlier and later journeys, he spent a total of sixteen years and seven months with Nāropa alone, integrating study, contemplation, and meditation so that he came to dwell in a state of attainment. On the occasion of Marpa’s final journey, Nāropa had already entered into a phase of advanced tantric conduct, so Marpa sought him out by undergoing great hardship and supplicating him. He actually met Nāropa at Puṣpahari in northern India and spent seven months with him while Nāropa conferred on Marpa the complete transmission of the oral lineage of the masculine and feminine aspects of Cakrasaṃvara. [16b]
In Tibet, the foremost among the students on whom Marpa bestowed profound teachings were known as the four great pillars. From among these, three—Me, Ngok, and Tsur—received the personal transmission of the lineage of exegesis, while the venerable Milarepa received that of the lineage of accomplishment. Among the many students of Mila, including the “seven who ascended to Khecara” and the “eight cotton-clad brethren,” one of the foremost was his heart son Rechung Dorje Drakpa, who was compared to the moon and from whom came the Oral Lineage of Rechung (Rechung Nyengyu); several of its instructions, such as those concerning Amitāyus and Caṇḍa, spread throughout the entire Land of Snows. The student who was compared to the sun and who was praised in the prophecies of the Victorious One was the great, incomparable Gampopa, whose coming was in every way similar to that of an actual buddha coming into the world.

Although he had an inconceivable number of students whom he brought to spiritual maturity and liberation, the foremost were those who upheld the lineages renowned as the four senior branches:
• Barompa Darma Wangchuk, from whom came the Barom Kagyu;
• Pakmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo, from whom came the Pakdru Kagyu;
• the glorious Dusum Khyenpa, from whom came the Karma Kagyu; and
• Zhang Tsalpa Tsöndru Drakpa (a student of Gampopa’s student Öngom Tsultrim Nyingpo), from whom came the Tsalpa Kagyu.
• As well, a fifth branch, the Dakpo Kagyu, came from the succession that followed the three “uncle and nephew” masters of Dakpo, which was the primary seat of Dakpo.

Some 500 students of Pakmo Drupa were famed as being worthy of a ceremonial canopy. From the foremost among them came what were renowned as the eight junior branches of Kagyu, or “the four pairs, totaling eight.” These students were:
• Kyoppa Jikten Sumgyi Gönpo, from whom came the Drigung Kagyu;
• Tangpa Tashi Palwa, from whom came the Taklung Kagyu;
• Drogön Gyaltsa Kuön, from whom came the Tropu Kagyu;

• Marpa Rinchen Lodrö, from whom came the Martsang Kagyu;
• Yelpa Yeshe Tsekpa, from whom came the Yelpa Kagyu;
• Zarawa Yeshe Senge, from whom came the Yapzang Kagyu; and

Each of these had its own monastic seat, lineage of teachings, and vast range of activities.
In particular, from Götsangpa Gönpo Dorje (who was the foremost student of Lingje Repa’s heart son Drogön Tsangpa Gyare) came the upper branch of the Drukpa, renowned as the “stars in the sky”; from the lineage of his students such as Gyalwa Yangönpa, Latö Sherap Gönpo, Barawa Gyaltsen Zangpo, and others came specific subbranches of the Kagyu. From Lore Darma Wangchuk came the lower branch of the Drukpa: the “focal point of earth.” And through the nine masters named Senge, who upheld the monastic seat, came the uninterrupted transmission of the middle branch of the Drukpa.
On the basis of the special nature of the lord Dusum Khyenpa’s motivation and aspirations, the incredible students and activities of each of his successive incarnations constituted the Kaṃtsang tradition, the primary branch of the Kagyu. Two further branches developed: the Zurmang Kagyu came from Drung Mase Lodrö Rinchen, who was invested as the master of the fifth lord Dezhin Shekpa’s oral lineage known as the “Three Cycles of the Gem,” while the Nedo Kagyu came from the learned and accomplished Karma Chakme, who was a personal student of the sixth Garwang, Chökyi Wangchuk.
From among the foregoing, nowadays only the Karma Kagyu (as one of the four senior branches) and the Drukpa, the Drigung, and the Taklung (of the eight junior branches) are still lineages that can stand on their own. Of the remaining branches, only the transmissions of a few minor maturing empowerments and liberating teachings have not disappeared; other than these, the presence of these branches is no longer felt to any great degree.

Concerning the Shangpa Kagyu, the learned and accomplished master Khyungpo Naljor (who was prophesied by the Victorious One as a “great śrāvaka worker of miracles”) first embraced his ancestral religion of Bön and then the Nyingma school. Although he became learned in each of these systems and gained some spiritual power thereby, due to the power of his aspiration to engage in enlightened conduct finding a timely expression, he was not satisfied with them alone and so journeyed to the holy country of India. He met with some 150 learned and accomplished masters, foremost among them his four primary gurus (Vajrāsana and others), and studied an enormous range of teachings from both sutra and tantra. [17b] In particular, he actually met the ḍākinīs of timeless awareness Niguma and Sukhasiddhi, who had both heard teachings directly from Vajradhara and who dwelled on one of the three pure levels of realization. They bestowed profound instructions on him, and he became a great lord among siddhās, indistinguishable from such sublime mahāsiddhās as Saraha, as exemplified by the fact that the deities of the five tantras were actually present in the five places of his body. Because he established his seat at Zhang Zhong in the Shang valley of the Yeru region of Tsang province, he was known as Lama Shangpa, and so those who continued his lineage became famed as the Shangpa Kagyu.
Khyungpo Naljor lived to the age of 150, maturing and liberating an inconceivable number of those who were to be guided, so that his students included some 180,000 teachers. Foremost among these were the five “earlier sons” and a sixth “later son.” And among these, it was only to Mokchokpa Rinchen Tsöndru that the personal transmission fell for the one-to-one lineage of the secret words of Vajradhara. After him this lineage passed in succession to Öntön Kyergangpa, Sangye Nyentön, Sangye Tönpa, and Drogön Tönpa. The vajra seal of this one-to-one transmission was then loosened by the seventh “jewel,” Chöje Tönpa, in accord with prophecies from Vajradhara and the ḍākinī of timeless awareness, thus allowing accomplished students to spread throughout the human world Jambudvīpa and as far away as its subcontinents. The primary holders of the continuing lineage were Tsangma Shangtön, Samdingpa Zhönu Drup, and Jakchen Gyaltsen Bum, all three of whom committed the instructions to writing. Countless lineages of students developed at the seats of both Jakchen and Samdingpa. There also appeared another series of great and exceptional beings known as the later seven jewels, such as Khyungpo Tsultrim Gönpo, who was a student of Tsangma Shangtön.

In addition, countless other lineages developed: from Chöje Tönpa’s student Serlingpa Tashi Pal, from the succession of Latö Könchok Kar’s students, and so forth. Later on, the mahāsiddhā Tangtong Gyalpo received the distinct “upper” and “lower” lineages and practiced these teachings, so that he was actually taken under the care of the ḍākinī of timeless awareness, [18a] which resulted in three successive direct lineages that still exist nowadays. The venerable Jetsun Kunga Drolchok received the extensive lineage of these teachings on some twenty-four occasions, and a twenty-fifth time—a marvelous and extremely direct lineage—when the ḍākinī actually bestowed instructions on him in this direct manner. Jetsun Tāranātha combined these twenty-five transmissions in the instruction manual found in this collection.
As for the cycle of teachings concerned with the “swift-acting lord protector of timeless awareness,” the special dharmapāla of the learned and accomplished Khyungpo, in former times the followers of the so-called upper tradition spread these teachings almost everywhere. Later on, the lower tradition that came from Rigong spread throughout the majority of schools, and in particular the Precious Lord and his spiritual sons adopted this as the foremost of their dharmapāla practices, so that the rituals of offering, praise, sādhana, and activity spread throughout the three region of U, Tsang, and Kham and as far away as China and Mongolia. It would seem that nowadays any tradition that upholds the sources of the “golden teachings” is exceedingly rare.

Kamalaśīla (who was also renowned in both Tibet and China as Padampa Sangye) was a greatly learned master who was born at Cata Senga in the region of Vetāli in India. He received the entire range of profound instructions from some fifty-four accomplished masters, both men and women, and one-pointedly applied himself to the practice of these instructions. In this way he gained the eight major attainments of the more ordinary variety— such as the ability to extract the vital essence of the inanimate world—and so lived for 570 years. In meditation he was graced with visions of twelve sugatas, thirty-six amazing gurus who had attained Khecara, and others; he also gained the supreme attainment: the timeless awareness of the great path of seeing.
It was this master who based his teachings primarily on the three versions of the Prajñāpāramitā—extensive, middle-length, and concise—as well as such texts as the tantra Great Flowing River of the Sanskrit Vowels and Consonants, condensing the meaning of these sources for application in spiritual practice. In accord with this master’s own life example, for him the support was that of the three levels of ordination; the path was the challenging one of austerities; and the fruition was conduct for the benefit of others. Those of fortunate karma who followed that example and were liberated on the level of buddhahood were as numerous as stars in the nighttime sky. The specific teachings that brought this about became known by the generic name of “the sacred teachings,” as well as “the pacification of suffering.” [18b]
Although these teachings comprise an inconceivable range of instructional methods based on people’s varying degrees of acumen, the lineages that are most renowned are the three successive lines of the transmission of Pacification established by Padampa during some five visits to the land of Tibet:

[1.] The first line of transmission concerns the “Three Cycles of the Lamp of Pacification” that Padampa imparted to Jñānaguhya of Kashmir and were transmitted by the translator Angpo Lotsāwa and others. 
[2.] In the intermediate line of transmission, the primary masters are Ma, So, and Kaṃ. The transmission of the words and meaning of Mahāmudrā were imparted to Ma Chökyi Sherap; the transmission of the words and meaning of the advice for “perceiving pure awareness in all its nakedness” were imparted to Sochung Gendun Bar; and the transmission of upper lineage and lower lineage of the transcendent perfection of wisdom was imparted to Kaṃ Yeshe Gyaltsen. There were also three minor transmissions:
• the “Ninefold Cycle of the Lamp of Pacification,” imparted to Geshe Drapa;
• the advice integrating sutra and tantra, imparted to Che Candrakīrti; and
• the advice “without letters” on the transcendent perfection of wisdom, imparted to Jang Kadampa.
It is also said that there were some fifteen minor transmissions of diverse lineages for such teachings as Lapkyi Drönma’s advice on the Object of Severance.
[3.] As for the final line of transmission, when Padampa returned from China to Dingri, there were transmissions beyond counting, of maturing empowerments and liberating instructions that he bestowed on his students: the twenty-six “destroyers of illusion,” his more than one hundred great and exalted spiritual sons, the twenty-four noble ladies, the twelve students who directed monastic seats, and others. However, the foremost of these students were known as the four favored yogins, who compiled teachings and wrote them down:
• in the east, Dampa Charchen, who compiled the “Cycle of the Teachings That Integrate the Sutras”;
• in the south, Vajrakrodha, who compiled the “Cycle Organizing the Meaning of the Precious Jewel”;
• in the west, Dampa Purchung, who compiled the “Cycle That Compiles Fragmentary Teachings”; and
• in the north, the bodhisattva Kunga, who compiled the “Cycle of the Teachings of Cholu.”

Of the foregoing three lineages, the intermediate one is explained as being in accord with the final cycle of the Buddha’s teachings (that is, the sutras that concern the definitive meaning of the teachings), while the later lineage is primarily in accord with the tantric approach.
All of the foregoing lineages, moreover, are complete spiritual paths, but Padampa averred that the most exalted among them—equal in its intent to that of Padampa himself—is the tradition of the holy master Kunga.
This cycle of teachings is composed of a vast range of sections, of both more ordinary and extraordinary teachings. [19a] Although all three lineages were formerly very widespread, nowadays they exist only in name. But the great translator Dharmaśrī of Mindroling put much effort into receiving whatever transmissions were available and writing manuals and ritual texts. It would seem that it is due to his kindness that at least the fundamental elements of the maturing empowerments and liberating instructions for all three lineages (the earlier, the intermediate, and the later), and particularly for the tradition of the holy master Kunga, are still extant.
The auxiliary cycle, the Object of Severance, is renowned for having two branches: the “male” lineage of Severance and the “female” lineage. As for the former, Padampa Sangye bestowed on Kyo Śākya Yeshe and Yalung Mara Serpo the exclusively sutra tradition of Severance: the instructions called Six Fragments, which discuss the meaning of Āryadeva’s short text Fifty Verses.[64] Kyo conferred these on his nephew, Sönam Lama, who in turn is said to have conferred four of these Fragments on Machik Lapkyi Drönma. The cycle transmitted by Mara Serpo was promulgated by Rok Sherap Ö and Khedrup Zhönu Drup. The foregoing is known as the male lineage of Severance.
As for the female lineage, the same Machik Lapkyi Drönma—who was the great mother Prajñāpāramitā manifesting as a human woman—read the sutra of the transcendent perfection of wisdom aloud, which aroused in her the view of emptiness. With Padampa teaching her a few words of heart advice, she experienced an ongoing sense of freedom and became a natural yoginī. Out of her own experience of enlightened intent—the meaning of the intent found in the Prajñāpāramitā Sutras—Machik established the extensive tradition of the path of Severance, composing an incredible number of cycles of advice. All of these are subsumed within four lineages: the father lineage of skillful method, the mother lineage of wisdom, the nondual lineage of ultimate meaning, and the ḍākinī’s lineage of meditative experience. Her many students, including some 108 male and female siddhās who were her personal students, lived throughout central and eastern Tibet. Foremost among them were her sixteen great spiritual children to whom personal transmission fell, whose activities flourished everywhere. Her own son Langlungpa Gyalwa Döndrup became the foremost one upholding the lineage of the sutra tradition. The upholder of the lineage of the tantra tradition was Tönyön Samdrup, who became renowned as a siddhā and whose
special lineage of Severance was known as Gangpa.[65] [19b] The one upholding the lineage that integrated the traditions of sutra and tantra was Khugom Chökyi Senge, whose lineage produced many further lineages that came from individual siddhās.
In particular, the Gyalwang Karmapa Rangjung Dorje received the teachings of Severance from Namtso Dopa, and from that lineage came the Severance lineages of “Rupa.” In later times there developed the traditions of Zurmang and Nedo. There also developed countless other traditions from various lineage holders, as exemplified by the Kyapche tradition that came from Jetsun Kyase and the Trechö tradition that came from Treho Chökyi Wangpo. An extensive lineage came from Machik’s daughters, while Gyaltang Samten Özer received many distinct transmissions and met directly with Machik, who bestowed instructions on him; all of this led to the Tang tradition.[66]
There were many profound teachings that Machik did not confer on her students but concealed as hidden treasure teachings. In later times these were revealed by Ladu Dorje Drönma, who was an emanation of Machik herself. Kunpang Tsöndru Senge, a rebirth of Khugom, revealed a profound and vast array of hidden treasure teachings from concealment; it would seem that the later transmission of these has continued to the present day as the Gyatön lineage of Severance.

The Vajrayoga of the Six Branches of Union dates from the time when our Teacher, the perfect Buddha, was teaching a vast range of anuttarayoga source tantras of the Vajrayāna at the glorious stupa of Dhānyakaṭaka to those in his retinue, a vast assembly of beings both of this world and transcendent. On that occasion, in response to a supplication by Dharmarāja Sucandra, who was an emanation,[67] the Buddha spoke the source tantra of the Kālacakra cycle in twelve thousand lines. This teaching flourished in the land of Shambhala until the end of the seventh Dharmarāja’s reign. Then the Kalkī ruler Mañjuśrī Yaśas composed an abridged version of the tantra based on the source, and Kalkī Puṇḍarīka elucidated this version in his major commentary. The successive generations of emanated Kalkī rulers spread these teachings, so that they definitely came to mahāsiddhās in the holy country of India at a certain early point in time, if in a somewhat random manner.
In the perceptions of people in general, however, the one who first introduced these teachings was Cilu Paṇḍita. When he was traveling to Shambhala seeking the “Bodhisattva Commentaries,”[68] [20a] during his journey he was taken under the care of an emanation of the Kalkī ruler, who bestowed on him the entire range of empowerments, tantras, commentaries, and pith instructions and blessed him so that Cilu thoroughly mastered these teachings. Cilu’s student was Piṇḍo Ācārya, also known as the master who begs for alms. It was from him that Mañjuvajra (also known as Kālacakrapāda the Elder, or Cilupa the Younger) received the teachings. Through the power of the emanated Kalkī ruler’s blessings, Mañjuśrīvajra gained siddhis and actually journeyed to Kalāpa, where he received a complete transmission of the empowerments, tantras, and pith instructions. Emphasizing these teachings, he explained them to those who listened, so that he came to have many students, including Nāropa, Ratnakāragupta, and others. Among these, three figures—Avadhūtipa, Śrībhadrabodhi, and Nālandāpa—were each referred to as Kālacakrapāda the Younger.
Initially, the translator Gyijo Lotsāwa Dawai Özer invited Kālacakrapāda Śrībhadrabodhi to this land of Tibet; they translated the commentary on the tantra and the pith instructions. Gyijo trained those known as the four great sons, including the translator Trom Lotsāwa Pema Özer. The Gyilo tradition was transmitted from Trom Lotsāwa.
Mañjukīrti was a student of Nālandāpa, and his student in turn was the Nepalese Samantaśrī. It was from Samantaśrī that Ra Lotsāwa Chörap received the teachings that became the Ra tradition. Alternatively, another student of Nālandāpa was the Kashmiri Dawa Gönpo, from whom the teachings passed to Dro Lotsāwa Sherap Drak, to his student Gompa Könchok Sung in turn, and so forth, resulting in the Dro tradition.

Other traditions included the following:

• the Nyö tradition, through Nyö Darma Ö, who received teachings from Tsami’s student Se Lotsāwa Zhönu Tsultrim;
• the Chak Lo tradition, another lineage that came from Nālandāpa and passed successively to Abhayākara, Niṣkalaṅka, the Nepalese scholar Ravīndra, and Chak Lotsāwa Chöje Pal;

In addition, there appeared many other traditions, such as the Bodong tradition (passed down from Shong and Pang), the Koktrangwa tradition, the Latö Wangyal tradition, and others.
In later times, however, the two schools that caused the teachings of the Kālacakra cycle to spread very widely in this Land of Snows were the Jonang and the Zhalu. Both of these received teachings initially from the lineage of the Ra tradition and subsequently brought in teachings from the Dro tradition, so that they definitely came to uphold a combined lineage of Ra and Dro. Because the Bu tradition was primarily a personal transmission of exegesis, it has continued from the great Butön to the present day and constitutes an uninterrupted transmission of explanation of the tantra.
In the Jonang tradition, the great Kunpang received from successive emanations of the Kalkī rulers the complete tradition of Kālacakra that included all the sources translated into Tibetan. His students were famed as the “four sons of Kunpang.” The great and omniscient Dolpopa’s marvelous activity in spreading the yoga of the Six Branches was truly incredible. Primarily, it was the fourteen students who were considered his equals who each engaged in extensive activities to spread traditions of instruction, which has resulted in an ongoing succession that constitutes a personal transmission of accomplishment. This continues even now without impairment as an ongoing tradition of consummate meditative experience and realization.
Generally speaking, in India, the holy country, it would seem that a number of traditions appeared, including those of Kālacakrapāda the Elder and the Younger, Śavaripa, Anupamarakṣita, Raviśrījñāna, the great scholar Nāropa, the Great Scholar of Kashmir, the mahāsiddhā Śāntigupta, and others. Here in Tibet the most renowned were the “four prior traditions” (of Gyijo, Dro, Ra, and Chödrak of Dingri); the “four intermediate traditions” (of Menlung Guru, Tar Lotsāwa, Orgyenpa, and Vibhūticandra); [21a] the three from Śāvari (earlier, intermediate, and later); and the “later tradition” that came from the great scholar Vanaratna.

As for the tradition of Dorje Sumgyi Nyendrup (Stages of Approach and Accomplishment of the Three Vajras), the learned and accomplished master Orgyenpa Rinchen Pal trained completely in the sutras and tantras; in particular he became a superb scholar of the Kālacakra cycle. Training under Gyalwa Götsangpa, he gave rise to a consummate level of realization, beholding the truth of the path of seeing. The lord of dharma Götsangpa extolled Orgyenpa as his heart son, equal to him in uncontrived tantric conduct. In order to develop his conduct to a consummate degree, Orgyenpa journeyed to Jalendhara and many other regions. In particular, he went to the land of Oḍḍiyāna in the west, where many obstacles and quasi-miraculous events occurred; he quelled these with his indwelling confidence on the view and the splendor of his uncontrived conduct. In the four cardinal directions of the central region of Dhūmatala, he was blessed by the ḍākinīs of the four families. In accord with a prophecy uttered by a lovely emanated maiden, he went to a town called Kapoka, where Vajrayoginī herself manifested in the form of a prostitute and bestowed on him the pleasures of food and drink and physical contact, which released the blockages in his subtle channels. With sounds and earthquakes and other great omens, she manifested in actuality as the Vajra Queen and conferred these instructions on him in their entirety. The four previous ḍākinīs and a fifth, the lioness-faced Siṁhamukhā, each conferred a portion of the instructions on Orgyenpa as well, and he gained the sublime and more ordinary attainments.
Orgyenpa journeyed to Tibet, where, in response to a supplication by Kharchu Rinpoche, a student who had received a prophecy concerning this, he first committed the vajra verses of this cycle to writing. He composed a Mnemonic Summary of verses concerning the visualizations that he had bestowed. Dawa Senge, who was entrusted with safeguarding these teachings, compiled the pith instructions into a volume. There are also what are referred to as the four major commentaries: The replies that Orgyenpa gave to questions from Golungpa Zhönu Pal were recorded; Zurpukpa Rinchen Pal authored a major commentary; and both the learned Shangtön and Nyedo Kunga Döndrup composed detailed explanations of the vajra verses.
Numerous traditions of these teachings developed, such as the lineage that passed from Patrapa Sönam Özer through Chöje Gangpa and was received by Palden Lama Sönam Gyaltsen. [21b] The venerable and omniscient Rangjung received the entire cycle of instructions from the mahāsiddhā himself, composed a commentary to unravel the vajra verses, and further elucidated this noble path, the key points of which are more especially exalted than others.

In the first case, that of the Early Translation school and its classification of nine approaches, with respect to the three yogas of the inner level of skillful method, there have developed many graduated approaches to meditation. These, however, can be subsumed within the two categories of those that involve some thematic structure and those that do not. As the Three Stages states:
The stage of meditating on a thematic structure and that of cultivating the experience of suchness itself— the specific variations are spoken of as twofold.
Of these, in this collection the emphasis is on presenting the sources for the stages of meditation in atiyoga, the pinnacle of the nine approaches.
This is the latter of the three categories of development, completion, and Great Perfection. If we interpret the Sanskrit term mahāsandhi, it translates as “great meditative absorption” or “great meditative stability”; that is, the meaning is that of timeless awareness, in which all phenomena of samsara and nirvana are naturally arising within the expanse of the oneness that is the true way in which things abide, transcending all the systems of the eight approaches of ordinary consciousness.
If this approach is further categorized, we read the following in the Supreme Array:
the Category of Mind for those with conceptual minds,
the Category of Expanse for those with minds like space,
and the Category of Direct Transmission for those who need not strive step by step.
Accordingly, the Great Perfection is renowned to involve three categories, because there are different degrees of profundity within this approach that forges the path of naturally occurring timeless awareness.
Of these, in the outer Category of Mind, the realization of all phenomena as being the display of the oneness of mind itself—beyond causes and conditions, effort and achievement—brings freedom from the limitation of there being factors to be eliminated. There are seven further subcategories within this, such as the position that the fruition state is the origin of mind.
In the inner Category of Expanse, free of anything to be done, the realization that all objects in the phenomenal world are without coming or going within the expanse of Samantabhadrā—and that they therefore do not undergo change within the basic space of the three kāyas as natural attributes—brings freedom from the limitation of there being antidotes. [22a] This has four subsections: the three of the White Expanse, Black Expanse, and Multicolored Expanse, plus the Immense Expanse.
In the secret and profound Category of Direct Transmission, there is the realization that the way in which all phenomena of ground, path, and fruition actually are is such that their innate attribute is the fact of the inseparability of original purity and spontaneous presence; and in accord with this realization, there is freedom from the limitations of factors to be eliminated as well as antidotes. This category includes three kinds of texts: personal advice, miscellaneous instructions, and teachings that discuss the tantras that are the source specific to this category.

In this regard, the All-Creating Monarch contains the following lines:
Six approaches that bring the attainment of certainty
are shown to be points of error concerning the great perfection.
Such passages demonstrate the fact that, in every case, all the fixed concepts pertaining to the sutras and to the outer and inner tantras (up to and including the anuyoga approach) are solely systems of thought constrained by ordinary rational consciousness, so that one succumbs to the error of failing to see the primordial way in which things actually abide, just as it is.
Timeless awareness in the context of the Great Perfection approach transcends the eight avenues of ordinary discursive consciousness, which entail imagining and describing things in terms of cause and effect. It is a supreme freedom from conceptual elaboration, with all limitless states of ordinary mind and mental events having subsided within basic space. It is the fundamentally unconditioned mode of being that is the true nature of pure awareness, occurring in and of itself, supremely free of anything to be done and transcending ordinary consciousness. Other than constituting a naturally abiding process of resting in its own fundamental nature, it is not contrived through any artificial means, and so the adventitious distortions that are manifestations of its dynamic energy have dissipated naturally within the basic space of genuine being. It is therefore remarkably superior to all lower systems of thought, a fact that is discussed in the tantra Naturally Arising Awareness:
How marvelous! The great perfection of ati does not fall into any extreme
and so embraces the ultimate meaning of naturally occurring timeless awareness.
To give an analogy, just as the carnivorous lion awes other predators with its majesty,
so the Great Perfection speaks its own language and awes inferior approaches with its majesty.
The Great Perfection speaks its own language and relies on its own ultimate meaning.[69]
In this and similar passages, this source presents the definitive secrets of unique view and meditation.

In the Supreme Array of Ati, moreover, following an extensive presentation of the way in which this approach is superior to systems of view and meditation that involve conceptual speculation, we read the following:
Therefore, this quintessence that is the definitive secret is like a lamp that illuminates the darkness;
it is like an elephant among oxen;
it is like a lion among other wild beasts; [22b] it is like a horseman among foot soldiers.
It is superior to all other approaches.
The preceding citation is an illustration of the extensive treatment found in this text.
As for the key points of this path, the Great Perfection approach is endowed with the special teachings of the unsurpassable instructions concerning “fourfold freedom.” And in particular, having received the empowerment into the dynamic energy of pure awareness from the secret cycle of the Category of Direct Transmission, with unimpaired faith and samaya one familiarizes oneself to some significant degree with the yoga of day and night. Even if one does so, one still might not gain the level of primordial freedom in this lifetime. Nevertheless, through the power of the blessings of the lineage of masters of awareness and that of the true nature of things, when one becomes free of the cage of the physical body, immediately upon calling nirmāṇakāya pure realms to mind, one beholds the nirmāṇakāya realms of the ten directions and is inspired to the level of “universal illumination.” This process is described in such passages as the following from the Supreme Array of Ati:
In the final of the five-hundred-year periods in degenerate times, this heart essence of secrets will manifest in the human realm.
Those fortunate individuals who follow and uphold this and to whom this heart essence becomes evident
will pass to the level of unchanging being.
Even if, due to having a short life and many illnesses in these degenerate times,
they do not gain indwelling confidence in this heart essence, by perceiving it they gain supreme inspiration,
taking pure and miraculous rebirth in the nirmāṇakāya realm of Universal Illumination,
freed from the confines of the womb.

As for the Kadampa, this refers to the tradition of the glorious Atīśa— known as the Noble Lord and the “single deity” of the Land of Snows—in which all the words of the Victorious One are experienced as personal advice by which a single individual can awaken to buddhahood. There is a saying, “The bodies of those who uphold this lineage are adorned with four deities, their speech is adorned with the Three Compilations, and their minds are adorned with the three higher trainings.” Of these, the four deities are Śākyamuni, the master of the teachings; Avalokiteśvara, the master of love and compassion; Tārā, who dispels external obstacles; and Acala, who dispels internal obstacles. The Three Compilations are the presentations with which the three higher trainings are counted together as the subject matter being presented, so that this tradition is renowned as embodying mastery that is endowed with seven divine components. This tradition has three parts: primary sources, advice, and pith instructions. [23a]
As for the primary sources, this tradition emphasizes a living process of
listening to and explaining six sources: the Garland of Lives and the Didactic Aphorisms, as the sources that arouse one’s faith; the Compendium of Training and Entering the Way of the Bodhisattva, as the sources that teach about one’s conduct; and the Levels of the Bodhisattva and the Ornament of the Mahāyāna Sutras, as the sources concerning meditative absorption.
The advice is instruction on the basis of the four truths—of suffering, of its all-pervasive origin, of its cessation, and of the spiritual path to it—in terms of the usual progression and its reversal. The pith instructions concern the practical implementation of secret teachings found in the Precious Volume. As that source states:
Please recall the guru, the source of refuge. Your body is of the nature of the deity.
Please use your speech to engage continuously in recitation and mantra repetition.
Think of all beings without exception as your parents. Investigate the way in which mind truly abides as empty. In maintaining these five,
please purify all your fundamentally positive qualities!
That is to say, the path is forged of the “sixteen spheres,” on both the relative and the ultimate levels, derived from the five recollections of the guru, the deity, mantra, compassion, and emptiness.
The Lamp on the Path to Enlightenment by the Noble Lord presents an integrated treatment of the primary sources and the advice. Given that it is indispensable for one to embrace this unerring path right up to the point at which liberation and omniscience are attained, it is famed as the “path to enlightenment,” or the “graduated path of the three spiritual models.” As the source itself states:
Understand there to be three spiritual models:
the lesser, the intermediate, and the most excellent.

The Sanskrit term for a spiritual model is puruṣa, which etymologically means “having capability,” and so the term “spiritual model of the teachings” is used in this context to refer to someone who has the capability to accomplish something meaningful for the next lifetime or even beyond that. In this tradition, at the outset the foundation for all three models lies in the teachings on how one relies on a spiritual mentor and how the opportunity and leisure to practice is difficult to gain, and so one begins with these.
Then, as the exalted Nāgārjuna states:
First there are teachings concerned with higher states of rebirth; later come those concerned with the definitive excellence of
enlightenment.
Why? Because once one has gained a higher state of rebirth, gradually one can come to that definitive excellence.
Accordingly, the lesser spiritual model is that of those who rid themselves of fixation on this lifetime and are capable of making the moral choices of what to accept and what to reject for the sake of some happier state of existence for themselves in the future. As the main body of teachings in this path, there are four topics: impermanence, the shortcomings of the lower states of rebirth, [23b] the taking of refuge, and the effects of karma.
The intermediate spiritual model is that of those who rid themselves of fixation on samsara in its entirety and are capable of engaging correctly in the three higher trainings for the sake of becoming liberated from it. From the perspective of approaches, this model comprises those of the śrāvaka
and the pratyekabuddha. From the perspective of what one meditates on, there are the four truths, interdependent origination, the obvious and subtle aspects of the identity of the individual, and so forth.
The superior spiritual model is that of those who perceive the flaws of both conditioned existence and mere personal salvation and are capable of accepting the challenge of bringing all beings to the level of buddhahood. From the perspective of view, this is either the Middle Way or the Mind Only school. From the perspective of spiritual approaches, this model can be divided into the two approaches of sutra and tantra. Beginning with the arousal of bodhicitta, which is the distinctive feature of this path, the teachings deal with the way in which one engages in the conduct of the heirs of the victorious ones—that is, the general and specific points of training—as well as the results to which this leads.
Generally speaking, the designation “three spiritual models” appears in a few sources, such as the Concise Definitive Conclusion and the commentary on the Treasury of Abhidharma. The stages of practical implementation are condensed from explanations found in the two Ornaments and the Categories of the Levels.[70] In fact, all the teachings that were spoken in so excellent a manner by the Victorious One are subsumed within this path of the three spiritual models.
The variant themes of mind training, or lojong, which constitute advice for mentally exchanging oneself with others, are primarily found in the Indian sources by the Lord Atīśa’s three gurus and are the quintessence of the practical implementation found in such texts as Entering the Way of the Bodhisattva and the Compendium of Training. This training is the fundamental theme for meditation on the path of the superior spiritual model—the consummation of the three models of the graduated path—and constitutes a remarkable way to enhance the relative aspect of bodhicitta and the meditative absorptions of loving-kindness and compassion.

In the case of the Lamdre tradition, the powerful lord among yogins Virūpa pursued a spiritual practice of the completion stage from the three tantras of the Hevajra cycle[71] and condensed this into the source text of pith instructions,[72] which became renowned as the Precious Speech Concerning the Path with the Result, a lineage imbued with four oral transmissions and authentic qualities. This tradition involves four ways of instructing students through three means of validation and four oral lineages.
Of these, if we discuss instruction exactly according to the source,[73] which is the most extensive basic treatise, [24a] to quote the great lord Sakyapa:
The three states of appearances lay the foundation for the path;
the three continua bring understanding of all practical implementation without exception.
In accord with this statement, the three states of appearances are teachings that are held in common with the approach of the transcendent perfections and lay the foundation of the path:

• Impure appearance involves meditating on the shortcomings of samsara, on the hard-won state of opportunity and leisure, and on conviction concerning the cause-and-effect process of karma; this completes the path of the śrāvaka approach.
• Experiential appearance involves, for the more ordinary kind of practitioner, the cultivation of loving-kindness, compassion, and bodhicitta; this completes the path of the ordinary Mahāyāna approach. For the more extraordinary kind of practitioner, this involves meditation on the path of the Vajrayāna approach, in which one understands that all the inconceivable states of meditative and visionary experience that arise are subsumed within fifteen topics, so that when these arise one recognizes them and allows their natural expression.
• Pure appearance involves being aware of the qualities of buddhahood in the context of the fruition state—the uninterrupted continuum of adornment and so forth—and the arousal of inspiration that one will oneself attain these qualities, so that one’s ongoing experience becomes refined through their cultivation in meditation.

In the extraordinary path of mantra, at the outset one receives empowerment as the causal circumstance and upholds the samaya commitments entailed in the ground situation.[74] As for the actual path of the three continua:
• The causal continuum of the basis of all experience involves one being directly introduced to the view of the indivisibility of samsara and nirvana as the primordial unity of lucidity and emptiness and cultivating that in meditation.
• The continuum of skillful method as the path in fact involves four successive paths connected to the four levels of empowerment:
• •• The path of the vase empowerment is that of the stage of development on the external and internal levels; having received empowerment in the context of the path, one meditates for four sessions in every twenty-four-hour period on the profound path that embodies the significance of that empowerment.
• •• The path of the secret empowerment involves techniques using subtle energies and caṇḍalī.
• •• The path of the empowerment of wisdom leading to timeless awareness involves the body of another as the “messenger.”
• •• The path of the fourth empowerment is that of the “vajra waves”— that is, meditation on the threefold path of the stage of completion to usher in the anticipatory and actual states of timeless awareness.
• Once one has meditated on these four paths, within the context of the mundane path, one experiences the four views (of the three essences and so forth). Within the context of the transcendent path, one reaches the four culmination states of attainment, and the resultant continuum of the fruition state of the five kāyas becomes fully evident. [24b]

To summarize, one lays the foundation of the path with the three states of appearances; carries out the implementation of the main body of practice with the three continua; eliminates one’s false assumptions with fourfold authenticity and the four oral lineages; and delineates the levels of the path by means of the five factors of interdependent origination. When implementing the foregoing, by knowing the three situations in which the subtle elements gather, one becomes skilled in the seven pith instructions that are of benefit and in the methods for dispelling hindrances; and by pursuing the practice, one reaches the culmination of attainment. This is the process of instruction in the extensive treatment of the path. The intermediate treatment of the path involves five topics, while the condensed treatment of the path is subsumed within four categories. Given that any of the foregoing treatments are such that the fruition remains attainable within the context of the path, this tradition is renowned as Lamdre—the Path with the Result—because it reveals the significance of the inseparability of ground, path, and fruition.

As for the tradition of the Kagyupa, this refers to the veritable ocean of advice (primarily associated with the anuttarayoga class) that has been transmitted
by the mahāsiddhās who founded the schools based on the oral lineage they upheld, which Lord Marpa the translator had received as the tradition of the venerable Nāropa and Maitrīpa. Although these instructions are so limitless as to defy description, we may summarize them according to the emphasis on the topics of meditation into two categories: the path of skillful method (the Six Dharmas of Nāropa) and the path of freedom (Mahāmudrā). Both of these, however, are subsumed within three major “vajra themes.” To cite from the Clear Summary of the Five Stages and the Later Primer:
The stages of the way in which things truly abide, the path, and the arising of the fruition state.

That is to say, there is
• the ground (the way in which things truly abide);
• the stages for traversing the spiritual path; and
• the way in which the fruition state is made fully evident.
The true way of abiding, furthermore, has two aspects: the way in which things actually abide as the ground of being and the way in which things actually abide as this pertains to mind. Each of these, too, has three levels (the more obvious, the subtle, and the extremely subtle), which are taken as the basis for the refinement process.
The path involves two aspects: maturation and liberation. Of these, one begins with one’s ongoing experience being matured through the empowerment process to some degree (ideal, middling, or lesser) based on one’s capacity as the recipient. Then, the teachings that liberate one concern the two stages of development and completion. [25a] A beginner implements the practice of these two alternately, but with familiarization one implements them simultaneously. In the stage of completion, moreover, one implements the practices of either the path of skillful method or that of freedom, which are the means that effect the refinement in accordance with the basis for that refinement process.
The fruition entails more ordinary attainments (such as the ten indications of successful practice, the eight qualities, the four aspects of enlightened activity, and so forth), as well as the most sublime attainment (being endowed with the seven attributes of integration, the eight qualities of powerful mastery, the four kāyas, and the five aspects of timeless awareness). Depending on one’s particular good fortune and diligence, these attainments may actually be gained in this lifetime or perhaps in the intermediate state after death.

As for the Six Dharmas, which constitute the path of skillful method, these are practical techniques that rely on such methods as the arousal of bliss to make fully evident the timeless awareness of Mahāmudrā that derives from these methods, and constitute a swift and profound path for those who are endowed with sharp acumen and diligence. They come from the tradition of the glorious Nārotapa.[75] The primary bases on which they rely are summaries of the key points of enlightened intent that are specific to five tantric cycles—Cakrasaṃvara and Hevajra, Mahāmāya, Catuḥpītha, and Guhyasamāja—and that permeate the Kālacakra cycle in general. These practices are thus renowned as the path of skillful method associated with the tantras. In this regard, we read in the True Measure of the Authentic Word of the Buddha:
Caṇḍalī, karmamudrā,
illusory body, dream, utter lucidity,
the intermediate state, the transference of consciousness, and transferring one’s consciousness into another’s body.[76]
In this regard, caṇḍalī is renowned as the root of the path, karmamudrā as the enhancement technique on the path, the practice of illusory body as the axis of the path, dream practice as the authentic measure of meditative warmth on the path, the practice of utter lucidity as the very core of the path, the practice of the intermediate state as the decisive factor on the path, the transference of consciousness as one’s escort on the path, and the practice of transferring one’s mind into another’s body as the means to bridge interruptions on the path.[77] Of these, the practices of caṇḍalī, illusory body, dream, and utter lucidity are known as the four basic practices, constituting the profound path that makes fully evident, within a single lifetime, the state of primordial unity that requires no more training. For those of lesser good fortune, for whom these practices will not make the fruition state evident in this lifetime, the instructions are given for the practices of the intermediate state and the transference of consciousness, making for a set of six practices. Karmamudrā and the practice of transferring one’s consciousness into another’s body are auxiliary practices to
enhance one’s practice or bridge interruptions, so they are not counted separately in the grouping.
The foregoing is the exegesis of Lord Gampopa and as such is universally espoused by those of the Dakpo Kagyu tradition. [25b] Lord Marpa subsumed these into what he termed the four corners of the teachings that bring awakening to buddhahood, while in the tradition of Ngok and his spiritual descendants, the essence of the Six Dharmas is condensed into the two processes of “blending” and “transference.” The venerable Mila sang of this as the direct introduction to the eight intermediate states; Tepupa explained this in terms of four pairs of eight practices; and Rechungpa spoke of it as the “three cycles of blending” or the “ninefold cycle of blending and transference,” and so forth.
While there are numerous analyses and syntheses, the actual teachings are subsumed within the previous explanation.

As for the path of freedom, or Mahāmudrā, according to the tradition of this precious lineage there is a sutra-based model, in which the instructions speak of the object as the utter lucidity that is free of elaboration, and the subjective perceiver as the absence of any conceptual process; with these instructions, one rests in equipoise. And there is a tantra-based model, that of Mahāmudrā specifically characterized as “gaining contact with the innate nature”—that is, the unity of bliss and emptiness—through timeless awareness awakened during the empowerment process and intense focus applied to the key points of the vajra body. Of these two models, the latter conforms to what was described previously, whereas the former derives primarily from the tradition of the master Maitrīpa.
In essence, Mahāmudrā is nondual timeless awareness, profound and lucid and permeating all of samsara and nirvana, imbued with seven special attributes. As for the derivation of the term, if we analyze the Sanskrit term mahāmudrā, mudrā (“seal”) means that all phenomena of the three situations of samsara, nirvana, and the spiritual path are such that they do not fall outside of this awareness, while mahā (“supreme”) indicates that there is no other thing superior to it; this is a compound term that combines these meanings.

If we analyze this, there are three aspects: Mahāmudrā of ground, of path, and of fruition:
[1.] The ground is a “seal” because all phenomena of samsara and nirvana are such that they do not fall outside this, for freedom and confusion occur respectively due to the realization of or the failure to realize that very fact of the way in which things truly abide. It is “supreme” because other than that there is no other dharmakāya to be sought.
[2.] The path is a “seal” because even while one is undertaking spiritual practice, having been introduced directly through the guru’s pith instructions, all consciousness and objects of consciousness are such that they do not fall outside this. It is “supreme” because other than that there is no other timeless awareness of buddhahood to be sought.
[3.] The fruition is a “seal” because once the way in which the ground of being is present becomes fully evident with adventitious obscurations being refined away through the process of the path, the entire manifest display of the kāyas and timeless awareness is such that it does not fall outside the essence of this. [26a] It is “supreme” because it constitutes the consummate state of being.

Regarding the innate nature, there are the two aspects of what is innate by nature and what is innate due to “melting bliss.” Of these, what is being referred to in the present context is not merely some speculative meditation on what is inferred after nothing is found at the conclusion of one’s investigation, but rather a path that is forged of the direct experience, free of concepts, of the unceasing unity of perceived appearances and mind, without the conceptual component of reifying that, so that one is brought into contact with that innate nature in its actuality. As Lord Gampopa stated:
Mind, conceptual thought, and dharmakāya:
these three are innate at the outset.
Because through instruction one gains contact with these as one, wouldn’t you call this “gaining contact with the innate nature”?
With respect to the practical implementation of such a path, as Tilopa said:
Ah! This is self-knowing timeless awareness.
Transcending any verbiage or terminology, it is not the province of mind.
I, Tilo, have nothing whatsoever to show you. Understand it by pointing it out to yourself!
That is to say, once one has recognized one’s own true way of abiding, the perspective of the ground of being, one meditates on this path using what are known as the six teachings of Tilopa:
Do not reflect. Do not contemplate. Do not examine.
Do not meditate. Do not think. Just rest, utterly relaxed.
To implement these in one’s practice amounts to what is identical in its significance to the cycles of Maitrīpa’s teachings on the “absence of any conceptual process.”

In addition to this, the lord Gampopa relied on the Second Armor of Mahāmudrā, authored by the Noble Lord,[78] and the instructional methods from the Kadam tradition. The fourfold preliminary practices ensure that meditation develops where it has not yet developed. The threefold process of direct introduction ensures that where it has developed, it is used as the path. Due to the methods for enhancing the practice and developing positive qualities, the issue of whether one is of excellent or lesser acumen is of no consequence; if one’s ongoing experience is refined by one’s immersion in the instructions, even those of lesser acumen are edified to the highest degree, for these are unsurpassable instructions that give one skill in the means to bring about the state of natural freedom.
Of the followers of this tradition, the glorious Pakmo Drupa, as well as Jikten Sumgön of the Drigung school and his descendants, emphasized instructions on the Five Principles of Mahāmudrā.[79] The glorious Karmapas matured and liberated people with instructions on “four key points of the ongoing cycle of the true nature of reality” and “direct introduction to the three kāyas.” [26b] In the glorious Drukpa Kagyu school, the upper branch of the Drukpa employ the “eight major instructions,” while the lower branch uses the “fivefold capability.” In the basic Kagyu tradition, instruction is given using the “path of the six cycles.”
As the foregoing cases illustrate, there are limitless individual traditions associated with the four primary and eight secondary schools and their derivative lineages, and in each of these cases many of those to be guided have been brought to states of attainment. Given its vast display of methods, this tradition is entirely worthy of one’s complete confidence.

In the case of the Shangpa Kagyu, in general terms the learned and accomplished master Khyungpo, who embodied five consummate attributes, received in its entirety the distilled essence of enlightened mind from some 150 learned and accomplished masters of the holy country of India, so that it was impossible to ascertain any finite number of what were renowned to be a limitless and unequaled array of methods. However, if these are summarized into categories, what developed was a threefold tradition, a graduated path that included theoretical teachings, debate, and practice. The latter consisted of five parts: the cycle of Niguma’s teachings, the cycle of Sukhasiddhi’s teachings, the cycle of Vajrāsana’s teachings, the cycle of Maitrīpa’s teachings, and the cycle of Rāhula’s teachings. Of these cycles, the primary one is the cycle of teachings from the ḍākinī of timeless awareness Nigupta,[80] which for adherents of the Shangpa Kagyu lineage consists in its most extensive version of the “fifteen special instructions,” in its condensed version of the “instructions on the three bodies,” and in its extremely condensed version simply of the “natural freedom of deathless mind.”
While these and other classifications exist, the Five Golden Teachings of
Shangpa constitute the widely known tradition of a one-to-one transmission bearing a vajra seal. These are:
• the Six Dharmas of Niguma as the root;
• Mahāmudrā as the trunk;
• the three means of maintaining ongoing awareness as the branches;
• the white and red forms of Khecarī as the flowers; and
• “unerring immortality” as the fruit.
These instructions were set down as mnemonic manuals for visualization from the Vajra Verses of Vajradhara and the ḍākinī of timeless awareness, so that even the topics for visualization and the supplication prayers are like refined gold, not in any way altered, changed, adulterated, or corrupted by the minds of ordinary individuals.

The first of these is the set of Six Dharmas. As we read in the Vajra Verses:
Having been matured through the four levels of empowerment,
if those who are endowed with faith and diligence
begin with impermanence, disenchantment,
and an awareness of shortcomings as preliminaries
and then exert themselves on this sublime path, [27a]
they will awaken to buddhahood in six months, or a year, or within this lifetime.
That is to say, for individuals who have been matured through the conferral of an empowerment either into the five tantric classes (as described in the major tantra Ocean of Gems) or into the mandala of the glorious Cakrasaṃvara, and through their receiving the transmission of the respective blessings, the first practice to be undertaken is that of the “purifying factor of the empty framework of A.” They then primarily carry out four practices: the path of skillful method (called “the natural blazing of bliss and warmth”), illusory body (“the natural freedom of attachment and aversion”), the dream state (“the natural purity of compounded confusion”), and utter lucidity (“the natural awakening of mental dullness”). Through these practices, the distortions of the confusion experienced in four life situations are dispelled. The two practices of the transference of consciousness (“awakening to buddhahood without meditation”) and the intermediate state (“the sambhogakāya of the victorious ones”) are relegated to the status of auxiliary practices in the stages of meditation for those of lesser diligence and acumen, so that complete freedom is gained in one of the three phases of the intermediate state, depending on the different levels of acumen (ideal, middling, or lesser).

Concerning Mahāmudrā, the learned and accomplished Khyungpo so highly valued the vajra verses of instruction on the ultimate heart essence of being, a state in which any conceptual process is absent, that he placed a small scroll of these inside an amulet box of Nepalese origin, which he wore around his neck. These instructions thus became know as “Mahāmudrā of the amulet box”:
• For the preliminaries, through the three states of utter relaxation[81] one develops calm abiding and profound insight.
• For the main body of practice, with the descent of the vajra state of timeless awareness, one is directly introduced through a stealthy approach and, by becoming free of four flaws in one’s natural state, one refines one’s experience of mind itself with great precision.
• For the concluding phase, one maintains the context in which the three kāyas arise naturally.
Through reliance on uncommon methods to enhance one’s practice and eliminate hindrances, the supreme seal of Mahāmudrā, which is the natural freedom of the four kāyas—the very core of what is presented in all the sutras and tantras, and the distilled essence of all pith instructions—becomes fully evident.

One maintains ongoing awareness of all phenomena (visible, audible, or imaginable) as being of the nature of the guru, chosen deity, and illusoriness, incorporating these into one’s spiritual path by applying this key point.

As for the forms of the transcendent and accomplished conqueror, the Vajra Queen, that bear the colors of the sun and moon, [27b] by one’s invoking them with the supplication prayers and the key points of visualization, caṇḍalī—the unity of bliss and emptiness—blazes in the four cakras due to the freedom from attachment that is associated with each of these places. With that as one’s working basis, one comes to experience Khecāra, the “enjoyment of space,” as the supreme state of primordial unity.

By performing the thirty-two physical exercises that ensure immortality, one utilizes one’s body on the path to liberation. Given that one’s own mind is primordially unborn, its immortality is ensured as a supreme state of natural freedom. The physical body as the natural consequence of karma, being an assemblage of inanimate matter, is devoid of any basis for assigning birth or death. In actual fact, even the body occurs simply as a manifestation of mind, so if one gains the indwelling confidence of realizing mind to be deathless, the manifestation of the body is that of Mahāmudrā in the form of the deity, as determined within basic space, without the error that is due to perceptions based on confusion.
It is said that one can gain the kāya of primordial unity in this lifetime by receiving just a few of these instructions, and that merely hearing them will allow one to awaken to buddhahood in the intermediate state after death, as the sambhogakāya of the victorious ones. As we read in the Vajra Verses:
For those who implement this most sublime of paths, without reference to any other time, but now or in the
intermediate state,
the inseparable unity of bliss and emptiness will arise naturally as the three kāyas
so that they go to the totally pure realm of Khecāra.
The cycle of teachings from the ḍākinī of timeless awareness Sukhasiddhi would seem to include simply two teachings: a set of Six Dharmas as the profound path of skillful method and “Mahāmudrā, the pure state of timeless awareness.” The sādhana practice that combines four deities is the instruction that comes from the mahāsiddhā Rāhula, while the profound teaching from Maitrīpa is that of the “swift-acting lord protector of timeless awareness.” It is evident that these are entirely transmissions based on authentic meditative experience and blessings.

In the case of the tradition of Zhije (Pacification), according to the systems of instruction that came to Tibet, the meaning of the term Zhije derives from the emphasis placed in this tradition on causing the student to turn away from unvirtuous pursuits and on refining away the afflictive emotions in the ongoing experience of original mind. This process is one that in the short term pacifies the inferior physical states, factors contributing to illness, and so forth that are due to the force of previous karma, and so ensures that the practitioner can deal with and bear these. And so the specific name Damchö Duk-ngal Zhije (Sacred Teachings on the Pacification of Suffering) was applied to this tradition. It was applied on the basis of such references as that in the “Mother”:
the mantra that utterly pacifies all suffering.[82] [28a] and that in the most majestic of tantras:
It pacifies the pains of the three kinds of suffering.
These are special instructions that combine into one the profound key points of all the sutras and tantras, for they are said to be “of the transcendent perfections in their essence, yet in accord with the mantra approach.”
Generally speaking, the powerful lord among siddhās Dampa Sangye gained mastery over the meaning of the unborn sound of the Sanskrit vowels and consonants and, through inconceivable secret means,[83] presented immeasurable avenues of teachings—through symbols, words, and meanings— to beings who were to be guided, according to their temperaments and levels of acumen, so that there was no single tradition to be systematized. He taught his students, however, in accord with his own life history, and they for the most part followed his example in three ways: (1) the working basis being that one was endowed with the three levels of ordination; (2) the path being the challenging one of ascetic practice; and (3) the result being conduct that benefited others. Dampa Sangye first formulated the Three Cycles of the Lamp of the Zhije Tradition, which summarized and presented the three higher trainings as these are implemented in a practical manner by those of lesser, middling, or ideal acumen.

Three specific lines of transmission became renowned here in Tibet as the earlier, the middle, and the later line:
• The first line of transmission was the “Kashmiri tradition,” which taught all the advice of fifty-four male and female siddhās, summarized into five key points as illustrated by five analogies.
• The middle line of transmission included three traditions: those of Ma, So, and Kaṃ.
•• The Ma tradition involved a process of direct introduction through sixteen practical instructions that rely on the “lineage of ultimate meaning,” and a process of eliminating false assumptions through sixteen major points that rely on the “lineage of words.”
•• The So tradition involves a process of direct introduction to an ideal, middling, or lesser extent using three key points that are the means of resting the mind, and then a process of practical implementation using ten themes.
•• The Kaṃ tradition, although it began as a very extensive method of instruction, in later times seems to have continued simply as instruction on the meaning of the Heart Essence of the Transcendent Perfection of Wisdom.
• The later line of transmission was the tradition of the bodhisattva Kunga. It consists of pith instructions concerning Prajñāpāramitā (the “transcendent perfection of wisdom”), which are nevertheless in accord with the secret mantra approach—a direct introduction to the ultimate heart essence of being (through the conferral of this fundamental insight in one’s ongoing experience) adorned with the skillful method of the supreme principle of interdependent origination in its many ramifications. [28b] These are pith instructions for the practical implementation of all the Buddha’s teachings at one time, on a single meditation seat.

With respect to the cycle of instructions for the practical implementation of the Immaculate Drop, this is subsumed within the following steps:
• One begins with the conferral of the four levels of empowerment through symbols (an extraordinary process unique to this tradition), which matures the student’s working basis for the teachings where this has not previously been matured.
• One proceeds through the strict parameters of the white, red, and black instructions, which causes meditative experiences to develop where these have not developed previously.
• One forges one’s path of the guru’s blessings, which causes realization to arise where it has not arisen previously.
• The assemblage of words causes the meaning to penetrate one’s mind, which eliminates conceptual elaboration where this has not yet been eliminated.

As for the actual process of instruction, according to the pith instructions for seven complete meditation sessions, there are three alternatives:
[1.] For those of the highest acumen, the key point of beholding pure awareness in all its nakedness is the “white instruction,” causing them to awaken to buddhahood all at once through directly beholding the uncontrived way in which genuine mind truly abides, beyond dualistic consciousness.
[2.] For those of middling acumen, the key point of devotion as the single decisive point is the “red instruction,” in which the four kāyas are attained in leaps and bounds due to the refinement of the bindu of the three avenues of body, speech, and mind in equal measure, which perfects the path of the four kāyas of the guru.
[3.] For those of lesser acumen, the key point of advice that defines issues precisely is the “black instruction,” since one gains the five paths successively.

Of these three, the last involves the following:

• By perfecting the five paths of the mother tantras, in which the motile factor of subtle energy is aroused and channeled, during a single session, one is brought into the strict confines of ascetic practice on the path of linkage.
• By meditating during a single complete session on the four mudrās, the instructions on the experience of bliss from the mother tantras, one is ushered into the path of seeing.
• Due to one’s meditating during a single complete session on the four yogas (or four states of meditative absorption), the instructions on the ultimate heart essence of being, one’s practice is enhanced through the equal taste of the path of meditation.
• By meditating during a single complete session on the Six Branches of Union, the instructions on the natural freedom of pure awareness, one attains the path of consummation, free of anything more to be done.

This method is the special teaching of Dampa Sangye, which had never existed before in India or Tibet. On the external level, it tears out the heart of the Three Compilations; [29a] on the internal level, it severs the aorta of the four classes of tantra; on the secret level, it opens the eye of ultimate heart essence of being; and on the level of thatness, it loosens the seal of secrecy imposed by the ḍākinīs. Thus, it constitutes the strict path of practice for implementing the limitless range of the Buddha’s teachings during a single meditation session, and it is adorned with the skillful method of the supreme principle of interdependent origination in its many ramifications. As we read in the Graduated Path by Zhikpo Nyiseng:
The salt of the lineages of attainment in general, the great graduated path, the strict path of accomplishment,
the united pith instructions of the sutras and tantras in general, this is indeed found in no other case: Ah!
As for the auxiliary tradition to this, that of Damchö Dukyi Chöyul (Sacred Teachings on the Māras as the Object of Severance), if the name is interpreted on the basis of supportive circumstances, this derives from the many classifications of conduct—such as secret conduct, the conduct of pure awareness, and so forth—as an enhancement of spiritual practice that are spoken of in the classes of anuttarayoga tantras, as well as what we read in the “Mother”:
those who wish to engage in the conduct of the profound and transcendent perfection of wisdom should train in this way.
Since this tradition constitutes the practical implementation of the meaning found in these sources, the related name “sphere of activity” was applied.

If the name is interpreted from the perspective of antidotes to counterproductive circumstances, in the context of the cause-oriented approach of the transcendent perfections, the four truths are paired with respect to the choices one makes of engaging in what one accepts or turning away from what one rejects. Because this tradition involves integrating the truths of suffering and its all-pervasive origin into one’s spiritual path, it constitutes the practical implementation of the profound key points of meditation as a countermeasure and the “equal taste” of things, and this is implied in the
name “Māras as the Object of Severance.”
In this name, the meaning of the term severance (Tib. gcod) is as explained in the brahmin Āryadeva’s small source text:
Because this cuts through to the very root of mind,
cuts the root of the five poisons as afflictive mental states, serves as the cause of meditation as the consummation of view, and cuts off all naïve hope, fear, or resistance
to conduct that is daunting,
severance is used as the definitive term.
As for the meaning of the term object (Tib. yul), because the afflictive states that are to be cut off develop through the mind focusing its attention on unsuitable objects, the advanced practitioner focuses intently on these objects, so that the habitual reactions are aroused, and then cuts them off in the immediacy of that very moment.
Of four mainstream transmissions of the Indian teachings of this tradition that flourished in Tibet, the two lineages from Padampa Sangye were those of the “male line of Severance” and the “female line of Severance”; [29b] it is the latter that nowadays has spread everywhere. And this is primarily a lineage of the meditative experience of the accomplished master Machik herself, who gained freedom on the basis of the Buddha’s word. The source of the view is the Prajñāpāramitā, while the specific skillful methods are distinctively those of the mantra approach, and so this tradition is held to blend the realization of the sutra and mantra approaches. The overview of the path of this tradition is stated in the sutra titled the Compendium:

Due to four causal factors, the bodhisattvas are endowed with powerful skill.
It is difficult for the four māras to challenge them, for these cannot perturb them.
They abide in emptiness, yet do not in any way forsake ordinary beings.
They act according to whatever is taught and are imbued with the blessings of sugatas.
That is to say, this is the practical implementation of some four themes found in these teachings: (1) the view of abiding in emptiness; (2) the compassion of not forsaking beings in any way; (3) the discipline of bodhisattvas, acting according to whatever the Buddha taught; and (4) the blessings conferred by sugatas.
[1.] As for the view of abiding in emptiness, initially one eliminates the belief that the mind-body aggregates that are included in one’s ongoing experience constitute a self, and then abides continually in the meaningful experience of a lack of any identity, without one’s mind focusing on any notion of subtle traits being associated with anything associated with other beings in one’s objective perception.
[2.] With respect to not forsaking beings in any way, one embraces the path to enlightenment and with a sense of great compassion turns away from conduct that harms beings, feeling a special love for those with material form (such as the afflicted, the sick, and so forth), while also not indulging in maliciously seeking to harm those without material form (such as gods and demons).
[3.] To act according to whatever is taught means to eliminate frivolous behavior and arouse bodhicitta—the motivation toward enlightenment—so that one does not act in ways that contradict the pledges associated with that.
[4.] To be blessed by sugatas means that, having taken refuge, one prays with fervent devotion to one’s primary gurus and those of the lineage.

With the foregoing as a basis, at the outset of one’s practical implementation of these instructions, one receives the empowerments that are unique to this tradition, which render one a suitable aspirant. [30a] As for the main process of instruction, for all branches of this tradition—the sutra method, the mantra method, the methods blending the realizations of sutra and mantra, and so forth—the general format is to begin with the preliminary exercise unique to this tradition, that of reinforcing positive factors on the physical level and driving home the vital point of blessings invoked through devoted supplication.
Then, for the main body of practice, through pursuing pure awareness and pure awareness alone, one seeks out the hidden flaw of ordinary mind. Having become involved in a methodical approach, one is shown the means of resting the mind. Through the process of “opening the doorway to space,” the meaning of the “mother” is directly introduced. In formal meditative equipoise, one maintains the experience of one’s own true nature—indescribable, inconceivable, and inexpressible—attaining dharmakāya in a single session. In postmeditation awareness, according to the Great Bundle of Precepts:
The entanglements of material objects have been cut off; the entanglements of nonmaterial mind have been cut off;
the entanglements of fixations due to excess enthusiasm have been cut off.
The māras are divided into four groups;
these are, however, subsumed in the māra of complacency.
As this passage states, with the four māras having been cut off through one’s being freed from the dualistic frameworks of hope and fear, of acceptance and rejection, whatever has proved difficult to cut off has nevertheless been cut off by one’s crushing it without hesitation. Applying oneself to a structured practice of sessions in frightening environments, one frequents those environments armed with the instructions, so that when any and all of one’s reactions are provoked, one blends basic space and pure awareness and uses the visualizations for casting out one’s body as food—the white feast, the red feast, the variegated feast, and so forth—alternating peaceful methods with wrathful ones. With this, one experiences concepts of good versus bad as having an equal taste, so that one puts an end to gods and demons outwardly and the belief in a self inwardly in light of the absence of any such identity. In the shorter term, one completes the process of annihilating these, while in the final analysis one gains the three aspects of indwelling confidence, which in itself constitutes a perfecting of the paths and levels as a natural consequence.

As for the Vajrayoga, the hidden meanings that are implied with vajra words in the condensed versions of such anuttarayoga tantras as those of Cakrasaṃvara and Hevajra are presented clearly in that of the glorious Kālacakra. In all the extensive source tantras, such as the Sublime Original Buddha, the profound meaning that they present directly with a single intent is that of the sublime yoga of Mahāmudrā, known as the Six Branches of Union. This is the unsurpassable point to which one can go as the consummation of the entire stage of completion. [30b] As for the way in which one becomes involved in this path, in the Stainless Light the Transcendent and Accomplished Conqueror speaks of threefold confidence with respect to this mantra approach:
Initially, at a certain point one has confidence in the tantra, then confidence in the guru, and then confidence in oneself. It is through these three that the path to completely perfect buddhahood is thoroughly finished.
As this passage states, it is because one is endowed with this threefold confidence that this becomes the totally pure path that brings one closer to the most sublime state of accomplishment.
In this regard, what are to be accomplished are the vajras of the three secrets and of the timeless awareness of tathāgatas, those gone to suchness. The Six Branches of Union, which ensure this accomplishment, are listed in the source tantra of the Kālacakra:
Withdrawal, meditative stability,
channeling subtle energy, and furthermore retention of it, recollection, and meditative absorption:
these are held to be the Six Branches of Union.

These are similar to what is also described in the Subsequent Tantra of the Gathering of Secrets and the Vast Range of Ḍākas. With respect to the way in which the practices are accomplished, they are accomplished it is through the four phases of approach and accomplishment.
That is to say, if we consider the combining of the preliminaries and the main body of practice (as these are specific to the completion stage) as constituting the completion of a single set of the four phases of approach and accomplishment, the following proves to be the case:
[1.] Since the preliminary stage of fourfold disregard lays the foundation for the deity’s form, it constitutes the phase of approach
[2.] In the main body of practice, the branches of withdrawal, meditative stability, channeling subtle energy, and retention constitute the phase of intimate approach.
[3.] Recollection of desire through the four mudrās constitutes the branch of accomplishment of the bliss of supreme unchanging desire.
[4.] Meditative absorption constitutes the branch of supreme accomplishment, since it ensures that the kāya of timeless awareness is actually accomplished.
If we consider the actual way in which this accomplishment is gained:
• The two branches of withdrawal and meditative stability are the yoga of the essence of the vajra principle of enlightened form; they refine the central subtle channel and bring accomplishment of vajra form in all its aspects.
• The channeling of subtle energy and retention are the yoga of the vajra principle of enlightened speech; channeling energy brings the subtle energies of the lateral rasanā and lalanā channels into the central channel, while retention causes these to become stabilized, bringing accomplishment of vajra speech in all its aspects. [31a]
• Recollection is the yoga of the vajra principle of enlightened mind; due to one’s reliance on the four mudrās, the bodhicitta that has been melted is maintained free of dissipation, bringing accomplishment of vajra mind in all its aspects.
• Meditative absorption is the yoga of the vajra principle of timeless awareness; that selfsame bliss is integrated inseparably with rūpakāya, bringing accomplishment of vajra timeless awareness—the primordial unity of bliss and emptiness—in all its aspects.

Alternatively, it is also said that the two branches of withdrawal and meditative stability are the phase of the accomplishment of total recall; the two of the channeling of subtle energy and retention are the phase of the accomplishment of subtle energy; recollection is the phase of the accomplishment of bliss; and meditative absorption is the phase of the accomplishment of suchness.
With respect to these branches, when the Oral Transmission of Kālacakrapāda says:
one should understand that each and every one has six . . .
the former masters of this lineage have interpreted the meaning implied in explaining each branch through a set of six topics: (1) the meaning of the term, (2) the appropriate time for that meditation, (3) the branch as a method of meditation, (4) the authentic indications of one’s having meditated,
(5) an analysis of what is purified and what purifies, and (6) the result that is gained through meditation.
These branches can also be subsumed within threefold virtue. Vajragarbha speaks of the two branches of withdrawal and meditative stability as the path that is virtuous at the outset; the two of channeling subtle energy and retention as the path that is virtuous in the interim; and the two of recollection and meditative absorption as that path that is virtuous in the final outcome. In general, the teachings of our Teacher in their entirety are virtuous at the outset, in the interim, and in the final outcome. From the point of view of this consummate stage of definitive meaning, however, meditation based on conceptual thinking, or the bliss of karmamudrā practice being considered to be the ultimate state, or meditation on emptiness as the nonconceptual state reached at the conclusion of mental investigation are neither exceptionally virtuous (since they can be characterized as causes of samsara), nor do they constitute, respectively, the mandala of ultimate reality or supreme bliss or true emptiness. In this path, there is virtue at the outset, since initially it brings accomplishment of empty forms as the mandala of ultimate reality; there is virtue in the interim, since later on it brings about the cessation of the subtle energy of
karma, which is the cause of discursive conceptual thinking; and there is
virtue in the final outcome, since it brings about accomplishment of the unchanging ultimate state of bindu. [31b] And there is virtue in all three stages of the outset, the interim, and the final outcome, since this path entails the perspective of authentic timeless awareness, a nonconceptual state that precludes mental investigation; for the meaning of virtue here is identified as bliss and its attendant causes.

<d e="2">
Thus what is virtuous at the outset brings accomplishment of the meditative absorption of extraordinary calm abiding and profound insight. The initial stage of what is virtuous in the interim blends subtle energy and mind in its earlier stages, and the later stage opens the gates of the cakras. What is virtuous in the final outcome ensures the accomplishment of the changeless kāya of timeless awareness.
Through the use of these six branches as yogic practice, at first one is imbued with a partial glimpse of vajra timeless awareness; then step by step one gains the complete blessing of the “vajra flow,” so that visionary experiences and significant perceptual indications arise. One’s mind abides as a matter of course in a nonconceptual state, while there occur physical sensations of shaking and trembling and verbal experiences of uttering various sounds. When one allows the natural expression of these, the blockages of the three avenues of body, speech, and mind are gradually released. Finally, the three factors of masculine energy, feminine energy, and subtle motile energy are purified within the six cakras, so that the kāya of timeless awareness of the victorious ones of the six families is accomplished.

Concerning the tradition of Dorje Sumgyi Nyendrup (Stages of Approach and Accomplishment of the Three Vajras), we may cite the Gathering of Secrets:
Consider your mind as like your body, your body as like your mind, your mind as like something uttered in words.
The instructions of this tradition are unique, for in the context of the ground of being, a connection is determined—that the three vajras cannot be divided from one another—and in the context of the spiritual path, one meditates on the yoga of the indivisible vajra state so that, in the context of the fruition state, the three vajra secrets are made fully evident. According to the Vajra Verses:
Through the refinement of the subtle channels, the body is purified of distortions;
through the refinement of the subtle energies, the speech is purified of distortions;
through the attainment of the state without dissipation, the habitual tendencies of ordinary mind are overcome.
The blockages of the cakras are eradicated though the progression of the four degrees of joy.
One wakes from the sleep of nonrecognition through coming back out of unconsciousness.
The mind that is free of desire and in which faintheartedness and aversion are exhausted
gains freedom in supreme bliss through the purification of desire.
The meaning of the lines cited is as follows:

[1.] In the branch of approach, which purifies the body and the subtle channels, the causal factor of the yoga that utilizes the key points of the body is withdrawal, and its result is meditative stability. [32a] One comes to a definitive conclusion through the Three Compilations.
[2.] In the branch of accomplishment of the vajra principle of enlightened speech, which purifies the speech and the subtle energies, with the vajra mantra repetition as the preliminary step, the causal factor is the channeling of subtle energy, and its result is retention. One comes to a definitive conclusion through four factors: these two branches, their effects, and the result that they accomplish.
[3.] In the branch of supreme accomplishment of the vajra principle of enlightened mind, which purifies the mind and bindu, the branch of recollection presents completion of the mundane phase of the spiritual path in any of three ways: ideally by reliance on caṇḍalī, in middling cases on one’s own body, and in lesser cases on the body of another. The branch of meditative absorption, which presents completion of the transcendent phase of the path, entails the mind abiding one-pointedly in the bliss of pure self-knowing awareness—the nonduality of both aspects of supreme bliss, that which is conceptually structured and that which is unstructured. On the external level, then, one secures all bindu of the refined essence that is subject to loss. By thus implementing the yoga of the three vajras in the correct manner, one gains the fruition of the three kāyas—the state purified of the three levels of obscuration with their three internal subdivisions—in this one lifetime, in this one body.

Thus, the traditions of the paths of these lineages of accomplishment, which can be summarized as the foregoing eight lines of transmission, were the foremost traditions in the land of Tibet and have been so considered from the point of view that they all constitute complete paths. There are, however, a great many minor traditions, such that a classification of their historical origins and instructions would be too much to document.

As for the enumeration of the teachings that are contained in the collection, these constitute the heart essence of the primary sources of the eight great mainstream lineages of accomplishment—the most profound vital essence of the teachings that mature and liberate, together with the cycles of minor teachings and the transmissions that support these—gathered together in a single collection, the volumes of which comprise ten major sections, equal in number to the directions. These sections are those of: (1) the Early Translation school of the Nyingma, (2) the Kadam, (3) the Lamdre, (4) the Dakpo Kagyu, (5) the Shangpa Kagyu, (6) the Zhije and Chöyul traditions,
(7) the Jorwa Yenlak Drukpa, (8) the Dorje Sumgyi Nyendrup, (9) the cycles of minor teachings, and (10) the 108 Instructions of Jetsun Kunga Drolchok (which are supports for all the foregoing). [32b]

With respect to the first section, in this tradition the fundamental process for maturing practitioners relies on either the masculine or the feminine aspect of the Cakrasaṃvara cycle. And though all schools within the tradition are alike in emphasizing the methods of Nāropa, those methods comprise both an extraordinary version from the oral lineage and the many more-common versions that derive from the various Kagyu schools. From among these, in this collection are included, by way of a generic format, the sādhana and mandala ritual for the empowerment into the five-deity cycle of Cakrasaṃvara according to the tradition of the Dakpo Kagyu, authored by Tashi Namgyal.[232]

[1.] The various texts and transmissions of blessings for the eighty-four mahāsiddhās. Although some three distinct traditions of these teachings were brought to Tibet, it seems that there was some controversy that caused learned ones with the discerning eye of the dharma to have misgivings about these. From among these three, it would seem that the Indian source for the tradition of the scholar Vīraprabhāsvara included here (as translated by Menyak Lotsāwa Möndrup Sherap) can be verified as authentic, and that the transmission of blessings for this tradition also included here (which is according to the methods set down by Jetsun Kunga Drolchok and is the tradition of the gurus of India, uncorrupted by some more generic format of authorization rituals) can be taken as reliable. And although there is definitely a specific transmission of blessings for each of the siddhās, while the method included here (that of conferring all of these in a single transmission) is intended to simplify the process, it is not simply my own invention. [39b] Rather, I have written out an arrangement of this practical method, having received explicit permission to do so from my lord guru Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, according to the advice conferred on him by the mahāsiddhā Lavapa.[446]
Also included are:
• a ritual honoring the eighty-four siddhās;[447]
• a guru yoga according to the Indian tradition;[448] and
• a manual of instruction for the Six Dharmas associated with these siddhās, together with some ancient sources.[449]

In the first place, of the cycles of teachings from the Early Translation school of the Nyingma, even the lineages of textual transmission for the Concise Path, the Garland of Views, and the Mamos’ Sphere of Activity are rare, to say nothing of the lineages of word-by-word explanation. Nevertheless, my precious lord guru, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, received the transmissions of these teachings from genuine teachers who held the unbroken essential lineages for them. The underlying basis that exemplifies the first of the seven great modes of personal transmission that this lord himself received consists of the extensive lineages of the eight great mainstream traditions of accomplishment. He thus conferred on me the reading transmissions, explanatory instructions, and authorization rituals as a direct lineage. In fact, witzh respect to all of the more ancient texts that are mentioned below, all the lineages that I received should be regarded as following this same format, that is, having been received through the grace of my lord guru Khyentse.
The way in which the lineage for the essential manual of instruction on the Heart Essence of Magical Illusion by the omniscient Longchenpa was transmitted from the author himself is as recorded in the record of teachings received by the Great Tertön (revealer of hidden treasure teachings) of the Mindroling tradition.[535] From Gyurme Dorje himself, the transmission passed down to Rinchen Namgyal, Śrīnātha, Jikme Lingpa, Jangchup Dorje, Chökyi Lodrö, Rikpai Dorje, Khen Padmavajra, Kunkhyen Dorje Ziji, and from him to me.

As for Four Stages of Yogic Practice by Dewa Saldze, my lord guru himself graciously recommended that it be included at this point in the collection, but the text has proved to be unavailable. If it is ever located, it should be inserted here.
Concerning the instruction on innate meditation extracted from the Discourse on the Gathering, the way in which this was transmitted conforms to that of the Mindroling tradition, while from the Great Tertön it passed, in succession, to Dharmaśrī, Rinchen Namgyal, Orgyen Tenzin Dorje, Trinle Namgyal, Rikzin Paljor Gyatso, Jikme Ngotsar, Orgyen Chemchok Palgyi Dorje, Gyalse Rikpai Dorje, Khen Damchö Özer, and Kunkhyen Lama Dorje Ziji Tsal, from whom I received it. An alternative lineage is that of the maturing empowerments and liberating instructions that the Katok master Drao Chöbum received from Śākyamitra (a holder of the Zur lineage), and that passed down through successive generations in the eastern region of Tibet to the vajra holder Pema Sangak Tenzin, from whom I received it. [41b]
As for the outer cycle of the Category of Mind in the Great Perfection approach, the lineage for the thirty-seventh chapter extracted from the tantra the All-Creating Monarch accords with that found in Minling Terchen’s record of teachings that he received. It then passed to Sungtrul Tsultrim Dorje, Tsultrim Gyaltsen of Bönlung, Tukse Tenzin Gyurme, Sungtrul Ngawang Kunzang Dorje, Tukse Gyurme Chokdrup Palbar, Sungtrul Tenzin Drupchok Dorje, Khenchen Orgyen Tenzin, Zichen Trinle Namgyal, Jetsun Trinle Chödrön, and the omniscient Gyurme Tenzin Pelgye Palzangpo, from whom I received it.

As for the small text of annotations to the preceding, as well as the vajra songs of the eighteen texts by masters of the Category of Mind and Smelting Gold from Ore, these were transmitted to me through the grace of the precious lord Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo.
The lineage for the empowerment into the dynamic energy of pure awareness, the means for direct introduction in a radical manner to the enlightened intent of the eighteen “mother and child” texts of the Category of Mind, which is conferred on the basis of the manual written by the Katok master Moktön Dorje Palzangpo, began with dharmakāya Samantabhadra and passed to the sambhogakāya (the victorious ones of the five families), the nirmāṇakāya lord of secrets Vajrapāṇi, the master Garap Dorje, the “twenty-one learned ones,” the translator Bairotsana, Yudra Nyingpo of Gyalmorong, Jñānakumāra of the Nyak clan, Sokpo Palgyi Yeshe, Sangye Yeshe of the Nup clan, Yeshe Gyatso of the Nup clan, Sherap Chok of the Nyang clan, Yeshe Jungne of the Nyang clan, Zurchen Śākya Jungne, Zurchung Sherap Drak, Kyotön Śākya Yeshe, Dropukpa Śākya Senge, Drogön Dampa Śākya Gyal, Khepa Chetön and his spiritual son, Chetön Zunge, Setön Tashi, Lama Tangtön Bumye, Chöje Lakyap Dorje, [42a] Drinchen Khepa Chenpo, Khandro Palgyi Yeshe, Machik Drinchen Zurmo, Zurham Śākya Jungne, Zurmo Gendun Bum, Śākya Shenyen of the Zur clan, Khedrup Drao Chöbum, Shenyen Könchok Zangpo, Dorje Zangpo of Katok, Dorje Namgyal of Darlung, Lodrö Palden Pangtön Karma Guru, Jatang Kunzang Paljor, Rikzin Trinle Lhundrup, and Lochen Chögyal Tenzin, who transmitted it to Terchen Gyurme Dorje. (The manner in which many lineage transmissions were brought together by this master can be learned from his record of the teachings he received.) From the Great Tertön[536] the lineage passed to Dharmaśrī, Rinchen Namgyal, Oḍīyana, Trinle Namgyal, Pema Wangyal, Namkhai Dorje, Tenzin Pelgye, Pema Tashi, Zhenpen Taye, and then to my lord guru Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, who graciously bestowed the transmission on me. An alternative transmission passed from the Great Tertön through the great translator[537] to Mingyur Paldrön, Rinchen Namgyal, Pema Tenzin, Trinle Namgyal, and Pema Wangyal, from whom Gyurme Tenzin Pelgye received it.

Of the three major traditions of teachings for the Category of Mind, that of the Nyang tradition is represented by the manual of instruction authored by Sokdokpa Lodrö Gyaltsen. The lineage of continuous instruction, based on a word-by-word reading transmission, began with Samantabhadra and passed to Vajrasattva, Garap Dorje, Mañjuśrīmitra, Śrīsiṃha, Bairotsana, Yudra Nyingpo, Nyak Jñānakumāra, Sokpo Palgyi Yeshe, Nupchen, Nup Yönten Gyatso, Nyak Sherap Chok, Nyang Yeshe Jungne, Zurchen, Zurchung, Kyotön, Dropukpa, Chetön Gyanakpa, Upa Zhikpo, Zhikpo Dutsi, Tatön Joye, Tatön Ziji, Kyeme Dampa Sangye, Nyame Tulku Chenpo, Zur Jamseng, Zurmo Khetsun Sangye, Drolchen Samdrup Dorje, [42b] Drolmapa Sangye Rinchen, Gyalse Tukchok Tsal, Drakpa Paljor, Lodrö Rapyang, Lachen Dorje Chang, Lhaje Lodrö Zangpo, Dorje Yeshe, and Siddhivajra, down to the Great Tertön, from whom the lineage passed down just as in the preceding case of the empowerment.
The lineage for the supplication prayer to the lineage of the Category of Mind is the same, from the author himself onward.
The lineage for the manual of instruction according to the eastern Tibetan tradition, by the Katok master Chenga Namkha Dorje, is a lineage of reading transmission that also includes that of the detailed instruction for the Web of Magical Illusion—that is, from Samantabhadra to Vajrasattva, Garap Dorje, Mañjuśrīmitra, Dhahetala, Gomadeva, Rapnang Tenma, Tsokyi Dakpo, Nāgārjuna, Dorje Lekpa Tsal, Kukurāja, the “one with nine topknots,” Dīpaṃkara, Śrīsiṃha, Bairotsana, Yudra Nyingpo, Salrap Chenpo, Palgyi Gyalpo of Ma, Jangchup Sherap of the Nyen clan, Yönten Jungne, Chokro Gomchung, Jampa Gomchen, Jangtön Namdak, Dampa Deshek, Chöje Tsangtön, Jampa Bum, Yeshe Bum, Yenpa Rinpoche, Bodhiśrī, and Vajraśrī (alternatively, from the great Jampa Bum the transmission passed to Tsade Chengawa, Drung Tukje Yeshe, Tönpa Wangjor Pal, to Vajraśrī). Palbar Namkha Dorje received this transmission from three masters—Yenpa Rinpoche, Jangchub Pal, and Moktön Dorje Pal—after which it passed to Palbum, Rinchen Palwa, Lodrö Zangpo, Sönam Döndrup, Namkha Gyatso, Wangdrak Gyatso, Chönyi Gyatso, Jangchup Gyaltsen, Ön Orgyen Namrol, Drung Namkha Gyatso, Losal Gyatso, Chökyi Dorje, Tsewang Chokdrup, Könchok Tupten Gyatso, Gyurme Tenzin, Choktrul Tupten Gyaltsen, and Kunzang Dorje Ziji, who graciously conferred this transmission on me.

As for the Aro tradition of oral transmission (a tradition from eastern Tibet of the Category of Mind in the Great Perfection approach), [43a] the manual of instruction authored by Zhamar Kachö Wangpo is entitled Straightforward Instruction on the Heart Essence of the Vault of Space. The lineage for the reading transmission of these teachings began with the Lord of Sages[538] and passed to the “child of the gods” Adhicitta, Garap Dorje, Śāvari Wangchuk, Maitrīpa (not the same master as the one famed in the New Schools), Śrīsiṃha, Bairotsana, Yudra Nyingpo, the translator Yeshe Zhönu of the Nyak clan, the incarnate Aro Yeshe Jungne, Yazi Böntön, Chokro Zangkarwa, Lodrö Jungne, Kongrap Tsoden Darmawa, Chegom Nakpo, Lama Drakarwa, Palden Dusum Khyenpa, Drogön Rechen, Gyalse Pomdrakpa, the mahāsiddhā Karma Pakṣi, Nyenre Gendun Bum, Kunkhyen Rangjung Dorje, Tokden Drakpa Senge, Ritröpa Darma Gyalwa, Kachö Wangpo, Lama Śākya Drakpa, and Chöpal Yeshe; down to this point there is an unbroken transmission of experientially based instruction. The lineage then passed to Lord Tongwa Dönden, Jampal Zangpo, Paljor Döndrup, Chödrak Gyatso, Sangye Nyenpa, Mikyö Dorje, Könchok Yenlak, Wangchuk Dorje, Chökyi Wangchuk, Maṇipa Karma Sungrap, Rapjampa Karma Dorje, Dhītsa Karma Trinle Wangpo, the all-seeing Dharmākara, Dudul Dorje, Pema Nyinje Wangpo, and the lord guru Karma Tenpai Nyima, in whose presence the transmission passed to me. (The more direct lineage for the foregoing teachings passed from Aro Yeshe Jungne to Bagom Sönam Nyingpo to Dusum Khyenpa, and then the rest of lineage continued as outlined previously.) An alternative lineage passed from Samantabhadra to Vajrasattva, Garap Dorje, Śrīsiṃha, Bairotsana, Yudra Nyingpo, Aro Yeshe Jungne, Yase[539] Böntön, Drugu Lokjung, Bagom Sönam Nyingpo, Dampa Dzegom Zhikpo, Tokden Bara Gomchen, Jomo Nyangmo, and Dampa Śākya Gyal, from whom it passed to both Upa Tönśāk and Upa Zhikpo. From these last three the teachings passed to Chikar Lhaje Lhakangpa Yönten, Zhikpo Dutsi, Tatön Joye, Tatön Ziji, [43b] Yungtön Dorje Pal, the Gyalwang Karmapa Rolpai Dorje, and then to Kachö Wangpo, after whom it continued as outlined previously. The lineage of oral instruction for Precious Ship, the essential manual of instruction for the All-Creating Monarch authored by the omniscient Longchenpa, began with the teacher, All-Creating Monarch, and passed to Vajrasattva, Garap Dorje, Mañjuśrīmitra, Śrīsiṃha, Bairotsana, Yudra Nyingpo, Chokro Lekpai Lodrö, Ba Gyalwai Wangpo, Tsur Chokgi Lama, Drung Yeshe Wangpo, Zurpa Rinchen Drak, Che Gawai Wangpo, Nyen Rinchen Tsemo, Chöje Kunga Döndrup, Zhönu Drup, Yeshe Wangpo, Drime Özer, Delek Gyatso, Mati Mangala, Yönten Palwa, Samdrup Gyatso, Namkha Zhönu, Namkha Longyang, Mati Dhvaja, Natsok Rangdrol, Khyapdal Lhundrup, Kunzang Namgyal, Dorje Pawo, Kundrol Namgyal, Ngedön Tenzin Zangpo, Rikzin Zangpo, Khen Pema Mangala, Zhenpen Taye, and Kunkhyen Sumpa, who graciously conferred it on me.

For the inner cycle of the Category of Expanse in the Great Perfection approach, the lineage for the fourth chapter of the Supremely Vast Range of the Great Expanse, which constitutes the core of that tantra, paralleled the various lineages described above in the section on the tantra of the Category of Mind.
There is a single lineage for all three components—empowerment, reading transmission, and instruction—for the following teachings:
• the extensive arrangement of the methods for meditation, a practical application of the guru’s blessing;
• the longevity empowerment that concludes this cycle;
• the conferral associated with the guardian of these teachings, Medongchen;
• the instruction in visualization for the “distilled essence of Ola Jose poured into the vessel that was Gyagom” and the associated manual for this oral lineage, entitled Opening the Eyes of the Fortunate, authored by Zhamar Chenga Chökyi Drakpa;
• the source for the Vajra Bridge, with associated pith instructions and personal advice;
• the summary of the Condensed Bridge;
• Garland of Meditative Experience from the Precious Lineage of Oral Teachings and two associated manuals of instruction.

As for the lineage of maturation and liberation based on the four empowerments—elaborate, unelaborate, extremely unelaborate, and utterly unelaborate—from the Innermost Drop of the Guru cycle authored by the omniscient and noble Longchen Rapjam, as well as the Oral Transmission of Vimala: Manual of Instruction That Unites in a Single Mainstream the “Mother and Child” Cycles of the Heart Drop Teachings, this began with dharmakāya— the masculine and feminine aspects, Samantabhadra and Samantabhadrā, in unity—and passed to the entire vast range of peaceful and wrathful victorious ones, [44b] the great one gone to bliss Vajradhara, Vajrasattva, Vajrapāṇi, Garap Dorje, Mañjuśrīmitra, Śrīsiṃha, Jñānasutra, Vimalamitra, the omniscient knower of the three times Padmākara, the Buddhist ruler Trisong Detsen, Tingzin Zangpo, Dangma Lhungyal, Senge Wangchuk, Gyalwa Zhangtön, Khepa Nyibum, Guru Jober, Senge Gyapa, Melong Dorje, Kumararāja, Longchen Rapjam, Khyapdal Lhundrup, Drakpa Özer, Sangye Önpo, Dawa Drakpa, Kunzang Dorje, Gyaltsen Palzang, Natsok Rangdrol, Tenzin Drakpa, Dongak Tenzin, Trinle Lhundrup, Terdak Lingpa, Rinchen Namgyal, Orgyen Tenzin Dorje, Gyurme Trinle Namgyal, Trinle Chödrön, and my omniscient guru Jampaiyang Khyentse Wangpo, who graciously bestowed these transmissions on me.

The lineage for the teachings from the Profound Innermost Drop collection—the empowerments for the “Three Cycles of the Sphere of Being” and Illuminating Lamp: Practical Instructions for the Empowerment, as well as the Great Practical Instruction of the Sublime Secret and the Quintessential Practical Instruction—is one of continuous instruction, based on a word-by-word reading transmission. It began with Samantabhadra and passed to Vajrasattva, Garap Dorje, Mañjuśrīmitra, Śrīsiṃha, Vimalamitra, Tingzin Zangpo of the Nyang clan, Be Lodrö Wangchuk, Dro Rinchen Barwa, Dangma Lhungyi Gyaltsen, Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, Guru Shangpa Repa, Lama Zapdön Chöbar, Dampa Gyertön and his spiritual son, Nyentön Sherap Tsemo, the two brothers who were incarnations of Yönten Gang, Rikzin Kumararāja, the omniscient Özer Gocha, Delek Gyatso, Mati Mangala, Jangsem Yönten Pal, the incarnate Samdrup Gyalpo, [45a] Shangpa Rechen, Namkha Zhönu, Khalong Yangpa, Mentse Lodrö Gyaltsen, Gyalse Sherap Gyaltsen, Tsultrim Sangye, Ösel Chokyang, Jamyang Chökyong Wangchuk, Gönpo Sönam Chokden, Trinle Lhundrup, Terdak Lingpa, Rinchen Namgyal, the throne holder Pema Tenzin, Gyurme Trinle Namgyal, Pema Tenkyong Gyurme, Pawo Tsuklak Chögyal, Dzogchenpa Orgyen Chöpel, Tokden Karma Pelgye, and the incarnate Karma Zhenpen Tenpa Dargye, from whom I received these transmissions.
As for the lineage of the Precious Golden Garland, the manual of instruction for the heart essence of profound meaning, this began with dharmakāya Samantabhadra and passed to the sambhogakāya buddhas of the five families, the nirmāṇakāya Vajradhara, the teacher Vajrasattva, Garap Dorje, Śrīsiṃha, Pema Tötreng, Yeshe Tsogyal, the princess Pemasal, Ledrel Tsal, Lekdenpa, the omniscient Drime Özer, Delek Gyatso, Tsungme Yönten Palwa, Sangye Rinchen, Sangye Gyaltsen, Dzayik Tsulgyal, Sönam Namgyal, Orgyen Tenzin, Karma Guru, Kunzang Paljor, Dongak Tenzin, Trinle Lhundrup, and Terdak Lingpa, following whom the lineage can be drawn as in the case of the Innermost Drop of the Guru.

As for essential instructions on the three aspects of virtue, the three topics of the Great Perfection cycle Resting at Ease in Mind Itself (taken from the collected works of the omniscient Drime Özer) and the “Three Cycles of Natural Freedom” (taken from his miscellaneous writings), the lineage of instruction and reading transmission for these texts is as follows (the ways in which the individual lineages of the sutra and tantra teachings were transmitted are clearly set forth in the records of teachings received by masters in the past):[540] From Longchen Rapjam onward the lineage passed to Dengom Chökyi Drakpa, [45b] Ngalpa Tönpa, Chökyi Drakpa, Sönam Paljor, Mentsepa, Natsok Rangdrol, Tenzin Drakpa, Dongak Tenzin, Trinle Lhundrup, and Gyurme Dorje, after whom the lineage is as described above for the essential manual of instruction on the Heart Essence of Magical Illusion. I received this transmission in the presence of my precious lord Khyentse Wangpo, and also from my lord guru Gyurme Tutop Namgyal, who passed on a lineage associated with the Great Perfection approach transmitted by Lhodrak Sungtrul and others.
The lineage for the manual of instruction for Stirring the Pit was transmitted from the author himself through the general lineage of the throne holders of Mindroling, down to Trinle Chödrön and then my sovereign lord Khyentse Wangpo, from whom I received it.
As for the lineage of the authorization ritual for the seven classes of Ekajāṭi, guardian of these teachings, before Longchenpa it is the general lineage of the Heart Drop teachings. Following him it passed to Delek Gyatso, Mati Mangala, Yönten Pal, Tulku Samgyal, Namkha Zhönu, Khalong Yangpa, Mentsepa Lodrö Gyaltsen, Natsok Rangdrol, Tenzin Drakpa, Karma Gyalse, Rinchen Dargye, Trinle Lhundrup, and Terdak Lingpa. From him the transmission continued through several lineages, but the one that concerns us here passed to Gyurme Tekchok Tenzin, Gyurme Kunzang Namgyal, Pema Sangak Tenzin Chögyal, and Gyurme Tutop Namgyal, from whom it passed to me.

In the second case, that of the precious Kadampa school, among the primary sources the main text is the Lamp on the Path to Enlightenment, the source verses on the graduated paths of the three spiritual models, authored by the incomparable Noble Lord. The lineage for the explanatory instructions and reading transmission of this teaching began with Paṇchen Dīpaṃkara and passed to the king of dharma Dromtön, Potowa Rinchen Sal, Sharawa Yönten Drak, Chumikpa Sherap Drak, Drotön Dutsi Drak, Sangye Gompa Senge Kyap, Chim Namkha Drak, Gyangro Lama Jangchup Bum, Chim Lozang Drak, Yönten Sönam Lhundrup, [46a] Lopön Drakpa Gyatso, Khenchen Drupa Sherap, Gyatön Tsandra Dewa, Ritröpa Sönam Gyatso, Gartön Sherap Gyatso, Khedrup Palden Dorje, Yongzin Könchok Pel, Ngorchen Könchok Lhundrup, Je Könchok Palden, Jampa Kunga Tashi, Drupkhangpa Palden Döndrup, Gönpo Sönam Chokden, Tsetsok Umdze Kunga Ngödrup, Je Puntsok Lekjor, Kangyurwa Ngawang Rapten, Morchen Kunga Lhundrup, Je Jampal Gyatso, Khenchen Gendun Gyatso, Könchok Jikme Wangpo, Khen Könchok Gyaltsen, Drupchen Könchok Gyatso, Könchok Tenpa Rapgye, and the all-seeing Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, who graciously conferred the transmissions on me.
As for the lineage for the text authored by Tokden Kachö Wangpo on the graduated path according to the tradition of Gampo, it paralleled the lineage for the bodhisattva vow (as described below) from the Noble Lord onward, and I received it from Pema Nyinje Wangpo and the Gyalwang Karmapa Tekchok Dorje.
The lineage for the explanations and reading transmission of Quintessence of Nectar: Manual of Instruction for the Pith Instructions Concerning the Three Spiritual Models, authored by Jetsun Tāranātha, began with the Noble Lord, the glorious Atīśa (in whom three lineages—that of profound view, that of extensive conduct, and that of the blessings of spiritual practice—converged as one), and passed to Dromtön, Potowa, Sharawa, Tumtön Lodrö Drak, Dotön, Palden Dromoche, Kyotön Senge Kyap, Chim Namkha Drak, Kyotön Mönlam Tsultrim, Zeu Drakpa, Chim Lozang Drakpa, Drotön Kungyalwa, Drupa Sherap, Sönam Chokdrup, Palden Döndrup, Sönam Drakpa, Kunga Chokdrup, Kunga Drolchok, Lungrik Gyatso, Tāranātha, Rinchen Gyatso, Lodrö Namgyal, Ngawang Trinle, Kunzang Wangpo, Tsewang Norbu, [46b] Kagyu Trinle Shingta, Kunga Gelek Palbar, Kunga Lhundrup, Kagyu Tenzin, and Karma Lhaktong, from whom I received this transmission.

As a relevant factor at this point, there are distinct alternate lineages for the transmission of the vow for arousing bodhicitta in the lineage of profound view, such as the lineage transmitted by Jowo Tangpa Dza and Jikme Jungne, or the one that Sangye Yeshe passed to the great Ngok Lotsāwa. Here, however, if we consider how the two lineages were passed down from the incomparable Noble Lord, the lineage of profound view began with the perfect Buddha, the Lord of Sages, and passed to Mañjuśrīkumāra, the exalted Nāgārjuna, Āryadeva, Candrakīrti, Vidyākokila, Kusāli the Elder, Kusāli the Younger, and Serlingpa Chökyi Drakpa. The lineage of extensive conduct began with the transcendent and accomplished conqueror Śākyamuni and passed to the regent Maitreyanātha, the exalted Asaṅga, the master Vasubandhu, Vimuktasena, Paramasena, Vinitasena, Vairocana, Haribhadra, Kusāli the Elder, Kusāli the Younger, and the bodhisattva Serlingpa. Both lineages then passed to the Lord Dīpaṃkara and then to Dromtön Gyalwai Jungne, Chenga Tsultrim Bar, Jayulwa, Yeshe Bar, [47b] Gyachak Riwa, Nazurwa, the incomparable Dakpo Lhaje, Dusum Khyenpa, Rechen Sönam Drakpa, Gyalse Sönam Dorje, Drupchen Chökyi Lama, Nyenre Gendun Bum, Rangjung Dorje, Yungtön Dorje Pal, Gönpo Gyaltsen, Dzamling Chökyi Drakpa, Kachö Wangpo, Dezhin Shekpa, Chöpal Yeshe, Tongwa Dönden, Jampal Zangpo, Paljor Döndrup, Chödrak Gyatso, Sangye Nyenpa, Mikyö Dorje, Könchok Yenlak, Wangchuk Dorje, Chökyi Wangchuk, Chöying Dorje, Yeshe Nyingpo, Yeshe Dorje, Chökyi Döndrup, Jangchup Dorje, Chökyi Jungne, the Gyalwang Karmapa Dudul Dorje, and Jamgön Pema Nyinje Wangpo, in whose gracious presence I received the transmission of the ritual for arousing bodhicitta as aspiration and application on two occasions, as well as that for the arousal of the ultimate aspect of bodhicitta as passed down from the lord Jikten Sumgön. Alternatively, from the lord Chökyi Jungne a lineage passed to Karma Chakme, Pema Kunga, Trinle Wangjung, Sherap Drakpa, Karma Tsangyang, and Karma Tenzin Trinle (the fourth sublime incarnation), from whom I received it.

With respect to the second category, that of the maturing factor of the causal empowerment in the “pith instruction” tradition of Hevajra, the lineage passed from Vajradhara to Nairātmyā, Virūpa, Kāṇha, Ḍāmarupa, Avadhūtipa, Gayadhara, Drokmi Lotsāwa, Setön Kunrik, Zhangtön Chöbar, Sachen Kunga Nyingpo, Sönam Tsemo, Drakpa Gyaltsen, Sakya Paṇchen, Chögyal Pakpa, Könchok Pal, Sönam Pal, Palden Lama Sönam Gyaltsen, Palden Tsultrim, Buddhaśrī, Ngorchen Dorjechang, Muchen Sempa Chenpo, Gyaltsap Kunga Wangchuk, Yongzin Könchok Pelwa, Lhachok Senge, Könchok Lhundrup, Sangye Senge, Namkha Palzang, Sönam Lhundrup, Palchok Gyaltsen, Sangye Puntsok, Sönam Palden, Palden Chökyong, Chökyong Zangpo, Namkha Chime, [54a] Jampa Naljor Jampal Zangpo, and the omniscient Vajradhara Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, who in his supreme compassion graciously bestowed it on me. The lineage of the reading transmission for the two texts by Könchok Lhundrup—the sādhana and the mandala ritual—is, from the author onward, the same as for the empowerment, whereas I received the reading transmission for the empowerment ceremony by Jamyang Loter Wangpo from the author himself.
In the third category, that of the instructions, the lineage for the Ngor tradition of Lamdre according to the “explanation to the multitude” is as in the foregoing case. The supplication to the lineage and other writings of Ngorchen are also the same as before.

(In the foregoing cases, the lineage after Drokmi Lotsāwa is as in the former case).
The lineage for the instructions of “spiritual connections with the six gatekeepers” is the same as for the 108 Instructions of the Jonang tradition, while the lineage for the reading transmission of these texts is, from the glorious Lama Dampa Sönam Gyaltsen onward, the same as that in the case of Clarifying the Hidden Meaning.

In the fourth case, that of the advice found in the Kagyu tradition of the powerful lord Marpa, to begin with, from among the primary sources there are the more common cycles associated with Mahāmudrā:

The lineage for the source verses of Marpa’s song “Creating No Concepts” passed from him to Milarepa and so on; while the Mahāmudrā text Shedding Light on Timeless Awareness, authored by the venerable Milarepa, was transmitted by him to Dakpo Rinpoche and so on. And the Mahāmudrā text Single Sufficient Path, authored by the venerable Gampopa, was transmitted by him to Dusum Khyenpa and so on as in the preceding cases.
Regarding the uncommon cycles associated with the Six Dharmas: The lineage for the reading transmission of Standards for Authentic Teachings passed from Vajradhara to the ḍākinī of timeless awareness, Vajrapāṇi, Tilopa, Nāropa, Marpa, Milarepa, Rechungpa, and from him to both Gyalwa Lo and Sumpa Repa, as well as Burgom. It was from the latter that Pakmo Drupa received the lineage and passed it in turn to Lingje Repa, who also received it from both Gyalwa Lo and Sumpa Repa. Lingje Repa then transmitted the lineage to Tsangpa Gyare, who then passed it to Önre Dharma Senge, Zhönu Senge, and Nyima Senge, and Ön Dorje Lingpa received it from the preceding two (who were uncle and nephew). He then passed it to Pökyawa Senge Rinchen, [57b] Senge Gyalpo, Kunga Senge, Dorje Rinchen, Lodrö Senge, Sherap Senge, Yeshe Rinchen, Namkha Palzang, Sherap Zangpo, Chöje Kunga Paljor, Ngawang Chökyi Gyalpo, and Jamyang Chökyi Drakpa, from whom both Avadhūtipa and Ngagi Wangchuk Drakpa Gyaltsen received the transmission. They both then passed it to the omniscient Pema Karpo, who in turn conferred it on Lhatse Ngawang Zangpo, Paksam Wangpo, Yongzin Kunga Lhundrup, Chökyi Wangchuk, Gelek Zhepa, Jamgön Gyepa, Jampal Pawo, the all-seeing Chökyi Nangwa, the Gyalwang Karmapa Tekchok Dorje, and the omniscient Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, who bestowed it on me.

In the case of the Vajra Verses of the Oral Lineage, the lineage passed from Vajradhara to the ḍākinī of timeless awareness, Tilopa, and so on as previously.
As for the two primers (longer and shorter) on the Six Dharmas, Tilopa’s pith instructions on the Six Dharmas, Nāropa’s vajra song on the Six Dharmas, and Lord Milarepa’s Three Cycles Clarifying the Oral Lineage, the lineages are as in the preceding case of Ganges Mahāmudrā.
The second category of texts in this tradition contains developmental instructions of two kinds: empowerments as the causal factor that brings spiritual maturation and the main sources of instructions (both primary and secondary) that bring liberation. Of the first kind, there are three versions of the primary cycles of the oral lineage: the extensive, the intermediate, and the concise.

[1.] In the extensive version, the Rechung Nyengyu (Oral Lineage of Rechungpa), the lineages for the following teachings—the short source by Tilopa, the more common manual Wish-Fulfilling Gem, the Six Dharmas (which bring total liberation through the “upper gateway”), the physical exercises for the path of skillful means, the “lower gateway to supreme bliss,” Supreme Bliss: Luminous Pure Awareness, and the Mahāmudrā text Shedding Light on Timeless Awareness—passed from Vajradhara to the ḍākinī of timeless awareness, Tilopa, Nāropa, Marpa, Milarepa, Rechungpa, Khyung Tsangpa, and to the latter’s three heart children Martön Tsultrim Jungne, Lopön Targom, and Machik Angjo (known as the three accomplished heart children). [58a] From these three the lineage passed to Zhang Lotsāwa, Drogön Dharaśrī, Jangsem Sönam Gyaltsen, Machik Kunden Rema, Khetsun Ziji Gyaltsen, Wangchuk Sherap, Ritröpa Zhönu Gyaltsen, Rechen Denchikpa, Tsenden Chipa, Dulzin Ngagi Wangpo, Sherap Jampa Sangye Senge, Tsangnyön Chökyi Senge, Götsang Rechen, and from him to the three known as the three with the title Rapjam: Nepa Rapjampa Jampa Puntsok, Rapjam Karma Tashi, and Rapjam Sangye Özer. The omniscient Drupchok Wangpo then received the transmission from all three of them and passed it on to Trinle Gyatso, Kagyu Drönme, Yönten Gyatso, Chöje Lingpa, Wangpo, Yeshe Kalzang, Palden Gyatso, Geupa Ngedön Tenzin Chökyi Gyatso, Tutop Gyatso, Kharakpa Rinchen Özer, Geu Kagyu Trinle Wangchuk, and Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, who bestowed it on me. The specific lineage for the Four Letters of Mahāmudrā passed from Vajradhara to Vajragarbha, Tilopa, Nāropa, Marpa, Milarepa, Dakpo Rinpoche, Pakmo Drupa, Lingje Repa, Tsangpa Gyare, Götsangpa, Yangönpa, Chenga Rinchenden, Zurpukpa Chöje, Ritrö Rechen, Mengom Özer Senge, Lachipa Namkha Gyaltsen, Dulzin Ngagi Wangpo, Taklung Ngawang Drakpa, and Shar Rapjampa, after whom it is as in the preceding case.
[2.] As for the intermediate-length cycle, the Ngamzong Nyengyu (Oral Lineage of Ngamzong), the lineage for the primary source, Three Cycles of Tseringma, passed from Repa Bodhiradza to Gungtang Repa, Yakpuwa, and so on through successive generations as a core tradition of the oral lineage.
[3.] As for the Mahāmudrā text Shedding Light on Timeless Awareness and the source text of the shorter-length cycle, the Dakpo Nyengyu (Oral Lineage of Dakpo), the lineage for these texts is as discussed previously in the case of Milarepa’s source text on Mahāmudrā and other texts. [58b]
The lineage for the reading transmission of the sources for the “nine cycles of the disembodied ḍākinī” is as in the preceding case, while that for the actual instruction in these is the same as for the Rechung Nyengyu.

As for the Four Scrolls of Heard Instructions, the lineage was transmitted as a main part of the Zurmang Nyengyu (Oral Lineage of Zurmang), so that the two scrolls on the yogic practices of subtle channels and energies and the transference of consciousness were conferred by Nāropa on Marpa, while the two on Mahāmudrā and the intermediate state were bestowed on Marpa by Maitrīpa. Marpa then transmitted them all to Tsurtön Wangde, Shengom Gomchung, Dakpo Dotse, Lopön Nyima Lungpa, Deshek Rinpoche Toktse Gangpa, the omniscient Chöje Kunga Döndrup of Nyedo, and Yungtön Dorje Pal, after whom it is the same as for the oral lineage.
The second set of texts consists of the cycles of instructions that derive from the individual schools within the Dakpo Kagyu. In the case of the primary tradition of the seat of Dakpo, the lineages for the instructions in the Six Dharmas and Mahāmudrā, as well as the other manuals of instruction, were transmitted as follows:

With respect to the concise summary of Dakpo Rinpoche’s four axioms, the lineage is as in the preceding case.
As for both the instruction on mind entitled Wish-Fulfilling Gem and the transference of consciousness known as “the ultimate state of entering the city,” the lineages passed from the venerable Gampopa to Kyebu Yeshe Dorje, who concealed the texts as termas, later revealed by Drogön Dungtso Repa, who conferred them on Neu Jadralwa Dorje Dzepa and others. The lineages were transmitted through successive generations, codified as a section of teachings in the oral lineage by the mahāsiddhā Lodrö Rinchen, following which the lineages were the same as for the mainstream oral lineage.
In the case of the tradition of the Tsalpa Kagyu, lord protectors of beings, the lineage for both Zhang Tsalpa’s Consummate Sublime Path of Mahāmudrā and the Mahāmudrā text entitled Great Wrathful Goddess passed from Vajradhara to the ḍākinī of timeless awareness, the six primary gurus, Zhang Tsöndru Drakpa, the incomparable Śākya Yeshe, Tsenkhangpa Sangye Zhönu, Kunga Gyaltsen, the lord Drakpa Zangpo, Śākya Sönam, Dharmapāla, Palden Gyaltsen, Drakpa Sönam, Gendun Palden, Drakpa Gyatso, Ngawang Gyatso, Sönam Gyaltsen, Kalden Gyatso, Chöying Rangdrol, the Great Fifth Dalai Lama, Pema Trinle, Kunga Sönam, Tupten Dargye, Gyurme Chöpel, Lozang Jungne, Drakpa Khedrup, Kalzang Khedrup, Chuzang Lama, Geshe Yeshe Gongpel, and my omniscient guru, the venerable Mañjughoṣa, by whose grace I received it.
As for the fifth Zhamar’s notes summarizing the meaning of the “sealed” teachings, the lineage passed from Könchok Yenlak, Wangchuk Dorje, Chökyi Wangchuk, Karma Nyima, [59b] Karma Trinle, Dönyö Nyingpo, Chökyi Döndrup, Chökyi Jungne, Dudul Dorje, and Pema Nyinje Wangpo, from whom I received it.
From the cycles of instructions found in the Kaṃtsang Kagyu lineage of accomplishment, for the victorious one Rangjung Dorje’s works—that is, the instruction manual on Merging with the Innate State of Mahāmudrā, the themes for understanding the Six Dharmas, and Molten Gold: Six Dharmas— the lineage from the author onward is the same as for the Mahāmudrā lineage described below, down to the fourteenth Gyalwang Karmapa Tekchok Dorje, who graciously bestowed it on me.

The Mahāmudrā lineage of “merging with the innate state” passed from Vajradhara to Ratnamati, Sarahapa, Ārya Nāgārjuna, Śavaripa, Maitrīpa, Marpa of Lhodrak, the venerable Milarepa, the king of dharma Dakpo Lhaje, Dusum Khyenpa, Drogön Rechen, Bomdrakpa, Karma Pakṣi, the learned and accomplished Orgyenpa, Rangjung Dorje, Yungtön Dorje Pal, the lord Karmapa Rolpai Dorje, Khachö Wangpo, Dezhin Shekpa, Ratnabhadra, Tongwa Dönden, Jampal Zangpo, Chödrak Gyatso, Sangye Nyenpa, Mikyö Dorje, Könchok Yenlak, Wangchuk Dorje, Chökyi Wangchuk, Chöying Dorje, Yeshe Nyingpo, Yeshe Dorje, Chökyi Döndrup, Jangchup Dorje, Chökyi Jungne, Dudul Dorje, and Chödrup Gyatso. Vajradhara Pema Nyinje Wangpo received it from the latter two and then graciously bestowed it on me. Alternatively, both the fourteenth Gyalwang Karmapa and Karma Tekchok Tenpel received the transmission from Pema Nyinje Wangpo, and then they both conferred it on me; and in addition, from the thirteenth lord Karmapa it passed to the fourth Chakme, Karma Tenzin Trinle, through whose kindness I received it.

The lineage for the reading transmission of the instruction manual Pointing Out Dharmakāya and the liturgies for the preliminary practices is as in the preceding case.
As for the concise and essential instruction on the deity for Vajrayoginī, the lineage passed from the author[553] [60a] to the Gyalwang Karmapa Wangchuk Dorje, Karma Döntok, Karma Palzang, Karma Kunkhyen, Chökyi Jungne, the thirteenth lord Karmapa, Pema Nyinje Wangpo, and Karma Ngedön Tenpa Rapgye, from whom I received it.
The lineage for the notes on the outer sādhana authored by Tsuklak Gyatso passed from the author himself to Chökyi Wangchuk, Drakpa Chokyang, Karma Tsoknyi, Karma Tenzin Namgyal, and Karma Kunkhyen, after whom it is as in the preceding case.
In the case of Nonduality of Subtle Energy and Mind,[554] authored by Rangjung Dorje, the lineage is the same as for the instruction manuals for Mahāmudrā, down to the fourteenth lord Karmapa Tekchok Dorje, through whose grace I received it. As for the instruction manual for the preceding source, authored by Tsewang Kunkhyap, from the author the lineage passed to Choktrul Karma Ratna, Ringul Tulku Karma Chögyal, Karma Ngedön Palzang, and my lord guru Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, from whom I received it.

As for the lineage of instruction in the Six Dharmas of Nāropa, the extensive lineage includes those of the “four commands,” while the more direct lineage passed from Vajradhara to Vajrayoginī, Tilopa Prajñābhadra, Nāropa Jñānasiddhi, Marpa Chökyi Lodrö, and the venerable Milarepa, after whom it is the same as for the foregoing Mahāmudrā lineage.
The lineage for the reading transmission of Distilled Nectar, a manual of instructions for the Six Dharmas, passed from the author, Garwang Chökyi Wangchuk, to the tenth lord Karmapa Chöying Dorje, following whom there is no difference from the preceding case.
With respect to the lineage of instruction and reading transmission for Direct Introduction to the Three Kāyas, a special teaching of the Karmapas, this began with the Karmapa Chökyi Lama, who passed it to the learned and accomplished Orgyenpa, after whom it is as in the former cases. It was through the kindness of the fourteenth Gyalwang Karmapa that I received it. (As for the manual of further instructions on Direct Introduction to the Three Kāyas, authored by this same lord, the lineage passed from the author himself to Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo and then to me.)
The lineage for the reading transmission of Nāropa’s Five Nails to Dispel Hindrances is as in the former cases of the longer and shorter primers.
As for the Four-Session Guru Yoga, from the eighth lord Mikyö Dorje onward it is the same as for the “golden garland” of the Kaṃtsang school, down to Pema Nyinje Wangpo [60b] and Karma Tekchok Tenpel, from whom I received it.
In the case of the stages of visualization for the foregoing and the notes on the Short Supplication to Vajradhara, the lineage for the reading transmissions passed from the author Karma Chakme to Tsöndru Gyatso, Pema Döndrup, Pema Lhundrup, Dechen Nyingpo, and Kaṃ Karma Norbu, from whom I received it.

From the Zurmang Kagyu tradition, the lineage for the instruction manual on Mahāmudrā authored by Drung Mase passed from Drung Mase Lodrö Rinchen to Tokden Chöpal Yeshe, after whom it is similar to the case of the longer and shorter primers.
From the Nedo Kagyu tradition, the lineage for its quintessential practice—the definitive instruction on the Bulu method for Mahākaruṇika— passed from Karma Chakme to Pema Kunga, Trinle Wangjung, Sherap Drakpa, Tenzin Döndrup, and Jeön Samten Choktrul Rinpoche Karma Tekchok Tenpel, by whose grace I received it.
From the primary teaching cycles of the Padru Kagyu tradition, the lineage for the reading transmission of the advice on Mahāmudrā authored by Drogön Pakmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo passed in succession from him to the siddhā Lingje Repa, Tsangpa Gyare, Gyalwa Götsangpa, Chenga Rinchen Denpa, Zurpukpa, Yakpukpa, Tangchungwa Śākya Senge, Khön Jose, Jadral Namkha Ö, Khetsunpa, Dorje Dzinpa, Rinchen Zhönu, and Chenga Sönam Gyaltsen. Then my lord guru Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo received it from a virtuous lama,[555] after which I received it in turn from him.
From among the cycles associated with the “four pairs,” that is, the eight secondary schools:
The lineage for the instructions in the Five Principles of Mahāmudrā, the special teaching of the Drigung school, lord protectors of beings, passed from Vajradhara to Tilopa, Nāropa, Marpa, Milarepa, Dakpo Lhaje, Pakmo Drupa, Drigung Rinchen Pal, Tsultrim Dorje, Sönam Drakpa, Chenga Drakpa Jungne, Chung Dorje Drakpa, Rinchen Senge, Drakpa Senge, Dorje Rinchen, Dorje Gyalpo, Dzamling Chögyal, Döndrup Gyalpo, Rinchen Palgyi Gyaltsen, Rinchen Palzang, [61a] Rinchen Chögyal, Kunga Rinchen, Rinchen Puntsok, Sönam Palgyi Gyatso, Chögyal Puntsok, Tashi Puntsok, Könchok Rinchen, Chökyi Drakpa, Könchok Trinle Namgyal, Könchok Trinle Zangpo, Döndrup Chögyal, Tenzin Drodul, Chökyi Gyaltsen of To, Tenzin Chökyi Nyima, and Pema Nyinje Wangpo, by whose grace I received it. Alternatively, from Könchok Trinle Namgyal the lineage passed to Karma Chakme, after which it was transmitted in the succession of the “golden garland” of the Nedo Kagyu; it was then bestowed on me, together with that of the manuals of background teaching for the definitive instruction on Mahākaruṇika, by the venerable Choktrul Tenzin Trinle.
As for the lineage of the single reading transmission for the fifth Zhamar’s instruction manual, this passed from Könchok Bang[556] to Wangchuk Dorje, Chökyi Wangchuk, Karma Sungrap, Karma Dorje, Karma Trinle Wangpo, Jamgön Tenpai Nyinje, Dudul Dorje, and Vajradhara Pema Nyinje Wangpo, from whom I received it.

In the case of the verses on the Five Principles of Mahāmudrā authored by lord Dharmākara, the lineage passed from the author himself to Dudul Dorje, and Pema Nyinje Wangpo, from whom I received it.
Before Tenzin Chökyi Nyima, the lineage of the torma empowerment for the Five Principles of Mahāmudrā is the same as for the lineage for the instructions in the Five Principles of Mahāmudrā; after him it passed to Tenzin Padmai Gyaltsen, Gar Könchok Tenzin, Chönyi Norbu, and Rikzin Könchok Tenzin, who passed it on to me.
This school’s lineage for the Six Dharmas is, before Drigung Kyopa, as in the general case, after which it passed to Ön Sönam Drakpa, Chung Dorje Drakpa, Tokhapa Rinchen Senge, Tsamchepa Drakpa Sönam, Chunyipa Dorje Rinchen, Nyergyepa Dorje Gyalpo, Nyernyipa Chökyi Gyalpo, Döndrup Gyalpo, Namkha Gyaltsen, Ngawang Gyaltsen, Ngawang Drakpa, Rinchen Chögyal, Kunga Rinchen, Rinchen Puntsok, Palgyi Gyatso, Chögyal Puntsok, [61b] Namjom Puntsok, Chökyi Drakpa, and then to Chökyi Nyima, as in the case of the lineage of the Five Principles. It then passed to Tenzin Pemai Gyaltsen, Ngawang Tenpai Nyima, the venerable Jamgön Khyentse Wangpo, and then to me.
The general lineage for the completion stage for the four aspects of the unsurpassable innate state is also as in the preceding case.
The lineage of experientially based instruction for Mahāmudrā—merging with the innate state—in the tradition of the glorious Taklungpa Tangpa Chenpo is, according to the successive line of holders of the seat of Martang, as follows: from Vajradhara to Ratnamati, Sukhasiddhi,[557] Sarahapa, Nāgārjuna, Śavaripa, Maitrīpa, to the sublime being Marpa (alternatively, it passed from Vajradhara to Tilopa, Nāropa, and Marpa), and then to Milarepa, Dakpo Lhaje, Pakmo Drupa, Taklung Tangpa, Kuyalwa, Sangye Yarjön, Sangye Ön, Tashi Lama, Sangye Palzang, Ratna Guru, Ratnākara, Namkha Jamyang, Tashi Paltsek, Jangchup Gyatso, Ngawang Drakpa, Namgyal Drakpa, Namgyal Tashi, Namgyal Palzang, Ngawang Namgyal, Tashi Paldrup, Drakpa Lekdrup, Jampal Gyatso, Trinle Tenzin, Trinle Chokdrup, and from both of them to Drakpa Rinchen Sherap. From the latter two it then passed to Tashi Drakpa Gyaltsen, Drakpa Rinchen Lekdrup, Chöying Lhundrup, Ngawang Tenpai Nyima, and the omniscient Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, who passed it on to me.

According to the shorter “golden garland” of the Martang lineage, before Sangye Ön it is as previously, but after him the transmission passed to the lord Orgyen Gönpo, Gyalwai Lodrö, Ratnākara, Drakpa Gyaltsen, Miyo Gönpo, Pakchok Jikten Wangchuk, Pema Gyalpo, Tsokye Dorje, Kunga Tashi, Ngawang Namgyal, and after him as in the preceding case. [62a]
Especially in the case of the lineage of words, this passed from Sangye Ön Drakpa Özer to Kunga Pal, Orgyen Gönpo, Yönten Gyaltsen, Yönten Özer, Lodrö Rinchen, Döndrup Rinchen, Chöpal Zangpo, Khardrung Sönam Tashi, and Tsokye Dorje, after whom it is as in the former case.
In the lineage of this Taklung Kagyu tradition, it is held that the lineages that derived from the Densa Kagyu,[558] Karma Kaṃtsang, Drigung, and Drukpa are included, so that it is considered to constitute a fivefold line of personal transmission.
As for this tradition’s lineage of instruction and reading transmission for the profound path of the Six Dharmas of Nāropa, it passed from Vajradhara to the ḍākinī of timeless awareness, Nāgārjuna, Caryapa, Lavapa, Subhagā, Tilopa (who brought together the personal transmissions from the preceding four), Nāropa, Marpa, Milarepa, Dakpo Lhaje, Pakmo Drupa, and Tangpa Tashi Pal, after whom it is the same as for the Mahāmudrā lineage. In this lineage are thus subsumed four mainstream traditions, those of the Kaṃtsang, Drigung, Drukpa, [and Taklung].
The lineages for the instruction manuals on Mahāmudrā and the Six Dharmas authored by Tangpa Rinpoche are, from the author onward, as in the preceding cases.
From the Tropu Kagyu tradition, the lineage of instruction on the Five Principles of Mahāmudrā and the “four syllables” begins in the same way as in the preceding cases, and then passes to Drogön Rinpoche, Gyaltsa Rinchen Gönpo, Kunden Tsangpa Rechung, Lotsāwa Jampai Pal, Lachen Sönam Wangchuk, Tropu Rinpoche, Yangtsewa[559] Rinchen Senge, Drachompa Yönten Lodrö, Changlungpa Zhönu Lodrö, Paṇchen Śākya Chokden, Yikdrukpa Sherap Paljor, Jamyang Kunga Drolchok, the lord Karma Zangpo, Jamyang Śākya Tenzin, Khewang Śākya Norbu, Kunga Lekpa, Lochen Shenyen Namgyal, Gyaltsen Zangpo, Dolpo Paṇchen Chokle Namgyal, Tenpa Gyatso, Ngawang Kung Lhundrup, Nesarwa Lekpai Jungne, Tabkhe Gyatso, [62b] Khenpo Kalzang Namgyal, Lozang Tenzin Gyatso, Lhodrak Palden Drakpa, Lhatsun Döndrup Gyaltsen, and Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, in whose presence I received it.

From the cycles of the Drukpa school, the lineage of instruction for Mahāmudrā and the Six Dharmas passed from Vajradhara to Vajrapāṇi, Tilopa, and so forth to Pakmo Drupa, Lingje Repa, Tsangpa Gyare, and then from Darma Senge to Ngawang Chögyal as in the previous case of Standards for Authentic Teachings. It then passed to Pema Karpo, Chökyi Gönpo, and Ngawang Zangpo, after whom it is as in the previous case until Chökyi Nangwa, who passed it to Tenzin Chökyi Wangpo, the lord Könchok Tenzin, and my precious omniscient guru,[560] who transmitted it to me.
As for the lineage of the Indian source on “equal taste,” this passed from Vajradhara to Tilopa, Nāropa, Tepupa, and Rechung Dorje Drakpa, who concealed the text as a hidden treasure teaching that was revealed by Tsangpa Gyare, who then passed the lineage on to Önre Darma Senge, Zhönu Senge, Nyima Senge, Dorje Lingpa, Pökyapa, Chusumpa, the lord named Kunga Senge, the lord Khenpo Dorje Rinchen, Lodrö Senge, Khyentse Tokden, Lekpa Rinchen, Trulzhik Yönten Sangye, the lord Gyalwang,[561] Drupchen Śākya Yarpel, Ngawang Chögyal, Jamyang Chökyi Drakpa, Kunpong Gyumai Garkhen, Pema Karpo, and so on.
In the case of the manual of instructions on the “six cycles of equal taste” authored by Khachö Wangpo, the reading transmission is the same as for the Five Principles of Mahāmudrā.
With respect to the summation of the intent of “equal taste,” the lineage passed from Vajradhara to Tilopa, Nāropa, Tepupa, Rechungpa, Gyalwa Lore, Sumpa Repa, Lingje Repa, Tsangpa Gyare, Önre Darma Senge, Zhönu Senge, Nyima Senge, and Zhönu Nyima. Senge Sherap received it from the latter two and then passed it to Senge Rinchen, Senge Gyalpo, Kunga Senge, Dorje Rinchen, Lodrö Senge, Khyentse Tokden, Yönten Sangye, the lord Gyalwang, and so on as in the previous case. [63a]
Concerning the quintessence of our own tradition of teachings on interdependent origination, the lineage passed through the “seven heroic buddhas,”[562] Tsangpa Gyare, Darma Senge, Zhönu Senge, Nyima Senge, Senge Sherap, Senge Rinchen, Senge Gyalpo, Kunga Senge, Dorje Rinchen, Lodrö Senge, Lodrö Gyaltsen, Könsampa, Yönten Sangye, the lord Gyalwang, and after that as in the previous case.

The lineage for the Indian source text on guru sādhana, as well as the more ordinary and extraordinary versions of the profound path, passed from Vajradhara to Tilopa, Nāropa, Marpa, Milarepa, Dakpo Rinpoche, Pakmo Drupa, Tsangpa Gyare and from him down to Lodrö Senge as in the case of the Mahāmudrā teachings and others. It then passed to Dampa Ngonyalwa, Drupchen Könsampa, Trulzhik Namkhai Naljor, Gyalwang Chöje,[563] Ngagi Wangpo, Jamyang Chökyi Drakpa, Avadhūtipa, and Pema Karpo.
As for the eight primary instructions, the lineage down to Tsangpa Gyare is as in the former cases. From him it passed to Sangye Ön, Gyalwa Götsangpa, Yangönpa, Nyenre Namkha Gyaltsen, the lord Gyalwang, Ngawang Chögyal, and Pema Karpo. The lineage for the secondary instructions is the same as the foregoing.
In the case of the combined intent of the practical application of seven spiritual exercises, the lineage down to Tsangpa Gyare is as in the foregoing case, after which it passed to Dremowa, Khogom, Śilay Tachen, Chöje Nyima, Pöchapa, Chusumpa, the lord Jamyang, Khenchenpa, Lodrö Senge, Yeshe Rinchen, Sherap Zangpo, the lord Gyalwang, Ngagi Wangpo, Jamyang Chökyi Drakpa, the lord Kunpang, and to Pema Karpo.
From the venerable Pema Karpo, the foregoing lineages then passed to Lhatsewa Ngawang Zangpo, after whom they were the same as in the former case of the Mahāmudrā teachings.
The lineage for the quintessential summation of the “fivefold capability” from the lower branch of the Drukpa tradition passed from Tsangpa Gyare to Tsāri Repa and then to Jamyang Gönpo. Öntön received it from the latter two, after which he passed it to Gönpo Yeshe, Gyaltsen Zhönu, Könchok Wangpo, Khedrupa, Sangye Zangpo, [63b] Chökyi Wangchuk, Sangye Paljor, Śākya Wangchuk, Jamyang Chödrak, Sherap Gyatso, and Pema Karpo, after whom it is as in the previous cases. The transmission of the instructions is the same as for the 108 Instructions.
The advice on the six “mother” practices of the quintessential teachings for mountain retreat by Gyalwa Yangönpa was transmitted from Gyalwa Yangönpa to Chenga Rinchenden, Zurpukpa, Rinchen Palzang, the lord Barawa, Namkha Senge, Sönam Döndrup, Ritrö Rechen, the lord Mengom, Lachiwa, Khedrup Je, Khetsunpa, “the one named Gönpo,” Begompa,[564] Chökyi Lodrö, the lord Rikzin, Paldingwa, Langkharwa, Rapjam Chöje, Orgyen Yongdrak, Drodön Rapel, Kunzang Longyang, Lodrö Chöpel, Ngawang Yeshe, Ngawang Chödrak Gyatso, Chökyi Gyatso, Tsewang Jikme, Tsuklak Chökyi Gyalpo, Karma Tenpa, and the precious Dazang incarnation Karma Tenpa Rapgye, from whom I received it.

The lineage for both the instructions and reading transmission of the teaching cycles for Mahāmudrā according to the tradition of the lord Barawa passed from Barawa Gyaltsen Palzang to Jadralwa Pema Zangpo, Zurkhangpa Sönam Zangpo, Tulku Namkha Gyaltsen, Gungpa Namkha Dorje, Lhundrup Gyaltsen, Dzamling Sangye Chöpel, Mangyul Könchok Gyaltsen, Rinchen Tenpai Salje, Jetsun Lodrö Chöpel, Rikzin Tsewang Norbu, Barawa Ngawang Yeshe, Chödrak Gyatso, Chönyi Gyatso, and Chöying Dorje just as in the case of the “golden garland” of the Barawa tradition. It then passed to Zhalu Losal Tenkyong and my omniscient and all-seeing lord,[565] from who I received it.
Concerning the guru sādhana combined with Mahāmudrā and the Six Dharmas— which was concealed by the lord Barawa when he was dwelling at Bara Drakkar in Shang and revealed by the lord Lodrö Chöpel (who was an emanation of Śāvaripa)— [64a] the transmission of the ancient manuals passed from the revealer himself to the great master of awareness, and then afterward as in the main lineage.
As for the lineage of the guardian of these teachings, the four-armed Mahākāla from the tradition of Ga Lotsāwa, according to the transmission of Pakmo Drupa this passed from Vajradhara to Nāgārjunagarbha, Āryadeva, Aśvaghoṣa, *Vajrāsanapāda,[566] Abhayākaragupta, Tsami Sangye Drakpa, Ga Lotsāwa, Pakmo Drupa, Taklung Tangpa, Ratnanātha, Sangye Yarjön, Mangala Guru, Sangye Palzang, Ratna Guru, Ratnākara,[567] Kadrukpa Rinchen Palzang, Ba Ratna Sengha, Lama Mönlam Paljor, Ngawang Drakpa, Tsultrim Chokdrup, Namgyal Tashi, Jetsun Kunga Tashi, and Jetsun Tāranātha, after whom it is as in the foregoing cases. According to the transmission of Tsal, the lineage passed from Vajradhara to Vajrapāṇi, Indrabhūti, his consort Lakṣmīkarā, the nāga child *Munī, Rāhulabhadra, Nāgārjuna, Āryadeva, Aśvaghoṣa, Kālacakrapāda; alternatively it passed from Vajrayoginī to Ghaṇṭapāda, Anaṅgavajra, Garap Dorje, and Kālacakrapāda. It then passed from him to Abhayākara, Tsami, Ga Lotsāwa, Zhang Tsalpa, Lhachukpa, Sangye Tsalpa, Lama Samdzongpa, Lama Önpo, Kunkhyen Gyalpo, Lekpai Gyaltsen, Nyima Gyaltsen, Chechok Tarpawa, Drupchen Gyalbum, Zangpo Gyaltsen, Palden Sangye, Ngawang Drakpa, Kurakpa Jangsem Sherpal, Draktöpa Lhawang Drakpa, and Jetsun Tāranātha.

The lineage for the chapter extracted from the teaching cycles on the “coarse embodiment”[568] of the four-armed Mahākāla of timeless awareness (cycles that were transmitted from the glorious Pakmo Drupa and Taklung Tangpa and his successors) was at the outset the same as for the Tsal transmission of the four-armed protector. From Ga Lotsāwa, however, it passed to Aseng, Drogön Pakmo Drupa, Taklung Tangpa, Sangye Gompa, Khepawa, Tashi Lama,[569] Sangye Palzang, Ratna Guru, Ratna Kara, the great Kadrukpa, Chö Gyaltsen, Ngawang Drakpa, [64b] the master Tsultrim Chokdrup, the venerable Namgyal Tashi, the venerable Kunga Tashi, Ngawang Namgyal, Tashi Paldrup, Drakpa Lekdrup, Jampal Gyatso, Pakchok Ngawang Drakpa, Trinle Tenzin, Drakpa Tenzin Pel, Trinle Tenzin, Gelek Paljor, Drakpa Rinchen Lekdrup, Ngawang Tenpai Nyima, Lhatsun Jampal Dorje, and my omniscient and all-seeing lord guru,[570] by whose grace I received it.

The first of these categories is that of the cycles of source texts of vajra verses and their commentaries:
The lineage for the Six Dharmas as the root, Mahāmudrā as the trunk, the three means of maintaining ongoing awareness as the branches, the white and red forms of Khecarī as the flowers, and “unerring immortality” as the fruit (as well as the respective commentaries to the foregoing) is, prior to Tsangma Shangtön, as in the case below for the five-deity mandala of Cakrasaṃvara; from him it then passed to Muchen Gyaltsen Palzang, Lama Dorje Zhönu, Tsenden Namkhai Naljor, Jangsem Jinpa Zangpo, the mahāsiddhā Tangtong Gyalpo, Lodrö Gyaltsen the lineage holder of Mangkhar, Puhrang Khedrup Palden Darpo, Sönam Tsemo of Zhechen Monastery, Jetsun Kunga Drolchok, Lochen Gyurme Dechen, Khenchen Ngawang Chödrak, Ngawang Sönam Gyaltsen of Gyakhartse, Kapewa Ngawang Tenpa Rapgye, Mangtö Sönam Chöpel, Ngawang Kunga Lekpai Jungne, [65a] Pakpa Gelek Gyaltsen, Kunga Ngedön Nyingpo, and the seventh Chakzam incarnation Yeshe Lhundrup. Gelong Lozang Tenpel received it from the latter two and then passed it on to the eighth holder of the teachings Khyenrap Tutop, who transmitted it to my venerable lord guru Khyentse,[571] who in turn passed it to me.

The second category is that of cycles concerning the maturing empowerments and blessing rituals:
The first of the two transmissions of blessings that open the doorway to spiritual practice is that of the four levels of empowerment into the five-deity mandala of Cakrasaṃvara. The succession in the lineage of this empowerment passed from the sovereign lord Vajradhara to the ḍākinī of timeless awareness known as Nigupta (which means “she who is definitively hidden”), the learned and accomplished master Khyungpo Naljor, Mokchokpa, Öntön Kyergangpa, Nyentön Bepai Naljor, Drogön Sangye Tönpa, Khedrup Tsangma Shangtön, Khyungpo Tsultrim Gönpo, Jadral Ritrö Rechen, Khyenden Shangpa Karpo, Kuklungpa Nyame Sangye Palzang, Drupchen Namkha Gyaltsen, Gyagom Lekpa Gyaltsen, the lord Kunga Drolchok, Chöku Lhawang Drakpa, Doring Ön Kunga Gyaltsen, Sangdak Tāranātha, Gyaltsap Yeshe Gyatso, Jampa Yönten Gönpo, Jalu Gönpo Paljor, the lord Gönpo Drakpa, Drupwang Gönpo Namgyal, Rikzin Tsewang Norbu, Kagyu Trinle Shingta, Kunga Gelek Palbar, Kunga Lhundrup Gyatso, Drupchen Kagyu Tenzin, Drupnye Karma Lhaktong, and Drupwang Karma Zhenpen Özer, in whose presence I received it.
Following the Sakya school, the lineage for the other nine transmissions associated with the Six Dharmas (excepting the foregoing fourfold empowerment for Cakrasaṃvara), as well as for the transmissions of the three means of maintaining ongoing awareness and the transmission for “unerring immortality,” is, up to Sönam Chöpel, the same as for the reading transmission of the Vajra Lines. He then passed it to Sangye Tenpa, Sangye Palzang, Muchen Sönam Palzang, [65b] Kalden Chönyi Yeshe, Yeshe Gyalchok, Lodrö Gyatso, Jamgön Dorje Rinchen, and Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, who graciously bestowed it on me.

One lineage for the transmission of the empowerment for Mahāmudrā, which is in addition to the foregoing, passed from Shangtön to Khetsun Gyaltsen Bum, Jakchen Jampa Pal, Jakchung Lodrö Pal, Jakchung Kunga Palzang, Kunkhyen Chögyal Palzang, Trulzhik Tsultrim Gyaltsen, Khyenrap Rinchen Chokdrup, Doring Kunpang Chenpo, Tsarchen Losal Gyatso, Jamyang Khyentse Wangchuk, Dorjechang Wangchuk Rapten, Khenchen Ngawang Chödrak, Ngawang Sönam Gyaltsen, Ngawang Tenpa Rapgye, Mangtö Sönam Chöpel, Ngawang Kunga Lekpai Jungne, and Muchen Sönam Palzang, after whom it is as in the previous case.
As for the lineage of the three cycles of Khecarī, from Jakchenpa this passed to Jamyang Lodrö Palzang, and then from Jakchung Kunga Palzang down to Tsarchen as in the case of the Mahāmudrā lineage. It then passed to Azha Khyentse Wangchuk, Wangchuk Rapten, Ngawang Chödrak, Ngawang Sönam Gyaltsen, Gyalwa Lhundrup, and Sönam Chöpel, after whom it is as in the previous case.
Following the Jonang school, the lineage for the eight transmissions associated with the Six Dharmas (excepting the two empowerments for the five-deity mandala of Cakrasaṃvara) is, before Lhawang Drakpa, the same as for the Cakrasaṃvara transmission. It then passed to Jetsun Drolwai Gönpo,[572] Tutsun Kunga Sönam, Mokchokpa Jampa Lhundrup, the lord Jampa Yönten Gönpo, Ngawang Kunga Lhundrup, Tsoze Ngawang Lodrö, Trulzhik Ngawang Jamyang, Chöje Drakpa Chöpel, Lozang Tutop the Pönlop regent of Takten, Rinchen Losal Tenkyong, [66a] and my omniscient guru Mañjughoṣa,[573] by whose grace I received it.

In the case of the four levels of “empowerment through meditative absorption” for the five-deity Cakrasaṃvara mandala, from Jetsun Rinpoche[574] the lineage passed to Rangdrol Ngawang Chödrak, Gyaltsewa Ngawang Sönam Gyaltsen, Khenchen Gyalwa Lhundrup, Tromolungpa Sönam Chöpel, Kunga Lekpai Jungne, Muchen Sönam Palzang, Drupwang Chönyi Yeshe, Jampa Sönam Wangchuk, Drupwang Dönyö Dorje, Zhalu Choktrul Rinpoche, and my omniscient guru Mañjughoṣa.[575]
One lineage for the six transmissions of blessings that serve as the central axis of the tradition is the same as for the five-deity Cakrasaṃvara mandala; I received this version from Drupwang Karma Norbu.
The lineage for the transmission of blessing for the ḍākinī of timeless awareness Sukhasiddhi passed from Vajradhara to the ḍākinī Sukhasiddhi, Khedrup Khyungpo Naljor, Mokchokpa, Kyergangpa, Nyentön, Chöje Tönpa, Shangtön, Gyaltsen Bum, Jampa Pal, Lodrö Pal, Kunga Palzang, Sönam Zangpo, Chökyi Nyima, Ngawang Chökyi Gyaltsen, Kunga Chödrak, Namkha Chödar, Ngawang Kunga Döndrup, Ngawang Chödrak, Sönam Gyaltsen, Gyalwa Lhundrup, and Sönam Chöpel, after whom it is the same as for the general empowerment lineage following the Sakya school. This collection also includes lineages that follow the Tsarpa and Zhalu traditions.
The lineage for the empowerments into the three cycles of secret sādhanas is, from Khyungpo Naljor down to Ngawang Chödrak, the same as for the general lineage of transmission following the Sakya school. After that it passed to Jampa Ngawang Namgyal, Sakyapa Kunga Tashi, and the lord Sönam Chöpel, after whom it is again as in the previous case.
The lineage for the transmission of blessings for the sādhana practice that combines four deities is, until Ngawang Chödrak, as before; afterward it passed to Ngawang Sönam Gyaltsen, Serdok Chenpa Gyalwa Lhundrup, and Tromolungpa Sönam Chöpel, [66b] after whom it is as in the previous case.
As for the profound longevity empowerments of Niguma and Sukhasiddhi, these were bestowed by the two ḍākinīs of timeless awareness themselves on Bodong Jikme Drakpa[576] when he was sixteen years of age. He then passed the lineages on to Shangpa Rechen Sönam Chokgyur, Kunkhyen Jampa Chönyi (who was an emanation of Jikdral),[577] Paṇchen Pema Garwang, Chokdrapa Jamyang Drakpa Özer, and Rapjam Chöje (who was an emanation of Jampa Chönyi). “The incomparable one named Ratna” received these lineages from the latter two, after which they passed to Garwang Duchen Rapjam, Tulzhuk Namkhai Naljor, Mingyur Rinchen Zangpo, Tamche Khyenpa Gelek Gyaltsen, and Drodul Rikzin Chenmo. From the latter two the lineages passed to Kalzang Jamyang Namgyal and then to both Tamche Khyenpa Trinle Lhundrup and Khedrup Rikzin Namgyal, from both of whom these lineages passed to Khyapdak Dechen Tsomo, the lord guru Tsultrim Dorje, and the all-seeing Mañjughoṣa,[578] in whose presence and by whose grace I received them.

[The third category is that of the cycles of instructions:]
As for the lineage for works authored by the mahāsiddhā Tangtong Gyalpo—his instructions on the Six Dharmas, Mahāmudrā, the three means of maintaining ongoing awareness, the transference of consciousness for the red form of Khecarī, and his experientially based instructions for applying the Six Dharmas in a single session—in its extensive version this is the same as for the two lineages of empowerment following the Sakya school. The more direct lineage passed from Vajradhara to Niguma, mahāsiddhā Tangtong Gyalpo, Lodrö Gyaltsen, and so forth; the more direct lineage for the instructions in the transference of consciousness for the white form of Khecarī is the very same as the preceding. This is also the lineage of reading transmission for the manuals.
It was in the presence of Drupchen Karma Norbu that I received on three occasions instructions, both extensive and condensed, on the basis of the instruction manuals authored by Jonang Jetsun Rinpoche. As well, the lineage I received for the reading transmissions of the Profound Meaning That Covers the Plains (a manual of instructions for the Six Dharmas), the Supplementary Text to the Main Course of Instruction (a supplement to the primary instructions), and the source verses concerning the physical exercises is the same as for the five-deity Cakrasaṃvara mandala. [67a]
In the case of the detailed explanation of the sādhana for the five-deity Cakrasaṃvara mandala, authored by Jonang Jetsun Rinpoche, the lineage for the reading transmission passed from the author himself to Jatang Kunga Yeshe, Jampa Yönten Gönpo, Ngawang Kunga Lhundrup, Ngawang Kunga Zangpo, Kunzang Tenzin Gyatso, Yeshe Zangpo, Mokchokpa Kunga Lhundrup Gyatso, Kagyu Tenzin, Karma Lhaktong, and Karma Zhenpen Özer, from whom I received it.
In addition, in the presence of my omniscient guru Jamyang Khyentse I received the experientially based instructions for both the Six Dharmas and Mahāmudrā according to the manuals of Jetsun Rinpoche; the lineage for these is the same as for the Jonang school’s transmission of the Six Dharmas. The lineage for the reading transmission of the texts alone passed from Jetsun Tāranātha to Jatang Kunga Yeshe, Jampa Yönten Gönpo, Ngawang Kunga Lhundrup, Kunga Sönam Lhundrup, Ngawang Kunga Zangpo, Lozang Khedrup Tendar, Kunga Lhundrup Gyatso, Tenzin Yeshe Lhundrup, Gelong Lozang Tenpel, Tenzin Khyenrap Tutop, and my lord guru Khyentse, from whom I received it.

The lineage for the experientially based instructions for the Six Dharmas of Sukhasiddhi passed from Vajradhara to Nairātmyā, Virūpa, Sukhasiddhi, Khyungpo Naljor and down to Shangtön as in the general lineage. It then passed to Rikpai Dorje, Khutön Tsultrim Gönpo, Chöpal Zangpo, Tsultrim Gyaltsen, Zhalu Khyenrap Chöje, Zhönu Chokdrup, Kunga Drolchok Semkyi Dudrol, Chöku Lhawang Drakpa, and Jetsun Tāranātha, after whom it is the same as for the 108 Instructions of the Jonang tradition.
As for the instructions concerning the sādhana practice that combines four deities, the lineage is the same as for the transmission of blessing already discussed.
The lineage for the reading transmission of various ancient manuals, such as the three “sealed” texts, is the same as for the lineage for the more mainstream transmissions following the Sakya school.
In the case of the torma empowerment for the ḍākinīs of the five families, the lineage passed from the ḍākinī Siṁhamukhā to the powerful lord of siddhās Khyungpo Naljor, [67b] Geshe Ghapa Chögyal, Tokden Zhangom Chökyi Senge, Öntön Kyergangpa, Nyentön Bepai Naljor, Drogön Sangye Tönpa, Lopön Nenyingpa Ai Senge, Serlingpa Tashi Pal, Drakchenpa Dorje Pal, Jatang Chui Naljor, Khutön Tsultrim Gönpo, Sumchu Chödrakpa, Nyamepa, Chöku Śākya Rinchen, Ngawang Lodrö, Gyagom Chenpo, Jetsun Kunga Drolchok, Chöku Lhawang Drakpa, Jetsun Tāranātha, Gyaltsap Yeshe Gyatso, and Rinchen Dorje. Nyingpo Taye requested this transmission from the latter two, and after him it passed as in the previous cases.
In the case of the “swift-acting lord protector of timeless awareness,” the six-armed form of Mahākāla, there are forms associated with the five families: the black form to dispel obstacles, the white form, the yellow form, the red form, and the green form. The lineage for these passed from Vajradhara to Śavaripa to Maitrīpa; or, alternatively, from Vajradhara to Abhayavajra, Rāhula, Khedrup Khyungpo Naljor, Mokchokpa, and Zhangom Chökyi Senge. From the latter two it passed to Kyergangpa, the great Nyentön, Sangye Tönpa, Khedrup Shangtön, and down to Tāranātha as in the case of the five-deity Cakrasaṃvara mandala. After him it passed down in the same manner as in the aforementioned case of the guardians of the teachings in general. An alternative lineage that I received in the presence of Drupwang Lama Karma Norbu is the same as for the five-deity Cakrasaṃvara mandala. As for the lineage of the dark blue-black form of the lord protector to dispel obstacles, following the Sakya school this is as in the previous case down to Shangtön, after whom it passed to Khetsun Gyaltsen Bum, Khyungpo Tsultrim Gönpo, Sangye Senge, Tulku Sangye Dorje, Tarpa Palzang, Drinchen Sangye Namgyal, Tsarchen Dorjechang, Jamyang Khyentse Wangchuk, Wangchuk Rapten, Ngawang Chödrak, Ngawang Sönam Gyaltsen, Ngawang Tenpa Rapgye, Mangtö Sönam Chöpel, Drenchok Sangye Tenpa, [68a] Khenchen Sangye Palzang, Khyapdak Chönyi Yeshe, Yeshe Gyalchok, Lodrö Gyatso, Vajra Ratna, and my lord guru Mañjughoṣa,[579] in whose presence I received it.

As for the white form of the lord protector, the lineage following the Sakya school passed from Vajradhara to Śavaripa, Maitrīpa, Rāhula, and the mahāsiddhā Khyungpo Naljor down to Gyaltsewa Sönam Gyaltsen, as in the case of the lineage for the general transmissions following the Sakya school. It then passed to Khechok Tashi Palden, Khamtön Sangye Palzang, Khedrup Sangye Puntsok, Wangla Kunga Tenzin, Khenchen Sangye Palzang, Muchen Sangye Palzang, and Muchen Chönyi Yeshe, after whom it is the same as for the transmission following the Sakya school as clearly outlined previously. The lineages following the Ngor school and others are subsumed as one with this lineage.
In the case of the remaining transmissions, such as that of the inseparability of guru and protector, as well as the practice of the lord protector “entering the heart center” and Kṣetrapāla, the lineage for the authorization rituals down to Khedrup Tsangma Shangtön is the same as for the protector dispelling obstacles. It then passed successively to Khetsun Gyaltsen Bum, Jakchen Jampa Pal, Kunkhyen Sherap Palzang, Sempa Chenpo Tsultrim Palzang, the lord Rinchen Shenyen, the lord Lekpai Lodrö, the lord Kyapchok Palzang, Ensapa Lozang Döndrup, Khedrup Sangye Yeshe, Paṇchen Chökyi Gyaltsen, the vajra holder Könchok Gyaltsen, and Ngawang Tenzin Trinle. It then passed to Lhatsun Döndrup Tenpai Gyaltsen and to my omniscient precious guru.[580] An alternative lineage from Shangtön passed to Muchen Gyaltsen Palzang, Ngakchang Dorje Zhönu, Tsenden Namkhai Naljor, Khedrup Gelek Palzang, Baso Chökyi Gyaltsen, Trulzhik Rinchen Shenyen, Rapjam Mawa Sangye Gyatso, [68b] and the lord Kyapchok Palzang, after whom it is as in the previous case.
The lineage for the instructions on the inseparability of guru and protector is the same as for the general transmission for empowerment following the Sakya school (in the version that includes Tangtong Gyalpo). The lineage for the instructions on the practice of the lord protector known as “entering the heart center” is as in the case of the formal authorization up until the lord Khedrup,[581] after whom it passed to Baso Chökyi Gyaltsen, the lord Sherap Senge, Gyuchen Jinpa Pal, Sera Chökyi Gyaltsen, Khedrup Rinchen Zangpo, the lord Sangye Samdrup, Paljor Dargye, Lozang Jamyang, Lozang Tokme, Tangsakpa Ngödrup Gyatso, Jamyang Dewai Dorje, Khenchen Gendun Gyatso, Könchok Jikme Wangpo, Könchok Tenpai Drönme, Palripa Könchok Dechen, Detri Jamyang Tupten Nyima, Lhatsun Döndrup Yeshe Tenpai Gyaltsen, Kachen Lozang Gelek, and Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, in whose presence I received it. The lineage for the manual of this practice passed from Rolpai Dorje to Gelong Gelek Namkha, Changlungpa Paṇḍita Lozang Tenpai Gyaltsen, Gyal Khenchen Drakpa Gyaltsen, Detri Tupten Nyima, Lozang Chödrak Gyatso, Lhatsun Döndrup Gyaltsen, and so forth as before.
With respect to the torma ritual for the six-armed Mahākāla and other such works by Jetsun Rinpoche, the lineage for their reading transmission passed from the lord Tāranātha himself to Gyaltsap Rinchen Gyatso, Lodrö Namgyal, Ngawang Trinle, Kunzang Wangpo, Tsewang Norbu, Pawo Tsuklak Gawa, Tsewang Kunkhyap, Karma Ratna, and Karma Ösel Gyurme, from whom I received it.

• In the first place the lineage for the fourfold vase empowerment (employing the volumes) passed from the buddha Vajradhara to the feminine consort Nairātmyā, and the nirmāṇakāya Padampa Sangye.
• The lineage for the fourfold secret empowerment (employing the nectar from the skull cup) passed from the sambhogakāya Vairocana and consort to the thirty-six marvelous gurus who attained Khecara and to Dampa Rinpoche.
• The lineage of the fourfold empowerment of intelligence leading to awareness (which depends on the physical exercises and the means of settling the mind) passed from Śākyamuni to Maitreya, Asaṅga, Vasubandhu, Āryadeva, and Dampa Rinpoche.
• The lineage of the fourfold word empowerment (which depends on the ultimate empowerment into the very essence of being) passed from Vajradhara to Guhyapati (Lord of Secrets), Sukhasiddhi, and the lord Dampa.
• For the three levels of the guru sādhana (outer, inner, and secret) and the twelve sugatas resting in meditation, my guru said that the lineage is the same as for the secret empowerment. [69b] (In certain sources, it would seem the lineage for the twelve sugatas passed from Vajradhara to Vairocana, Śākyamuni, Vajrapāṇi, the ḍākinī Dhatvātmā, and Dampa Sangye.)
• As for Cakrasaṃvara, the lineage passed from Vajradhara to Cakrasaṃvara, Śavaripa, Maitrīpa, and Dampa Sangye.
• In the case of the black wrathful goddess Kālī Kruddha, the lineage passed from the black Vārāhī to the ḍākinīs of the four families to Dampa.
• The lineage of both the major and minor forms of caṇḍālī passed from Vajra Caṇḍālī to Dampa of India.
• The lineage of Aghora passed from Mahākāla to Dampa of India.

As for the lineage of general transmission that proceeded from the foregoing, this passed from the venerable Dampa of India to Gyalse Jangsem Kunga, Tsultrim Bar of Dratsap Monastery, the “three brothers who were lions of speech in the sutra tradition” (that is, the siddhā Gyalwa Tene, Rok Sherap Özer, and Zhikpo Nyima Senge), Rok Tamche Khyenpa Sönam Pal, Rok Gyalse Kunga Zangpo and his brother Kunga Döndrup, Tsenden Ritrö Wangchuk, Khenchen Tsultrim Penpa, and Drinchen Sangye Önpo; alternatively, it passed from the “brothers named Kunga”[582] to Gyatön Mönlam Sherap and then from him and Sangye Önpo. It then passed to the brothers named Damchö Kunkhyen, Gyagom Dorje Denpa, and Jangsem Jinpa Gyatso (alternatively, it passed from the elder Kunkhyen brother, Jangchup Zangpo, to Chöje Lodrö Gyatso, Rechen Palden Sönam, Tukse Sönam Özer, Sönam Palzang of Lungchen, and Gyatso Jinpa).[583] From them it passed to Kusumpa Dechen Lhundrup, Khedrup Namkha Zangpo, Jamyang Paljor Lhundrup, Khyapdak Paljor Puntsok, Tsungme Tashi Zangpo, Chime Lodrö Tenpa of Dingri, Chime Zhönu Lodrö, Ngawang Kunga Lekpai Jungne, Khenpo Losal Rapgye of Samye Monastery, Pakpa Gelek Gyaltsen, Trichen Gyurme Trinle Namgyal, Jetsunma Gyurme Trinle Chödrön, and my omniscient guru Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, [70a] who thought of me with delight and graciously bestowed the lineage on me.

As for the outer and inner practices of Vajravārāhī, the lineage passed from Dampa Rinpoche to Jñānaguhya of Kashmir, Puhrang Lochung, Martön Chökyi Gyalpo, Geshe Yomi Gompa, Sheu Tönpa Namkha, Ritröpa Śākya Tönpa, Rokpa Deshek Sherap Özer, and Nyedowa, after whom it is the same as in the previous case.
With respect to the secret sādhana of the black wrathful goddess Kālī Kruddha, from Dampa Sangye the lineage passed to Drokchung Könchok Senge, Shangpa Ludem, and then from him it was transmitted to the ḍākinī’s four gurus,[584] and from them to Lapkyi Drönma, Khyijema, Cherbuma, Bermo Rozen, and then to Gyalwa Tene, after whom it is the same as in the previous case.
The lineage of the lord protector Aghora was received from both Dampa Sangye and Zhama Lotsāwa by Kunga,[585] after whom it is the same as in the previous case.
In the case of the patron Norbu Zangpo, the lineage passed from Guhyapati[586] to Padampa, Gyalse Jangsem Kunga, Dro Chötsön, Chupa Darma Tsöndru, Gyalwa Tene, and Chögyal Zhikpo and his brother, after whom it is the same as in the previous case.
Although the extensive lineage for the transmissions of blessings and authorization rituals from the initial and intermediate lines of transmission is parallel to the transmission of instructions explained below, after Lochen Dharmaśrī the line was interrupted and no longer extant.[587] However, given that there are many lineages of deities and mantras taken from other sources that are essentially identical to these, in actuality the lineage has remained unbroken. And that is not all, for it seems that Dampa Sangye actually revealed his embodiment of timeless awareness to my lord guru Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, who was master of the seven modes of personal transmission, bestowing advice and formal authorizations specifically on him. After I had supplicated him fervently, with enormous kindness my guru bestowed on me the lineage of the empowerments, authorization rituals, and reading transmissions with his supreme motivation that these teachings endure in an ongoing way.

The third section comprises the cycles of advice and instructions:
From the initial line of transmission, the lineage for the instructions on the “Three Lamps”[588] from the Lord of Sages passed to Vajrapāṇi, Tārā, Nāgārjuna, the miraculously born Āryadeva, Dampa Sangye, Jñānaguhya of Kashmir, and Önpo Palden Sherap. [70b] Lotön Tsunchung of central Tibet received the lineage from both of the latter two, then passed it on to his son Dorje Gyaltsen, Chupa Darma Tsöndru, Chupa Darma Senge, Rok Sherap Ö, Tamche Khyenpa Sönam Pal, Gyalse Kunga Zangpo and his brother,[589] Gyatön Mönlam Sherap, the brothers named Kunkhyen, Gyagom Dorje Denpa, Jangsem Jinpa Gyatso, Kusumpa Dechen Lhundrup, Khedrup Namkha Zangpo, Jamyang Paljor Lhundrup, Khyapdak Paljor Puntsok, Kunpang Tashi Zangpo, Jetsun Lodrö Tenpa, and Chime Zhönu Lodrö, after whom it is the same as the lineage for empowerment.
From the intermediate line of transmission, of the masters Ma, So, and Kaṃ:
[1.] In the first case the lineage of instructions for what became renowned as the “advice of the oral lineage”—the Mahāmudrā teachings of Ma[590]— passed from Vajradhara to Vādisiṃha Mañjuśrī, the lord Dampa of India, Madrom Chökyi Sherap, Dode Drak of Mongolia, the siddhā Gyalwa Tene, Rok Sherap Ö, Zhikpo Nyima Senge, and Tamche Khyenpa Sönam Pal, after whom it is the same as for the initial line of transmission.
[2.] As for the instructions of So[591] for “perceiving pure awareness in all its nakedness,” the lineage passed from Vādisiṃha Mañjuśrī to Virūpa, Āryadeva, Dampa Sangye, So Gendun Bar, Shami Mönlam Bar, and Trulzhik Metön; or, alternatively, from Shami to Chupa Darma Tsöndru, Chupa Tsöndru Senge. The latter and Trulzhik Metön passed the lineage to Rok Sherap Ö, and from him it passed to Chöje Tamche Khyenpa, after whom it is the same as for the initial line of transmission.
[3.] In the case of the instructions of Kaṃ[592] on the quintessential meaning of the transcendent perfection of wisdom, the lineage passed from the Lord of Sages to Maitreya, Asaṅga, Vasubandhu, the brahmin Āryadeva, the lord Dampa Sangye, Kaṃtön Yeshe Gyaltsen, Khutön Wangchuk Lama, Chaktön Rinchen Drup, Tötön Śākya Senge, Rangtön Darma Sönam, the lord Godrak, Tsenden Ritrö Wangchuk, Khenchen Dusum Sangye, Drinchen Sangye Ön, and the brothers named Kunkhyen, after whom it is the same as for the initial line of transmission.

<d e="2">
From the final line of transmission, the lineage for the definitive instruction on the five paths passed from the dharmakāya Vajradhara to the sambhogakāya goddess Nairātmyā, the twelve sugatas “resting in meditation,” the twenty-four ḍākinīs of the three places, the thirty-six glorious ones, the fifty-five siddhās, the venerable Dampa Sangye, the unborn Gyalse Jangsem Kunga, Khetsun Patsap Gompa, and the siddhā Gyalwa Tene, after whom it is the same as for the foregoing cases.
My guru also said that it was fine to consider these lineages of instruction to be the same as the lineages for the reading transmissions described below. As for the lineage of instruction in the five paths that is included in the 108 Instructions, it is the same as for that collection.
I received the reading transmission for the manual of instructions for Zhije authored by Nyedo Sönam Pal, and embellished with verses at the beginning and end by my lord guru, from the author himself.
The lineage for the texts of the supplication to the lineage of gurus entitled Golden Garland, the empowerment ceremonies collected and arranged for recitation, and the collection of instruction manuals entitled Distilled Nectar passed from the author, Lochen Dharmaśrī, to Gyalse Rinchen Namgyal, Khenchen Orgyen Tenzin Dorje, Trichen Trinle Namgyal, Gyurme Trinle Chödrön, and my lord guru Mañjughoṣa, from whom I received it.
The reading transmissions for the thirty prayers of aspiration of Dampa and the thirteen prayers of aspiration by Kunga are the same as in the foregoing cases.

As for the lineage of reading transmission for the commentary on the Great Bundle of Precepts, authored by Rangjung Dorje,[595] this passed from Rangjung Dorje [72a] down to Jampa Kunga Tenpai Gyaltsen as in the former case, after which it passed to Kunga Palden, my lord guru, and then to me.

With respect to the empowerments that “open the doorway”:
The lineage of opening the doorway to the teachings through the bestowal of empowerment based on a torma, which is from the Zurmang tradition, began with Machik Lapkyi Drönma, who brought together four mainstream transmissions: the father tantra lineage of skillful means, the mother tantra lineage of wisdom, the nondual lineage of ultimate meaning, and the lineage of meditative experience that brings freedom on the basis of the teachings. Then, according to the lineage of her students, it passed to Khugom Chökyi Senge, Dolpa Zangtal, Gyanak Cherbu, Sangye Raptön, Zalmo Depa Sherap, Sumpa Gomchen, Dringom Tokme, and the Gyalwang Karmapa Rangjung Dorje. According to the lineage of her offspring, from Machik the lineage passed to Khampu Yale, Yeshe Bar, Sangye Nyima Bar, and the lord Rangjung Dorje. From him these lineages then passed to Senge Palwa, Wangchuk Dorje, Könchok Palwa, Özer Gyaltsen, Palden Rinchen, Sangye Tashi, Sangye Rinchen, Zung Kunga Namgyal, Garwang Karma Tenkyong, Sönam Gyurme, Könchok Tenzin, Drupgyu Tenpa Namgyal, Sungrap Gyatso, Kunkhyen Chökyi Jungne, Drupchok Delek Rapgye, Drungpa Gyurme Tenpel, and the incarnate upholder of the teachings Karma Drupgyu Tenzin, who bestowed it on me.
The lineage for the Gyaltang tradition of the empowerment into Severance passed from the supreme mother Prajñāpāramitā to the transcendent and accomplished conqueror Śākyamuni, Vādisiṃha Mañjuśrī, the venerable Tārā, Vajravārāhī, Sukhasiddhi, Āryadeva, [72b] Dampa Sangye, Sönam Lama, Machik Lapkyi Drönma, Khugom Chökyi Senge, Dolpa Zangtal, Gyanak Cherbu, Sangye Raptön, Sangye Gelong, Rinchen Ö, Tsatsa Repa, Drakpa Gyaltsen, Khenpo Chörin, Rinchen Gangpa, Khenchen Dusum Sangye, “the one named Zhönu,” Samten Rinchen, and so forth. Machik actually revealed
herself to Gyaltangpa Samten Özer in a vision and conferred on him the blessings and advice of both the extensive and more direct lineages. From him these passed successively to Namkha Özer, Śākya Özer, Delek Gyaltsen, Önse Chölek, Yikdruk Shepal, Kunga Drolchok, Lhawang Drakpa, Lungrik Gyatso, Tāranātha, Chakzampa Kunga Sönam, Kunga Yeshe, Yönten Gönpo, Kunga Lhundrup, Chöying Dorje, Sangye Dorje, Ngawang Trinle, Chöpel Gyatso, Kunga Namgyal, Könchok Jikme Wangpo, Könchok Senge, Könchok Tenchö, Lhatsun Döndrup Gyaltsen, and my lord guru Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, who graciously bestowed them on me personally.

Concerning the stages of instructions:
The lineage of instructions in the Zurmang tradition of Severance is, in the earlier stages, the same as for the empowerment of that tradition. From Sungrap Gyatso, however, this lineage passed to Garwang Chökyong Namgyal, Rechung Sherap Gyatso, Tokden Tenzin Namdak, Lhalung Karma Desal, and Karma Tekchok Tenpel, in whose presence I received it.
The reading transmission for the instructions in Severance authored by the venerable Rangjung Dorje is the same as above for the Great Bundle of Precepts.
The reading transmission for the notes on Severance authored by Tokden Namdak is, from the author onward, the same as the lineage of instruction. The reading transmission for the manual of instructions authored by Tāranātha, according to the Gyaltang tradition, [73a] is parallel to the lineage for the empowerment.
The lineage of instruction in Severance according to the fifth Zhamar’s writing, taken from the “recordless” teachings on practicing Severance in challenging environments, passed from Könchok Yenlak to Wangchuk Dorje, Chökyi Wangchuk, Lungrik Nyima, Karma Chakme, Tsöndru Gyatso, Pema Döndrup, Pema Lhundrup, Dechen Nyingpo, Chöla (“Severance Master”) Karma Trinle, Karma Döndam, Tenzin Gelek Nyima, Tokden Könchok Gyaltsen, and my lord guru, from whom I received it.
As for the arrangement of liturgies for the “gift of the body” and “feeding” authored by Karma Chakme, the transmission passed from him down to Dechen Nyingpo as in the previous case, following which it passed to the vajra master Karma Tenzin, from whom I received it.
The lineage of reading transmission for the activities for group rituals arranged by the Gyalwang Karmapa Tekchok Dorje is, up until Gelek Rapgye,
the same as the lineage of empowerment. Following him it passed to Garwang Chökyong Gyurme, Pema Nyinje Wangpo, the Gyalwang Karmapa Tekchok Dorje, and the Chöwang incarnation, from whom I received it.

In the second section, that of the empowerments that bring maturation:
The lineage of the extraordinary higher “sublime empowerments” passed from the holy original buddha to the transcendent and accomplished conqueror Śākyendra,[597] the dharma king Sucandra, the dharma king and lord of the tenth level Devendra, Tejasvin, Somadatta, Deveśvara, Viśvamurti, and Sureśana, the Kalkī ruler Mañjuśrī Yaśas, Puṇḍarīka, Bhadra, Vijaya, Sumitra, Raktapāṇi, Viṣṇugupta, Sūryakīrti, Subhadra, Samudravijaya, Ajaya, Sūrya, Viśvarūpa, Candraprabha, Ananta, Pārthiva, [73b] Śrīpāla, Kālacakrapāda the Elder Mañjuvajra, Kālacakrapāda the Younger Śrībhadra, the son Bodhibhadra, Somanātha of Kashmir, Dro Lotsāwa Sherap Drak, Lhaje Könchok Sung, Drotön Namlatsek, the mahāsiddhā Yumowa Mikyö Dorje, his son Dharmeśvara, the learned Namkha Özer, his consort Jobuma, Semo Chewa Namkha Gyaltsen, Jamsarwa Sherap Özer, Kunkhyen Chöku Özer, Kunpang Tukje Tsöndru, Jangsem Gyalwa Yeshe, Khetsun Yönten Gyatso, Kunkhyen Dolpo Sherap Gyaltsen, Chöje Chokle Namgyal, Nya Ön Kunga Pal, Drupchen Kunga Lodrö, Könchok Zangpo, Namkha Chökyong, Namkha Palzang, Ratna Bhadra, the lord Kunga Drolchok, Khenchen Lungrik Gyatso, the omniscient Tāranātha, Gyaltsap Rinchen Gyatso, the lord Lodrö Namgyal, his nephew Ngawang Trinle, the siddhā Kunzang Wangpo, the great master of awareness from Katok Monastery,[598] the omniscient Tenpai Nyinje,[599] Kagyu Trinle Namgyal, and Vajradhara Pema Nyinje Wangpo, by whose grace I received it. An alternate lineage passed from Tenpai Nyinje to Tsewang Kunkhyap, Wangyal Dorje, Tsuklak Chökyi Gyalpo, and the Gyalwang Karmapa Tekchok Dorje. And again, from Tsewang Kunkhyap a lineage passed to Karma Ratna and then to Karma Ösel Gyurme. Through the kindness of my teachers I thus received three transmissions of this lineage, which is solely that of the Dro tradition.
As for the Ra tradition, the lineage passed from the original buddha through the seven dharma kings, the Kalkī ruler Mañjughoṣa Yaśas,[600] Puṇḍarīka, Cilu Paṇḍita, Piṇḍo Ācārya, Kālacakrapāda the Elder and Younger, Mañjukīrti, Sumantaśrī, Ra Chörap, Ra Yeshe Senge, Ra Bumseng, Ga Lotsāwa Namgyal Dorje, Rongpa Sherap Senge, Pakö Yönten Gyatso, Butön Rinchen Drup, Tukse Rinchen Namgyal, Jamyang Drakpa Gyaltsen, [74a] Sharchen Yeshe Gyaltsen,[601] Khyenrap Chöje,[602] Könchok Palzang, Jangling Tashi Gyaltsen, Jamyang Khyentse Wangchuk, Wangchuk Rapten, Rinchen Sönam Chokdrup, Ludrup Gyaltsen, Mönlam Lhundrup, Lozang Khetsun, Lozang Jampal Zangpo, Jampa Chöpel, Yeshe Paljor, Rinchen Losal Tenkyong, and Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, in whose presence I received it.
In this way, the traditions of Dro and Shang, the direct lineage, and the great paṇḍita Vanaratna were united as one mainstream transmission.

<d e="2">
In the third section, that of the instructions:
The lineage for the instructions on the Vajrayoga of the Six Branches of Union was primarily transmitted as in the case of the Jonang lineage for the sublime empowerments. I received the primary instructions and affiliated texts once from Pema Nyinje Wangpo. There is also a lineage through Ngawang Trinle, Ngawang Namgyal, Ngawang Drime, and the holy guide Ngawang Chöpel, in whose presence I also received experientially based instruction on one occasion.
The reading transmission for the instruction manual Meaningful on Sight, which I received in the presence of Pema Nyinje Wangpo, came through the same lineage as the transmission of the empowerments.
The lineage for the works of Jonang Jetsun Rinpoche—the sādhana for the nine-deity mandala, the ritual for honoring the foregoing, the texts for the sublime empowerments, the instruction manual, the manuals of the signs and authentic measure of practice, the ways to dispel hindrances, and the summary of the physical exercises—passed from Jetsun himself to Gyaltsap Rinchen Namgyal, Lodrö Namgyal, Ngawang Trinle, Kunzang Wangpo, Tsewang Norbu, Chökyi Jungne, Tsewang Kunkhyap, Ngedön Tenzin Rapgye (who was also known as Karma Ratna), and Karma Ösel Gyurme, who conferred it on me.
The lineage of the reading transmission for Drops of Nectar on the Profound Path, authored by Rikzin Tsewang Norbu, passed from the lord Rikzin himself to Orgyen Tenzin Dorje, Kunzang Tsewang Döndrup Palwa, Barawa Tsewang Jikme Tenzin, and the glorious Pawo Tsuklak Chökyi Gyalpo, from whom I received it. [74b]
The reading transmission for the main source text of the mahāsiddhā Anupamarakṣita (known as the intermediate version of the Six Branches of Union), as well as for the instructions on this entitled Analyzing the Vajra Lines, authored by Pema Karpo, passed from Avalokiteśvara to Anupamarakṣita, Sadhuputra, Bhāskaradeva, Dharmākaraśānti, Raviśrī, Ratnarakṣita, Narendrabodhi, Muktipakṣa, Śākyarakṣita, Buddhaghoṣa, Vanaratna, the lord Gyalwang, Ngawang Chögyal, Jamyang Chödrak, Sherap Gyatso, and the venerable Pema Karpo, after whom it is the same as the lineages for the major and minor instructions of the Drukpa tradition.

For the concise version of the techniques, the source text of advice on “placing the tip of the tongue against the palate,” as well as the instruction on this entitled Short Path of the Vajra Holder, which was authored by Pema Karpo, the reading transmission passed from Śavaripa to Vanaratna, and then as in the previous case.
The lineage for the authorization ritual for the connate form of Kālacakra passed from Akṣobhyavajra, Rāhulaśrī, Vimalaśrī, Vikhyātadeva, Buddhaśrī, Tropu Lotsāwa, Khenpo Sönam Wangchuk, Tropu Sempa Chenpo, Yangtsewa Rinchen Senge, Drachompa Yönten Lodrö, Changlungpa Chenpo, Paṇchen Śākya Chokden, Jangsem Sherap Paljor, Jetsun Kunga Drolchok, Khenchen Lungrik Gyatso, and Tāranātha, after whom it is the same as in the case of Kartarīdhara Mahākāla and so forth in the general lineage of the Rinjung collection.
In the case of the authorization ritual for the wrathful Vajravega and the sixty guardians, it is sufficient to trace the lineage as in the case of the Dro tradition of Kālacakra. Alternatively, it passed from Abhayākaragupta to Sucarita, Ananta, Ratnarakṣita, Vibhūticandra, Martön Yangbar, Kungpang Chenpo Tukje Tsöndru, Jangsem Gyalwa Yeshe, Khetsun Yönten Gyatso, the Great Omniscient One of Jonang,[603] Garongpa Lhayi Gyaltsen, the lord Tsönpawa, Dakchen Namgyal Drakpa, Shangtön Kunga Palden, Paṇchen Namkha Palzang, the lord Sher Trepa, the lord Kunga Drolchok, Khenchen Kunga Gyaltsen, and Jetsun Tāranātha, after whom it is parallel to the previous case. [75a]
With respect to the transmissions of the main source texts and commentaries of these, they were subsumed within the lineages of empowerment and instruction, and so the lineage in the ultimate sense of blessing has remained unbroken. And even though the actual lineage of textual transmission was not maintained in later times, I have included these texts in this collection with the intention of providing some scriptural continuity, since the main sources are an indispensable component.

The lineage for the Sutra-Based Severance of the Sage passed from the supreme mother Prajñāpāramitā to Śākyamuni, Paṇchen Chokle Namgyal, Ngawang Drakpa, Chime Palzang, Sangye Lhundrup, and Namkha Özer, after whom it is the same as the lineage for caṇḍalī.
The lineage for instruction and reading transmission for Inserting a Stalk of Grass, the transference of consciousness that constitutes the third Golden Teaching of Bodong Rechenpa, passed from Vajradhara to Vajrayoginī, the ḍākinī of timeless awareness Niguma, Rechen Paljor Zangpo, Dorje Denpa Kunga Namgyal, Jamyang Jangchup Wangyal, Paṇchen Dewai Dorje, Lhawang Trinle, Tsultrim Tashi, Trinle Namgyal, Jampa Tenpa Gyatso, [78b] from both of them to Khenchen Lodrö Wangchuk, Chöwang Gyatso, Namgyal Yarpel, from both of the latter two to Kunga Chöpel, Kunga Chödar, Tenzin Tsultrim, and my omniscient and precious guru,[609] from whom I received it. An alternative lineage passed from Rechen to Drigung Khenchen Namgön Drimede, and from both of them to Gyatön Jangchup Wangyal, after whom it is the same as before. In accordance with tradition, following the instruction on the transference of consciousness, I also received the reading transmission for the “three Oṃ” dhāraṇī of longevity.

From the newer translation by Jonang Jetsun Rinpoche of the six modes of personal transmission[610] according to the mahāsiddhā Śāntigupta’s tradition:
[1.] The lineage for the teachings on the stage of development passed from Vajradhara to Buddhaguhya, Dipaṃkarabhadra, Vaidyapāda, and Buddhaśrīśānti; alternatively, it passed from Buddhajñāna to Padmākara, Ratnaśīla, Kāyastha the Elder, Durhari, Vaidyapāda, and Avadhūtipa. These lines then converged as one lineage passed to Ratnākaragupta, Abhayākara, Puṇyākaragupta, Daśabalaśrī, Vajraśrī, Dharmaśrībhadra, Buddhakīrti, Ratnakīrti, Ratīgupta, and the glorious lord protector of beings Śāntigupta.
[2.] The lineage for Mahāmudrā passed from Vajradhara to Saraha, Nāgārjuna, Śavaripa, Lūipa, Darikapa, Diṅgipa, Antarapa, Tilopa, Ḍombipa, Kusālipa, [79a] Asitaghana, Jñānamitra (or, alternatively, from the powerful lord Śavaripa, Maitrīpa, Gangādhari, Jñānamitra), and Śāntigupta.
[3.] The lineage for caṇḍalī passed from the Vajra Queen to the glorious black dharmapāla Virūpa, Vyāḍhalipa, Kusālipa (or, alternatively, from Virūpa to Ḍombipa, Caṇḍalīyogi, Ratīvajra, Kṛṣṇacārin, Singhalima, Dūrjayacandra, Rāhulavajra, Danaśrī, Sauripa, Kusalībhadra, Asitaghana, Jñānamitra), and Śāntigupta.
[4.] The lineage for utter lucidity passed from Vajradhara to Paramāśvapāda, Vīnasa, Yogicintama, Ghaṇṭapāda, Lavapa, Indrabhūti, Bālapāda, Kṛṣṇacārin, Guhyapa, Antarapa, Tilopa, Nāropa, the sublime and glorious Ḍombipa, Kusālipa (or, alternatively, from Antarapa to Kṛṣṇacārin the Younger, Bhūhari, Bhūvamatimat, Kusālibhadra, Asitaghana, Jñānamitra), and Śāntigupta.
[5.] The lineage for karmamudrā passed from Vajradhara to Indrabhūti, Sukhalalitā, Padmavajra, Saukarika, Saroruhapāda, Indrabhūti the Younger, Jalandharipa, Kāṇhapa, Pariṇāyaka, Amṛtavajra, Kusālipa (or, alternatively, from Indrabhūti to Padmākara, Kusāli the Elder and Younger, Jñānamitra), and Śāntigupta.
[6.] The lineage for miscellaneous pith instructions passed from Vajradhara to Carpaṭipa, Vyālipa, Kokiṭipa, Machandra, Gaurakṣa, Kāṇiripa, Nāgopa, Kumbhakāranātha, Okornātha, Rātigupta, and Śāntigupta.

From the mahāsiddhā Śāntigupta these passed to his most excellent students Dīnakara and Gombhiramati, and then from the three of them the lineages were received by their three heart sons Buddhaguptanātha, Ativajra, and Nirvanaśrī. It was from the three of them that Jetsun Drolwai Gönpo[611] received the transmissions. Both Yeshe Gyatso and Rinchen Gyatso then received them from him. The lineages then passed successively to Lodrö Namgyal, Ngawang Trinle, Kunzang Wangpo, [79b] Kunga Namgyal, Ngawang Gyaltsen, Drupchen Drime, and Karma Ösel Gyurme, from whom I received them. The reading transmissions for the Indian source texts and the manuals of instruction were the same as the above lineages.
The lineage for instruction and reading transmission concerning the five stages of advice on extracting the vital essence of flowers passed from Vajradhara to Vajrayoginī to Dampa Sangye, after which it passed successively to Minyak Ringyal, Retön Lodrö Tsungme, Lama Tsewangpa, Nering Gyaltsen Rinchen, Kunga Delek, Gendun Gyatso, Sönam Drakpa, Sönam Gyatso, Namkha Gyaltsen, Tashi Gyaltsen, Jamyang Drakpa, Lozang Gomchung, Nyangtsang Ngawang Tenpai Nyima, Namkha Senge, Jamyang Sherap, Ngawang Samdrup, Könchok Gyaltsen, Döndrup Gyaltsen, and my precious guru Mañjunātha,[612] from whom I received it.

It then passed to Tāranātha, after whom it is the same as in the previous case. In addition, from Ngorchen the reading transmission of the ritual for making one thousand offerings to Uṣṇīṣavijayā, authored by Jetsun Rinpoche, is the same as the general lineage for his collected works.
The lineage for the extraordinary authorization ritual of the white form of Cintamāṇicakra Tārā,[621] of sixfold rays of light, passed from the venerable Tārā to Vāgīśvarakīrti, Vajrāsana, Bari Lotsāwa Rinchen Drak, Lenakpa,[622] Drepa,[623] the incomparable Dakpo Rinpoche, Tsultrim Nyingpo, Dakpo Dulzin, Drigung Lingpa, Damchö Lingpa, Chökyi Tsultrim, Lhalungpa,[624] Toknepa, Chökyi Wangchuk, Jangchup Zangpo, Tashi Namgyal, Sönam Lhawang, Palden Gyaltsen, Dakpo Chokle Namgyal, Tsarchen Losal Gyatso, and Jamyang Khyentse Wangchuk.

As for the lineage that maintained the experientially based method of teaching that is the extraordinary instruction for the white form of Cintamāṇicakra Tārā, down to Tsarchen this is the same as for the authorization ritual above. From him it passed to Jamyang Khyentse Wangchuk, Wangchuk Rapten, Sönam Chokdrup, Rinchen Jampal, Losal Tenzin, Kunga Lodrö, Kunga Khedrup Wangpo, Jampa Kunga Tenzin, and my omniscient guru,[625] by whose grace I received it.
In the case of the reading transmission for the concise summary of the practical methods for the white Tārā, authored by Kunga Lodrö, [81a] from the author onward this is as in the case for the 108 Instructions.[626] As for the reading transmission for the manual of instructions authored by Ngawang Lekdrup, this passed from him to my lord guru Mañjunātha, and from him to me.
With respect to the authorization ritual uniting the three deities of longevity in one practice, the lineage is subsumed within the former cases. The ritual for honoring the three deities of longevity is an example of one of the texts included in The Treasury of Precious Instructions that were authored by my omniscient and all-seeing lord guru, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo; I received the transmissions for all of these texts—the instruction manuals and so forth—from my guru himself.

The lineage for the threefold reading of the texts as a combination of reading transmission and instruction, which is a supplement added by Jetsun Rinpoche,[627] passed from the venerable Kunga Drolchok to Lungrik Gyatso, Kunga Nyingpo,[628] Rinchen Gyatso, Nyingpo Taye, and Kunzang Wangpo, from whom both Tsewang Norbu and Kunga Namgyal received it. From both of them it passed to Chökyi Jungne, Karma Gyurme, Tsewang Norbu Pema Tashi, and Pekar Tulku Palden Dorje Mipam Chökyi Gyalpo, from whom I received it.
As for the lineage for the detailed method of instruction, this passed from Jetsun Kunga Drolchok to Chöku Lhawang Drakpa, Jetsun Drolwai Gönpo, Jetsunma Trinle Wangmo (also known as Rinchen Dorjema), Gyaltsap Rinchen Gyatso, Jikje Drupa Nyingpo Taye, Chöje Kunzang Wangpo, Rikzin Tsewang Norbu, Chöying Rangdrol, Kunzang Chöjor, Lozang Tutop, Nyima Chöpel, Rinchen Losal Tenkyong, and Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, in whose presence I received the entire 108 Instructions over a period of three years, during which time he ensured that I gained experience in these to a consummate degree. When we requested these instructions, he first gave a concise presentation using a structural analysis. He then explained in detail each of the source manuals of instruction for which the reading transmission of the text existed. [81b] Finally, he provided a summary using the sources for the 108 Instructions, so that the transmission was precise and extensive.

To sum up, it was on the strength of the motivation of the ancestral kings— beings who were emanations—that the sun of the Victorious One’s precious teachings first shone here in the Land of Snows. During that initial period, through the kindness of the second Buddha Padmākara, the great scholar Vimalamitra, the great translator Bairotsana, and others, the lineage of attainment based on the three yogas first appeared. From that time until the great Jetsun Tāranātha later received the personal transmissions of advice from the powerful lord among siddhās Śāntigupta, major and minor systems of advice appeared throughout these earlier and later periods—advice concerning the practical application of general and specific principles of the sutras and tantras. In the case of each of these systems, those of the highest degree of acumen and good fortune could gain the state of primordial unity that requires no more training in a single lifetime; those of an intermediate degree could awaken in their ongoing experience the manifest states of realization associated with the paths and levels, to whatever extent was commensurate with their faith and diligence; and even those of a lesser degree underwent a gradual maturation in their ongoing experience, so that through a succession of lifetimes they attained the state of complete freedom. The scriptures and historical records attest to these facts.
Even to forge some connection with such teachings closed the doorway to rebirth in samsara and lower states of existence, while planting the seeds of liberation and enlightenment in one. But while such inconceivable enlightened activity manifested to a marvelous and superb extent, from the point of view of this country of Tibet the periods of “fruition” and “attainment” have successively passed away, so that the somewhat superficial presence of the teachings of the scriptures has become predominant and we are on the point of passing into the period of “mere outer signs.” It is due to such events that even those who uphold the lineages of practice engage in rote repetition of the theory underlying that practice and are caught up in distractions involving the eight mundane values. In the case of the majority of the most exalted lineages of accomplishment, even the mere uninterrupted reading transmissions for the texts have become rare and are on the point of vanishing altogether.
In such times as these there appeared one who is an expression of the playful dance of the spiritual king Tsangpa Lhayi Metok[629] himself taking conscious rebirth in order to stir the embers of the teachings—the omniscient and all-seeing Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, a true master of the seven modes of personal transmission. [82a] Through his kindness I have enriched myself with the good fortune of hearing most of the teachings that still exist in Tibet—all the primary sources and advice from the more ancient and more recent schools of the secret mantra approach, primarily those of the eight great mainstream lineages of accomplishment. In coming to appreciate the integrity of each of these traditions without any sectarian prejudice, I have felt the lotus of my faith blossom in an unbiased way, and I am therefore unsullied by any stain of rejecting the teachings. I have taken as my guiding principle such words as those of the omniscient Dolpo Sangye, who said:

To me, these lines mean that even though I consider myself incapable of actually benefiting the teachings, due to my hopes that their ongoing transmission will not be interrupted, I have exerted myself greatly to request these teachings from holy masters who uphold these lineages and have gathered all the most important texts—sources for empowerment and instruction—in this series of volumes. In this way, I pray again and again that henceforth those holy people who truly hold these precious teachings in their hearts may ensure ongoing enlightened activity on a vast scale, upholding and protecting and spreading teachings through explaining, listening to, and practicing them; for to do so will fulfill the intentions of victorious ones and their heirs.

The source of all limitless virtue and excellence, that of conditioned existence and the peace of nirvana,
lies solely in the precious teachings of victorious ones;
and the very essence of those teachings is the Vajrayāna approach of secret mantra,
the appearance of which is as difficult to ensure as that of the udumvara flower.
Like the concentrated butter that is churned from milk,
this treasury of profound advice is the quintessence of the sutras and tantras.
Deriving from the pith instructions of the tantras and accomplished masters,
this is the unrivaled distillation of the purest precious gold,
the refined essence of the intent of victorious ones and their heirs, [82b]
the path left by the most powerful masters among the siddhās, the lifeblood of the hearts of hundreds of thousands of ḍākinīs, and the most sublime splendor of all that is rare in this world.
Like a pauper who cannot recognize the value of a precious gem, fools cannot distinguish the varieties of profound teachings,
but for those with the discerning eye of spirituality without prejudice,
this is a great treasury of gems that brings delight.

Since I am truly lacking in the qualities found in the lives of holy ones,
I am not worthy as the source of this sublime collection of teachings;
rather, it has been accomplished due to my previous aspirations and completely sincere altruistic intent
and on the strength of the compassion of my gurus, who are buddhas.
Group chanting, ritual music and dance, and so forth, though pleasing to the eye, are unable to provide any lasting
support.
Even with scripture and reasoning, explanations and debates, intellectual investigations, and belief systems,
one cannot behold the true way in which things abide, and enlightenment remains merely an idea in the mind.
But if one has put the tradition of any of these approaches into practice,
this will certainly bring one to the sublime state of primordial unity in a single lifetime;
and just as a piece from a bolt of brocade is still a precious thing, to practice to even a slight degree accomplishes something of
great purpose.
Therefore, to say nothing of the major traditions of advice and instruction,
a consummate practice of even one of the minor traditions will utterly uproot the vicious cycle of conditioned existence and ensure ongoing well-being and the spontaneous
accomplishment of the two kinds of benefit.

Misappropriating the commands, broadcasting the secrets— any errors I have committed out of my confusion
I acknowledge in the presence of my gurus and victorious ones and their heirs.
May I be granted absolution and my ongoing experience become pure!
Training in the footsteps of victorious ones and their heirs,
I dedicate the virtue amassed throughout the three times, as evidenced by this completely positive undertaking,
so that the conduct of enlightenment may be completely perfected and all beings, equal to space in their extent, may attain enlightenment.
May the pillar of immortal life force stand utterly firm,
may we always enjoy the full bloom of the youth of well-being free of illness,
and may our lives and our spiritual practice reach consummation together,
so that the sublime kāya of timeless awareness, the state of primordial unity, becomes fully evident!
Although we lack the good fortune for freedom in this lifetime, immediately upon our passing, may the perception of a pure state
arise. [83a]
May we be miraculously reborn in a lotus in the realm of supreme bliss,
behold a buddha’s face, and receive the sublime prophecy of our own enlightenment!
With a firm resolve to become free of conditioned existence,
may I and all beings without exception, who are equal to space in their extent,
arouse sublime bodhicitta where we have not yet aroused it, and may it be stable once aroused and flourish more and more!
May doorways to rebirth in inferior states without freedom for spiritual practice be closed;
may we gain noble working bases in higher states endowed with seven attributes;
may we be taken into the care of authentic spiritual mentors; and may we bring to consummation the three completely pure higher trainings!
May obstacles not occur in our practice of the sacred Dharma;
may our goals be realized in accord with the Dharma, just as we wish;
may we bring to consummation spiritual practice that focuses on its quintessential purpose;
and may buddhahood, with its twofold benefit, be spontaneously accomplished in this single lifetime!

This concludes my account of the contents of, and a brief summary of the lineages associated with, The Treasury of Precious Instructions, which constitutes an excellent summary simply of the sources—empowerments that mature and instructions that liberate—for those teachings that definitely exist at present in the Land of Snows, having come here as the eight great mainstream lineages of accomplishment and the more exalted among the miscellaneous methods of instruction. It was composed by me, Karma Ngawang Yönten Gyatso Trinle Kunkhyap Palzangpo, also known as Gyalwai Se Lodrö Tayepai De, who has entered the doorway of the teachings of both the second Buddha, Guru Padmākara, and the perfect Buddha (that is, the Karma Kagyu); who guards the pledge to uphold the teachings of the Sage lifetime after lifetime without sectarian bias; and who engages in the conduct of a yogi in places of solitude with no fixed purpose. This text was completed at Kunzang Dechen Ösel Ling, the retreat center of Śrī Devīkoti Tsadra Rinchen Drak, the hermitage associated with Palpung Tupten Chökhorling, the great monastic seat of the Kagyu school in the eastern region of Tibet. May virtue and excellence flourish!
