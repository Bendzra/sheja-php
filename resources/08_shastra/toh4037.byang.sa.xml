What is the support?[100]
In this case, (1) the bodhisattva’s own spiritual lineage, (2) the initial act of generating enlightenment mind, and (3) all the spiritual qualities that are conducive to enlightenment[101] are called the “support.”

Why is that?
In this context, through depending upon and relying upon the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage, a bodhisattva becomes fit for and capable of attaining unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment. Therefore, the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage is called a support in that it is a capability.

In this context, through depending upon and relying upon the initial development of enlightenment mind, the bodhisattva applies him- or herself to generosity, and he or she applies him- or herself to morality, patience, effort, meditative absorption, and wisdom. Similarly, one applies oneself to the six perfections, the accumulation of merit, the accumulation of wisdom, and all of the entities that are conducive to enlightenment. Therefore, the initial act of generating enlightenment mind is called a support in that it is a bodhisattva’s means of application to the practice.

Because a person who does not abide in the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage lacks that spiritual lineage, he or she is not capable of bringing to completion unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment, even though he or she may generate [enlightenment] mind and put forth effort [in relation to the practice]. Conversely, it should be understood that the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage is a support even for a bodhisattva who has not yet developed [enlightenment] mind and who has not yet commenced the bodhisattva practice. But if someone who abides in the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage both fails to generate [enlightenment] mind and fails to undertake the conduct that leads to enlightenment, then despite having the capacity to achieve enlightenment, he or she will not attain enlightenment quickly. [On the other hand,] it should be understood that someone who is the opposite of that[102] will attain [enlightenment] quickly.

<d e="2">
What is the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage?
In brief, the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage is of two types: that which exists naturally[109] and that which has been developed.[110]
Regarding this [topic], the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage that exists naturally is a quality of bodhisattvas’ six [inner] bases.[111] Its [nature] is such that it has existed as an unbroken series since beginningless time and it is [a quality that is] obtained through the natural order of things. The form of spiritual lineage that is developed is one that is obtained through the prior cultivation of virtue roots. In the present usage, [the term “spiritual lineage”] is meant to apply to both types. This spiritual lineage,[112] moreover, is also called a “seed,”[113] a “constituent element,”[114] and a “fundamental nature.”[115] Additionally, the form [of the spiritual lineage] that has not yet borne fruit[116] is subtle, because of the absence of any fruit. The form that has borne fruit is distinct, by virtue of the presence of that fruit.
Since the bodhisattvas who are endowed with this spiritual lineage surpass all the listeners and solitary realizers, let alone all other sentient beings, it should be known as a quality that is unsurpassed.

</d>
<d e="2">
Why is that?
In brief, there are two types of purity: the purity [of having removed] the obscurations of the mental afflictions[117] and the purity [of having removed] the obscurations to that which needs to be known.[118] Regarding these, the spiritual lineage that is possessed by listeners and solitary realizers brings a purity that is gained through the removal of the obscurations of the mental afflictions, but not [a purity that is gained] through the removal of the obscurations to that which needs to be known. However, the spiritual lineage of the bodhisattvas brings them a purity that is gained through the removal of both the obscurations of the mental afflictions and the obscurations to that which needs to be known. Therefore, [that spiritual lineage] is the most outstanding of all, and thus it is said to be “unsurpassed.”

<d e="2">
What are the four?
[The bodhisattvas’ superiority] is one that is due to their [superior] faculties, their [superior] pursuit, their [superior] skill, and their [superior] result. Regarding this [point], the [bodhisattvas’] superiority that is due to their [superior] faculties is the following. A bodhisattva is naturally one who possesses sharp faculties, whereas a solitary realizer possesses middling faculties, and a listener possesses [relatively] weak faculties.
Regarding this [point], the [bodhisattvas’] superiority that is due to their [superior] pursuit is the following. Listeners and solitary realizers are dedicated [only] to pursuing what is beneficial to themselves. Bodhisattvas are dedicated not only to pursuing what is beneficial to themselves, but also to pursuing what is beneficial to others, what is beneficial to a multitude of people, and what brings happiness to a multitude of people. They are also [motivated by] their compassion for the world and are dedicated to the welfare, benefit, and happiness of gods as well as humans.
Regarding this [point], the [bodhisattvas’] superiority that is due to their [superior] skill is the following. Listeners and solitary realizers develop skill in relation to the heaps, the bases, the constituents, dependent origination, proper and improper conditions, and the [four noble] truths.[119] Bodhisattvas do so in relation to these [subjects] as well as all the other branches of learning.[120]
The [bodhisattvas’] superiority that is due to their [superior] result is the following. Listeners attain the result that is the listeners’ [form of] enlightenment. Solitary realizers attain the result that is the solitary realizers’ [form of] enlightenment. Bodhisattvas attain the result of unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment.

Regarding this [topic], these are signs of the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage that occur in relation to the perfection of generosity: In this case, a bodhisattva naturally takes pleasure in being generous. As long as one continues to have and possess objects that are suitable for giving, one is inclined to share them with others continually and without interruption. One gives with a joyous mind, not with a mind that is distressed. One will share even though one may only have a small amount [of something]. One offers a splendid gift, not one that is inferior.
[A bodhisattva] feels shame at having failed to practice generosity.[121] One extols [the virtues of] generosity to others and instills in them a desire to be generous. Upon seeing someone who is being generous, [a bodhisattva] is delighted and feels very happy. He or she rises before those persons worthy of honor,[122] those who are elders, those worthy of being venerated,[123] and those worthy of being shown respect, and offers them a seat.
Whether asked to do so or not, [a bodhisattva] gives suitable instruction concerning the different activities that sentient beings ought to carry out and that will enable them to remain free of misfortune in both this world and the next.[124] One gives protection to those beings who are threatened by such [sources of] fear as the king, robbers, enemies, water, and the like. To the fullest extent of one’s powers, one protects those [beings] from those diverse and extensive kinds of serious danger.

If another person’s wealth is entrusted into [a bodhisattva’s] hand, he or she will not squander it. If one borrows from others, one will not cheat them or default on the loan. One will not cheat or seek to defraud those relatives with whom an inheritance is shared. One truthfully informs an individual who is confused or who has formed a mistaken opinion about various types of objects of value, such as gems, pearls, lapis lazuli,[125] conch shells, crystals, coral, gold, silver, emeralds, sapphires, rubies, [conch shells that] turn to the right, and so forth, so that they will not be cheated by others.

These are [some of] the vices that are pursued in the world: the vice of [pursuing] women, the vice of intoxicating drinks, the vice of gambling, the vice of viewing [public performances by] actors, dancers, jesters, dramatic dancers, and the like. [A bodhisattva] achieves detachment from these kinds of evil pursuits very quickly and easily. He or she exhibits [the moral virtues of] shame and abashment.[126] [A bodhisattva] does not develop great attachment even after acquiring extensive wealth, let alone a small [amount of wealth]. These and other similar qualities should be understood as the signs of a bodhisattva’s spiritual lineage that occur in relation to the perfection of generosity.

After having committed an evil deed, one feels remorse very quickly. Moreover, one feels shame while carrying out that [misdeed]; one does not feel pleased [as it is being carried out].

[A bodhisattva] is naturally affectionate and holds sentient beings dear. One honors those who are worthy of being shown respect at appropriate times with acts of reverential salutation and prostration, by standing up in their presence, making the gesture of joined palms, and engaging in respectful behavior. One is sincere, polite, and willing to comply with the wishes of others. One smiles, extends a pleasant facial expression, does not frown, and speaks in an agreeable manner.[128]
[A bodhisattva] is grateful and appreciative toward those persons who have been helpful [previously]. One behaves in an upright manner toward those who ask for something. One does not mislead them with deceitfulness[129] and guile.[130] One obtains wealth not in an unjust manner but by adhering to what is right and without engaging in cruelty.[131]

[A bodhisattva] is naturally desirous of virtue. One takes an interest[132] in the meritorious activities of others, needless to say in one’s own. [A bodhisattva] is greatly upset by the doing of harm to others, such as when he or she has seen or heard that others have been killed, bound, cut, beaten, reviled, threatened, and the like.
[A bodhisattva] is serious about taking up the Dharma and serious about future lives, apprehensive about even a very minor objectionable act,[133] much less one that is great. [A bodhisattva] also assists others in their work and activities. For example, one assists others in [performing the activities of] agriculture, commerce, tending livestock, service to the king, scribal work, counting, record keeping,[134] calculating, and signing;[135] [the activities of] resolving difficulties with an employer/overlord, among family members, between friends and foes, and within a royal palace; [the activities of] accumulating, preserving, storing, making use of, and distributing wealth; [the activities of making] matrimonial arrangements in which a bride is sent out [to another family] or brought into [one’s own family]; [the activities of] extensive feasting and communal feasting; as well as other similar types of activities. One does not engage in quarreling, verbal condemnation, contentiousness, disputes, or [any other] activities that are harmful to others, or that bring harm, disadvantage, or suffering both to oneself and others. One stops others from engaging in improper activities, such as the ten evil and nonvirtuous karmic paths.

[A bodhisattva] allows him- or herself to be subject to the will of others and to be put to use by others. As [a form of practice that is] equally patience and morality, one will give up one’s own activities and allow oneself to be directed by others in whatever manner they may desire to carry out their activities.
[A bodhisattva] has both a tender and gentle mind. One does not maintain a hostile or angry state of mind for a long period of time; [rather,] one instantly changes that state of mind into one that is pleasant. [A bodhisattva] values the truth greatly, does not mislead others with false speech, and does not take pleasure in the estrangement of others from their friends nor cause it to occur.
[A bodhisattva] does not speak in an incoherent manner about things that are useless or meaningless, or without giving due consideration [to his or her words]. One speaks in a pleasant manner and avoids using a sharp tone even with one’s own retinue of servants and the like, let alone with anyone else. One has a high regard for virtuous qualities and voices genuine[136] praise of others. These and other similar qualities should be understood as the signs of a bodhisattva’s spiritual lineage that occur in relation to the perfection of morality.

These are the signs of a bodhisattva’s spiritual lineage that occur in relation to the perfection of effort: In this case, a bodhisattva is naturally energetic. One rises at daybreak and goes to sleep [only] at the end of the day. One does not indulge excessively in the comfort of sleep, the comfort of lying down, or the comfort of lying on one’s side. When an activity is being carried out, one gives careful consideration to [the danger of] being overcome by the disinclination to act and idleness, in order to insure that the activity is brought to completion. One is also firmly resolute with regard to all activities that have been undertaken. As long as [an activity] has not been completed and finished, a bodhisattva will in no way relinquish effort or fall into [a state of] dejection during that time.
One does not become fainthearted about matters that are lofty and important. Nor does one hold a low opinion of oneself. One encourages oneself by thinking, “I am capable and have the strength to accomplish these [goals].” One is confident in a large assembly when presenting arguments [to others] or responding to arguments made by others, or in the face of some other [kind of] difficult activity. One also does not become overly distressed even in the face of matters of consequence that require great exertion, much less those that [only require] minor [exertion]. These should be understood as the types of signs of a bodhisattva’s spiritual lineage that occur in relation to the perfection of effort.

These are the signs of a bodhisattva’s spiritual lineage that occur in relation to the perfection of meditative absorption: In this case, a bodhisattva naturally avoids becoming greatly distracted when reflecting upon a Dharma topic. Whenever one sees or hears about remote forest retreats, places for sleeping and sitting that are [located] in outlying regions, that have the quality of being isolated from [other] human beings, and that are free of evil persons and suitable for engaging in inner contemplation, one develops a fervent eagerness for departure [from worldly life] and living in solitude, and thinks to oneself: “Departure [from worldly life] and living in solitude are such states of happiness!”

[A bodhisattva] is a person in whom the mental afflictions are naturally weak, the hindrances[138] [to meditative composure] are [naturally] weak, and [the states of] indisposition[139] are [naturally] weak.

[A bodhisattva] remains steadfast of mind[140] with regard to those who have experienced misfortune, with regard to a relative in difficulty, with regard to someone experiencing distress relating to material wealth, with regard to someone who has undergone corporal [or capital] punishment, imprisonment, or banishment, as well as with regard to those who have experienced any other similar kinds of misfortune.

These are the signs of a bodhisattva’s spiritual lineage that occur in relation to the perfection of wisdom: In this case, a bodhisattva is endowed with the innate wisdom [that is able] to take up all the branches of learning and all the objects that need to be realized. He or she is not slow-witted, weak of mind, or a type of person who is [easily] bewildered. He or she possesses the strength [of intellect] to reflect carefully on the various [points] that put a stop to the causes of lack of mindfulness.[141] These should be understood as the types of signs of a bodhisattva’s spiritual lineage that occur in relation to the perfection of wisdom.
All of these should be understood as the types of distinct signs through which one can infer [that an individual possesses] the bodhisattva’s spiritual lineage. However, with regard to the ascertainment of its actual existence, only the buddhas, the blessed ones, perceive [the presence of the Great Vehicle’s spiritual lineage] directly.
Moreover, because the spiritual lineage of bodhisattvas is naturally endowed with good qualities, excellent, virtuous, and possessed of pure spiritual attributes, it serves as a cause for attaining the supreme, eternal, unsurpassed status of a tathāgata that is beyond ordinary thought and so difficult to gain. However, in its absence [the attainment of that goal] is not possible.

In addition, a bodhisattva naturally will continue to possess these pure spiritual attributes, as long as he or she does not become afflicted by some or all of the four states of mental affliction[142] that oppose those pure spiritual attributes. At those times when he or she does become afflicted [by any of them], those pure spiritual qualities will not be evident and he or she occasionally will be reborn in the lower realms.[143] But even when a bodhisattva is born in [one of] the lower realms, it should be understood that, due to the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage, there is a great difference between him or her and the other sentient beings who have been born in the lower realms.
In this case, a bodhisattva is born in the lower realms only occasionally and once in a great while. Having been born in the lower realms, he or she quickly escapes from there. He or she does not undergo the kind of severe experiences of suffering associated with the lower realms that other beings born there must undergo. When [a bodhisattva] does undergo those lighter forms of suffering, he or she generates great aversion [for the suffering of the lower realms]. Moreover, urged by the spiritual lineage that is the cause for [ultimately developing] a buddha’s great compassion, he or she also generates a compassionate attitude toward the suffering beings who have been born there. It should be understood that these are the kinds of characteristics that distinguish a bodhisattva who has been born in the lower realms from the other beings who have been born there.

What are the four states of mental affliction that oppose a bodhisattva’s pure spiritual qualities?
The first state of mental affliction is the condition of possessing strong mental afflictions and mental afflictions that continue for extended periods of time, due to having previously been a heedless person who repeatedly developed the mental afflictions. The second state of mental affliction is the [activity of] associating with evil companions that is engaged in by a foolish person who is lacking in judgment. The third state of mental affliction is the lack of freedom and the mental trepidation that is experienced by someone who is under the control of a superior, a king, a robber, or an adversary, and the like. The fourth state of mental affliction is the need to obtain a livelihood that is experienced by someone who does not have a means of subsistence.

There are also four causes that prevent a bodhisattva who possesses the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage from attaining unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment.
What are the four?
In this case, a bodhisattva may not meet initially with a spiritual teacher, a buddha, or a bodhisattva who can reveal the unerring path to enlightenment. This is the first cause. Then again, even though a bodhisattva has met with a spiritual teacher, he or she may wrongly grasp the bodhisattva trainings and wrongly cultivate them. This is the second cause. Furthermore, even though a bodhisattva has met with a spiritual teacher and is cultivating the bodhisattva trainings unerringly, he or she may become lax in carrying out the practice. He or she may become lazy and fail to develop a strong and continuous form of effort. This is the third cause. In addition, even though a bodhisattva has met with a spiritual teacher, is cultivating the bodhisattva trainings unerringly, and has generated effort in relation to the practice, he or she may not possess faculties that are [fully] matured and may not have completed the [two] collections [that bring about] enlightenment, because he or she has not gained mastery of the [spiritual] qualities that are conducive to enlightenment for a [sufficiently] long period of time. This is the fourth cause.
Even if someone possesses the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage, he or she will not attain enlightenment due to the deficiency [brought about] by these causes. On the other hand, if [all the necessary favorable conditions] are present, enlightenment will be attained. However, it should be understood that if someone does not possess the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage, he or she will absolutely never, under any circumstances, attain enlightenment.

A bodhisattva’s initial development of [enlightenment] mind is the first correct aspirational prayer[144] among all the correct aspirational prayers of a bodhisattva and the one that causes all the other correct aspirational prayers to be undertaken. Therefore, its essential nature is that of a correct aspirational prayer that occurs at the beginning.
The bodhisattva who is aspiring to [attain] enlightenment formulates the following thought and states the following words: “Oh, how I wish to attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment! May I be one who accomplishes the welfare of all sentient beings, and may I establish them in the [form of] nirvana that is an absolute termination[145] and in the knowledge of a tathāgata.” In this way, he or she generates [enlightenment] mind by being one who desires both [to achieve] enlightenment and [to accomplish] the welfare of [all] sentient beings. Therefore, the generating of [enlightenment] mind is [a mental state] whose aspect is [a form of] desire. Moreover, the generating of [enlightenment] mind develops its desire by relying upon both enlightenment and the welfare of sentient beings as its objects;[146] it does not do so in the absence of [these two] objects. Therefore, the generating of [enlightenment] mind possesses both enlightenment and the welfare of sentient beings as its objects.
Because it is also a necessary antecedent[147] for the collection of all the roots of virtue that are conducive to enlightenment, the act of generating [enlightenment] mind is virtuous[148] and endowed with supremely virtuous qualities; it is excellent[149] and supremely excellent; and it is good[150] and supremely good. It opposes all the misdeeds of body, speech, and mind that reside within sentient beings. Compared to all other virtuous, correct aspirations that relate to any of the mundane or transcendent aims, the bodhisattva’s initial development of [enlightenment] mind is the unsurpassed and most supreme correct aspiration. In this way, the initial development of [enlightenment] mind should be understood in terms of these five characteristics: (1) essential nature, (2) aspect, (3) mental objects, (4) virtuous qualities, and (5) superiority.

As soon as a bodhisattva has generated enlightenment mind, he or she becomes one who has entered into the unsurpassed Great Vehicle [that leads to] enlightenment and also is counted among those who are referred to as bodhisattvas, according to the conventions of everyday usage.[151] Therefore, the act of generating [enlightenment] mind is considered to represent the point of entry. Once a bodhisattva has generated this mind, he or she will eventually attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment; this is not the case for anyone who has not generated [enlightenment mind]. Therefore, the act of generating enlightenment mind is the root of unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment.
It is through feeling compassion toward suffering beings and developing the intention to save them that a bodhisattva generates [enlightenment] mind. Therefore, the act of generating [enlightenment] mind is a natural outcome[152] of compassion. Moreover, it is by depending upon and relying upon this [enlightenment] mind that a bodhisattva applies him- or herself to the bodhisattva training, [which consists of acquiring] the spiritual qualities that are conducive to enlightenment and [carrying out] the activities that are beneficial to sentient beings. Therefore, the act of generating [enlightenment] mind serves as the support[153] for the bodhisattva training. In this way, the initial development of [enlightenment] mind should be understood in terms of (1) the way in which it is considered,[154] as well as in terms of its being (2) a root, (3) a natural outcome, and (4) a support.

The bodhisattva’s initial development of [enlightenment] mind is also briefly of two types: (1) that which leads to emancipation and (2) that which does not lead to emancipation. Regarding them, the [form of enlightenment mind] that leads to emancipation is that which, once developed, perpetually engages [in pursuit of the ultimate goal] and does not turn back [from it at some later time]. The form that does not lead to emancipation is that which, once developed, does not perpetually engage [in pursuit of the ultimate goal] and does turn back [from it].
Moreover, the turning back of the [enlightenment] mind that was [previously] generated is of two types: (1) one that is permanent and (2) one that is not permanent. Regarding them, the one that is permanent is the [form of enlightenment] mind that, once reversed, does not develop again the intention to pursue enlightenment. By contrast, the one that is not permanent is the [form of enlightenment] mind that, after being reversed, does again develop repeatedly the intention to pursue enlightenment.

It should be understood that the act of generating [enlightenment] mind [is motivated] by four contributing factors, four causes, and four strengths.
What are the four contributing factors?[155]
In this case, a son of good family or daughter of good family may see an inconceivable and marvelous miraculous act or [an example of] the spiritual power[156] of a tathāgata or a bodhisattva, or may hear about it from a trustworthy person. Upon seeing or hearing this, he or she may have the following thought: “How great is the power of enlightenment! [It is a state] that [enables one] to see or hear about [the performance of] such [an example of] spiritual power or such a miraculous act by [a tathāgata] who resides in it or [a bodhisattva] who has undertaken to attain it.” Having developed a strong feeling of devotion toward supreme enlightenment on the strength of having seen or heard about this spiritual power, he or she may then generate the thought to [achieve] supreme enlightenment. This is the first contributing factor for generating [enlightenment] mind.

He or she may neither see nor hear about [some display of] spiritual power but may hear [a discourse on] the true Dharma that relates to [the topic of] unsurpassed enlightenment. Having heard this teaching from the bodhisattva collection [of scriptures], he or she may then develop faith [toward unsurpassed enlightenment]. Having developed this faith and having developed a strong feeling of devotion toward the knowledge of a tathāgata on the strength of [the act of] listening to the true Dharma, he or she may then generate the intention to attain a tathāgata’s knowledge. This is the second contributing factor for generating [enlightenment] mind.

He or she may not hear [a discourse on] the Dharma but may observe that the true Bodhisattva Dharma is on the verge of disappearing. Having observed this, he or she may then have the following thought: “Oh, how much the continued existence of the true Bodhisattva Dharma does serve to remove the suffering of immeasurable numbers of beings! Therefore, I must generate [enlightenment] mind in order to preserve the true Bodhisattva Dharma for a long time so that the suffering of those beings might [continue to] be removed.” Having developed a strong feeling of devotion toward the knowledge of a tathāgata on the strength of this very [desire to] preserve the true Dharma, he or she may then generate the intention to attain a tathāgata’s knowledge. This is the third contributing factor for generating [enlightenment] mind.

He or she may not observe that the true Dharma is about to disappear but may observe that during a final era and a final age the constitution of beings [who live] in such an age is inferior in that they are afflicted by the following ten secondary mental afflictions: a high degree of ignorance, a high degree of shamelessness and absence of abashment, a high degree of jealousy and stinginess, a high degree of suffering, a high degree of indisposition, a high degree of mental afflictions, a high degree of misdeeds, a high degree of lack of mindfulness, a high degree of laziness, and a high degree of lack of faith. Having observed this, he or she may then have the following thought: “Oh, how great is the degeneracy[157] of the present era! During a time when [beings] are afflicted in this way, it is rare for anyone to generate even the intention to attain the lesser forms of enlightenment [that are pursued by] listeners and solitary realizers, much less for anyone to generate the intention to attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment. Therefore, let me generate [enlightenment] mind myself and may this also lead others to emulate me and generate [enlightenment mind] as well.” Having developed a strong feeling of devotion toward supreme enlightenment on the strength of [the realization that the act of] generating [enlightenment] mind is so unlikely to occur during a final era, he or she may then generate the intention [to achieve] supreme enlightenment. This is the fourth contributing factor for generating [enlightenment] mind.

The excellence of a [spiritual] friend should be understood as being of four types. In this case, for [the person who is] a bodhisattva’s [spiritual] friend at the very outset not to be stupid or have a slow intellect, to be learned and discerning [in judgment], and not to be one who has taken on bad views is the first excellence of a [spiritual] friend. For him or her not to direct [a bodhisattva] to engage in lack of mindfulness[158] or provide any opportunity [for a bodhisattva] to engage in lack of mindfulness is the second excellence of a [spiritual] friend. For him or her not to direct [a bodhisattva] to engage in misdeeds or provide any opportunity [for a bodhisattva] to engage in misdeeds is the third excellence of a [spiritual] friend. For [a spiritual friend] not to turn [a bodhisattva] away from those qualities of faith, aspiration, undertaking, effort, or method that relate to a higher purpose and then cause that [bodhisattva] to pursue qualities of faith, aspiration, undertaking, effort, or method that relate to a lesser purpose is the fourth excellence of a [spiritual] friend. Examples [of this latter excellence] are not to turn [a bodhisattva] away from the Great Vehicle and cause him or her to pursue the Listeners’ Vehicle or the Solitary Realizers’ Vehicle; not to turn [a bodhisattva] away from [qualities] that derive from meditation and cause him or her to pursue those that derive from reflection; not to turn [a bodhisattva] away from [qualities] that derive from reflection and cause him or her to pursue those that derive from [the activity of] listening [to Dharma teachings]; not to turn [a bodhisattva] away from [qualities] that derive from [the activity of] listening [to Dharma teachings] and cause him or her to pursue administrative activities [in support of the spiritual community]; not to turn [a bodhisattva] away from [qualities] that derive from [the practice of] morality and cause him or her to pursue [the practice of] generosity; [as well as other situations] in which [a spiritual friend] does not turn [a bodhisattva] away from similar kinds of superior [spiritual] qualities and cause him or her to pursue [other] similar kinds of lesser qualities.

A bodhisattva becomes one who possesses an abundance of compassion toward sentient beings due to four causes. Among the limitless world spheres of the ten directions there are world spheres in which suffering is not found. However, a bodhisattva takes birth in a world sphere where there is suffering and where suffering is found, not one where suffering is absent. He or she observes that others have been affected, stricken, and overcome by some particular form of suffering. He or she is also affected, stricken, and overcome by some particular form of suffering. Moreover, he or she observes that either others, or [oneself], or both [others and oneself] have been affected, stricken, and overcome by many different kinds of long-lasting, intense, and continuous forms of suffering. Therefore, on the basis of his or her spiritual lineage, due to his or her natural goodness, and because of these [four] circumstances that are perceived and these [four] factors, a bodhisattva develops a [form of] compassion that can be small, middling, or great, [and he or she does so] without having engaged in the continuous practice [of spiritual exercises].

Once a bodhisattva has manifested compassion toward sentient beings, there are four causes that keep him or her from become afraid of or alarmed by even samsaric suffering that is long-lasting, of many varieties, intense, and continuous, much less [samsaric suffering] that is small. He or she is naturally courageous, steadfast, and strong. This is the first cause. He or she is learned, disposed to proper reflection, and possesses strong deliberative powers. This is the second cause. He or she possesses strong devotion toward unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment. This is the third cause. He or she possesses strong compassion toward sentient beings. This is the fourth cause.

What are the four strengths?
They are (1) the strength that relates to oneself,[159] (2) the strength that relates to others, (3) the causal strength, and (4) the strength that derives from practice.
Regarding these, the desire for unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment that is developed through one’s own abilities is called the bodhisattva’s strength for generating [enlightenment] mind that relates to oneself. By contrast, the desire for unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment that is caused to arise through the influence of another person is called the bodhisattva’s strength for generating [enlightenment] mind that relates to others. The previous practice[160] by a bodhisattva of virtuous [spiritual] qualities associated with the Great Vehicle [tradition] that now[161] quickly leads him or her to generate [enlightenment] mind merely by seeing a buddha or bodhisattva or hearing them being praised, let alone by hearing the true Dharma [being taught] or seeing [an example of] spiritual power, is called the causal strength for generating [enlightenment] mind. The long-term cultivation of virtuous activities by a bodhisattva in this life—[activities] such as serving a true spiritual being and listening to and reflecting upon the true Dharma—is called the strength for generating [enlightenment] mind that derives from practice.
Regarding this [topic], whether a bodhisattva relies upon these four contributing factors and four causes either in their entirety or only partially, if he or she develops [enlightenment] mind by means of the strength that relates to oneself and the causal strength in combination or either one individually,[162] then it will be firm, strong, and unwavering. However, the [enlightenment] mind that arises through the strength that relates to others and the strength that derives from practice should be understood as one that will not be firm.

There are four causes that turn a bodhisattva away from [enlightenment] mind.
What are the four?
He or she does not possess the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage. He or she is under the control of an evil companion. He or she has little compassion for sentient beings. He or she is afraid of the suffering of samsara that lasts for a long time, has many varieties, is intense, and occurs uninterruptedly. He or she fears it and is alarmed by it to a very great degree, and falls into a state of terror [about it]. These four causes that turn one away from [enlightenment] mind should be understood as being the opposite of the four causes for developing [enlightenment] mind that were described above at length.

He or she embraces all sentient beings in the manner that a spouse[163] [is embraced] and yet is untainted by the fault of embracing a spouse. Regarding this [topic], the fault of embracing a spouse is the following. It is the two qualities of developing afflicted forms of affection and hostility [respectively] in response to favorable or injurious actions [that are carried out] by one’s spouse.

What are they?
They are the beneficial superior attitude and the superior attitude that relates to happiness. Regarding these, the beneficial superior attitude is the desire to cause [sentient beings] to turn away from opportunities [to engage in] nonvirtuous [actions] and become established in opportunities [to engage in] virtuous [actions]. The superior attitude that relates to happiness is the desire to provide those sentient beings who have fallen into misfortune, who have no protector, and who have no shelter with the things that will assist them and free them from their state of affliction.

From the time that [a bodhisattva] first generates [enlightenment] mind, there are two forms of superiority regarding the acquisition of virtue for the sake of enlightenment by one who has newly generated [enlightenment] mind as compared with the acquisition of virtue by anyone other than that [bodhisattva]. [They are] (1) the superiority that relates to the cause and (2) the superiority that relates to the result. The acquisition of virtue by a bodhisattva is indeed the cause for unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment, and [supreme enlightenment] is the result of that [acquisition of virtue]. This is not the case for the acquisition of virtue by all those other listeners and solitary realizers, much less [for the acquisition of virtue] by any beings other than [the listeners and solitary realizers]. Therefore, the acquisition of virtue by bodhisattvas is abundantly superior to the acquisition of virtue by all others, both in terms of its causal nature and in terms of its result.

These are the two benefits of generating [enlightenment] mind that are gained by a bodhisattva who has newly generated a firm [enlightenment] mind: (1) As soon as [one] has generated [enlightenment] mind, [one] becomes worthy of being venerated[165] by all sentient beings; [one] becomes worthy of honor;[166] [one] becomes a field of merit and is like a father to all beings. (2) One also acquires the merit that will keep one from being harmed.
Regarding this [latter point], the merit that keeps [a bodhisattva] from being harmed is such that the bodhisattva who possesses it is safeguarded in a manner that is twice as great as the [form of] protection [experienced] by a wheel ruler.[167] Because it is a form of protection that is always present, neither malicious beings, nor harmful spirits, nor demons, nor local guardian spirits are able to harm [such a bodhisattva], even when he or she is asleep, or in an excited[168] or inattentive state of mind.

<d e="2">
Even after a bodhisattva has taken on a different life, he or she meets with little harm and is by nature free of illness through the possession of that merit. He or she also does not experience harm that is long-lasting or intense.
When [a bodhisattva] is striving physically or verbally [to accomplish] the welfare of beings or [to carry out] activities on behalf of sentient beings, or when [a bodhisattva] is teaching the Dharma, [his or her] body does not experience excessive weariness, [his or her] recollection does not become clouded, and [his or her] mind does not become impaired.
A bodhisattva who is established in the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage is a person in whom [the condition of] indisposition[169] is naturally weak. And once he or she has generated [enlightenment] mind, then [that bodhisattva] becomes one in whom [the condition of] indisposition is much more weak, in terms of both indisposition of the body and indisposition of the mind.

Needless to say, those [mantra formulas and vidyā spells] that are successful [in the hands of others will also succeed when carried out by that bodhisattva].
[A bodhisattva who has newly generated a firm form of enlightenment mind] possesses an abundance of patience and gentleness; he or she endures the pain inflicted by others and does not inflict pain upon others. He or she is also greatly distressed upon learning[170] that someone is inflicting pain upon another person. The intensity of his or her secondary mental afflictions such as anger, envy, guile, dissembling,[171] and the like has been blunted. Those weakened forms that occasionally develop quickly disappear.
The kinds of fears, sources of terror, scarcity of provisions, and other faults that can occur in an inhabited region, as well as the misfortunes that are caused by both human beings and [malevolent] spirits, do not occur [when a bodhisattva who has newly generated a firm enlightenment mind] is residing there.

(5) the meaningless[177] and false utterings made to others by [a bodhisattva] who is desirous of [acquiring] material gain in which [he or she] tries to please [those persons] by telling them that they possess manifold good qualities in order to [obtain] material gain and procure material gain; (6) the attracting of a group [of spiritual followers] in a manner that is contrary to the Dharma and that is not in keeping with the Dharma by [a bodhisattva] who is desirous of obtaining acts of service [from those followers] for him- or herself and [who attracts a following] in order to obtain [such] acts of service; (7) the freeing of beings who were the servants of others from their state of servitude, so that [they may enter into] a state of servitude to you; (8) the freeing of beings who were bound in prison from their imprisonment only to bring them under your control so that they may be made to perform work for you; (9) the freeing of beings who are threatened by others with the dangers of undergoing [judicial] punishment and the like[178] in order to make them subject to the same dangers from you; and (10) the remaining in a state of ease during this life by a bodhisattva, without engaging in careful reflection about the welfare of others.

In the latter case, even after having remained in the meditative absorptions, such [a bodhisattva] can avert [the natural power of] the meditative absorptions [to bring about rebirth in the higher realms] and, through [the power of] prayer, be born anywhere in the desire realm that he or she may wish [to be born]. [Two more examples are] (3) the performance of beneficial activities for the sake of manifold sentient beings by a bodhisattva who has attained mastery of the controlling powers[183] and [who carries out those activities] by [sending forth] a great variety of emanations into the ten directions; and (4) the performance of immeasurable forms of beneficial activities for the sake of an immeasurable number of sentient beings by a muni and a tathāgata who has completed [the perfection of] his own aim and [who carries out those activities] on the basis of the [one hundred and forty] unique qualities of a buddha,[184] which include the [ten] powers, the [four] forms of intrepid confidence, and so forth.

Regarding these [six activities that accomplish the aims of others in an exclusive manner], the first two that were presented are [instances] that should be fully understood by a bodhisattva and rejected. However, [a bodhisattva] should train [him- or herself] with an ever-increasing degree of diligence in relation to the other [four examples that accomplish] the aims of others in an exclusive manner. Therefore, with the exception of those [six] types [of activities], all [other instances in which] bodhisattvas [pursue] the aims of others—including those that are the opposite [of the first two examples[185]]—represent [activities] that are also related to one’s own aim.

In brief, it should be understood to have five aspects: (1) the characteristic of being irreproachable, (2) the characteristic of being favorable, (3) [the form that] relates to this life, (4) [the form that] relates to future lives, and (5) [the form that] promotes tranquility.
Regarding these, whatever acquisition of virtue or accumulation of virtue, whether small or great, that a bodhisattva carries out, as well as [whatever] acquisition of virtue or accumulation of virtue, whether small or great, that he or she causes others to adopt, leads them [to carry out], introduces them to, and establishes them in, should be understood as the characteristic of being irreproachable as it relates to a bodhisattva’s [pursuit of both] one’s own and others’ aims that is linked to what is beneficial.
Whatever happiness a bodhisattva might provide for him- or herself or for another that is free of affliction, whether it be a state of happiness that arises from the providing of assistance[186] or a state of happiness [that arises from any] of the meditative absorptions, this should be understood as the characteristic of being favorable as it relates to a bodhisattva’s [pursuit of both] one’s own and others’ aims that is linked to what is beneficial.
There are [forms of] a bodhisattva’s [pursuit of both] one’s own and others’ aims that are beneficial to this life but not future lives; [forms that are beneficial] to future lives but not this one; [forms that are beneficial] both to this life and to future lives; and [forms that are] beneficial neither to this life nor to future lives. These four [forms of a bodhisattva’s pursuit of both] one’s own and others’ aims should be recognized, in the same order and in the appropriate manner, as being related to the four ways of taking up what is right.

There are ways of taking up what is right that bring happiness in the present but have a ripening in the future that consists of suffering;[188] [ways of taking up what is right] that bring suffering in the present but have a ripening in the future that consists of happiness;[189] [ways of taking up what is right] that bring happiness in the present and also have a ripening in the future that consists of happiness;[190] and [ways of taking up what is right] that bring suffering in the present and also have a ripening in the future that consists of suffering.[191] These categories should be understood in the manner [in which they are presented] in the sutras.
Regarding this [topic], in brief the worldly and transcendent [spiritual] qualities that either constitute nirvana, cause nirvana to be attained, or are conducive to [the attainment of] nirvana constitute [the fifth aspect of] a bodhisattva’s [pursuit of both] one’s own and others’ aims that is linked to what is beneficial—[namely, the one described as the form that] promotes tranquility.

The experience[194] that is favorable to body and mind and is produced by those very three causes included in the causal aspect of happiness, irrespective of the abatement of suffering,[195] is called “the experiential [aspect of] happiness.” Moreover, it is of two types: (1) that which is related to the outflows and (2) that which is free of the outflows.[196] Regarding them, [pleasant experiences] that are free of the outflows can be both a quality of [an ārya] who is still undergoing training[197] and a quality of [an arhat] who is beyond [the need to undergo any further] training.[198]
Further, [pleasant experiences] that are related to the outflows are those of the three realms—[that is to say,] those that are related to the desire, form, and formless realms. All these [feelings] of the three realms can further be distinguished, in the appropriate manner, as being of six types according to the basis[199] [from which they arise], ranging from those that arise from contact with the eye to those that arise from contact with the mind.[200] These six types [of feelings] are also [understood as being subsumed within] two types: corporeal and mental. Regarding [this latter classification], [the feelings] that are related to the five collections of [sense] consciousness are corporeal, and the ones that are related to mind consciousness are mental.[201]

The causal aspect of happiness is identified as [a form of] happiness in that it is the cause of happiness; it does not represent happiness in terms of its essential nature. The experiential aspect of happiness is not [a form of happiness] by virtue of its causal nature; however, [it does represent happiness] in terms of its essential nature. The aspect of happiness that is an antidote to suffering is not [a form of happiness] either by virtue of its causal nature or in terms of its essential nature; rather, it is [a form of] happiness only in the sense of quieting [some form of] suffering—[which is to say,] by virtue of the fact that it brings about the removal of [some specific instance of] suffering. The aspect of happiness that cuts off feelings is not [a form of happiness] either by virtue of its causal nature, in terms of its essential nature, or in the sense of bringing about a removal of suffering; however, it is [a form of] happiness in that it is a state [of meditative composure] that one abides in for a limited period of time and that constitutes the cessation of suffering in its highest sense, as [indicated by Buddha] in the phrase: “Whatever feeling [is experienced] here is [a form of] suffering.” The final form[205] included in the [category of] happiness that is [described as] freedom from harm—that is, the happiness of complete enlightenment—represents happiness in the sense that it is the permanent cessation in the future[206] of that very same suffering in its highest sense [that was just mentioned] and, as a seen event,[207] the permanent removal of the forms of indisposition present in one’s being[208] that are related to the mental afflictions. The remaining [three forms] of [the category of] happiness that is [described as] freedom from harm should be understood as the happiness that is freedom from harm in that they conform to, are supportive of, or are conducive to that very [fourth and] final form.

Regarding this [topic], the bodhisattva should provide for sentient beings [those forms of] happiness that support what is beneficial, not [those forms] that support what is harmful. Moreover, after having fully and accurately realized with his or her wisdom the [forms of] happiness that support what is harmful, [a bodhisattva] should cause beings to give up any desire for them and, to the best of his or her ability, strive to draw them away and divert them from them. Through reliance upon skillful means, a bodhisattva should also provide for sentient beings what is beneficial [for them], even though it may be followed by [some form of] unpleasantness [in the near term] and they might not desire it because it is accompanied by [physical] pain and mental unhappiness. [Similarly,] through reliance upon skillful means, [a bodhisattva] should also draw sentient beings away from and divert them from what is harmful [for them], even though it is followed by [some form of] pleasantness [in the near term] and they might desire it because it is accompanied by [physical] pleasure and mental satisfaction.

It should be understood with certainty that providing for [sentient beings] what is beneficial [for them even though] it is accompanied by [some form of] unpleasantness and turning them away from what is harmful [for them even though] it is accompanied by [some form of] pleasantness is [done] so that sentient beings [will experience greater forms of] happiness in the future. Therefore, it should be recognized that the bodhisattva who desires what is beneficial for sentient beings also, in fact, desires happiness [for them]. Whoever provides what is beneficial [for beings] should also be recognized as providing [them with] happiness, because what is beneficial represents a cause and what is happiness represents a result. Therefore, anything that possesses [the quality of] being beneficial for sentient beings should be understood as possessing [the quality of] bringing them happiness.

With regard to this [overall topic], a bodhisattva should, unhesitatingly and [with unwavering devotion to this] as one’s sole aim, [seek to] provide sentient beings with whatever [forms of] karma both [are recognized as] having a desirable result—either as a seen event or in a future life—and are included in the causal aspect of happiness; with whatever [forms of] happiness are [of the type that is] an antidote to suffering; with whatever [forms of] happiness are [of the type that] cuts off feelings; and with whatever [forms of] happiness are [of the type that] is freedom from harm. [The reason for this is that] these [forms of happiness] are both beneficial and free of reproach. [A bodhisattva] should not, however, provide [sentient beings] with either [those forms of] the experiential aspect of happiness or [those forms of] object, faculty, or contact contained within the causal aspect of happiness that are afflicted [in nature] in [the sense] that they will lead to a state of affliction, and that are, [therefore,] reprehensible,[209] harmful, and unwholesome. On the other hand, a bodhisattva should, to the utmost of [his or her] ability and strength, pursue [for others] whatever [forms of the experiential aspect of happiness and whatever forms of object, faculty, or contact contained within the causal aspect of happiness] are not afflicted [in nature] in [the sense] that they will lead to a state of affliction, [and that are, therefore,] free of reproach, beneficial, and wholesome. Similarly, [a bodhisattva] should also engage in them him- or herself, train him- or herself in them, and experience them for him- or herself. This should be understood as the bodhisattvas’ [pursuit of] one’s own and others’ aims that is linked both to what is beneficial and to what [represents a state of] happiness. There are no [points relating to this topic] beyond these, and there are no [points] other than these.

A bodhisattva’s excellence of life span is the quality of possessing a long life span and the condition of remaining [alive] for a long period of time. Excellence of physical appearance is the qualities of having a superior physical form, being very good-looking, and having a pleasing appearance. Excellence of family is the quality of being born into an eminent family. Excellence of power is the quality of possessing much property and the condition of having a large number of supporters as well as that of having a large retinue.[212] To be trustworthy and credible, to be considered an authoritative arbiter for persons who are involved in every manner of legal dispute, to be someone who does not cause any loss to property that has been entrusted [to him or her] because [he or she] is free of deceit and guile and would not commit fraud by [misrepresenting] brass [as something more valuable than it actually is] or commit theft by [using false] weights, and the like, to be someone who does not break [his or her] word—and for these reasons to be someone whose word is [well] received by others—is called “the quality of having one’s speech accepted.” For [a bodhisattva] to have great fame and renown, and to be recognized in the world for such things as prowess, strength, steadfastness, skill, proficiency, good conduct, or [for being] the most exceptionally accomplished at [any of] various categories of crafts and occupations—and for these reasons to be esteemed, shown respect, venerated, honored, and revered by a great multitude of persons—is called “the quality of being regarded as eminent.” The quality of being a man is the state of being a male [human being] and [the condition of being a person] who possesses the male [sex] faculty. The excellence of strength that occurs naturally [includes] the qualities of [being someone who experiences] few troubles, being a type [of person] who is free of illness, and [being someone who can put forth] great exertion.

[Practicing] avoidance of harm[213] toward beings and [developing] the attitude of [wanting to] avoid doing harm are causes for [obtaining] excellence of life span. Giving light and [giving] bright[214] clothing are causes for [obtaining] excellence of physical appearance. Overcoming pride toward beings is a cause for [obtaining] excellence of family. Giving to beggars and to those who lack material necessities[215] is a cause for [obtaining] excellence of power. Speaking the truth and cultivating the avoidance of divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle talk are causes for [obtaining] the quality of having one’s speech accepted. Veneration of the Three Jewels and veneration of those worthy of honor[216] by one who has made prayers of aspiration[217] that he or she might gain a variety of spiritual qualities in the future are causes for [obtaining] the quality of being regarded as eminent. Admiration for male qualities and aversion toward the female state, regarding that [female state] as having disadvantages, and instilling in others the two causes for attaining the male state—[namely,] (1) reversing the desire for the female state that is held by women who delight in female qualities and (2) [causing others], in a proper manner,[218] to set free those men who have been seized and are being led away to have their male faculty destroyed—are causes for [obtaining] the quality of being a man. Physically carrying out yourself on behalf of others whatever duties they may have or assisting them [in their work], with all your strength and ability, in a proper manner, and without being careless; and providing beings with food [such as] boiled grain, porridge, rice gruel, and drink that will strengthen and invigorate them, are causes for [obtaining] excellence of strength. These should be understood as the eight types of causes for [obtaining] the eight types of [karmic] maturation.

They are (1) purity of mind, (2) purity of application, and (3) purity of field. Regarding these, the purity of attitude, in the sense of dedicating these virtue roots[219] to unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment; the intensity of attitude, in the sense of carrying out [these virtue roots] with deep sincerity and great clarity[220] [of mind]; the joy [that arises] at the sight of one who is an exemplary Dharma follower; and the extensive reflection and deliberation, at every moment of each day, upon just those things that are in accord with these [virtue roots] are what is called purity of mind.
Regarding these [conditions], cultivating [these virtue roots] for a long period of time, performing them continually, performing them diligently, extolling [them] to others in order to cause them to take up those virtuous acts that have not been undertaken, extolling [them to others] in order to encourage [them to continue performing] those [virtuous acts] that have been undertaken, causing those very persons to settle into [the performance of] these virtue roots, and causing them to become firmly established in [their performance] are what is called purity of application.
Regarding [these conditions], in brief it should be understood that the purity of field [comes about] through (1) the correct performance of the application and (2) the stability of the properly [executed] application in relation to [the generating of] a result.[221]

These are the eight results of the eight [karmic] maturations that favor and support bodhisattvas [in their efforts] to benefit sentient beings and to develop the [spiritual] qualities of a buddha. The bodhisattva who has become established in the maturation results is also competent and able to accomplish a great number and variety of aims that pertain to sentient beings. [Other beings] will also become disciples who are willing to be directed to carry out activities according to his or her wishes—that is to say, [to carry out activities] that relate to the accomplishing of their own aims. [On the other hand,] if a bodhisattva is able [to help beings], but his or her disciples are unwilling to act as they have been directed, then the activities that he or she performs on behalf of [other] beings will be neither abundant nor favorable, and he or she will be unable to accomplish the aims of others. [Similarly,] if a bodhisattva is neither competent nor able, then even though other beings become disciples who are willing to be directed [by him or her] to carry out activities that relate to the accomplishing of their own aims, the activities that [such a] bodhisattva performs on behalf of [other] beings will be neither productive nor favorable, and he or she will be unable to accomplish the aims of others. Therefore, it is [only] when both [of these conditions] are present and both [of these conditions] exist that a bodhisattva’s activities on behalf of beings will be productive and favorable such that he or she is capable of accomplishing the aims of others. A bodhisattva who finds him- or herself in circumstances [where both of these conditions are present] will quickly ripen the qualities of a buddha in him- or herself, and he or she will quickly ripen [other] beings in relation to the three vehicles. He or she will also attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment and liberate those sentient beings who have been [spiritually] ripened.

In brief, three of the [six] perfections are called “merit”: (1) the perfection of generosity, (2) the perfection of morality, and (3) the perfection of patience.

Regarding this [point], erring instructions about merit and wisdom that occur through having met with an evil companion or erring notions that come about through erring forms of attention[232] are called “the presence of adverse conditions.” [The conditions that are] the opposite of this and that represent the side of [spiritual] purity[233] should be understood to constitute the presence of propitious conditions. In addition, those conditions that remove and prevent the arising of obstacles for someone who has undertaken to acquire, maintain, and increase merit and wisdom are said to be “the favorable conditions” for a bodhisattva’s [pursuit of] merit and wisdom. It should be understood that the absence of any of these three causes prevents merit or wisdom from being generated.

On the basis of merit, a bodhisattva remains uninjured[234] as he or she transmigrates in samsara and avoids being afflicted excessively by suffering. He or she is also able to benefit beings and accomplish their aims, in whatever way may be desired.
On the basis of wisdom, a bodhisattva collects merit correctly and not in a wrongful manner, and, employing skillful activities of immeasurable variety, [continues to do so] until unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment has been attained.
In brief and in a manner that is appropriate [to each of them], these should be understood as the four types of results that relate to merit and wisdom. However, [the description] would be immeasurably large if an [exhaustive] classification of [all] the types [of results] were made.
Regarding this [topic], all of the maturations, as well as all the causes of the maturations, and all the results of the maturations are based upon merit and arise from merit. For its part, merit is based upon wisdom and arises from wisdom. Therefore, both [wisdom and merit] are essential factors for [the pursuit of] unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment. While merit is an essential factor, wisdom is further [an essential factor] that is unsurpassed. If a bodhisattva lacks either merit or wisdom, he or she cannot attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment. This [explanation] should be understood as representing [the aspects of] a bodhisattva’s [pursuit of] one’s own and others’ aims that are contained within a cause or a result.

(1) The permanent abandonment of all the mental afflictions,[241] (2) the eightfold ārya path, and (3) the worldly virtuous entities that are attained on the basis of that [ārya path] are what are called “one’s own and others’ aims that are perpetual.”
Regarding this point, it should be understood that the qualities of being perpetual and not perpetual are due to three reasons: (1) in terms of essential nature, (2) in terms of being subject to deterioration, and (3) in the sense that the experiencing of a related result [eventually] comes to an end. Regarding these [reasons], nirvana is perpetual in terms of its essential nature. All conditioned entities are not perpetual [in terms of their essential nature]. The eightfold ārya path is perpetual because it is not subject to deterioration and because the experiencing of its result does not come to an end. Those other [conditioned] entities which are virtuous [in nature] but are related to the outflows[242] are not perpetual, both in the sense that they are subject to deterioration and in the sense that the experiencing of their results comes to an end.[243]
This represents both a brief and an extensive [presentation] of the ten aspects of one’s own and others’ aims. [They are two of the seven subjects] in relation to which the training is undertaken by bodhisattvas with all their ability and with all their strength. There is nothing of greater significance than [these ten aspects] and nothing besides them. All those [bodhisattvas] who have trained themselves in the past and [all] those who will train themselves in the future with regard to one’s own and others’ aims, have done so and will do so with regard to these very same ten aspects of one’s own and others’ aims; there is nothing of greater significance than these and nothing besides these.

Regarding this [fourfold distinction, the first category refers to] that substance[251] toward which all worldly beings[252] share the same view, based on judgments that operate through gaining familiarity with convention and accepted usage, such as when [one says] about the earth [element]: “This is earth; it is not fire.” Just as with the earth [element, such shared views also occur] in relation to fire, water, air, [visible] form, sounds, smells, tastes, tangible objects, food, drink, vehicles, clothing, objects that are applied as ornaments, implements and household utensils, incense, garlands, scented oils, [objects that relate to] dance, song, music, [objects that are used to create] light, [objects that relate to] sensual pleasures enjoyed by men and women, and objects that relate to [the cultivation of] fields, [the operation of] commercial shops, and [the maintenance of] private dwellings. [Such shared views also occur] in relation to [the nature of] pleasure and suffering, [such as when worldly beings agree:] “This [experience] is [a form of] suffering; it is not [a form of] pleasure”; or, “This [experience] is [a form of] pleasure; it is not [a form of] suffering.” In short, it is any thing that is an object of settled and firm belief for all worldly persons, [such that it is held:] “[The nature of] this [object] is this; it is not that”; or, “This [object exists or is used] in this manner; it does not [exist nor is it used] in some other manner.” [Likewise, the existence of these objects] is recognized [by such persons] with their own conceptual thought [simply] on the basis of [familiarity with] the traditional usage of terms; it is not [a belief that is] held through having engaged in reflection, contemplation, and investigation.

With regard to these [two concepts], “being” is that which is posited as the essential nature [that is expressed in] a designating assertion.[262] This [notion is one that] has been adhered to by the world in just this manner for a long time. It is the root of all the world’s conceptual thoughts[263] and elaborations.[264] These include, for example, [the essential natures that are expressed by such designating assertions as] “form,” “feeling,” “conception,” “formations,” and “consciousness”; [those of] “eye,” “ear,” “nose,” “tongue,” “body,” and “mind”; those of “earth,” “water,” “fire,” and “air”; those of “[visible] form,” “sound,” “smell,” “taste,” and “tangible object”; [the qualities of being] “virtuous,” “nonvirtuous,” and “indeterminate”; [those of] “origination,” “disappearance,” and [of being] “dependently arisen”; [those of] “past,” “future,” and “present”; [those of being a] “conditioned [entity]” and [of being] “unconditioned”; [that which is identified as being] “this world” and “the next world”; the pair of “the sun and the moon”;[265] [the qualities of being] “seen,” “heard,” “considered,” or “perceived”; [those of being] “attained” or “sought”; [those of being something that is] “deliberated upon” or “reflected upon” with the mind; as well as the range of others that end with “nirvana.” These and other similar kinds of essential natures that [are thought of as] pertaining to entities and that are conceived of on the basis of designating assertions are what is called the world’s[266] [notion of] “being.”

By contrast, the [real] substance[269] that is free of both the former [concept of] being and this [latter concept of] nonbeing, and that is included among the defining attributes of entities, is the absence of duality. This absence of duality is the middle way that avoids the two extremes and that is described as being “unsurpassed.” It should be understood that the knowledge of this [form of] reality that is possessed by the buddhas, the blessed ones, is perfectly pure. On the other hand, the knowledge of it that is possessed by bodhisattvas should be understood to represent [a form of] the path that is being pursued by those who are still undergoing training.

[This latter point should be understood] as follows. A bodhisattva who applies him- or herself using conviction[270] about [the meaning of] emptiness during various births as he or she continues to be reborn in samsara in order to ripen sentient beings and also to ripen the qualities of a buddha in him- or herself will understand samsara as it truly is. [That bodhisattva] will also not allow his or her mind to become [overly] upset by [the unsatisfactory nature of] samsara through [having contemplated] the aspects of impermanence, etc.[271] [A bodhisattva who] fails to understand samsara as it truly is will be unable to maintain a mind that is [largely] unaffected by all the mental afflictions of desire, hatred, and ignorance, etc. And [a bodhisattva] who cannot maintain a mind that is largely unaffected [by the mental afflictions] will become a person who wanders [continuously] in samsara with an agitated mind and [a person] who can neither ripen the qualities of a buddha [in him- or herself] nor ripen [other] sentient beings. Moreover, if a bodhisattva allows his or her mind to become [overly] upset by [the unsatisfactory nature of] samsara through [having contemplated] the aspects of impermanence, etc., then he or she, having developed such [an attitude], will very quickly bring about [the] complete extinction [of samsaric rebirths]. The bodhisattva who very quickly brings about [the] complete extinction [of his or her samsaric rebirths] will, in that way, also fail to ripen the qualities of a buddha in him- or herself and fail to ripen [other] sentient beings, much less attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment.

Moreover, the bodhisattva who applies him- or herself using conviction about [the meaning of] emptiness will neither become frightened by nirvana nor desire to attain nirvana [prematurely].[272] If a bodhisattva should become frightened by nirvana, he or she will not, from that point forward, complete the accumulations [that are necessary to attain] nirvana because, through having developed this frightened attitude, he or she will become a bodhisattva who fails to see the benefits of nirvana and who has abandoned [both] the faith and the steadfast devotion toward nirvana that derive from recognizing the good qualities that are gained by its attainment. If a bodhisattva becomes one who abides [too] frequently in [the attitude of] wanting to attain nirvana, he or she will quickly bring about [the] complete extinction [of samsaric rebirths]. And a person who quickly brings about [the] complete extinction [of samsaric rebirths] can neither ripen the qualities of a buddha [in him- or herself] nor ripen [other] sentient beings.

This [effective] means is one that depends upon a conviction about [the meaning of] supreme emptiness. Therefore, meditation upon a conviction about [the meaning of] supreme emptiness represents [the element] within a bodhisattva’s path of training that is called a “great means”—which is to say, [a great means that contributes] to the attainment of a tathāgata’s knowledge. Indeed, a bodhisattva who has realized the ineffable nature of all entities as it truly is with [a form of] the knowledge of the insubstantiality of phenomena that has long since penetrated [into its meaning] does not form any type of conceptual thought whatsoever and does not grasp anything other than the bare substance[273] [of entities] and [their] bare suchness. [That bodhisattva] also does not think to him- or herself: “This is the bare substance [of entities],” or “This is the bare suchness [of entities].” Rather, the bodhisattva engages the [true] import.[274] Engaging this ultimate object, he or she perceives, with his or her wisdom, all entities as they truly are—[which is to say,] that they are [all] exactly the same in relation to this suchness.

He or she will not develop a dejected mind toward any of the [requisite] skills but will be energetic and one whose progress is unimpeded.

The more [this bodhisattva] attains extraordinary positions of eminence, the more he or she will become completely devoid of pride in the presence of [other] sentient beings. The more [this bodhisattva] attains extraordinary [forms of] knowledge, the more he or she will realize to an ever-greater degree [those situations in which] he or she is [about to] criticize or quarrel with another person, engage in rambling conversation,[275] [develop one of] the root or secondary mental afflictions, or engage in mistaken forms of conduct, and [therefore this bodhisattva] will [be able to] keep his or her mind in a heightened state of equanimity.

[That bodhisattva] becomes one who has no craving for possessions or for his or her own individual existence.[277] He or she also trains in relation to this freedom from craving in order [to become able] to give both his or her possessions and self to [other] sentient beings for the exclusive benefit of sentient beings. He or she becomes one who is restrained[278] and one who is extremely well restrained. He or she trains [continually] in body and speech with regard to the [moral discipline of] restraint,[279] in order to develop a natural aversion to evil and a character that is naturally good and virtuous. He or she is forbearing of every harm and act of hostility that is carried out [against him or her] by others.

He or she is either intent upon [mastering] or has [already] become a master of all the branches of learning, [enabling him or her] both to dispel the doubts of sentient beings and to provide them with what is beneficial, as well as [enabling him or her] to obtain the causes of omniscience. He or she also becomes one whose mind remains fixed inwardly and one who is well-established in the states of composure. He or she trains with regard to mental stability,[280] in order to refine the four divine pleasurable states[281] and develop an effortless mastery of the five forms of supernatural knowledge,[282] in order to both accomplish the aims of sentient beings and remove any fatigue that may arise from applying oneself to the topics about which one should become skilled.[283] He or she is perceptive[284] and knowledgeable about the supreme form of reality.

The bodhisattva who is thus correctly engaged [in the spiritual practice] attends to those beings who are endowed with virtuous qualities by venerating them and bestowing gain and honor upon them. One maintains an attitude of utmost compassion and pity toward those beings who are guilty of wickedness. With all one’s ability and strength, one undertakes to eliminate the faults of those [wicked beings]. One maintains an attitude of loving-kindness toward those beings who carry out harmful acts. With all one’s ability and strength, and keeping oneself free of both guile and deceitfulness, one provides those harmful beings with happiness and well-being, with the aim of inducing them to abandon the hostile states of mind that are caused by their own wicked thoughts and deeds. With gratitude toward those who carry out beneficial acts, one strives to repay [their kindness] with a [form of] benefit that is equal to or greater [than that shown to oneself]. With all one’s ability and strength, one fulfills [one’s] virtuous aspirations. And, with regard to those tasks and duties that one may be asked to do but is unable [to complete], one displays a proper regard [for them] and puts forth an effort [to undertake them]; one does not simply abandon them immediately. One [also] ponders, “How can it be made known that [it is because] I am unable [to do such and such a task that I have not completed it], not [because] I am unwilling [to do it]?” It should be understood that these are the kinds of correct practice [that are carried out] by a bodhisattva who has undertaken the system that is free of elaboration and who is relying upon the knowledge of the supreme form of reality.

It should be understood that any designation of a unique [essential] characteristic that occurs in relation to those entities that were [described] earlier [with the terms] that range from “form” and “feeling”[286] up to “nirvana” is nothing more than a [nominal] designation. [Such a designation] neither [describes] a [real] essential nature nor something separate from or different from [a real essential nature] that represents a thing to which speech refers or that is an object of speech. That being the case, the essential nature of entities does not exist in the way it is described in words. However, it is also not the case that it is completely and totally nonexistent.
If [an essential nature] does not exist in that manner[287] and it is also not something that is completely and totally nonexistent, how, then, does it exist?
It [exists in a way that] is both the avoidance of a failure of understanding that represents the imputation of something that does not truly exist[288] and the avoidance of a failure of understanding that represents the denial of something that does truly exist.[289] Moreover, it should be understood that this essential nature of all entities in an ultimate sense is an object that is perceived exclusively by a [form of] knowledge that is free of conceptual thought.[290]
On the other hand, if entities or a substance[291] actually did possess the very nature that is indicated by the verbal expressions that occur in relation to them, then [it would follow absurdly that] a single entity or a single substance must be of many different kinds and possess a multiplicity of essential natures.

[This can be understood] in the following way. Many designations and figurative expressions of many different kinds can be made using numerous terms in relation to a single entity or substance. Yet among these many and diverse designating assertions, no determination whatsoever can be made which [establishes] that the essential character, composition, or nature of some entity or substance [that is expressed] by one particular designating assertion is correct, and that [the ones that are expressed] by [all] the other remaining designating assertions are not [correct]. Therefore, all entities and substances lack the [forms of] essential character, composition, or nature [that are attributed to them] by all designating assertions, both the ones that [appear] sound and the ones that are flawed.

Moreover, suppose that the entities of form, etc., as they were described previously, did possess the [kind of] essential nature [that is expressed in] a designating assertion. In that case, a substance [would have to arise] first and then, afterward, a designating assertion could be applied to it, according to the wish [of some individual]. [This would mean that,] prior to the application of the designating assertion, [which is to say, at a time] when the designating assertion had not yet been made, such an entity or substance would not possess an essential nature. However, in the absence of an essential nature, it would not be valid for there to be a designating assertion that was not related to a [real] substance. And if no application of a designating assertion is made, then it should not be right for an entity or substance to possess [the kind of] essential nature [that is expressed in] a designating assertion.

On the other hand, suppose that an entity or a substance did possess such a nature[292] prior to the application of a designating assertion when the designating assertion had not yet been made. If that were so, then even without the application of a designating assertion [to the entity called] “form,” an awareness of form should occur in relation to the entity that is known as “form” and the substance that is known as “form.” But [such an awareness of form] does not occur [in this manner]. For this reason and by means of this [form of] application, it can be understood with precision that all entities possess an essential nature that is ineffable.

It should be understood that the following two [types of individuals] are lost to this [spiritual system of] Dharma and Vinaya:[293] (1) [the individual] who, due to having ascribed to the entities of form, etc., or the [underlying] substance of form, etc., a unique [essential] characteristic that does not truly exist and that represents an essence [formulated by] a designating assertion, then [mistakenly] adheres to [the existence of such a unique characteristic]; and (2) [the individual] who, by repudiating the substance that truly exists as ultimate truth in the form of an ineffable essence, and that is also the basis for the signs [by which] designating assertions [are formulated] and the support for the signs [by which] designating assertions [are formulated], repudiates it [by declaring] that it is completely and totally nonexistent.

Now I shall describe how [the individual] who denies the bare [underlying] substance that pertains to those entities of form, etc., and who [believes in] the complete annihilation of everything becomes lost to this [spiritual system of] Dharma and Vinaya.
For someone who denies the bare [underlying] substance of such entities as form, etc., neither [ultimate] reality nor [verbal] designations exist; they are both invalid. [This can be understood] in the following way: The [nominal] designation of a person is valid only if the heaps of form, etc., [are entities that] exist.[295] It would not be valid if they do not exist, [as then] the [nominal] designation of a person would be one that is not based upon an [underlying] substance. Similarly, as long as the bare [underlying] substance of the entities of form, etc., does exist, then the application of designating assertions to the entities of form, etc., is valid. It would not be [valid] if [the bare underlying substance of form and the rest] did not exist, [because in that case] the application of designating assertions would be [an act] that is not related to a [real] substance.

According to this [interpretation], since no [real] substance exists in association with a [verbal] designation, that [verbal] designation lacks an [underlying] basis and [thus] it, too, does not exist. Therefore, certain individuals[296] who have listened to the profound sutras associated with the Great Vehicle [tradition] that are difficult to understand, that relate to emptiness, and that present a topic expressed with an underlying thought[297] have failed to comprehend in a proper manner the meaning that is being taught [in them]. [Furthermore,] having engaged in improper conjecture, they develop and proclaim the following view that is based upon nothing but wrongly formulated reasoning: “Everything is nothing but a [verbal] designation and this represents [ultimate] reality. Whoever perceives [things] in this way perceives [things] correctly.” Because, according to them, the bare [real] substance that is the [underlying] basis of a designation does not exist, [it must also be the case that] the designation itself does not exist at all. How, then, could [the state of being that is] a mere designation represent [ultimate] reality? On the basis of this method [of reasoning], these [individuals] have repudiated both [ultimate] reality and [nominal] designations. And because of this repudiation of both [nominal] designations and [ultimate] reality, it should be understood that this is [the position of] a preeminent nihilist.[298]

On the other hand, by wrongly grasping [the meaning of] emptiness one is both confused about a knowable substance and also discredits all objects of knowledge.

Because a certain [quality] does not exist in relation to some [entity], one perceives: “This [entity] is empty of that [quality].” Moreover, one truly realizes in relation to what remains there: “This [emptiness] is real and it does exist here.” This [latter realization] is called “the true and unerring entry into emptiness.” That is to say, [such a person realizes] that there does not exist any entity that possesses the nature [that is expressed by] a designating assertion, such as those of “form,” etc., [as they are expressed] in relation to those substances known as form, etc., that were indicated [earlier]. Therefore, the substances that are known as form, etc., are empty of that nature [that is expressed by] designating assertions [that posit entities] such as “form,” etc.
What, then, is there that remains in relation to the [real] substance that is [variously] known as form, etc.?
It is just that which constitutes the basis for the designating assertions [that posit entities] such as “form,” etc. More specifically, one realizes both of the following things as they truly are: (1) the bare substance and (2) the mere [nominal] designation that exists in relation to that bare substance. Moreover, one does not falsely attribute that which does not truly exist nor does one repudiate that which does truly exist. One does not engage in either [false] augmentation or [unwarranted] diminution. Nothing [valid] is excluded and nothing [invalid] is interpolated. There is a true realization of the genuine suchness [of things] and the ineffable essential nature [of things]. This is called “the emptiness that has been correctly grasped and well penetrated by means of correct wisdom.” This favorable form of application that relates to demonstrating correctness is the one by which the ineffable essential nature of all entities can be understood with precision.

The ineffable essential nature of all entities can also be understood on the basis of trustworthy scripture. As the Blessed One declared in the Sutra on [the Manner of] Passing Over to a [New] Existence,[300] this very meaning is clarified in a verse recitation:
Verily, by whatever names
Entities may be expressed,
That is not to be found there.[301]
This, indeed, is the true nature of entities.
How, then, does this verse set forth its meaning?
A name is [a term], such as “form,” etc., for the entities that are known as form, etc. [The first two lines of the verse state the following:] By whatever names—such as those of “form,” etc.—the entities known as form, etc., are expressed and verbally described—[that is, the entities that are expressed by the names] “form,” “feeling,” [and so on] at length up to “nirvana” … [The third line states:] It is not the case that the entities known as form, etc., themselves, possessing the nature of form, etc., [are to be found] there. It is also not the case that some other entity possessing the nature of form, etc., is to be found in those [entities known as form, etc.]. [The last line of the verse states:] On the other hand, the ineffable mode of existence that pertains to the entities known as form, etc., should be understood to constitute their true essential nature [that exists] in an ultimate sense.
The Blessed One also declared in the [sutras known as] The Sections on Objects:[302]
Whatever things are agreed upon in the world,
The Muni does not admit to any of them.
As he does not assent, why would anything be grasped?
Thus, he generates no desire for what is seen or heard.

[The Muni] does not hold a view that [either mistakenly] ascribes [a quality that does not exist] or that [mistakenly] denies [a quality that does exist]. Therefore, he is said to be “one who does not assent,”[305] in the sense that he does not have a view that maintains an error. Being one who does not assent in this way, why would anything be grasped repeatedly? [That is to say,] in the absence such a view, there occurs no repeated grasping at a real substance either in the sense of ascribing [to it a quality that it does not have] or in the sense of denying [of it a quality that it does have] and, [therefore,] he becomes one who sees an object of knowledge correctly. This is what is seen by him. Whatever words are heard regarding an object of knowledge [that is understood] in just this way constitutes what is heard by him. [Therefore,] he neither develops nor strengthens any craving toward that which is seen or heard. There is no other means by which he could abandon [attachment for] an object and remain in a state of equanimity. This is the way in which he avoids generating desire.
The Blessed One again declared to Saṃtha Kātyāyana:
Here, Saṃtha, a bhikṣu does not rely upon earth when he meditates. He does not rely upon water, fire, or air [when he meditates]; [he does not rely upon] the sphere of space, [the sphere of] consciousness, [the sphere of] nothingness, and [the sphere in which there is] neither conception nor absence of conception;[306] [he does not rely upon] this world and the next world; the pair of the sun and moon; that which is seen, heard, considered, or perceived; or that which is attained, sought, deliberated upon, and reflected upon with the mind. He does not rely upon anything when he meditates.

How does he meditate so as not to rely upon earth when he meditates, [and so on, up to how does he meditate] so as not to rely upon anything when he meditates?
Here, Saṃtha, the conception of earth that occurs in relation to earth has been eliminated by the bhikṣu. The conception of water that occurs in relation to water, and so on, up to the conceptions that occur in relation to everything have been eliminated [by the bhikṣu]. This is how a bhikṣu meditates so as not to rely upon earth when he meditates, and so on, up to [this is how a bhikṣu] meditates so as not to rely on anything when he meditates.
From afar, the gods, together with [their chiefs] Indra, Īśāna, and Prajapati, pay homage to a bhikṣu who meditates in this manner, when they declare:
Homage to you, O noble of men.

How, then, does this sutra passage set forth its meaning?
The designation of a conventional name,[307] such as that of “earth,” etc., to the substance known as earth, etc., is what is called “the conception of earth,” etc. That conception, further, can either be one that [wrongly] ascribes [a quality that does not exist] or it can be one that [incorrectly] denies [a quality that does exist] in relation to the entities known as earth, etc. [The conception which] holds that [an entity] possesses this [or that kind of] substantive essence [is said to be the type] that [wrongly] ascribes [a quality which does not exist]. [The conception which] holds that the bare substance that represents [an entity’s] ultimate nature is to be rejected is said to be the [type of] conception that [incorrectly] denies [a quality that does exist]. These [two errors] are what are eliminated [by a bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī] from conceptions. Their abandonment and relinquishment are what is called their “elimination.” Therefore, it can also be understood on the basis of scripture—[which is to say,] through [relying upon] the Tathāgata’s supremely trustworthy word—that all entities have an [ultimate] nature that is ineffable.

If it is true that all entities possess such an ineffable nature, why is it that words are used in relation to them?
Without [the use of] words, it would not be possible for that ineffable true nature to be expressed to others nor [would it be possible for it] to be heard [by others]. Moreover, without speech and the hearing [of speech], it would also not be possible for that ineffable nature to be realized. Therefore, words are used so that [the explanation of the ultimate nature of all entities] might be heard and realized.

Because they have not fully realized this very suchness in the manner [that has just been described], immature beings[308] develop the eight types of conceptual thought that give rise to three [kinds of] substance and that bring forth the entire world of sentient beings and their physical environment. [The eight conceptual thoughts] are the following: (1) the conceptual thought [that conceives] of an essential nature, (2) the conceptual thought [that conceives] of a distinguishing characteristic, (3) the conceptual thought that grasps a collection [as a separate entity], (4) the conceptual thought [that conceives] of an “I,” (5) the conceptual thought [that conceives] of [entities as being] “mine,” (6) the conceptual thought [that conceives] of [entities as being] agreeable, (7) the conceptual thought [that conceives] of [entities as being] disagreeable, and (8) the conceptual thought [that conceives] of [entities as being] the opposite of both of these.[309]

Which of these eight types of conceptual thought give rise to the three substances?
Three conceptual thoughts—that is, the conceptual thought [that conceives] of an essential nature, the conceptual thought [that conceives] of a distinguishing characteristic, and the conceptual thought that grasps a collection [as a separate entity]—give rise to the substance that is [variously] known as form, etc., and that serves as [both] the basis for conceptual thought and elaboration[310] and the mental support of conceptual thought and elaboration. While continuously generating elaborations on the basis of [a particular substance], the conceptual thought that is both controlled by and governed by expressions [that derive from] recognition of [an object’s] name operates in numerous ways and in many different forms in relation to this very same substance.

With regard to this [point], two conceptual thoughts—that is, the conceptual thought [that conceives] of an “I” and the conceptual thought [that conceives] of [entities as being] “mine”—give rise to the view of the perishable collection,[311] which is the root of all the remaining views,[312] and [also give rise] to egoistic pride,[313] which is the root of [ordinary] pride and the root of all the other forms of pride.[314]

This is the manner in which the eight types of conceptual thought operate to bring about the three types of substance—that is, (1) the substance [that engenders] elaboration and is the basis of conceptual thought; (2) [the substance that consists of] the view [of the perishable collection] and egoistic pride; and (3) [the substance that consists of] desire, hatred, and ignorance. Regarding these, the basis for the view of the perishable collection and egoistic pride is the substance [that is the basis of] conceptual thought and [that engenders] elaboration. Desire, hatred, and ignorance are based upon the view of the perishable collection and egoistic pride. The aspect of all the worlds that relates to their progression[315] is explained exhaustively by means of these three [types of] substance.

In brief, this [explanation] consists of these two [elements]: (1) conceptual thought and (2) the substance that forms the basis of and the mental support for conceptual thought. Both of these should be understood as having existed since beginningless time and as having been each other’s reciprocal cause. A previous conceptual thought [serves as the cause] for the appearance of a present substance that constitutes the mental support for [a present] conceptual thought. Moreover, a present substance that has been caused to appear and that is the mental support for a conceptual thought [serves as] the cause for the appearance of the present conceptual thought for which it constitutes a mental support.
Regarding this [point], the current lack of thorough knowledge regarding [the nature of] a conceptual thought [serves as the cause] for the appearance of a substance in the future that will become the mental support for [a conceptual thought that exists at] that [time]. Moreover, because of the arising of that [substance], inevitably the appearance of a conceptual thought for which that [substance] serves as the basis and the support will also occur.

What are the four investigations?[327]
[They are] (1) the investigation of names, (2) the investigation of substances, (3) the investigation of [what constitutes] the designation of an essential nature, and (4) the investigation of [what constitutes] the designation of a distinguishing characteristic.
Regarding these, the investigation of names is that [process by] which a bodhisattva perceives, in relation to a name, that it is merely a name. Similarly, [the process that results in] the perception, in relation to a substance, that it is a bare substance constitutes the investigation of substances. The investigation of [what constitutes] the designation of an essential nature is [the process that results in] the perception that the designation of an essential nature is merely the [nominal] designation of an essential nature. The investigation of [what constitutes] the designation of a distinguishing characteristic is [the process that results in] the perception that the designation of a distinguishing characteristic is merely the [nominal] designation of a distinguishing characteristic. [The bodhisattva] perceives both the defining attributes of names and substances that are distinct [from one another], as well as the defining attributes that connect them.[328] He or she also realizes that the designation of an essential nature and the designation of a distinguishing characteristic are [both] based upon the connection [that exists] between a name and a substance.

What is the thorough knowledge of the way things truly are that has completed the investigation of names?
Having examined, with regard to names, the quality of being a mere name, a bodhisattva gains the following thorough knowledge regarding the true nature of names: This is the extent of the import of a name that is established in relation to [some] substance: its nominal import,[330] its theoretical import,[331] and its suppositional import.[332]
If a name such as “form” is not applied to a substance, such as one that is known as form, etc., then one will not form the conception of any substance whatsoever as being “form,” etc. When no conception is made [in relation to a substance], then one will not [mistakenly] adhere to it in the sense of [wrongly] ascribing [to it a quality that it does not possess]. When no [mistaken] adherence is made, then one will not make verbal assertions about it. [When a bodhisattva] truly discerns how this [process] occurs, that is called “the thorough knowledge of the way things truly are [that is gained by] having completed the investigation of names.”

His or her perception that this [nominally designated] essential nature is like a [mentally generated] emanation, a reflection, an echo, a false image, [a reflection of] the moon in water, [an object in] a dream, or a magical illusion, and that this appearance is not [truly] made up of that [nominally designated essential nature], constitutes the third form of thorough knowledge of the way things truly are, one whose field of action is a profound object.

What is the thorough knowledge of the way things truly are [that is gained by] having completed the investigation of [what constitutes] the designation of a distinguishing characteristic?
Through having investigated, in relation to the designation of a distinguishing characteristic, the quality of being a mere [nominal] designation, a bodhisattva perceives, in relation to the substance that is [variously] known as form, etc., the designation of the distinguishing characteristic in a nondual sense—[which is to say,] that a substance is neither a thing that exists nor a thing that does not exist. Because its verbally described nature does not constitute an absolute mode of being,[333] it is not a thing that exists. On the other hand, it is also not a thing that does not exist, because it is characterized by a [real] nature that is ineffable. Similarly, [form] both lacks the quality of being material from the perspective of ultimate truth and does not lack the quality of being material from the perspective of relative truth, since it is described in a provisional sense as constituting form. Just as with [the distinguishing characteristics] of being a thing that exists or a thing that does not exist, and those of being material or immaterial, all the [other] instances of designating a distinguishing characteristic, such as those of being visible or not visible, etc., should be understood according to this method [of explanation]. That which is realized in this way as it truly is—[which is to say,] in this nondual sense—about the designating of a distinguishing characteristic is called “the thorough knowledge of the way things truly are [that is gained by] having completed the investigation of [what constitutes] the designation of a distinguishing characteristic.”

Regarding this [topic], the eight types of improper conceptual thought, which cause immature beings to give rise to the three substances[334] and which bring forth the [entire] world [of sentient beings and their physical environment], arise because of [an individual’s] lack of competency about and failure to establish the four forms of thorough knowledge of the way things truly are. Furthermore, [the states of] affliction [arise] from the [eight forms of] improper conceptual thought; continuous rebirth in samsara [arises] from [the states of] affliction; and the suffering of birth, old age, illness, death, etc., that follow samsaric existence arises from [the condition of] being reborn continuously in samsara.

When a bodhisattva relies upon the four forms of thorough knowledge of the way things truly are, he or she develops thorough knowledge of the eight types of conceptual thought. Through having developed this true and thorough knowledge in the present life, there will be no appearance [for him or her] in future [lives] of the substance that constitutes the basis and mental support for those [conceptual thoughts] and that bring about the occurrence [of conceptual] elaboration. Because that [substance] does not arise or appear, there will also be no appearance [for him or her] in future [lives] of the conceptual thought for which that [substance would serve as] a mental support. This cessation of conceptual thought together with its [related] substance should be known as the cessation of all [conceptual] elaboration. The cessation of [conceptual] elaboration that occurs in this manner should be known as the bodhisattva’s [form of] complete nirvana [that is achieved through] the Great Vehicle.[335]
Through having perfected in one’s present life the knowledge that has this supreme form of reality as its field of action,[336] a bodhisattva becomes one who has attained a mastery of the universal controlling powers,[337] such as [having the ability to generate] a variety of emanation bodies by means of the miraculous power that produces emanations, [having the ability to generate] a variety of supernatural transformations by means of the miraculous power that transforms objects, [having the ability to generate] knowledge regarding all objects of knowledge, [having the ability to] remain [alive] for as long as one wishes, and [having the ability to] pass away without [experiencing] any physical harm, according to one’s desires.

[The bodhisattva] who has attained such powers becomes the most excellent of all sentient beings and one who has no superior. It should be understood that the bodhisattva who has attained this universal mastery gains five most excellent beneficial qualities. (1) He attains a supreme mental peace that is due to the tranquility [that originates from] abiding [in a state of extraordinary ease];[338] it is not due to the tranquility [that originates from having quelled] the mental afflictions. (2) He applies [this] unimpeded, thoroughly purified, and completely accomplished knowledge-vision to all the branches of learning.[339] (3) He does not become weary at having to be reborn successively in samsara in order to [accomplish] the welfare of sentient beings. (4) He is able to understand [the meanings of] all the enigmatic statements[340] made by the tathāgatas. (5) He becomes one who cannot be led away from devotion to the Great Vehicle, because he does not have to rely upon others [for spiritual guidance].

It should further be understood that these five forms of benefit have five types of action. (1) [The ability] of a bodhisattva who is thoroughly familiar with the [spiritual] practices that are directed toward enlightenment to abide in a supreme state of ease in the present life so that he may overcome any physical and mental weariness [that might otherwise be] caused by that exertion should be understood as the action that pertains to the beneficial quality of [having attained] a state of mental peace. (2) A bodhisattva’s [ability] to ripen all the qualities of a buddha [in himself] should be understood as the action that pertains to the beneficial quality of [having attained] the state in which his knowledge is unimpeded in relation to all the branches of learning. (3) A bodhisattva’s [ability] to ripen [other] sentient beings should be understood as the action that pertains to the beneficial quality of [having attained] the state in which he does not become weary [from being reborn repeatedly] in samsara. (4) [A bodhisattva’s ability] to eliminate any and all doubt that might arise [in the minds] of those persons who are suitable to be [spiritually] trained [by him], as well as [his ability] to maintain and preserve the Dharma [system of spiritual] guidance for a long time by being thoroughly aware of, exposing, and overcoming those who [promote] a false likeness of the true Dharma and who [contribute to] the disappearance of the [Buddha’s] teaching should be understood as the action that pertains to the beneficial quality of understanding [the meanings of] all the enigmatic statements [made by the tathāgatas]. (5) [A bodhisattva’s ability] to refute all those who assert verbal challenges, his strong spiritual fortitude, and his ability to avoid falling away from [the commitment to accomplish] the aspirational prayers [that he has made] should be understood as the action that pertains to the beneficial quality of being one who cannot be led astray because of not having to rely upon others [for spiritual guidance].

Now then, what is the power[341] of the bodhisattvas?
In brief, [the ability] of [a bodhisattva] who has attained mastery of [one-pointed] concentration [to achieve] complete success in all [one’s own] aims through relying on mastery of [one-pointed concentration and merely by [forming] the desire to do so is called the “noble[342] power of one whose mind is fit for action and one whose mind is very well cultivated.” The great results and the highly beneficial nature of the spiritual qualities [that are possessed by bodhisattvas] are also called their “power.” The marvelous and wonderful nature of the buddhas and bodhisattvas that they are born with and that derives from the great accumulation of merit that they collected in the past should also be understood as another natural power that is possessed by them.
In terms of its variety, this [power] of the buddhas and bodhisattvas is of five types: (1) the power of supernatural knowledge, (2) the power of spiritual qualities, (3) natural power, (4) the power that is shared with listeners and solitary realizers, and (5) the power that is not shared with listeners and solitary realizers.

It is when a tathāgata or a bodhisattva in this world simultaneously accomplishes the aims of countless, immeasurable numbers of sentient beings in immeasurable and countless world spheres that lie in the ten directions, by means of manifold magical emanations that appear in a variety of forms.
In addition, some magical creations are established in such a way that they continue to carry out [their activities] even after the tathāgata or bodhisattva [who created them] has passed away. Some magical creations of buddhas and bodhisattvas are simply intended to reveal illusory objects to sentient beings. On the other hand, some [magical creations] are emanated as actual objects such as food, drink, a vehicle, clothing, etc., or jewels, pearls, lapis lazuli, shell, crystal, coral, etc. [The latter] are exactly the same and no different from [those ordinary objects], such that they are able to serve the same function that [ordinary] riches and useful objects do.

He or she can cause his or her voice to be understood throughout a double-thousand world spheres, or a great triple-world spheres, or as far as countless, immeasurable numbers of world spheres that lie in the ten directions. Dharma teachings that are directed toward sentient beings and that are of many different kinds emanate from this [kind of] voice, and [they are Dharma teachings] that come into being for the sake of sentient beings.

Regarding this [topic], a magical creation of speech that is connected with oneself is one that teaches Dharma or admonishes the heedless with speech that was magically created by oneself.

These numerous forms of magical creations should be understood in brief as [consisting of three types]: a magical creation of a body, a magical creation of speech, and a magical creation of an object. This represents [a description of] creative miraculous power. Moreover, it should be understood that if this [type of miraculous power] were distinguished in [all of] its various individual forms, they would be beyond measure and number.
Moreover, in brief, this twofold[394] form of miraculous power of buddhas and bodhisattvas also causes two aims to be achieved: (1) once sentient beings have been won over through the displaying of marvelous abilities,[395] they are caused to take up the Buddha Dharma; and (2) many different kinds and varieties of benefit are provided to sentient beings who are undergoing suffering.

Regarding this [topic], what is the buddhas’ and bodhisattvas’ knowledge of an existence [that took place] in the past?
In this world, a tathāgata or a bodhisattva recalls his or her own former existences.[396] He or she recalls everything [about a particular life], including such things as the group of sentient beings [with whom he or she lived], as [described] at length in the sutras with language that states in part, “The sentient beings [of the place] where I lived [at that time were known by] such and such a name. I was named thus ....”
Just as one recalls one’s own [former existences], one also causes others to recall their [former existences]. One also recalls [the former existences] of others. One recalls the groups of sentient beings that existed at a previous time and also causes others to recall [such groups of sentient beings], as described at length in the sutras with language that states in part, “The sentient beings [of the place] where I lived [at that time were known by] such and such a name. I was named thus ...” [One] also recalls those [groups of] sentient beings in all the existences of the past in just the same way that [one] does [the group of sentient beings with whom one lives] in one’s own present life.
[A tathāgata or bodhisattva] also remembers minute things [that took place in a former life], [including] whatever infrequent or numerous former actions and former [thoughts] that, once considered, had been lost from memory. In addition, he or she remembers uninterrupted moments—[that is,] the precise order in which something was done continuously and in an uninterrupted manner. He or she remembers as well a measure [of time] that is capable of being counted in terms of a discrete number of kalpas. He or she also remembers an immeasurable and countless [span of time] that is incapable of being counted in terms of a discrete number of kalpas.

In short, this [tathāgata’s or bodhisattva’s] knowledge of existences [that took place] in the past operates in an unobstructed manner—wherever, in whatever manner, and for however long may be desired. Such is the nature of a bodhisattva’s or a tathāgata’s power that pertains to existences [that took place] in the past. By means of the knowledge that recalls former existences, he or she reveals to sentient beings the varied and numerous kinds of previous births in which supremely marvelous bodhisattva activities were carried out, in order to cause [those beings] to develop faith and devotion toward the Buddha, the Blessed One, and in order to engender [in them] aversion [toward samsara]. He or she also reveals events from bygone times that relate to the ripening of the karmic fruit of sentient beings. [In this way], he or she can destroy the eternalistic views of those who uphold an eternalistic doctrine—namely, those eternalists who form a speculative doctrine based upon the past that views [the world and the self] as [completely] eternal, and [those who form a speculative doctrine based upon the past] that views a portion of [the world and the self] to be eternal.[397]

Regarding this topic, human sounds are those that occur horizontally[400] and [that are made by the human] beings who have been born in all of the four continents.
Regarding this topic, noble sounds are those made by buddhas, the buddhas’ listeners, bodhisattvas, and solitary realizers. Alternatively, it is [the sounds made by] beings other than these [four groups], who declare [to others] what they have heard directly from [any of] these [four groups]. For example, these are [sounds] that relate both to taking up virtue and to abandoning nonvirtue, and that have the nature of revealing [how this is to be done], that induce others to take up [such a practice], that generate enthusiasm [for such a practice], and that gladden [those who have done so successfully]. Similarly, it includes [the sounds] of those individuals whose minds are not disturbed [by the mental afflictions] and [who are engaged in acts such as] explaining [doctrine], reciting [scriptures], settling [philosophical meanings], correctly admonishing [others], causing [others] to recall [what is proper], and giving instruction[401] and counsel.[402] It is also any other form of good speech, good conversation, or meaningful [talk].

Faint sounds are the sounds that are as slight as a whisper in the ear.
Distinct sounds are those in which a meaning is understood.
Indistinct sounds are those in which a meaning is not understood—for example, [the sounds] of Dravidian mantras,[404] as well as [the sounds] of the wind, large forest trees, parrots, mynas,[405] cuckoos, pheasants,[406] and the like.
Regarding this topic, sounds that are magical creations are those that are produced by the miraculous power of those who possess miraculous powers and who have attained mastery of their mind.
Distant sounds are those sounds other than the ones that occur in a village, field, or hall, in which a tathāgata or bodhisattva is present, [and they can be heard arising from] as far away as countless, immeasurable world spheres.

What is the buddhas’ and bodhisattvas’ knowledge regarding death and rebirth?
In this world, a tathāgata or a bodhisattva, by means of the pure divine eye that surpasses that of humans, sees beings at the time of their death and also sees the good or bad appearance of those who have died[407] and the inferior or excellent circumstances into which they are reborn in the future. In addition, [a tathāgata or a bodhisattva sees] that [these beings], due to the development and ripening of their faculties and with the variety of their physical exertions, will engage in virtuous, nonvirtuous, and indeterminate [deeds].
Similarly, [he or she] also sees and realizes [gross] appearances,[408] and [he or she] also sees subtle objects, [such as] the form that is a magical creation and the divine form that is clear—reaching as far down as Avīci Hell and as far upward as the celestial realm [known as] Below None. If [a tathāgata or a bodhisattva] makes an effort that relates to seeing the form present in other world spheres that lies in a downward, upward, or horizontal [direction], [he or she] sees all the form that exists, reaching as far away as countless, immeasurable world spheres. [He or she] even sees all the individual tathāgatas in all the different buddha fields who are seated in the midst of a great assembly-circle made up of a great variety [of beings] and teaching the Dharma.
With regard to this [supernatural power], having seen by means of his or her divine eye the good and bad physical acts [that are carried out by sentient beings] in the ten directions, a tathāgata or bodhisattva acts in a fitting manner and in an appropriate manner with regard to those sentient beings. In addition, having heard by means of his or her divine ear the good and bad verbal acts, [a tathāgata or bodhisattva] acts in a fitting manner and in an appropriate manner with regard to those sentient beings. In brief, this is how a bodhisattva or a tathāgata carries out deeds by means of the divine eye and the divine ear.

Regarding this [topic], what is the buddhas’ and bodhisattvas’ knowledge regarding diverse states of mind?[409]
In this world, a bodhisattva or a tathāgata knows the minds of other beings that have been perturbed by the mental afflictions, [wherever those beings may exist] in countless, immeasurable world spheres that lie in the ten directions. He or she also knows the minds [of other beings] that have been freed of the perturbation caused by the mental afflictions, as well as those [minds] that have a connection with the mental afflictions and are associated with the latencies,[410] those [minds] that have no connection with the mental afflictions and are free of the latencies, as well as those [minds] that possess an aspiration that is directed improperly—such as the minds of heretics and any unafflicted minds of individuals whose intentions are driven by corporeal desire.[411] He or she also knows the minds [of those beings] that are the opposite of that—namely, the minds that possess an aspiration that is directed correctly.[412]
[A bodhisattva or a tathāgata] also knows inferior minds—that is to say, those of all sentient beings who have been born in the desire realm, including forest animals and birds. He or she knows middling minds—that is to say, [the minds] of all sentient beings who have been born in the form realm. He or she knows superior minds—that is to say, [the minds] of all sentient beings who have been born in the formless realm.

Regarding this [topic], what is the buddhas’ and bodhisattvas’ knowledge regarding termination of the outflows?
In this world, a tathāgata or a bodhisattva realizes truly the attainment of the termination of the mental afflictions, which is to say that he or she [realizes], “I or others have attained or have not attained the termination [of the mental afflictions].”[414] [A tathāgata or a bodhisattva] also realizes truly, as pertains to him- or herself as well as to others, the means to the attainment of the termination of the outflows. Just as with the means [to such an attainment], he or she also realizes truly what does not constitute a [proper] means [to such an attainment]. [A tathāgata or a bodhisattva] also realizes truly the exaggerated pride[415] of others in relation to the attainment of the termination of the outflows, and he or she also realizes truly the absence of exaggerated pride.
Although a bodhisattva realizes all of this, he or she does not bring about his or her own termination of the outflows. Therefore, a bodhisattva does not generate overt forms of the entities that are related to the outflows and he or she also does not abandon the substantive form of the entities that are related to the outflows together with the outflows.[416] Regarding this [point], [a bodhisattva] investigates the entities that are related to the outflows and he or she also avoids becoming afflicted by them. It should be understood that, among all the [spiritual] powers, this one is [a bodhisattva’s] greatest [form of] power. Indeed, it is through this knowledge of the termination of the outflows that buddhas and bodhisattvas prevent themselves from becoming afflicted. It is also [through this knowledge that] they identify others [who have succeeded in terminating the mental afflictions] and destroy the exaggerated pride [of those who mistakenly believe that they have done so]. It should be understood that this is the action [that is accomplished] by this [form of supernatural knowledge].

Regarding this [topic], what is the power of spiritual qualities?
It is the power of generosity, as well as the powers of morality, patience, effort, meditative absorption, and wisdom. Moreover, in brief, this power of the spiritual qualities of generosity, etc., should be understood in terms of four aspects: (1) abandoning the opposing qualities, (2) ripening the accumulations,[417] (3) benefiting oneself and others, and (4) bestowing results in the future.

By practicing generosity, a bodhisattva abandons stinginess, [the fault that] directly opposes generosity. His or her generosity also constitutes an accumulation [of merit that leads to] enlightenment. By means of the generosity that is one of the principles for attracting a following,[418] [a bodhisattva] also brings about the spiritual ripening of sentient beings. Prior to giving, one’s mind is favorably disposed; while giving, one gladdens one’s heart; after having given, one avoids any sense of regret. By maintaining a joyfulness of mind in relation to the three times,[419] [a bodhisattva] benefits him- or herself. He or she also benefits others by dispelling the suffering that they undergo due to hunger, thirst, cold, heat, illness, unfulfilled desires, and danger. Wherever [a bodhisattva] is reborn in a future existence, he or she becomes wealthy, has many possessions, is endowed with many friends, and has a large following. In addition, he or she takes pleasure in generosity. These are the four aspects that make up the power of generosity. It does not consist of anything superior to this or anything beyond this.

A bodhisattva who possesses wisdom abandons ignorance, [the fault that] directly opposes wisdom. His or her wisdom also constitutes an accumulation [that leads to] enlightenment. [A bodhisattva] ripens sentient beings by means of generosity as well as agreeable speech, beneficial conduct, and sameness of purpose.[430] He or she benefits him- or herself by means of the great joy and great delight that is accompanied by accurate and specific knowledge of the objects that need to be realized.

What is the natural power that is possessed by buddhas and bodhisattvas?
[One of the natural powers that they possess is] a natural ability to recall [former] births. [Another is] the ability to endure long-lasting, varied, intense, and continuous hardships after having investigated what promotes the welfare of sentient beings. [A third is] a joyful willingness [to take on any] suffering that will bring about the welfare of sentient beings and that is [taken on] exclusively for the sake of sentient beings.
[The natural powers] also include for [a bodhisattva[432]] who has taken birth among [the deities of] the Tuṣita Heaven to remain among [those deities of] the Tuṣita Heaven for the duration of his life. It is the quality by which he surpasses the other deities who have been born in Tuṣita Heaven in three respects: divine life span, divine physical beauty, and divine fame. When [a bodhisattva] is entering the belly of his mother, he also permeates the world sphere with great light. When he enters his mother’s belly and remains there, as well as when he emerges [from her belly] and is born, he does so with correct awareness. As soon as he is born, he takes seven steps upon the earth without being held by anyone, and he also utters speech. Once born, he [is honored] with supremely excellent acts of worship by exalted gods, nāgas, yakṣas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, and mahoragas, who offer him celestial flower garlands, music, incense, garments, parasols, banners, flags, and the like. His body is well marked with the thirty-two unsurpassed marks of a great being.

In his last existence and final birth, he is incapable of being harmed by any hostile beings, followers of Māra,[433] or any [forms of] violence. When seated at the place of enlightenment, he conquers all of Māra’s forces by means of his loving-kindness. In all his joints and in [each] single one [individually] he possesses the strength of Narāyaṇa. As a small boy and without having undergone any training,[434] he very quickly and on his own develops an understanding of all the secular arts. Without a spiritual guide and entirely on his own, he achieves the great enlightenment that extends throughout a triple-thousand [world spheres]. Approached by Brahmā himself, lord of the Sahā[435] world sphere, he is beseeched to teach the true Dharma in the world. Without recognizing [even the sound of] great thunder, he does not arise from a state of meditative composure [and remains in] a peaceful state.
Wild beasts, birds, and even small animals regard the bodhisattva with utmost trust, approaching him at all times and remaining next to him for as long as they wish. Even animals honor the Tathāgata. For example, a monkey once presented raw[436] honey to the Tathāgata. When the Tathāgata accepted it, the monkey was greatly pleased and withdrew dancing.[437]

When a tathāgata bathes, clouds move toward the blessed one [as if] they deliberately formed the intention to bathe him.

Because [a tathāgata’s] recollection is always present, he is constantly and continuously in a state of well-placed [recollection]. [A tathāgata] remains in a state of recollection with regard to the arising, continuous existence, and cessation of each of the feelings, conceptions, and thoughts that he experiences.

Similarly, buddhas possess a [form of] natural power that brings benefit [merely] by being seen, as well as a [form of] natural power that relates to excellence of movement and remaining at rest.[438] Examples in which [buddhas] benefit [beings] by being seen are the following: After seeing a tathāgata, those who are insane or mentally disturbed regain [their soundness of] mind. Women whose wombs are irregular obtain a normal womb. Those who are blind gain their sight. Those who are deaf gain their hearing. Those who are filled with desire become free of the perturbation[439] of desire; those who are hateful [become free of] of the perturbation of hatred; and those who are ignorant [become free of] of the perturbation of ignorance. These kinds of occurrences should be understood as forms of the natural power [by which buddhas] benefit [beings] by being seen.

Regarding the natural power that relates to excellence in moving about and remaining at rest, the following are examples: [A buddha] prepares to sleep by lying on his right side in the manner of a lion. Grass and leaves are spread out for him to lie down upon on one side. This bedding for a tathāgata, arhat, and completely enlightened buddha remains undisturbed. The wind does not blow his monks’ robes away from his body. He moves with the gait of a lion. He also moves with the gait of a bull. He raises his right foot first [when walking], followed by his left foot. When he walks, elevated areas [of the ground] descend and lower ones rise up, becoming as even as the palm of the hand and free of stones, pebbles, and shards. He enters a town with a mind that is intent on solitude. When he enters [dwellings], low doors become elevated [to accommodate him]. When he eats food, he does not ingest even a single lump of boiled rice without having separated it [into bite-sized morsels].[440] He does not take a second morsel if there is still some remainder [of the previous one in his mouth]. These kinds of [behavior and physical occurrences] should be understood as [forms of a buddha’s] natural power that relates to excellence in moving about and remaining at rest.

At the time of [a buddha’s] parinirvana, the great earth shakes, meteors are seen to fall, a fire-like glowing appears on the horizon, the sounds of divine drums are heard in the sky. These phenomena are also instances of the natural power of the tathāgatas; they are not [artificial] creations of supernatural knowledge. This is what is called the natural power of buddhas and bodhisattvas.

What is the power of buddhas and bodhisattvas that is not shared with listeners and solitary realizers and what is [the power of buddhas and bodhisattvas] that is shared with them?
In brief, [the power] that is not shared [with listeners and solitary realizers] should be understood as having three aspects that relate to subtlety, types, and constituents. In this world, a tathāgata or a bodhisattva knows exactly how to do what is beneficial for countless, immeasurable numbers of sentient beings, by employing countless, immeasurable [varieties of] means. This represents [the aspect] that relates to subtlety [of discernment]. [A tathāgata or a bodhisattva] possesses every type of power—the power of supernatural knowledge, the power of spiritual qualities, and natural power. This represents [the aspect] that relates to types [of power]. All the world spheres and all the [types of] constituent elements that are possessed by sentient beings represent the scope of [a tathāgata’s or a bodhisattva’s] powers. This represents [the aspect] that relates to constituents.[441]
By contrast, the scope of the supernatural knowledge that is possessed by listeners is [limited to] a double-thousand world spheres together with the [various] types of sentient beings [that are found there]. The scope of the supernatural knowledge that is possessed by solitary realizer [arhats] is [limited to] the entirety of a triple-thousand [world spheres].

Why is that?
It is because each [of the disciples within those two vehicles] is only devoted to bringing about his or her own [spiritual] self-control, not that of all sentient beings. Therefore, the maximum scope of their spiritual power does not extend beyond one [complete] world sphere.

With the exception of those aspects [that are exclusive], all other [forms of] power that are possessed by buddhas and bodhisattvas should be understood as being shared with the listeners and solitary realizers. Even so, listeners and solitary realizers do not possess supernatural knowledge that is equal in its reach to that of the buddhas and bodhisattvas. This is all the more true for [any powers that are possessed by] all the [worldly] gods, humans, heretics,[442] and ordinary persons.[443]
It should be understood that the bodhisattva’s power of marvelous abilities[444]—which encompasses miraculous power, revealing others’ thoughts, and giving spiritual instruction—is also included, in the appropriate manner, within the power of supernatural knowledge. [That is, in the same order, they are included] within [these three forms of] the power of supernatural knowledge: (1) miraculous spheres of activity, (2) [knowledge of] diverse states of mind, and (3) knowledge of termination of the outflows.

Regarding this [topic], the essential nature of having become [spiritually] ripe is a state of fitness[445] and soundness[446] of body and mind that favors the abandonment and complete removal of the obscurations of the mental afflictions and the obscurations to that which needs to be known;[447] and it is the culmination point [of an individual’s] right practice[448] that is due to the presence of the seeds of virtuous qualities and that comes about through having diligently engaged in [the practice of] virtuous qualities. Immediately after this point has been reached, [a practitioner] becomes fit and sufficiently strong to bring about the abandonment of either the obscurations of the mental afflictions or the obscurations to that which needs to be known, irrespective of whether he or she has met with the Master[449] or has not met with the Master.[450] For example, immediately after a boil has reached the ideal state for lancing, it is ready to be lanced and [when it reaches this point] it is said to be ripe. Immediately after a household object made of clay—such as a pitcher, a water jar, or a plate, etc.—has reached the ideal state for being put to use, it is ready to be used and [when it reaches this point] it is said to be ripe.[451] Immediately after fruit such as a mango or a breadfruit, etc., has reached the ideal state for eating, it is ready to be consumed and [when it reaches this point] it is said to be ripe. In just the same way, [the point at which] right practice has reached a state of culmination through [a bodhisattva’s] having diligently engaged in [the practice of] virtuous qualities is one that is followed immediately by the purification [of some portion of the obscurations]. This is the essential nature of having become [spiritually] ripe.

Regarding this [topic], in brief, there are four [types of] persons who are to be ripened. An individual who possesses the spiritual lineage of a listener is to be ripened by bodhisattvas and the buddhas, the blessed ones, in relation to the Listeners’ Vehicle. An individual who possesses the spiritual lineage of a solitary realizer is to be ripened [by bodhisattvas and buddhas] in relation to the Solitary Realizers’ Vehicle. An individual who possesses the spiritual lineage of a buddha is to be ripened [by bodhisattvas and buddhas] in relation to the Great Vehicle. An individual who does not abide in any spiritual lineage is to be ripened [by bodhisattvas and buddhas] so that he or she can proceed to a happy migratory state.[452] These are the four persons who are to be ripened in relation to those four worthy objects.[453] This is how the aspect of ripening that relates to persons who are to be ripened should be understood.

In brief, there are six types: (1) the ripening of faculties, (2) the ripening of roots of virtue, (3) the ripening of knowledge, and (4) weak, (5) middling, and (6) great [forms of] ripening.
Regarding this [topic], the ripening of faculties refers to excellence of life span, physical appearance, family, and power, [as well as the qualities of] having one’s speech accepted, being regarded as eminent, being human, and having great strength. Through having attained a [physical] basis that possesses these excellent [forms of] maturation results,[454] one becomes fit for [maintaining] fervor[455] in [pursuit of] one’s spiritual practice, and one remains free of mental weariness about the constant exertions [that must be made] in order to gain full knowledge of all the branches of learning.

What is the ripening of roots of virtue?
It is the quality of having afflictive emotions that are naturally weak. Through having such a quality, one’s mind naturally avoids going toward evil, nonvirtuous qualities. In addition, one is [a person whose] hindrances[456] [to meditative composure] are weak, [a person whose] discursive thoughts[457] are weak, and [a person] who is upright and duly observant.[458]

What is the ripening of knowledge?
[It is when] one possesses recollection and learning and is able to perceive, comprehend, retain, and fathom the meaning of teachings that are well explained as well as those that are poorly explained. [Such a person] is endowed with a natural wisdom that, once gained, makes him or her suitable and capable of freeing his or her mind completely and permanently of all the mental afflictions.
Regarding [these varieties of ripening], the ripening of faculties causes one to become free of the maturation obscurations;[459]459 the ripening of the roots of virtue causes one to become free of karmic obscurations;[460] and the ripening of knowledge causes one to become free of the obscurations of the mental afflictions.

What is weak ripening?
There are two reasons that [an individual’s] spiritual ripening is weak: (1) the causes that ripen the faculties, roots of virtue, and knowledge have not been practiced for a [sufficiently] long period of time; and (2) the causes [of one’s spiritual ripening] that are being practiced have not been fully nurtured and are deficient [in strength].
A middling form of [ripening] should be understood as being due to the fact that one of these two conditions is not in effect while the other one is.
A great form of [spiritual] ripening should be understood as [occurring when] neither of these two conditions is in effect.

(25) How does one personally accomplish the ripening [of others]?
[A bodhisattva] teaches suitable [forms of] Dharma that cause [others] to turn away from opportunities [to engage in] nonvirtuous [actions] and to become established in opportunities [to engage in] virtuous [actions]. He or she also conducts him- or herself in the [same] manner that he or she tells [others that they should behave]. An individual who acts in a manner that conforms to his or her own words[479] is a person who is established in a form of practice that accords with Dharma[480] or a person who follows [a form of practice] that resembles that,[481] such that no one would say to him or her: “You yourself are not yet someone who has turned away from opportunities [to engage in] nonvirtuous [actions] and become established in opportunities [to engage in] virtuous [actions]. Why do you think that you can cause others to take up that [behavior], urge them [to do so], and remind them [to do so]?

What are the characteristics of those persons who are spiritually ripe?
When a listener who has practiced virtue in the past abides in a state [that represents] a weak form of ripening, he or she possesses a weak aspiration and a weak [form of] application. He or she also [can] fall into the lower realms and in the present life will neither achieve [any of] the fruits of asceticism nor complete emancipation.[490] When [a listener] abides in a state [that represents] a middling form of ripening, he or she possesses a middling aspiration and a middling [form of] application. He or she no longer falls into the lower realms and does achieve [some of] the fruits of asceticism in the present life. However, [a listener who possesses a middling form of ripening] does not achieve complete emancipation in the present life. [A listener] who abides in a great [form of] ripening possesses a great aspiration and a great [form of] application. He or she does not fall into the lower realms, does achieve [all of] the fruits of asceticism in the present life, and also does achieve complete emancipation in the present life.
The solitary realizer should be understood in the same manner as the listener.

Why is that?
It is because his or her path is of the same kind as that of the listeners. However, the following is a difference between a solitary realizer and listeners. In [a solitary realizer’s] final existence, when he or she has obtained [the] final physical form, [that practitioner] realizes the status of an arhat through abandoning all the mental afflictions and after having meditated on the thirty-seven spiritual qualities that are conducive to enlightenment,[491] without [having to rely upon] a teacher and on the strength of [his or her] former practice. This is the reason [that such a practitioner] is called a solitary realizer.

Regarding this [topic], these five forms of ripening—the ripening that is accomplished on the basis of material things, [the ripening that occurs] through winning over [followers by displaying] miraculous powers, [the ripening that] arises through explaining secret Dharma, [the ripening that is accompanied by] weak application, and the ripening that is accomplished merely on the basis of learning—will be only a weak form [of ripening] even after virtuous qualities have been cultivated for a long period of time, much less when they have been cultivated for a short period of time.
It should be understood that all the other causes of ripening bring about the [spiritual] ripening [of beings] in a threefold manner. A weak form of ripening should be understood [to result] from a weak form of practice, a middling form [of ripening] from a middling form [of practice], and a great form [of ripening] from a great form [of practice]. Each of these three forms of ripening—weak, middling, and great—should be understood as occurring in an additional threefold manner. [That is,] the weak form [of ripening] has a weak form of being weak, a middling form of being weak, and a great form of being weak. The middling form [of ripening] has a weak form of being middling, a middling form of being middling, and a great form of being middling. The great form [of ripening] has a weak form of being great, a middling form of being great, and a great form of being great. By a similar process of ever-greater subdivision, it should be understood that the variety of forms in which buddhas and bodhisattvas bring about the ripening of sentient beings is beyond measure.

In brief, two types of abandonment and two types of knowledge are called “enlightenment.”
Regarding this [topic], the two types of abandonment are (1) the abandonment of the obscurations of the mental afflictions and (2) the abandonment of the obscurations to that which needs to be known. The two types of knowledge, on the other hand, are (1) the stainless knowledge that is free from the encumbrance of the mental afflictions through having abandoned the obscurations of the mental afflictions, and (2) the knowledge that is unobstructed in relation to all objects of knowledge through having abandoned the obscurations to that which needs to be known.

A tathāgata’s quality of being endowed with four unsurpassed and unequaled forms of accomplishment—[that is,] perfection of morality, perfection of [right] view, perfection of conduct, and perfection of livelihood—is what is called “supremacy of accomplishment.”
A tathāgata’s quality of being endowed with four unsurpassed and unequaled forms of knowledge—[that is,] informative knowledge of Dharma, informative knowledge of meanings, informative knowledge of clear expression, and informative knowledge [that confers] eloquence—is what is called “supremacy of knowledge.”

Regarding this [last form of supremacy], [the practice of] abiding in [states of one-pointed concentration upon] emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness,[508] as well as [the practice of] abiding in the state of composure that is a cessation,[509] are what are called “the pleasurable states of the āryas.” The four meditative absorptions and the four formless states of composure are what are called “the pleasurable states of the gods.” The four immeasurables are what are called “the divine pleasurable states.”
Furthermore, of these three [types of] pleasurable states, four [elements represent the aspects of] the supreme pleasurable states in which the tathāgatas abide to a high degree. [Two are] from the pleasurable states of the āryas—[namely,] abiding in emptiness and abiding in the state of composure that is a cessation; [one is] from the pleasurable states of the gods—[namely,] the fourth meditative absorption, which is known as “immobile”;[510] and [one is] from the divine pleasurable states—[namely,] the pleasurable state of abiding in compassion. [These four are the ones] which a tathāgata employs to look upon the world with his buddha eye three times during the night and three times during the day, or six times during the day and night, to determine “Who is growing spiritually? Who is declining spiritually? Whose undeveloped virtue roots can I cause to become firmly established?” ... and so on, up to “Whom can I establish in the highest fruit of an arhat?”

Regarding this [topic], due to the supremacy of their basis, the tathāgatas are called “great beings.” Due to the supremacy of their action, they are called “the ones whose compassion is great.” Due to the supremacy of their accomplishment, they are called “the ones whose morality and spiritual qualities are great.” Due to the supremacy of their knowledge, they are called “the ones whose wisdom is great.” Due to the supremacy of their power, they are called “the ones whose supernatural knowledge is great.” Due to the supremacy of their abandonment, they are called “the ones who have attained great liberation.” Due to the supremacy of their pleasurable states, they are called “the ones who abide in the great pleasurable states to a high degree.”

Moreover, ten aspects make up the verbal description of the good qualities possessed by the tathāgatas; [they] also [form the basis for practicing] recollection of their good qualities.
What are the ten?
[As the sutra passage states:] “So it is that the Bhagavān is the Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyaksaṃbuddha, the One who possesses knowledge and its support, the Sugata, the One who knows the world, the unsurpassed Leader of persons who can be tamed, the Teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, and the Bhagavān.”

(1) Regarding [these expressions], he is the Tathāgata because his speech is unerring.[511]

(3) He is the Samyaksaṃbuddha because he has become aware of all entities exactly as they are in their ultimate sense.
(4) He is the One who possesses knowledge and its support[513] in that he is well endowed with three forms of knowledge[514] and their support, which are described in the sutras as consisting of insight and quiescence as well as those elements that favor both of them.

Why is that?
[It is because] there are countless, immeasurable numbers of bodhisattvas in the ten directions who have made aspirational prayers at the same time and who have completed equal amounts of the [two] accumulations. In whatever day, half-month, month, or year a single bodhisattva has made the aspirational prayer of enlightenment mind, in that very day, half-month, or year all [bodhisattvas have done so as well]. In whatever way a single [bodhisattva] has exerted him- or herself, striven [to practice], and made great effort, all [bodhisattvas have also done so] in the same way. For if even in this very world sphere many hundreds of bodhisattvas are seen to make aspirational prayers at the same time, [if they are seen] to be similar in their generosity, similar in their morality, similar in their patience, similar in their effort, similar in their meditative absorption, and similar in their wisdom, then how much more would this be so throughout the endless and limitless [numbers of] world spheres that lie in the ten directions. The buddha fields that exist throughout the ten directions, [each of which encompasses] a great triple-thousand world spheres, are also measureless and countless [in number].

Now, since it is not possible for two bodhisattvas who have similarly completed their accumulations [of merit and wisdom] to take birth at the same time in the buddha field of one and the same world sphere, how much more would this be so for measureless and countless numbers [of bodhisattvas]. Moreover, it would not be proper for [bodhisattvas whose completion] of accumulations is similar to take birth in succession with one following the other, nor would it be proper for them not to take birth at all. Therefore, it should be understood that those bodhisattvas who have similarly completed their accumulations are born in separate buddha fields throughout the measureless and countless numbers [of world spheres that lie] in the ten directions in regions that are devoid of a buddha and [they are born there] according to [the state of] their purity. In this way, it is entirely proper for there to be a multitude of buddhas in a great number of [separate] world spheres. However, it is not the case that two tathāgatas can take birth simultaneously in a single buddha field.

Why is that?
For a great length of time, bodhisattvas strongly cultivate the following aspirational prayer: “I so wish that I alone may become a leader [of beings] in a world that has no leader, [that I alone may become] one who [spiritually] tames sentient beings, who liberates them from every form of suffering, and who causes them to attain complete nirvana.” The correct pursuit of spiritual practice by one who has strongly cultivated such a prayer for a great length of time is sure to bring success. Furthermore, a single tathāgata is able to perform all the deeds of a buddha within a single buddha field that [encompasses] a great triple-thousand [world spheres]. Therefore, it would be meaningless for a second tathāgata to be born [there]. In addition, because of the arising of a single tathāgata in a [particular] world, the successful completion by sentient beings of their own aims occurs in much greater numbers and with much stronger devotion.

Why is that?
The following thoughts occur to [sentient beings]: “Throughout the entire world, there is only this one tathāgata; there is not a second [tathāgata]. If he were to travel to [a different] country or [if he were to] enter nirvana, there would be no second [tathāgata] whatsoever in whose presence we could practice the spiritual life or hear the Dharma.” Having made this realization, they make haste with a very firm aspiration and exertion to abide in the spiritual life and hear the true Dharma. However, if they were to encounter a multitude of buddhas, they would not make haste. Thus, through the arising of a single tathāgata, the successful accomplishment by them of their own aims occurs in greater numbers and with stronger devotion.
Regarding this [topic], all buddhas are the same in every respect and free of differences, except for these four things: life span, name, caste, and physical size. The distinction among buddhas is due to a variation in these four qualities and not to anything else whatsoever.
A woman cannot attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment.

Why is that?
[This should be understood] as follows: Once a bodhisattva has passed beyond the first [period of a] countless number of kalpas he abandons the state of being a woman, and [from then on] until he sits at the seat of enlightenment,[526] he will never again become a woman. The entirety of womankind naturally possesses a great many mental afflictions and is subject to inferior wisdom, and it is not possible for [a person with] a mind stream that naturally possesses a great many mental afflictions and is subject to inferior wisdom to attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment.
Thus, it should be understood that the essential nature of unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment has been described as it truly is. It should also be understood that the supremacy, the manner of recalling the special description of [a tathāgata’s] good qualities, the manner of [a tathāgata’s] appearance, and the differences [that exist among tathāgatas] have been described as they truly are. However, unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment is beyond thought, because it transcends all forms of speculative analysis. It cannot be fully grasped, because it possesses spiritual qualities that are immeasurably great. And it is truly unsurpassed in that it produces all the tathāgatas, listener [arhats], and solitary realizer [arhats]. Therefore, this form of enlightenment alone is the foremost, the best, the most eminent, and the most excellent.

How does a bodhisattva become one whose devotion is abundant?
Here a bodhisattva becomes endowed with a [sense of] certainty and eagerness that is preceded by the faith that is a clarity [of mind] toward the eight objects of devotion, about which he or she thinks: “I am capable of achieving (1) the virtuous qualities of the Three Jewels—that is, the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha; (2) the powers of a bodhisattva and a buddha that were [previously] described;[528] (3) [knowledge of] the nature of reality that was [previously] described; [knowledge of] the various kinds of (4) causes and (5) results, according to the manner in which they occur; and (6) the unerring aim that is worthy of being achieved.” Just as with the aim that is worthy of being achieved, [a bodhisattva regards] (7) the means of achieving [that aim] in the same way, such that he or she thinks: “There exists a means for attaining the aim that is worthy of being achieved.” Regarding this [point], the aim that is worthy of being achieved is unsurpassed enlightenment. For its part, the means of achieving [that aim] is all of the paths that make up the bodhisattva training. Just as with them, devotion [should also be developed] toward (8) that which was well expounded, well spoken, and well declared—that is to say, the Dharma teachings [contained in the twelve divisions, which are known as] discourses, songs, declarations, and the rest.[529]

In brief, a bodhisattva seeks the bodhisattva collection[531] [of scriptures] and also seeks the listener collection [of scriptures], the outer bodies of teachings,[532] and the categories of secular crafts and occupations.
Regarding these [areas of study], among the twelve divisions [of the Buddha’s teachings] that were mentioned, the one known as “extensive discourses” represents the bodhisattva collection. The remaining [eleven divisions] should be understood to make up the listener collection.

Regarding the categories of secular crafts and occupations, they are of numerous types and many diverse forms, including knowledge of the occupations of a goldsmith, ironsmith, jeweler, and the like.
All of these branches of learning are subsumed within the five branches of learning: (1) the inner science, (2) the science of logic, (3) the science of grammar, (4) the science of treating disease, and (5) the science of the categories of crafts and occupations. These five branches of learning are the ones that the bodhisattva seeks. In this way, he or she seeks all the branches of learning.

Regarding this [topic], Buddha’s speech is referred to as “the inner body of teachings.” In how many forms does [Buddha’s speech] occur? The same [question is asked with the other fields] up to: In how many forms do the branches of worldly crafts and occupations occur?
In brief, Buddha’s speech occurs in two forms: (1) the form that correctly sets forth causes and results and (2) the form that sets forth [the principles] that what has been done will not perish and that what has not been done will not yield any fruition.[533]
The body of teachings on logic also occurs in two forms: (1) the form that sets forth the advantages of responding to criticisms that are raised by others and (2) the form that sets forth the advantages of refuting views that are posited by others.
The body of teachings on grammar also [occurs] in two forms: (1) the form that sets forth how to derive and establish the nature of verbal roots and (2) the form that sets forth the advantages of correct formation [and usage] of words.
The body of teachings on the treatment of disease occurs in four forms: (1) the form that sets forth [how to gain] expertise regarding disease, (2) the form that sets forth [how to gain] expertise regarding all the sources of disease, (3) the form that sets forth [how to gain] expertise about [the methods of] curing diseases that have arisen, and (4) the form that sets forth [how to gain] expertise about preventing diseases that have been cured from arising [again] in the future.

Regarding this [topic], that entity upon which something is dependent and by which it is caused, and that entity in relation to which something is sought after and acquired are called its requisite cause. For example, the act of grasping is dependent on a hand and is caused by a hand; the acts of going out and coming back[536] are dependent on feet and are caused by feet; the acts of contracting and extending [the limbs] are dependent upon joints and caused by joints; and the pursuit and acquisition of food and drink are dependent upon hunger and thirst and are caused by hunger and thirst. It should be understood that there are an immeasurable number of similar instances of requisite causes that conform to this principle.[537]

Regarding this [topic], a seed is the propelling cause[538] of its own result, which represents the culmination [of its development]. All other conditions with the exception of the seed constitute supporting causes.[539] The seed is the originating cause[540] of its own [immediate] result. Further, the result that is [immediately] brought into being by the seed is the producing cause[541] of the subsequent results that were propelled by the seed. Fixed causes are the distinct forms of causality that relate to a variety of different classes of things. Requisite causes, propelling causes, supporting causes, originating causes, producing causes, and fixed causes, all taken together as one group, are called “cooperating causes.”[542] Causes that obstruct the arising of something are opposing causes. Those that lack any obstructive nature are compatible causes.

Regarding this [topic], briefly there are six kinds of opposition: (1) Opposition relating to speech is, for example, the contradictory statements that are found at different places throughout the treatises of certain brahmins and ascetics. (2) Opposition relating to reasoning is when [a form of] the application that relates to demonstrating correctness does not properly establish the existence of something in relation to a knowable object. (3) Opposition to arising is when, for example, the arising [of something] does not occur because of the absence of those causal factors that promote its arising and the presence of entities that obstruct its arising. (4) Opposition to simultaneous occurrence is [a condition that exists between] such pairs of things as light and darkness, desire and hatred, and pleasure and pain. (5) Opposition of adversaries is [a condition that exists between] species that are adversarial and hostile to one another, such as snakes and mongooses, and cats and mice. (6) Opposition between bad qualities and their antidotes is [a condition that exists between], for example, desire and meditation on unattractiveness;[543] malice[544] and meditation on loving-kindness; harmfulness[545] and compassion; and between meditation on the limbs of enlightenment[546] and the eightfold noble path on the one hand and all the root and secondary mental afflictions that operate in the three realms on the other. This [last] point is considered to represent [a specific type of] opposition to arising.

There are four conditions:[547] (1) causal conditions, (2) homogeneous immediate conditions, (3) objective conditions, and (4) governing conditions. Regarding this [topic], it should be understood that generative causes are forms of causal conditions, and instrumental causes are forms of governing conditions.
Homogeneous immediate conditions and objective conditions are limited to those entities that are minds and mental factors. That is, those minds and mental factors that are supported by [the minds and mental factors] that arose before them in the sense that [those entities] provide them with the opportunity [to arise] are the ones that come into being. Similarly, those minds and mental factors that are supported by a mental object are the ones that become active. Therefore, it should be understood that homogeneous immediate conditions and objective conditions are subsumed within [the category of] supporting causes.

The various kinds of crops that are considered forms of grain in the world and by which the world maintains its livelihood have the following variety of names, conceptions, and forms of verbal usage: barley, rice, wheat, sesame, urad beans,[548] mung beans,[549] horse gram beans,[550] etc. “Let the barley be fetched,” “Let it be reaped,”[551] “Let it be ground,” “Let it be stored,” etc., are expressions that provide examples of their causes of orderly discourse.

Whatever individual seeds are the ones from which various individual crops arise, those particular seeds are the propelling causes of those [very crops]. The conditions of earth, rain, etc. that [promote] the arising of sprouts are the supporting causes. The seeds are the originating causes of [their respective] sprouts. The continuous series of sprouts, stems, and leaves, in turn, are the producing causes of that crop’s growth and maturation. Barley seeds cause the arising of barley sprouts and, [ultimately, the arising of] a barley crop; they do not [cause the arising] of anything else. The same should be understood for all the remaining [kinds of crops]. This represents [the condition of being] a fixed cause. Beginning with the requisite cause and ending with the fixed cause, all these causes [that contribute to] the arising of a [particular] crop are the cooperating causes. This grain cannot reach maturity if any of these causes is absent. Therefore, the totality of all of them is called the “cooperating cause.” Obstacles such as the occurrence of hail and crop diseases are opposing causes. The absence of such obstacles is the compatible cause. These ten causes should also be understood to occur in relation to other mundane entities just as they do in this summary of [how] grain [is produced], according to the circumstances [of each situation].

Regarding [the series of limbs that make up] the orderly discourse that begins with “formations are conditioned by ignorance” and continues up to “old age and death are conditioned by birth,” the activities that occur in relation to the limbs of [a sentient being’s] existence and that are dependent on the experiencing of objects represent the requisite causes of the process of affliction.

Additionally, [the limbs beginning with] ignorance, etc., and ending with existence, which make up a series that functions in such a way that each succeeding member brings into being the next [limb], are the producing causes of [the limbs of] birth and old age and death that will occur in another lifetime. Certain of [these series of limbs that begin with] ignorance, etc., and end with existence, together with each of their individual seeds, function collectively to [bring about] rebirth in the hells. Others do so to [bring about] rebirth as an animal, a hungry ghost, a human being, or a god. This represents [the condition of being] fixed causes in relation to the process of affliction. The [collection of causes] beginning with the requisite causes and ending with the fixed causes are called the “cooperating causes.” Additionally, the opposing causes of the process of affliction are [the condition of] possessing a form of spiritual lineage, the appearance of the buddhas, the teaching of the true Dharma, [the activities of] associating with wise persons, listening to the true Dharma, proper attention [of the mind], [engaging in] a form of [spiritual] practice that conforms with Dharma, as well as all the entities that are conducive to enlightenment. The causes that do not oppose [the process of affliction] are a deficiency in or absence of those entities that were just mentioned. This is the manner in which these ten causes should be understood [as bringing about] the entire process of affliction for all sentient beings.

Regarding this [topic], the names, conceptions, and verbal expressions that relate to all the spiritual qualities that are conducive to purification, as well as the cessation [that occurs in the reversal of the twelve limbs of dependent origination] and nirvana, constitute the causes of orderly discourse that pertain to the process of purification. The kind of entities [that make up this form of the cause] of orderly discourse include [the thirty-seven qualities that are conducive to enlightenment—which begin with] the [four] closely placed recollections,[553] the [four] forms of correct abandonment,[554] and continue up to the eightfold noble path,[555] as well as [the elements that make up the reversal of the twelve limbs of dependent origination—which begins with] the cessation of conditioning entities that is brought about by the cessation of ignorance and continues up to the cessation of old age and death that is brought about by the cessation of birth.

Regarding this [topic], [the activities of] seeking purification, accomplishing purification, and completing purification, [all of which] are dependent upon [having become aware of] the disadvantages of the formations, represent the requisite causes of the process of purification.
The [condition of] possessing [a form of] spiritual lineage—[a quality] that relates to those persons who abide in [a state of having] a spiritual lineage and that is a precondition for the attainment of the [form of] nirvana in which the support [of the five heaps] remains and [the form of nirvana] in which the support [of the five heaps] does not remain—represents the propelling cause of the process of purification.
[The activities of] associating with wise persons, listening to the true Dharma, [engaging in] proper attention [of the mind], and the ripening of one’s faculties that was accomplished previously [all] constitute the supporting causes.
The seeds of those uncontaminated[556] entities that are conducive to enlightenment and that are included within [a person’s] spiritual lineage are the originating causes of those entities that are conducive to enlightenment.
Moreover, those very entities conducive to enlightenment that are generated by their respective seeds are the producing causes that gradually [bring about] the realms of the nirvana in which the support [of the five heaps] remains and [the nirvana] in which the support [of the five heaps] does not remain.

Having realized in this manner the form of the Buddha’s speech that correctly sets forth causes and results, and as a consequence of continually cultivating [the aspect of] his or her [spiritual] lineage that relates to the power of knowledge regarding proper conditions and improper conditions,[566] a bodhisattva gradually causes [the spiritual lineage of that power] to be refined and further developed.[567]

Moreover, those deeds that [an individual] did perform will not perish even after a hundred kalpas with regard to [their ability to] yield a result.

Regarding this [topic], how does a bodhisattva seek learning?[569]
A bodhisattva seeks the Dharma after he or she has engendered intense respect toward eloquent speech[570] and excellent sayings. Briefly, this is the kind of respect that should be developed toward eloquent speech: It is [a level of respect] in which this bodhisattva would be willing to enter a region consisting of blazing hot iron with utmost delight and respect in order to hear even a single eloquent statement, let alone a great many forms of eloquent speech, if he or she could find no other way of hearing eloquent speech.
Between the fondness and respect that a bodhisattva feels toward the improvement of his or her own physical being,[571] not to mention the entire collection of other objects [that are its means of support], such as food and drink, and the fondness and respect he or she feels toward hearing eloquent speech, having placed the former fondness and respect next to the latter fondness and respect, [the fondness and respect that is felt toward the former] does not reach a hundredth part or even a thousandth part [of that which is felt toward the latter], nor does it reach [any level of] calculation, portioning, reckoning, or factoring.
[A bodhisattva] who has generated such [a sense of] respect toward eloquent speech does not [ever] become weary while listening to eloquent speech, and he or she is insatiable [in the desire to continue hearing it]. He or she is filled with faith and develops an abundance of clarity [of mind].[572] He or she becomes one whose mental continuum possesses the moisture of tender feelings and one who is sincere in outlook. He or she approaches a Dharma teacher [motivated] by a desire for virtuous qualities and a desire for the Dharma, not with the intention of trying to find fault [with the teacher]; with respect, not with the stiffness of pride; seeking [to learn] what is virtuous, not with the aim of promoting him- or herself; and [that bodhisattva] does so thinking, “I shall apply myself and others to roots of virtue,” not motivated by [a desire for] gain or honor. Having approached [a Dharma teacher] in this manner, he or she remains unafflicted and undistracted while listening to Dharma.

How does [a bodhisattva] remain unafflicted while listening to Dharma?
He or she does so by becoming free of the affliction of arrogance, free of the affliction of contempt, and free of the affliction of diffidence.[573]
Regarding this [topic], there are six aspects by means of which [a bodhisattva] becomes free of the affliction of arrogance; four aspects by means of which he or she becomes free of the affliction of contempt; and one aspect by means of which he or she becomes free of the affliction of diffidence.
[A bodhisattva] listens [to Dharma] at an appropriate time,[574] acting respectfully, being attentive,[575] remaining free of discontent, aiming to put into practice [what is being heard], and without intending to find fault. By means of these six aspects, one becomes free of the affliction of arrogance.
Having generated respect toward the Dharma and generated respect toward the Dharma teacher, [a bodhisattva] avoids [developing any feeling of] disdain for the Dharma and avoids [developing any feeling of] disdain for a person who is a Dharma teacher. By means of these four aspects, one remains free of the affliction of contempt while listening [to Dharma].
[A bodhisattva] should listen without feeling disdain toward him- or herself. By means of this single aspect, one remains free of the affliction of diffidence while listening [to Dharma]. This is the manner in which a bodhisattva remains unafflicted while listening to Dharma.

This is the manner in which a bodhisattva should seek learning.

What are a bodhisattva’s motives for seeking learning?
A bodhisattva seeks [to learn] the Buddha’s speech in order to put it into practice in a manner that accords correctly with the Dharma and in order to [be able to] fully reveal it to others in an extensive manner.
A bodhisattva seeks [to learn] the science of logic in order to [gain] an accurate and complete knowledge of what is badly taught and badly described in that body of teachings, in order to refute the objections that are raised by others, as well as to instill faith toward this [Buddhist] teaching in those who lack it and to further increase the faith of those who have engendered it.
A bodhisattva seeks [to learn] the science of grammar in order to cause those who are devoted to well-composed speech to develop a firm sense of trust toward him or her by virtue of the presentation of well-derived words and syllables[576] and so that he or she might engage in the orderly discourse[577] that [provides] a variety of linguistic interpretations for a single meaning.
A bodhisattva seeks [to learn] the body of teachings on medicine in order to cure the many varieties of illness [that are contracted] by sentient beings and in order to promote the welfare of the greater populace.
A bodhisattva seeks [to learn] the categories of worldly crafts and occupations in order to [be able to] amass wealth so that he or she can benefit sentient beings with little difficulty, in order to generate in sentient beings [an attitude of] high regard [toward him- or herself],[578] and in order to benefit [sentient beings] and attract[579] them [to the Dharma] by providing them with knowledge of a craft.
A bodhisattva seeks all five of these branches of learning in order to perfect the great wisdom accumulation[580] [that leads to the attainment of] unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment. This is because [a bodhisattva] who fails to train in all [of the sciences] will not attain in an orderly manner the knowledge of an omniscient being that is free of [all] obstructions. This completes the presentation of what a bodhisattva seeks, as well as the manner in which it is to be sought and the motives for seeking it.

[A bodhisattva] teaches in two ways. He or she explains [using] suitable speech and speech that is pure.

Regarding this [topic], how does [a bodhisattva] explain [using] suitable speech?
He or she teaches those who are seated in a manner that conforms to the [proper] modes of physical behavior,[581] not [those who are seated] in an inappropriate manner. This should be understood to mean that one should not [teach] a person seated on a higher seat who is not ill, a person whose head is covered [and who is not ill], a person who is walking in front [of you and who is not ill], etc., as [explained] at length in the sutras.[582]

Why is that?
It is because the Dharma is an object that the buddhas and bodhisattvas venerate. [It is also] because when [it is observed that] the Dharma is being honored, others will develop a high degree of respect for the Dharma. Also, when the Dharma is being heard, others will generate reverence [for it] and they will not develop [an attitude of] disrespect.

[A bodhisattva] also teaches everything to everyone continuously, without being stingy with the Dharma and without exhibiting a preceptor’s tightfistedness toward Dharma teachings. He or she teaches words and syllables in a systematic manner. With the systematic teaching of words and syllables, he or she differentiates meanings in a systematic manner. He or she teaches both meaningful Dharma [teachings] and their import but not [subjects] that are empty of meaning.

[A bodhisattva] explains [instruction] to those who are suitable to receive explanations, prompts those who are suitable to be prompted to take up practices [that are appropriate for them], generates enthusiasm in those who are suitable to be encouraged, and pleases those for whom it is suitable to make them feel pleased. He or she teaches [using] speech that is endowed with [the qualities of] direct perception, inference, and trustworthy scripture, not [speech] that is unrelated to valid cognition.[583] [He or she teaches using speech] that promotes reaching the happy migratory states, is free of confusion, and easy to comprehend, not [speech] that is impenetrable. [He or she] also [teaches using speech] that has a connection with the four noble truths. In all assemblies, he or she teaches in whatever manner is appropriate and [using] whatever speech is appropriate to that [particular assembly]. In these fifteen ways, the speech that bodhisattvas use when teaching should be understood as suitable to all the important aims of sentient beings.

In addition, with regard to sentient beings who commit harm, a bodhisattva establishes [his or her] mind in a state of loving-kindness before speaking [to them]. With regard to sentient beings who engage in misconduct, he or she establishes a beneficial state of mind before speaking [to them]. With regard to beings who have experienced happiness or suffering and who [for that reason] are [in the former case] behaving heedlessly or [in the latter case] feeling dejected, [a bodhisattva] establishes a compassionate state of mind that wishes to benefit and bring happiness [to them] before speaking [to them]. He or she does not, under the influence of the perturbation of jealousy, extol him- or herself; nor does [a bodhisattva] discredit others. With a mind that is free from corporeal desire[584] and avoiding any yearning for gain, honor, or fame, he or she teaches Dharma to others. In these five ways, a bodhisattva explains [using] speech that is pure.

In brief, these [aspects of teaching] can be represented as having twenty forms: [A bodhisattva should teach] (1) at an appropriate time, (2) in a manner that treats [the Dharma] with respect, (3) following a [proper] order, (4) in a [logically] connected manner, (5) in a manner that combines [words and meanings well], (6) in a manner that causes gladness, (7) in a manner that causes eagerness, (8) in a manner that causes satisfaction, (9) in a manner that causes exertion, and (10) in a manner that avoids causing [others] to become discouraged. [He or she should teach a discourse that is] (11) correct,[585] (12) fitting,[586] (13) not jumbled, (14) conforms to the Dharma, and (15) is appropriate for the [particular] assembly. [He or she should teach] (16) with an amicable mind, (17) a mind [that seeks to] benefit, (18) a compassionate mind, (19) without consideration for gain, honor, or fame, and (20) without extolling oneself or discrediting others. This is the manner in which a bodhisattva should teach the Dharma to others.[587]

Regarding this [topic], what is correct reflection by a bodhisattva?
A bodhisattva here who has gone alone to an isolated place, who is desirous of reflecting, desirous of pondering, and desirous of examining those Dharma teachings that he or she has heard, initially rejects those subjects that are unsuitable to think about, and then sets about considering those [that are proper to consider]. He or she reflects upon them continuously, with a method of practice that is both constant and attentive, and without becoming lax. Some of the time, a bodhisattva who is engaged in reflection uses the applications[589] to examine [a topic] and penetrate[590] [its meaning]. Some of the time, he or she generates devotion [toward a topic]. [A bodhisattva] relies upon the meaning [of a teaching] as he or she reflects, and does not rely upon the letter.[591] He or she realizes “black” expressions[592] and “great” expressions as they truly are.[593] He or she also enters upon [the practice of] reflection with the initial means of engagement. Having become engaged [in the practice], he or she attains what is of [genuine] value by repeatedly applying [proper] attention.[594]

Rejecting what is unsuitable to think about, a bodhisattva does not develop confusion or distraction. Continuously engaged [with a form of application that is] both constant and attentive, one reflects in a way that comprehends meanings that were not previously understood and gains [a deeper realization] of those that were understood. One does not allow [the understanding of] those meanings that were gained to be lost nor allow [oneself] to become inattentive [with regard to them]. On the one hand, by using the applications at times to examine, investigate, and deliberate, [a bodhisattva] does not have to rely upon others.[595] On the other hand, regarding those subjects that are being examined carefully using the applications, while generating devotion at times toward those profound subjects that one’s mind fails to penetrate, [one] thinks to oneself, “These topics are within a tathāgata’s range of understanding; they are not within my mind’s range of understanding.” In so doing, [a bodhisattva] avoids repudiating those topics and, thus, keeps him- or herself undamaged, uninjured, and free of any objectionable act.[596] Relying upon the meaning and not the letter [of the teachings], a bodhisattva investigates all the enigmatic sayings[597] of the buddhas, the blessed ones. Because he or she possesses skill with regard to “black” expressions and “great” expressions, no one can in any way cause a bodhisattva to waver from or become unsteady about meanings that pertain to ultimate reality. Investigating that which is to be considered first, the bodhisattva obtains a forbearance that had not previously been obtained. Moreover, as he or she attains that forbearance and [also attains] a state of [genuine] value that has been well obtained, a bodhisattva undertakes to engage in meditation. By means of these eight aspects that relate to reflection, a bodhisattva becomes engaged in the form of practice that accords with Dharma that is contained within [the practice of] reflection.

What is delighting[604] in quiescence and insight?
It is the stability of the mind in relation to the signs [that are the basis for practicing] quiescence and insight, the condition in which [the mind] moves spontaneously [toward those signs] without [the need for any] application [of effort], [the ability to] maintain control [over the mind in relation to those signs], and [the ability to] keep [the mind] from moving away [from those signs]. This is what is called “delighting in quiescence and insight.”
Regarding this [topic], however strongly a bodhisattva cultivates quiescence and insight, [the state of] delighting in quiescence and insight will, to a corresponding degree, be accomplished. However much [a bodhisattva’s state of] delighting in quiescence and insight is accomplished, [his or her] quiescence and insight will, to a corresponding degree, become pure.[605] As a result, however much [a bodhisattva’s] quiescence becomes pure, [his or her] physical agility and mental agility will reach a state of being abundant, strong, and developed. And however much [a bodhisattva’s] insight becomes pure, [his or her] knowledge-vision will reach a state of being abundant, strong, and developed. This is the extent of what is to be accomplished by [the practice of] meditation—that is to say, the indisposition that is present in a [person’s] being[606] is what is to be removed and [a bodhisattva’s] knowledge-vision in relation to all knowable things is what is to be made pure. All of these actions of meditation are brought about by the four aspects of a bodhisattva’s meditation [practice].

What is instruction?[607]
Briefly, it should be understood as being eightfold in nature. Whether the situation is one in which a bodhisattva is desirous of giving instruction to others, either through relying upon one-pointed concentration or as a consequence of association [with those individuals], or alternatively it is a situation in which another bodhisattva or a tathāgata gives instruction to him or her, at the very outset, that [teacher who intends to give the instruction] examines and realizes [the nature of] the mind [of the person who is to be instructed]. Having examined [that person’s] mind, [the teacher] then examines and realizes [the nature of the student’s] faculties. Having examined [that person’s] faculties, [the teacher] then examines and realizes [the nature of the student’s] attitude. Having examined [that person’s] attitudes, [the teacher] examines and realizes [the nature of the student’s] latent propensities.[608] Having examined [that person’s] latent propensities, [the teacher] causes [him or her] to undertake [any of] a variety of means of practice, in whatever manner is suitable and in whatever manner is appropriate [to that person]. Having caused [that person] to undertake [any of] those means of practice that are suitable and appropriate [to him or her]—whether it be through [the practice of] unattractiveness, loving-kindness, dependent origination, the diversity of the elements, or recalling the inhalation and exhalation [of the breath]—[the bodhisattva] then teaches [that person] the Middle Way as the antidote to wrongly grasping at the eternalistic extreme. [The bodhisattva also] teaches [that person] the Middle Way as the antidote to wrongly grasping at the nihilistic extreme. [The teacher] causes [that person] to abandon the exaggerated pride [in which he or she mistakenly thinks] that [he or she] has accomplished something that has not been accomplished. [The teacher] causes [that person] to abandon the exaggerated pride [in which he or she mistakenly thinks] that [he or she] has attained [some result] that has not been attained, reached, or realized.
This eightfold form of instruction should be understood as being encompassed more briefly within three categories.

Regarding this [topic], it should be understood that the act of binding [a person’s mind] to a correct mental object in order to stabilize it is accomplished by means of the knowledge of [that person’s] mind, faculties, attitude, and latent propensities, and by causing [him or her] to undertake a means of practice in whatever way is appropriate.

It should be understood as being fivefold in its nature: (1) forbidding conduct that engages in what is objectionable; (2) approving of conduct that engages in what is free of objection; (3) admonishing[611] a person who has engaged in erroneous conduct that relates to actions that are forbidden and approved; (4) prompting those who continually develop disregard [for proper conduct] and behave erroneously to observe recollection, by censuring them with an attitude that is not impure and that is unaltered[612] and friendly; and (5) giving encouragement to those who are engaged in correct practice regarding those things that are forbidden and approved, by making an agreeable statement about their genuine good qualities. In brief, the five aspects of a bodhisattva’s counsel should be understood thus: forbiddance, approval, admonishing, censuring, and encouragement.

What does it mean for bodhisattvas’ deeds of body, speech, and mind to be supported by means?
Briefly, the bodhisattvas’ four principles for attracting [a following] are what is called “means.” As the Blessed One declared, the bodhisattva who possesses the means that are supported by the four principles for attracting a following is [worthy of being] called a bodhisattva.[613]

Why, then, are the four principles for attracting a following called “means”?
Briefly, the means that has as its purpose teaching discipline to sentient beings and attracting them [to the Dharma] is fourfold in nature; there is nothing of greater significance than these [four types of means] and nothing besides these [four types of means]. They are [a type of means] that benefits, [a second type] that brings about comprehension,[614] [a third type] that produces action, and [a fourth type] that has a conforming nature.

</d>
<d e="2">
Regarding this, generosity[615] is the type of means that benefits. For instance, those beings who are benefited by [receiving] various kinds of gifts having material value will think that they should listen to and act in accordance with the speech [of their benefactors].
Following that, by means of agreeable speech,[616] a bodhisattva causes those who are confused about different subjects to grasp what is correct [about those subjects] and to perceive [what is correct about those subjects] in order to completely remove whatever confusion they might have. This is how agreeable speech is the type of means that brings about comprehension.

Similarly, [a bodhisattva] induces those beings who have been caused to comprehend and perceive by means of correct [instruction] to turn away from opportunities [to engage in] nonvirtuous [actions] and to adopt, be led to, become settled into, and become established in opportunities [to engage in] virtuous [actions]. This is [a bodhisattva’s] beneficial conduct,[617] [which represents] a type of means that produces action.
Having caused beings to undertake action in this way, a bodhisattva also complies with [such a practice him- or herself], by [engaging in a form of] conduct that represents a similar lifestyle, such that the students will not be able to reproach him or her and cause him or her to feel regret[618] by saying: “You yourself have not yet become one who possesses faith, one who possesses morality, one who possesses generosity, one who possesses wisdom. Why are you urging others to take up this [form of practice]?” Therefore, sameness of purpose[619] should be understood as a bodhisattva’s fourth type of means, one that has a conforming nature.

It is the volition[620] of a bodhisattva who is indifferent[621] toward all material objects as well as [his or her] own body, and [a volition] that arises together with [an attitude that is] free of acquisitiveness. It is also the deeds of body and speech that are caused to arise by that [volition] for the purpose of giving up those objects that are suitable to be given, as well as the faultless giving up of all those objects that are suitable to be given. It should be understood that the essential nature of a bodhisattva’s generosity is the [act of] providing an entity to that individual by whom it is desired, and [this act is one that is carried out] by an individual who is abiding in the [bodhisattva system of moral] discipline, who sees what is to be gained [by practicing generosity], and who recognizes the results [of practicing generosity].[622]

Briefly, what is called “all-inclusive” refers to the two types of object that are suitable to be given: (1) an inner one and (2) an outer one. Regarding this, the giving up by a bodhisattva of [his or her] own body down to the marrow is called “the giving up of what is exclusively an inner object.” On the other hand, the food and drink that a bodhisattva continually eats and then vomits for the sake of those [beings] who sustain themselves by consuming vomit[623] is called a bodhisattva’s “giving of what is a mixture of an inner and an outer object.” The giving up of all remaining forms of objects that are suitable to be given, aside from the ones that were just mentioned, is called “the giving up of what are exclusively outer objects that are suitable to be given.”

Regarding this, briefly there are two ways in which a bodhisattva offers [his or her] own body to those individuals who are seeking a body. [One way is that] he or she offers him- or herself to others by placing [him- or herself] under their control and submitting to their will such that [he or she] will do as they wish. It is like an individual agreeing to become a servant for others in order to receive food and clothing. Similarly, with a mind that is free of corporeal desire, a bodhisattva who is desirous of [achieving] supreme enlightenment, who is desirous of [providing] benefit and happiness to others, and who is desirous of completing the perfection of generosity offers him- or herself to others by placing [him- or herself] under their control and submitting to their will such that [he or she] will do as they wish. [The second way is that] to those who request [the bodhisattva’s] hands, feet, eyes, head, limbs, or minor appendages, to those who seek [his or her] flesh, blood, or sinews, and to those who seek [his or her] marrow, [the bodhisattva] offers [all of these things,] up to his or her marrow.

There are two ways[624] in which a bodhisattva gives up outer objects to sentient beings. [One is that] he or she provides a borrowed object[625] so that it may be used however it might please [the petitioner]. [The second is that a bodhisattva] offers [an object] so that [the petitioner] might have dominion over it, and he or she does so with a mind that gives up [ownership of that object] fully and completely. Nevertheless, a bodhisattva does not give all inner and outer objects in every way to sentient beings without exception.

Moreover, if a bodhisattva has become one who possesses a pure attitude with regard to [the practice of] generosity, he or she should not offer his or her own body, limbs, or appendages when a great matter relating to sentient beings that ought to be done is near at hand, even though a person may have approached and asked for his or her body, limbs, or appendages.

Why is that?
The bodhisattva who possesses a pure attitude with regard to [the practice of] generosity would not experience any manner of apprehension whatsoever such that he or she might wonder, “Should this be given or should this not be given?” Therefore, while a bodhisattva should disregard the presence of matters relating to sentient beings and give[627] [his or her own body] in order to continue purifying his or her attitude, once his or her attitude has become purified, [a bodhisattva] does not [need to] disregard the presence of matters relating to sentient beings and give [his or her own body].
[A bodhisattva] also should not give his or her own body, in such a way that involves the separation of the limbs, to those gods who belong to Māra’s entourage who have approached him or her with an injurious aim and have asked for [his or her body]. [He or she should refuse to do so] in order to insure that an extremely great injury or loss does not befall those [gods].[628] Just as with the gods who belong to Māra’s entourage, the same should be understood with regard to beings who have been directed by those [gods].

Moreover, a bodhisattva should not give his or her own body, in such a way that involves the separation of the limbs, to those who are mad and have deranged minds, for they are neither in their right minds nor petitioners who are seeking [a genuine aim]. [Their requests] are nothing but idle chatter. Therefore, he or she does not give them [what they ask for] because they are not in control of their minds.

With the exception of these situations, a bodhisattva does give up his or her own body to those who ask for it in those situations that are the opposite of those [that were just described], either in the sense of submitting to the will of another or in a way that involves separation of the limbs and appendages. This is how it should be understood that a bodhisattva does and does not practice generosity in relation to inner objects.

On the other hand, with regard to outer objects, a bodhisattva does not offer poison, fire, weapons, or intoxicants to petitioners if they are [to be used] for the purpose of harming sentient beings, regardless of whether they have been asked for by petitioners in order to harm themselves or in order to harm others. However, a bodhisattva does give poison, fire, weapons, and intoxicants to petitioners if they are [to be used] for the purpose of benefiting sentient beings, whether they have been asked for by petitioners in order to benefit themselves or in order to benefit others.[629] In addition, a bodhisattva does not offer movable property[630] to others that belongs to someone else and arouses suspicion. A bodhisattva does not, as a form of procuring, seize someone’s wife and offer [her] to others. Nor does [a bodhisattva] offer food or drink that contains sentient beings who are alive.

Why is that?
Even though [giving] that object might cause those [recipients] to generate some measure of an approving attitude toward that bodhisattva, nevertheless his or her act of generosity might do very great harm [to other sentient beings], by reason of which [the recipients of that gift] would give rise to conceit, lack of mindfulness, and misdeeds, and, following the dissolution of their bodies, they would be reborn in the lower realms. On the other hand, if it were granted that this object of pleasure, amusement, etc., would not cause [the recipients] to go to the lower realms nor cause [them] to accumulate roots of nonvirtue, then a bodhisattva should offer such an object of pleasure, amusement, etc., to petitioners in order to cause [them to generate] an approving attitude [toward him or her], and so that, by means of that object, [those individuals] might also be drawn [to the Dharma] and caused to undergo spiritual ripening.

What sort of object, then, [that is a source of] pleasure and amusement does a bodhisattva not give to petitioners? What sort does he or she give?
For example, a bodhisattva does not provide training in the [methods of] killing wild animals. He or she does not perform either those base forms of sacrifice or those great slaughters at which many living beings are gathered together and deprived of their lives, nor does he or she cause them to be carried out by others. He or she also does not offer the killing of sacrificial animals in temples. If asked to donate geographical areas that are relied upon as a refuge by great numbers of living beings and which are inhabited by beings who are born in water or beings who are born on dry land, so that those living beings might be harmed, he or she does not offer [those areas]. If asked to provide nets, traps, or instruction [in the making of] nets and traps for the purpose of harming living beings, he or she does not provide them. He or she also does not present [his or her own] enemies to [someone who is their] enemy so that they might be reviled, killed, detained, punished, or tortured. In short, a bodhisattva does not give to petitioners any object at all that is a source of pleasure and amusement for sentient beings if its purpose is to inflict pain upon other beings or to injure other beings.

However, a bodhisattva does not offer an immoderate amount of food or drink or [food or drink] that is unsuitable to a sick person even if he or she should ask for it. [A bodhisattva] does not offer excellent food and drink to sentient beings of a greedy nature who have already been satisfied. [A bodhisattva] does not give what is desired to those beings who are overcome by grief so that they might hang themselves, beat themselves, ingest poison, or throw themselves over a precipice.

A bodhisattva absolutely never offers his mother or father to petitioners, for a bodhisattva’s mother and father represent his or her highest object of veneration. They are the ones who suckled, nourished, and raised [him or her]. A bodhisattva should not tire of carrying them on his or her head[631] for a long time. He or she should also give him- or herself to them as one who is under their control and one who is to be used by them, [as if] he were an object that is being pledged, bartered, deposited [as collateral, etc.], or sold. How could a bodhisattva even consider giving them to others, much less actually do so?
A bodhisattva king and lord who has been anointed does not, within his own domain of sentient beings together with their households, remove the child or wife that belongs to one person from the presence of that individual and offer [either of them] to someone else. Nor does he offer to someone from another [domain] an entire village or part of a village, or an [entire] town or part of a town, as his or her property, thinking, “As [this property] belonged to me, so [now] it belongs to you.”

Even if they have been properly informed, if it pleases them, and if they are desirous [of being given to someone else], [a bodhisattva] does not turn them over to hostile persons, powerful spirits[633] or malignant demons,[634] or those who are violent.[635] Nor does he or she commit into servitude a child or spouse who is of a delicate nature or who is from a distinguished family.

For example, a person who gives food will become one who is strong, a person who gives clothing will become one who possesses an [excellent] physical appearance, a person who gives vehicles will become one who enjoys physical comfort, and a person who gives lamps will become one who possesses [excellent] eyesight.

A bodhisattva does not give a gift that is unsuitable for the petitioners, such as leftover food and drink to religious ascetics, or [food and drink] that contains excrement, urine, phlegm, mucus, vomit, purging, pus, or blood, or [food and drink] that has become spoiled but was not declared and made known [to be spoiled], or porridge and gruel that ought to be discarded. Similarly, [an unfit gift is the giving of food] that contains onions or has onions mixed in with it to those who do not eat onions. It is also [the giving of food that contains meat or has meat mixed in with it] to those who do not eat meat and the giving of drink that contains alcohol or has alcohol mixed in it to those who do not drink intoxicating beverages. Likewise, a bodhisattva does not engage in any inappropriate action when giving a gift to others. Nor does he or she give any gift that is similar to these in that it is unsuitable [in some way].

A bodhisattva does not give a gift to a petitioner only after [the latter] has become exhausted by having had to make repeated requests, by having had to go away and return again [repeatedly], and by having had to render service [for an extended period of time]. Without exception, [he or she gives a gift] as soon as the request is made.
A bodhisattva does not give a gift that is based on [a desire for] renown, fame, and reputation. He or she does not give [a gift] that is based on [a desire to] receive something in return from another person, nor one that is based on [a desire to attain] the power of Śakra or Māra, or a wheel ruler.
He or she does not give a gift to others in order to [engage in] hypocrisy,[642] by thinking, “I hope that [by this act of generosity] others—[such as] members of the royal family, the king’s ministers, [leading] townspersons and countrymen, brahmins, village heads, persons of wealth, leaders of guilds, or merchants—will recognize me as one who is generous and a benefactor, [so that] in the future they will honor, venerate, respect, and revere me.”

A bodhisattva is skillful, diligent, and poised for action.

Without displaying any laziness him- or herself, he or she directs others to make gifts.

A bodhisattva who possesses abundant, extensive, and vast wealth does not give a meager gift. He or she does not give a gift to others in order to cause injury to someone else, nor does he or she give a gift to verbally abuse, anger, beat, threaten, reproach, kill, bind, amputate, confine, or exile someone.
Before making a gift, a bodhisattva is in a happy state of mind. During the act of giving, he or she remains glad. After having completed the act of giving, he or she does not feel remorse.
He or she does not, [motivated] by deceit, give a gift of fake jewels, pearls, lapis lazuli, conch shell, crystal, or coral, etc., to persons who desire [a genuine form of any of] those [precious objects].
There is no object to be given whatsoever, small or great, that a bodhisattva has not previously given mentally to all sentient beings and that later, [when] a petitioner requests it from the bodhisattva, [he or she does not consider] as [the petitioner’s] own wealth that had been borrowed [by the bodhisattva] and [is now being] returned.

He or she does not frown. He or she exhibits a radiant countenance, greets with a smile, and initiates polite conversation.

He or she personally takes hold of the objects that are granted to them.

A bodhisattva also does not practice unwise generosity. When giving, he or she only practices wise generosity.
What is a bodhisattva’s wise generosity?
Here a bodhisattva who possesses and has obtained objects that are fit to be given forms [his or her] mind in the following manner, before a petitioner has come forward: “Suppose two petitioners were to approach me, one of whom is comfortable, not miserable, not wretched, has a protector, and has someone to rely upon, while the other is distressed, miserable, wretched, does not have a protector, and does not have someone to rely upon. In that situation, if I should have the wealth to satisfy and fulfill the desires of both, then I should satisfy both; I should fulfill the desires of both. But if I should not have sufficient wealth to satisfy and fulfill the desires of both, then I should turn away the one who is comfortable and make a gift to the one who is distressed. I should turn away the one who is not miserable, not wretched, has a protector, and has someone to rely upon, and make a gift to the one who is miserable, wretched, does not have a protector, and does not have someone to rely upon.” Having formed his or her mind in this way, [a bodhisattva] should carry out [this intention] with [his or her] actions, just as it was formed [in the mind]. If [a bodhisattva] is unable to fulfill the wish of the petitioner who is comfortable, after having made that earlier mental determination, he or she should send away that petitioner after assuaging him or her in the following manner: “That donation was committed earlier and promised earlier by me to that person who is in distress. I have [already] presented it to him or her. It is not my desire to deny giving you [a gift]. Therefore, good person,[644] I hope you don’t feel any antipathy toward me.”

Moreover, a bodhisattva who possesses and has obtained objects that are fit to be given should approach households that are marked by stinginess, that are marked by extreme stinginess, that cling to their possessions, that are avaricious,[645] that have never practiced charity toward ascetics and brahmins and, after having made a friendly greeting and established an air of goodwill, he or she should say the following: “Please, friends, do me a great favor that will not cause you any loss of wealth. In my home, there is an abundance of property and an abundance of objects that are suitable for practicing charity. I am one who seeks petitioners in order to complete the perfection of generosity. If you should encounter any petitioners, please do not abandon them by turning them away. Either take from my wealth and objects for charity and deliver it to them as you wish, or bring those petitioners to me and rejoice at the generosity that I practice.”

After hearing this from [the bodhisattva] and being pleased by the fact that their own wealth will not be depleted, those [householders] do as he or she asks, thinking to themselves, “This son or daughter of good family will come to have a favorable attitude toward us.” In this way, the bodhisattva plants a seed for them to dispel the impurity of stinginess in the future. Eventually, through engaging in this practice and this form of skillful means that is accompanied by wisdom, [these householders] will also offer small amounts of their own wealth to others. After having relied upon a weak form of avoidance of desire,[646] they will attain one that is middling; after having relied upon a middling form, they will attain one that is great.

Moreover, in a situation where a bodhisattva’s teachers, preceptors, the students that he or she lives with, or his or her fellow spiritual practitioners are individuals with a nature that is marked by desire, or they are individuals who are prone to attachment, or, though not prone to attachment, they are individuals who have lost the desire [to practice charity] because they lack objects that are suitable for giving, that bodhisattva, being someone who desires to perform substantial forms of meritorious action[647] that derive from generosity and are related either to the Buddha, the Dharma, or the Sangha, gives objects that are suitable for giving to those individuals and does not perform [such acts of generosity] him- or herself but rather causes those individuals to perform them. In this manner, the bodhisattva produces a great quantity of merit for him- or herself, he or she causes some of [his or her] fellow spiritual practitioners to bring their mental affliction under control and others to perfect their desire for Dharma practice, and he or she also both causes sentient beings to be drawn [to the Dharma] and causes sentient beings to attain spiritual ripening.

Moreover, a bodhisattva who possesses and has obtained objects that are fit to be given, having understood [someone to be] a petitioner merely by [recognizing] a sign of his or her intention, presents [that person] with objects that are suitable to be given, according to his or her wishes.
If someone approaches that [bodhisattva] thinking, “I shall cheat him or her with this fraudulent transaction, and [the bodhisattva] realizes this person’s intention, he or she conceals that misdeed even from others, let alone from that very individual. [The bodhisattva] also causes the desire of that individual to be fulfilled, in such a way that he or she departs without being embarrassed and feeling highly pleased, confident, and happy, and also in such a way that the bodhisattva [allows him- or herself] to be cheated by that fraudulent act. The [cheater’s] deception is not exposed before it occurs nor does [the bodhisattva] expose it afterward. Nor does [the bodhisattva], because of this incident, reproach the cheater or cause him or her to feel regret. [The bodhisattva] acquiesces fully and with a sincere mind to that dishonest act, which constitutes a form of taking what was not given. This and other examples like it should be understood as wise forms of generosity [that are performed] by a bodhisattva who possesses and has obtained objects that are fit to be given.

Moreover, a bodhisattva who does not possess and has not obtained objects that are fit to be given but who is skilled in a variety of crafts and occupations takes up one of those crafts or occupations in such a way that, having acquired a great amount of wealth with little difficulty, he or she is able to maintain [him- or herself]. Alternatively, using various forms of discourse, pleasant forms of discourse, and agreeable forms of eloquence, he or she teaches Dharma to others in such a way that even impoverished sentient beings develop a desire to practice generosity, much less those who are wealthy; even stingy persons do so as well, much less those of a charitable disposition. Alternatively, he or she directs those petitioners who appear continuously to the households of individuals who are faithful and where, due to the extensive wealth [of those families], charitable acts are carried out on a daily basis. Having gone to those places where acts of generosity are being practiced and merit is being generated, he or she is skillful, dispels any laziness, and is ready to act. Having gladdened the mind, he or she goes to work physically and verbally, as much as he or she is able and with all his or her strength, and makes sure that the gifts to those petitioners are well presented. In such a manner, the act of generosity is not badly presented due to an absence of attendants, acts of favoritism, the occurrence of improper conduct, or the failure to remain attentive. This is the manner in which a bodhisattva who does not possess and has not obtained wealth becomes a practitioner of wise generosity, for as long as he or she has not attained purity of mental disposition. However, a bodhisattva whose attitude has become pure attains inexhaustible wealth in rebirth after rebirth, just as he or she transcends having to be born in the lower realms.

Moreover, a bodhisattva does not give the Dharma to a heretic who is looking for flaws [in the Buddhist doctrine], either through verbal instruction or in the form of a book. Nor does he or she give a book to a person of an acquisitive nature who desires to sell it or desires [merely] to collect it, but does not seek it for knowledge. On the other hand, if the individual is seeking knowledge and [the bodhisattva] no longer has any need of the book, then he or she may give it to [this person] as he or she sees fit. If [the bodhisattva] has not yet completed the purpose for which the book was acquired, then, after locating another copy or causing one to be copied, he or she should give that one [to the petitioner].

If [the bodhisattva] is unable to locate a copy or have one copied, he or she should first examine his or her [own] mind to determine the following: “I hope that my mind has not been overcome by the impurity of stinginess concerning the Dharma. I hope that I do not have a deeply held desire not to give a written form of the Dharma.” If upon making such an examination, he or she realizes, “I have engaged in the impurity of stinginess concerning the Dharma to some extent,” then that gift of Dharma should be made, after having formulated his or her mind in the following manner: “Even if this gift of Dharma should cause me to be ignorant in this life, I shall make this gift of Dharma in a manner that refuses to embrace a mental affliction, let alone if it causes me to be deficient in the wisdom accumulation.”

On the other hand, if upon making such an examination, he or she realizes, “I have not engaged in the impurity of stinginess concerning the Dharma to the slightest extent,” then the bodhisattva should clearly recognize the following: “I ought to make a gift of Dharma either to overcome my own mental afflictions, or to perfect the accumulation of wisdom, or out of affection for sentient beings. I do not see that I have any mental affliction [relating to this act]. Further, I do see that, by not making this gift, [I can attain] an extensive accumulation of wisdom both in this life and in future ones. [However,] by making such a gift, this will not occur and a meager amount [of the wisdom accumulation] in future lives [will have to suffice] for the purpose of obtaining an abundance of Dharma.[648] Moreover, if I do not make this gift, I can accumulate wisdom for the happiness and benefit of all sentient beings and I can also show kindness to this one individual and to all other sentient beings as well. But if I make this gift, I can only show kindness to this single individual.” If the bodhisattva refuses to give [the book] after having correctly gained this understanding, he or she remains free of any objectionable act, free of remorse, and does not violate [any portion of] the bodhisattva conduct.

How does [a bodhisattva] refuse to make a gift?
Now then, a bodhisattva is incapable of rejecting a petitioner by saying in a harsh manner, “I shall not give you a gift.” Rather, using skillful means, he or she should assuage [the petitioner] before sending him or her away.
Regarding this [point], the following represents skillful means. A bodhisattva has from the outset dedicated and entrusted, with a pure attitude, all his or her possessions and objects suitable for practicing charity to the buddhas and bodhisattvas throughout the ten directions, in the same way that a fully ordained monastic dedicates his or her robes to a teacher or preceptor. Because of [having made] this dedication, even though [such an individual] may have obtained an extensive and varied quantity of possessions and objects that are suitable for practicing charity, he or she is referred to as “a bodhisattva who abides in the ārya lineage.”[649] He or she becomes one who brings forth an immeasurable amount of merit. Moreover, this merit that is always being brought to mind in a comprehensive manner increases more and more by virtue of its being present at all times.

He or she keeps those objects that are suitable for practicing charity as if they had been entrusted to him or her by the buddhas and bodhisattvas. If [a bodhisattva] sees a petitioner and also sees that the granting of a charitable gift in the manner [that the petitioner] desires is suitable for this [individual], he or she then fulfills the desire of the petitioner, after reflecting, “There is nothing whatsoever that the buddhas and bodhisattvas would not give to sentient beings.”
If [a bodhisattva] perceives that [some gift] would be unsuitable, then, relying on that very determination,[650] he or she sends away that [petitioner] after having assuaged him or her by declaring in a gentle voice, “Good person, that [object] belongs to another. I am not authorized to give it [to you].” Alternatively, [a bodhisattva] gives [the petitioner] a different object that is two or three times greater in value than the one asked for, and then, after showing him or her respect and honor by making that gift, sends [the petitioner] away in such a way that [the petitioner] realizes, “This bodhisattva was not unwilling to give [me the gift that I wanted] due to his being of an avaricious nature. Rather, the reason that he did not make a gift was certainly because he did not have the authority to do so with regard to this gift of the Dharma in the form of a book.” This [example] should also be understood as a bodhisattva’s wise form of generosity in relation to a gift of the Dharma.

Moreover, in practicing all forms of generosity—that is, the giving of Dharma, material objects, and protection[651]—a bodhisattva makes him- or herself aware that he or she is doing so in a correct manner, as relates to verbal formulations, [defining] characteristics, clear expression, as well as causes, results, and types [of generosity].[652] This should also be understood as a bodhisattva’s wise form of generosity.

Moreover, a bodhisattva maintains an attitude of loving-kindness when practicing generosity toward beings who engage in harmful activities; he or she maintains a compassionate attitude [when practicing generosity] toward beings who are experiencing suffering; he or she maintains a joyful attitude [when practicing generosity] toward beings who possess virtuous qualities; he or she maintains an attitude of equanimity [when practicing generosity] toward benefactors, friends, and close associates. This too should be understood as a bodhisattva’s wise form of generosity.

Moreover, a bodhisattva correctly understands both the conditions that obstruct generosity and the antidotes to the conditions that obstruct generosity. Regarding this [point], the four conditions that obstruct generosity are (1) not having practiced it in the past, (2) the deficiency of having a limited number of objects suitable for giving, (3) greed for attractive objects of the best quality, and (4) the desire and [high] regard for the result of excellent wealth in the future.
[A bodhisattva] should, by means of wisdom, very quickly make the following observation: “The reason that a bodhisattva’s mind does not move toward generosity even though he or she has objects that are suitable for giving and a petitioner is present is that he or she has not cultivated this practice. This is a fault of which I am guilty.” He or she should also make the following observation: “It is certain that I did not practice generosity in the past regularly and this is why, even though I currently have objects that are suitable for giving and a petitioner has approached in a proper manner, my mind does not move toward generosity. If, after having made this analysis I should fail to make a gift at this time, then in the future I shall continue to be ill-disposed to [the practice of] generosity.” Having made these observations, relied on the antidote to this obstruction to generosity, and completed this analysis, [a bodhisattva] makes a gift. He or she does not continue to adhere to the fault of failing to cultivate the practice and does not remain subject to this [fault].

Moreover, [a bodhisattva] should, by means of wisdom, very quickly make the observation that, if a bodhisattva’s mind does not move toward generosity when a petitioner has correctly approached, due to having a limited amount of wealth, this [condition] is a consequence of adversity[653] and a cause that obstructs the practice of generosity. Having accepted and analyzed this suffering that is a consequence of adversity, [a bodhisattva,] motivated by compassion, makes a gift and reflects in the following manner: “Either because of [my] former karmic offenses or because of having been subject to the control of others, I have experienced many great forms of suffering, such as hunger, thirst, and the like, in [samsaric] existence, [yet these have occurred] without my having provided any benefit to others. Even if this generosity were to cause me suffering in this life that leads to my death, it would still be better for me to make a gift rather than turn away this petitioner. This is especially true since an individual can survive by [consuming] leafy vegetables.” Accepting in this way the suffering that is a consequence of adversity, a bodhisattva makes a gift.

Moreover, [a bodhisattva] should, by means of wisdom, very quickly make the observation that, if a bodhisattva’s mind does not move toward generosity when a petitioner has correctly approached, because of the great attractiveness and excellence of the object to be given, this represents for that bodhisattva a fault that is a consequence of greed. He or she should reflect, “This erroneous conception in which I regard what is suffering as a state of well-being[654] is one that will produce suffering for me in the future.” Through realizing that it is an error, [a bodhisattva] abandons [this fault that is a consequence of greed]. Then, after having completed this analysis, he or she gives the object.

Moreover, [a bodhisattva] should, by means of wisdom, very quickly make the observation that if a bodhisattva, after having made a gift, develops the view that the benefit of generosity is the result of [obtaining] great wealth and not [the view] that it is [the result of attaining] unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment, this represents for that bodhisattva a fault that derives from a view that values the wrong result. Then he or she should correctly regard all conditioned entities as having no real value. Regarding all conditioned entities as perishing with each moment and the enjoyments that are their results as both perishable through being lost and perishable through our having to be separated from them,[655] [a bodhisattva] abandons the view that values [the wrong] result and then dedicates everything that he or she may give to great enlightenment.
These [instructions] should be understood as [explanations of] the four types of knowledge that constitute the antidote for the four types of obstacle that obstruct a bodhisattva’s practice of generosity. They represent a penetrating observation, an acceptance of suffering, a realization of an erroneous belief, and the perception that conditioned entities have no real value. Regarding this [topic], on the basis of the first three of these corrective forms of knowledge, a bodhisattva practices generosity correctly and with conviction. On the basis of the last form of corrective knowledge, he or she develops a correct understanding of the result of merit. These, too, should be understood as [explanations of] a bodhisattva’s wise form of generosity.

In sum, these [explanations] should be understood as [descriptions of] the unique forms of a bodhisattva’s wise generosity (1) that relate to the giving of material objects [as performed] both by those who possess objects suitable for giving and those who do not possess them, as well as [the forms] (2) that relate to the giving of Dharma, (3) that relate to informative knowledge, (4) that relate to the [appropriate type of] superior attitude [that should be employed when practicing] generosity, (5) that relate to the knowledge that corrects obstructions to generosity, and (6) that relate to the generosity [that is cultivated by means] of a superior attitude together with visualizations.

Regarding this [topic], what is the form of generosity that is difficult for a bodhisattva to carry out?
The first form of generosity that is difficult for a bodhisattva to carry out is that in which one must inflict hardship upon oneself because of possessing only a limited quantity of objects to give and yet one accepts this suffering as one makes an offering to others. The second form of generosity that is difficult for a bodhisattva to carry out is that in which one must overcome one’s attachment to a most excellent and choice object that is suitable for giving—an object that is cherished either because of a natural fondness for it, because of a long-term familiarity with it, or because of its great usefulness—as one makes an offering to others. The third form of generosity that is difficult for a bodhisattva to carry out is that in which one must make an offering to others of objects suitable for giving that were acquired with difficulty.

What is the generosity of a bodhisattva that is directed everywhere?
It is that [form of generosity] in which a bodhisattva gives his or her own objects that are suitable for giving, or those that have been acquired from others, to his or her dependents—[including] mother, father, children, spouse, male and female servants, workmen, hired persons, friends, advisers,[657] near relations, and kinsmen—or that [form of generosity] in which [he or she gives either of these two types of objects] to other petitioners. This is known as “the generosity that is directed everywhere.” In short, it is a bodhisattva’s [generosity] that has four aspects.[658]

What is a bodhisattva’s generosity that brings happiness here and in the next world?
In brief, it should be understood that the generosity that brings happiness to sentient beings here and in the next world consists of giving material things,[670] giving the Dharma, and giving protection. Moreover, with the giving of material things [a bodhisattva] dispels the impurity of stinginess and the impurity of hoarding, and gives [a material object] that is excellent, clean, and proper. Regarding this, it should be understood that the impurity of stinginess is dispelled through renouncing [the attitude of] grasping tightly with the mind, and the impurity of hoarding is dispelled through renouncing [the attitude of] grasping tightly to possessions. Giving protection should be understood as that which is accomplished by providing protection from the fear caused by lions, tigers, predatory marine animals,[671] the king, robbers, water, and the like. Giving the Dharma consists of teaching the Dharma unerringly, giving proper instruction,[672] and causing [others] to take up the precepts of spiritual training. All of these nine forms[673] combined together constitute a bodhisattva’s generosity that brings happiness to sentient beings here and in the next world. Regarding that, the varieties [of giving] that constitute giving material things and protection bring happiness here, and the varieties [of giving] that constitute giving the Dharma bring happiness in the next world.

<d e="2">
Regarding these, what is generosity that is not delayed?
When a petitioner has appeared, a bodhisattva here makes a gift to him or her quickly and without procrastinating. The petitioner should not feel the [same degree of] urgency about receiving [a gift] that a bodhisattva does in giving it.

What is generosity that is not wrongly considered to be supreme?
A bodhisattva should not consider any of the following views about generosity to be correct: “This act of generosity will not yield a result.” “A gift that causes harm constitutes [true] Dharma.”[674] “Well-completed generosity by itself will bring about mundane and transcendent purity.”

What is generosity that does not [consist of] giving things that have been stored up?
A bodhisattva does not, after repeatedly collecting things over a long period of time, create a store of objects that are suitable for giving and then later make a gift of them all at once.

<f>
<d e="1">

</d>
<d e="2">
Why is that?
A bodhisattva who possesses objects that are suitable for giving is incapable of turning away a petitioner who has appeared in a proper manner. One does not even consider that it would be proper to turn someone away, much less that one should create a store [of objects suitable for giving].
A bodhisattva also does not regard practicing generosity with things that have been stored up to be a greater source of merit, because this is how he or she sees things: “If the quantity of objects that are given is the same and the number of petitioners is identical whether they come separately or in a group, why would someone acquire a different quantity of merit if he or she made gifts to them gradually or all at once?”
A bodhisattva also regards practicing generosity with things that have been stored up to be morally objectionable and practicing generosity with objects of value [by giving them] as they are obtained to be free of any objection.

</d>
<d e="2">
Why is that?
It is because when the donor who practices generosity with things that have been stored up is asked by petitioners [to make a donation], by initially turning away a hundred petitioners he or she causes them to develop animosity, intolerance, and distrust. Then later, even though not having been asked [to make a donation], he or she makes a gift to some portion of them with things that have been stored up. Therefore, a bodhisattva does not practice generosity with things that have been stored up.

</d>
<d e="2">
What is generosity that is free of haughtiness?
A bodhisattva makes a gift to a petitioner with a humble mind. He or she does not make a gift out of a sense of rivalry toward others. After having made a gift, he or she also does not, because of that gift, conceitedly think, “I am a donor and great patron; no one else is my equal.”

</d>
<d e="2">
What is generosity that is disinterested?[675]
A bodhisattva does not make a gift that is based upon [a desire for] fame, praise, acclaim, or renown. He or she considers fame to be derived from words [generated by] the imagination, bound to nothing more than sound, and as insignificant as dried-up leaves.

Before making a gift, a bodhisattva here is happy. During the act of giving, he or she remains glad. After having made a gift, he or she does not feel any remorse. Upon hearing of [other] bodhisattvas’ extensive and extremely liberal acts of generosity, he or she does not become timid or disparage him- or herself.

<d e="2">

When giving a gift, a bodhisattva is even-minded, impartial, and feels the same compassion toward friends, foes, and neutral persons.

<d e="2">
What is generosity that doesn’t seek anything in return?
A bodhisattva maintains a compassionate mind and a sympathetic mind when making a gift and does not expect to receive anything back from someone else. He or she perceives that [all] humankind desires happiness, is tormented by the fever of craving, is powerless, and is in a natural state of suffering.

</d>
<d e="2">
What is generosity that doesn’t seek a [karmic] maturation?
A bodhisattva who makes a gift does not expect that in the future [that] gift will ripen into the fruit of excellent wealth or an excellent physical form. He or she views all conditioned entities as worthless[676] and supreme enlightenment as what is [truly] beneficial.
It is by means of these ten aspects that the generosity of bodhisattvas becomes pure.
By relying upon the generosity [that was described] in this way as consisting of these nine aspects and after completing the perfection of generosity, bodhisattvas attain unsurpassed and true enlightenment.

Regarding this [point], through accepting the morality from another person, a bodhisattva develops abashment[677] in relation to others if he or she violates [any precepts of] the training. Through having an extremely pure attitude toward the moral precepts, a bodhisattva develops shame[678] in relation to self if he or she violates [any precepts of] the training. A bodhisattva remains free of regret through these two causes: (1) remedying any transgressions of the training’s precepts and (2) developing from the very outset a respect for remaining free of any transgressions. In this way, by relying on acceptance [of the morality] and doing so with a pure attitude, a bodhisattva generates shame and abashment. Through shame and abashment, he or she protects the morality that has been accepted. By protecting it, he or she is free of regret.

Regarding this, the two qualities of accepting [the morality] from another and having a pure attitude [toward the morality] represent the factors that bring forth the two qualities of remedying transgressions and having respect for remaining free of transgressions. Regarding them, the three qualities of (1) accepting [the morality] from another person, (2) having an extremely pure attitude, and (3) taking care to remain free of transgressions should be understood as the ones that prevent a bodhisattva’s morality from being ruined. For its part, [the quality of] remedying transgressions should be understood as the countermeasure that restores [a bodhisattva’s morality] when it has become marred.

Moreover, the essential morality of bodhisattvas that possesses four qualities should be understood as being good[679] in that it is accepted and cultivated to benefit oneself, to benefit others, to benefit a great number of beings, to provide happiness to a great number of beings, with compassion toward the world, and for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of gods and humans.[680] It should be understood as being immeasurable because it encompasses immeasurable forms of training for a bodhisattva. It should be understood as providing aid to sentient beings, because of its quality of attending to the benefit and happiness of all beings. It should be understood as having a great result and a great benefit because it obtains and bestows the result of unsurpassed true enlightenment.[681]

What is a bodhisattva’s all-inclusive morality?
In brief, the morality of a bodhisattva that pertains to the faction[682] that is made up of householders and [the morality of a bodhisattva] that pertains to the faction that is made up of those who have gone forth [into the homeless state] is called “all-inclusive morality.”
Moreover, the morality that is observed by the faction that is made up of householders and [the morality] that is observed by the faction that is made up of those who have gone forth [into the homeless state] consists in brief of three types: (1) the morality of restraint, (2) the morality of acquiring virtuous entities, and (3) the morality that acts on behalf of beings.

Regarding this, the morality of restraint is the acceptance of the discipline of individual liberation,[683] which is made up of seven categories: (1) the morality of a fully ordained monk, (2) the morality of a fully ordained nun, (3) the morality of a probationary nun, (4) the morality of a novice monk, (5) the morality of a novice nun, (6) the morality of a layman, and (7) the morality of a laywoman. These should be understood, in the appropriate manner, as relating either to the faction of beings who are householders or to the faction of beings who have gone forth.

Similarly, [a bodhisattva,] regularly and at appropriate times, makes respectful verbal salutations, makes obeisance, stands up [as a gesture of deference], and greets with joined palms those who are worthy of being venerated. Likewise, one respectfully waits on those very same persons worthy of veneration. One cares for those who are sick and attends to their illnesses with compassion. Likewise, one expresses approval when an eloquent speech is made. One voices genuine praise of persons who possess virtuous qualities. Likewise, after developing a mind that is deeply pleased at all the merit of all sentient beings in the ten directions, one rejoices [at this virtue] and says so in words. Likewise, after pondering all the transgressions [committed by sentient beings], one generates patience toward others. Likewise, [one] dedicates all the virtue that [one] has done and not [yet] done[684] by body, speech, or mind to unsurpassed true enlightenment. Regularly and at appropriate times, one makes a variety of correct aspirational prayers[685] and all manner of extensive forms of worshipping the Three Jewels. One also applies oneself to and initiates effort toward [everything] that pertains to virtue, always and continuously. One abides in [a state of] mindfulness in relation to [one’s] body and speech.[686] One keeps watch over the precepts of the training by practicing recollection and vigilance.[687] One keeps the doors of one’s faculties guarded, knows moderation with regard to food, strives to remain wakeful during the first and last parts of the night,[688] serves true spiritual beings,[689] and relies upon spiritual teachers.[690] One is aware of one’s own mistakes and sees them as faults.[691] Having realized [one’s mistakes] and seen [them as faults], one rejects them. Having erred, one also confesses [one’s] violations in the presence of the buddhas, bodhisattvas, and followers of the same form of Dharma.[692] The morality [that is cultivated] in order to gain, preserve, and increase these kinds of virtuous entities is called a bodhisattva’s “morality of acquiring virtuous qualities.”

What are the eleven forms?

How does a bodhisattva who is abiding in the morality of restraint, abiding in the morality of acquiring virtue, and abiding in the morality of acting on behalf of beings become one whose conduct is well restrained, one whose conduct acquires virtue effectively, and one whose conduct addresses every aspect of acting on behalf of sentient beings?
If a bodhisattva who is established here in the discipline of individual liberation were to renounce the kingdom of a wheel ruler to become one who has gone forth [into the homeless state], he or she would have the same lack of interest in that wheel ruler’s kingdom as he or she has toward straw or excrement. A person of low social standing who abandons insignificant forms of pleasure and goes forth [into the homeless state] with the aim of [taking up that lifestyle in order to gain] a means of livelihood does not have a lack of interest in those insignificant pleasures that is equal to [the lack of interest] that a bodhisattva who has gone forth motivated by a pure attitude feels toward the most excellent of all human forms of pleasure, [which is to say] the pleasures [that are enjoyed by] a wheel ruler.

A bodhisattva also does not harbor any desire for future pleasures, not even those that are found in Māra’s domain,[697] let alone those of any other divine realm. Nor does he or she engage in a pure spiritual life[698] through having resolved to attain [divine pleasures], [since] he or she perceives those [divine] pleasures as they truly are—[which is to say, that they are] like an entrance leading into a dense forest filled with many kinds of great dangers.
With regard to the present, a bodhisattva who has gone forth [into the homeless state] sees by means of his or her right wisdom that even great forms of gain and honor received from exalted beings are like vomited food and does not relish them, much less [does he or she relish] those insignificant forms [of gain and honor] received from beings of low standing.
[A bodhisattva] also dwells alone, delighting in solitude. When in the midst of the Sangha, he or she maintains an isolated mind[699] at all times. He or she is not satisfied just with practicing restraint as a form of morality. Relying on and established in that morality, he or she strives to develop and attain mastery of the bodhisattvas’ limitless forms of one-pointed concentration. When associating with others, he or she does not indulge in even the slightest form of wrongful conversation or wrongful speech. When in a place of solitude, he or she does not indulge in even the slightest form of wrongful deliberation.[700]

Regularly and at appropriate times, one generates strong regret at having engaged in [any of] those [forms of wrongful] conduct due to clouded recollection[701] and recognizes the disadvantages [of having done so]. Through having repeatedly generated regret [about such improper behavior] and having [repeatedly] considered its disadvantages, [one’s] recollection becomes established very quickly, as soon as any form of wrongful conversation or wrongful deliberation occurs. One also develops the thought that wants to avoid committing [such actions] and [this thought] constitutes the means by which one draws back [from such wrongful thought and speech]. Through cultivating [this impulse of] drawing back [in this way], one gradually comes to abide [in a state that] delights in the avoidance of that conduct and becomes averse to that conduct to the same degree that one previously took pleasure in it.
Upon hearing about all the bodhisattva precepts that are observed by bodhisattvas who have attained the great stages, one does not become frightened, diffident, or timid [about the fact that they are] vast, unlimited, and inconceivable, or that they must be practiced for long periods of time and they are extremely difficult to carry out. One reflects in this very manner: “The ones who have trained themselves gradually in the bodhisattva trainings and who have developed restraint by possessing the physical and verbal discipline that is unlimited and inconceivable did so as human beings. I, too, am a human being and, by gradually training myself, I shall also without doubt attain success in that [very same] physical and verbal discipline.”

A bodhisattva also is one who becomes established in the moral discipline by examining his or her own faults and inner failings, not by examining the faults and inner failings of others. He or she does not develop animosity or hatred toward any sentient beings who are violent and engage in wrongful conduct. Relying upon a form of great compassion that is [based upon] entities,[702] he or she develops a bodhisattva’s [attitude of] especially strong sympathy toward such beings and a desire to act [on their behalf].
The bodhisattva who is established in the morality of restraint does not even become angry with others when struck with a hand, a lump of earth, a stick, or a weapon, much less does he or she utter evil speech or return the blow. This is all the more true when he or she experiences the mistreatment of being reprimanded with angry verbal abuse that causes only minor suffering.

The bodhisattva who is established in the morality of restraint also becomes endowed with a mindfulness[703] consisting of five limbs: (1) one that relates to the past, (2) one that relates to the future, (3) one that relates to the present, (4) one that should be cultivated in advance, and (5) one that is practiced concurrently. A bodhisattva who is practicing the bodhisattva trainings and who has incurred an offense in relation to the past remedies that [offense] in accordance with the Dharma.[704] This is mindfulness that relates to the past. Whatever offense may be incurred in the future, he or she also determines to remedy that [offense] in accordance with the Dharma. This is mindfulness that relates to the future. Whatever offense is incurred in the present, he or she remedies that [offense] in accordance with the Dharma. This is mindfulness that relates to the present. A bodhisattva develops an intensely zealous attitude prior to [the occurrence of] an offense [in which he or she resolves], “May I conduct myself and maintain myself in whatever way will insure that I can avoid committing any offense.” This is a bodhisattva’s mindfulness that should be cultivated in advance. On the basis of that very form of mindfulness that should be cultivated in advance, [a bodhisattva] conducts and maintains him- or herself continuously in whatever way will insure that he or she avoids committing any offense. This is mindfulness that is practiced concurrently.

A bodhisattva who is established in the morality of restraint conceals his or her virtue, exposes his or her evil, has few wants, is satisfied with what he or she has, endures suffering, is indefatigable, does not become excited, is unwavering and calm in his or her physical behavior, and avoids all the qualities that lead to hypocrisy and the other forms of wrong livelihood.[705]
A bodhisattva who is established in the morality of restraint and who is also endowed with [the following] ten qualities becomes one whose conduct is well restrained: (1) indifference to past pleasures, (2) lack of desire for those of the future, (3) lack of attachment to those of the present, (4) delighting in solitude, (5) striving to develop purity in speech and deliberative thoughts, (6) avoiding self-abasement, (7) gentleness, (8) patience, (9) mindfulness, and (10) purity of conduct and means of livelihood.

Furthermore, (1) a bodhisattva who is established in the morality that acquires virtuous qualities does not tolerate the occurrence of even a small amount of regard for his or her body and possessions, much less [the occurrence of] a great amount. (2) He or she does not tolerate the occurrence of any of the root or secondary mental afflictions, such as anger, resentment, etc., that constitute the primary cause of all forms of immoral conduct. (3) He or she does not tolerate the occurrence of any feelings of animosity, hatred, or hostility toward others. (4) He or she does not tolerate the occurrence of idleness or laziness. (5) He or she does not tolerate the relishing of [the ease associated with] the states of composure that may occur or [any of] the mental afflictions that [may occur in connection] with the states of composure.
[A bodhisattva] also correctly learns five subjects. He or she correctly learns (1) the benefits[706] that result from virtue. He or she correctly learns (2) the causes of virtue, (3) what is erring and (4) unerring about the results of virtuous causes, and (5) the obstacles to acquiring virtue. Recognizing the benefits that result from virtue, a bodhisattva seeks the causes of virtue. Correctly knowing what is erring and unerring about acquiring virtue, a bodhisattva who has attained a result of virtue does not regard what is impermanent as permanent, does not regard what is suffering as a form of well-being, does not regard what is impure as pure, and does not regard what does not constitute a self as constituting a self. Knowing the obstacles to acquiring virtue, he or she abandons them.
With these ten qualities, [a practitioner] who is established in the morality of acquiring virtuous qualities quickly becomes one who acquires virtue, and one who acquires [virtue] of every form. That is to say, [one acquires virtue] by means of the foundation[707] of generosity, by means of the foundation of morality, by means of the foundation of patience, by means of the foundation of effort, by means of the foundation of meditative absorption, and by means of the five forms of wisdom.[708]

He or she dispels the suffering caused by the perturbation of desire for sensory pleasures that is possessed by those who suffer from the perturbation of desire for sensory pleasures. He or she dispels the perturbations of malice, torpor, sleep, excitation, regret, and doubt that are possessed by those who suffer from any of those perturbations.[714] He or she dispels the deliberation about sensory pleasures that is engaged in by those who are suffering from the perturbation of deliberation about sensory pleasures. Just as with [the statement regarding] deliberation about sensory pleasures, the same should be understood with regard to deliberation about malice, harmfulness, family relatives, one’s homeland, the unlikeliness of one’s death, contempt [toward others], and arrogance because of [being from an eminent] family.
He or she dispels the suffering of having been defeated and humiliated by others that is felt by those who are experiencing the suffering of having been defeated and humiliated by others.

Moreover, employing the morality of embracing,[723] a bodhisattva who is practicing [the act of] embracing [sentient beings] through the act of leading a body of practitioners initially provides a dwelling place, [and does so] with a mind that is free of desire for any material gain and having initially formed a mind that is motivated exclusively by compassion. Following that, in a manner that conforms with the Dharma, one seeks on their behalf robes, food, bedding, seats, medicine for curing the ill, and the other personal belongings from those brahmins and householders who possess faith [in the Dharma]. One also shares one’s own robes, food, bedding, seats, medicine for curing the ill, and the other personal belongings that are in keeping with the Dharma and were obtained in a manner that accords with the Dharma; one does not keep them for private use. Regularly and at appropriate times, one also bestows the orderly instruction that has eight aspects and correctly teaches discipline using the counsel that has five aspects. Instruction and counsel should be understood here in the same way that they were explained in the chapter on the spiritual lineages of the powers.[724]

Moreover, employing the morality of compliance, a bodhisattva who is complying with the minds of sentient beings at the very outset makes him- or herself aware of the attitude, fundamental nature, and constituent element of sentient beings. Having become aware of their attitude, fundamental nature, and constituent element, one associates with them in whatever man ner one ought to associate with them. One conducts oneself in relation to those sentient beings in whatever manner one ought to conduct oneself.
If a bodhisattva who wishes to comply with the mind of a particular sentient being sees that a certain type of physical or verbal conduct of some significance will cause that [being] to develop suffering or unhappiness of mind and he or she [also sees] that that suffering or unhappiness of mind will not serve to turn [that being] away from opportunities [to engage in] nonvirtuous [actions] and cause [him or her] to become established in opportunities [to engage in] virtuous [actions], then, after consideration, a bodhisattva diligently abandons that significant form of physical or verbal conduct and does not engage in it. On the other hand, if a bodhisattva sees that that suffering or unhappiness of mind [will serve to turn] that [being] away from opportunities [to engage in] nonvirtuous [actions] and cause [him or her] to become established in opportunities [to engage in] virtuous [actions], then, after consideration, [that bodhisattva] generates compassion toward that other [being] and does not comply with [his or her] mind.

On the other hand, if he or she sees that either of those individuals [or groups of individuals] or both would be turned away from opportunities [to engage in] nonvirtuous [actions] and caused to become established in opportunities [to engage in] virtuous [actions], after consideration a bodhisattva engages in that physical or verbal conduct.

If a bodhisattva perceives that his or her particular physical or verbal conduct of some significance would give rise to suffering or unhappiness of mind in others and this physical or verbal conduct is neither included among the precepts of training nor constitutes a form of the merit or wisdom accumulations, and that suffering or unhappiness of mind also does not serve to turn others away from opportunities [to engage in] nonvirtuous actions, etc., as described above, then a bodhisattva avoids that physical or verbal conduct in order to preserve the opinion of others. In the opposite circumstances, [a bodhisattva’s] conduct should be understood as described above.[725]
Just as with the suffering or unhappiness of mind [that might be caused to arise in others], a similar explanation should be understood to apply in detail and according to circumstances for the pleasure or happiness of mind [that might be caused to arise in others].[726]
A bodhisattva who complies with the minds of others does not even express praise directly to another [person] who is perturbed by the perturbation of anger, as long as the perturbation of anger has not disappeared, much less does he criticize [such an individual]. [A bodhisattva] also does not offer an apology [to such a person in those circumstances].

Moreover, a bodhisattva who complies with the minds of others addresses and greets another person even if that person does not address him or her. This is all the more true if that person does address and greet him or her.
A bodhisattva who complies with the minds of others does not upset [another person], except in a situation where he or she wishes to reproach someone. Then he or she reproaches those [individuals] with a sense of compassion and with the faculties composed.
A bodhisattva who complies with the minds of others does not ridicule or show contempt toward another [person], or cause him or her to feel embarrassed. [A bodhisattva] also does not cause [another person] to develop regret in order to make [that person] feel unhappy. Nor does he or she ask someone who has suffered a defeat and been punished about the particulars relating to that punishment. He or she also does not make known his or her own success to someone who has fallen into low circumstances.
A bodhisattva who complies with the minds of others neither [completely] avoids the company of others nor keeps company with them to an excessive degree. He or she does not keep company with others at inappropriate times. He or she also does not criticize the friends or praise the adversaries of others in their presence. He or she does not confide in those whom he or she does not know well. He or she does not repeatedly solicit [the same person]. He or she shows moderation when accepting gifts. He or she does not refuse an invitation to receive food and drink, etc. Or, as a person who acts in accord with Dharma, he or she offers a proper reason to be excused.

Moreover, employing the morality of suppression, a bodhisattva suppresses sentient beings [who have engaged in wrongful conduct]. With an attitude that is inwardly affectionate and free of distress, he or she censures a lesser offense and lesser transgression[727] with a mild reprimand. He or she censures an intermediate offense and intermediate transgression with a moderate reprimand, and a great offense and great transgression with a severe reprimand. Just as with reprimands, a similar [description] should be understood for punishments.
For lesser and intermediate offenses and lesser and intermediate transgressions, a bodhisattva expels [the transgressor] as a temporary measure and with the intention of allowing him or her to return. [This expulsion is imposed] for the purpose of correcting those very [transgressors] as well as [serving as instruction for] others, and it is carried out with a compassionate mind and with the intention of benefiting [those involved]. For great offenses and great transgressions, [a bodhisattva] expels [the transgressor] without allowing him or her to associate [with the religious community] or partake of [life in the religious community] again and without allowing him or her to be readmitted [to the religious community] for the remainder of his or her lifetime. [This expulsion is imposed] with compassion toward those very [transgressors] so that they will not continue to acquire any more nonmeritorious karma in relation to the [Buddhist] teaching and with the desire to benefit others as well, by serving as instruction for them.

Moreover, a bodhisattva who is desirous of frightening sentient beings and desirous of winning them over by means of miraculous powers repeatedly brings forth and reveals to those beings who engage in misconduct [visions of] the ripening of that misconduct in the lower realms of the hell regions, [which include] the great [hot] hells, the cold hells, and the partial hells.[728] He or she tells them, “Honorable ones, look at this violent, extremely severe, and undesirable ripening result that is being experienced by human beings who carried out and accumulated misdeeds.” Upon seeing this, these beings become frightened, develop apprehension, and refrain from [engaging in any further] misconduct.
Some beings are desirous of causing a bodhisattva’s speech not to be accepted[729] through refusing to answer his or her questions[730] when seated in a large gathering. A bodhisattva frightens and terrifies such beings by emanating him- or herself as Vajrapāṇi or some other powerful spirit that is imposing in appearance, has a large body, and [displays] great power. [This is done] so that, because of this [action], he or she can cause those who have been made to develop faith, a high degree of esteem, and respect to answer his or her questions correctly, and so that, by means of those responses, he or she might impose spiritual self-discipline upon that large body of beings.

In this way, a bodhisattva becomes one who possesses, in all its aspects, the morality that acts on behalf of sentient beings.
These are a bodhisattva’s three heaps of morality that represent immeasurable heaps of merit. They are the heap of morality that consists of the morality of restraint, [the heap of morality] that consists of the morality of acquiring virtuous qualities, and [the heap of morality] that consists of the morality of acting on behalf of sentient beings.

Regarding this [topic], whether he or she is a householder or one who has gone forth [into the homeless state], a bodhisattva who wishes to train him- or herself in the bodhisattva training that relates to this threefold heap of morality and who has generated the aspiration to achieve unsurpassed true enlightenment should initially throw him- or herself at the feet of a bodhisattva who is an exemplary Dharma follower[732] and who has [also] made the aspiration [to attain enlightenment], is wise, and is able to convey the meaning of the verbal informative form,[733] and make the following entreaty: “O son of good family” [or, “O daughter of good family”],[734] “I wish to receive from you the acceptance of the discipline of bodhisattva morality. If it causes no trouble, may it please you, in your compassion, to hear me for a brief moment.”
Following this, the bodhisattva who is capable [of conducting the ritual] should describe at length the benefits of the bodhisattva [system of] discipline[735] to the bodhisattva who is desirous of receiving it. He or she should also describe the heavy and light precepts to the individual who is desirous of receiving the discipline and cause him or her to develop enthusiasm by saying the following: “Hear me, O son of good family” [or, “Hear me, O daughter of good family”]. “Do you wish to lead across those who have not crossed over, set free those who have not been set free, comfort those who are in need of comfort, bring to nirvana those who have not reached nirvana,[736] and preserve the lineage of the buddhas? You should generate a firm attitude and a firm determination regarding this.” This should be said to those who are recognized to be unaware of these points in order to cause them to develop enthusiasm.[737]

Having made reverential salutation before an image of the Tathāgata that had been set up, [the candidate] should place his or her [right] knee on the ground or sit in a squatting position and humbly[738] address the knowledgeable bodhisattva with the following words: “O son of good family [or “O daughter of good family],”[739] or “O long-lived one,”[740] or “O venerable one,”[741] “please bestow upon me the acceptance of the discipline of bodhisattva morality.” Having spoken these words, [the candidate] should fix his or her recollection one-pointedly and, with a state of mind that steadily becomes ever more reverential, remain silent while reflecting on the following thought: “Before long now, I shall gain an inexhaustible, immeasurable, and unsurpassed treasure of great merit.”
Then, while standing or sitting and with an undistracted mind, the knowledgeable bodhisattva should address the [candidate] bodhisattva who has spoken in this way as follows: “Hear me, O son of good family,” or “[Hear me,] O Dharma brother,” who is named so-and-so.” [Or “Hear me, O daughter of good family,” or “Hear me, O Dharma sister, who is named so-and-so.”] “Are you a bodhisattva and have you made the aspiration to [attain] enlightenment?”
[The bodhisattva candidate] should then affirm, “Yes, it is so.”[742]

Following that, [the officiating bodhisattva] should state the following: “O son of good family who is named so-and-so [or, “O daughter of good family who is named so-and-so], do you accept from me all of the bodhisattva precepts and all of the bodhisattva morality—[namely,] the morality of restraint, the morality of acquiring virtuous qualities, and the morality of acting on behalf of sentient beings—those precepts and that morality which have been observed by all the bodhisattvas of the past, those precepts and that morality which shall be observed by all the bodhisattvas of the future, and those precepts and that morality which currently are being observed by all the bodhisattvas of the present throughout the ten directions, those precepts and that morality with regard to which all the bodhisattvas of the past have trained themselves, with regard to which all the bodhisattvas of the future shall train themselves, and with regard to which all the bodhisattvas of the present are training themselves?”

It is also a fact of nature that immediately following the rite of accepting the discipline of [bodhisattva] morality, a particular type of sign[743] will become evident to the tathāgatas and the bodhisattvas who have achieved the great [ārya] stages and who exist, remain, and live in the endless and unlimited world spheres that lie in the ten directions. Because of this [sign, those tathāgatas and bodhisattvas] will realize the following: “A bodhisattva has taken up the acceptance of the discipline of bodhisattva morality.” And immediately thereafter, their attention will turn toward that bodhisattva. And with that attention, their knowledge-perception[744] will take effect. By means of this knowledge-perception, those [buddhas and great bodhisattvas] become fully aware, in accordance with reality, that a bodhisattva named so-and-so in this particular world sphere has received the acceptance of the discipline of bodhisattva morality from another bodhisattva named so-and-so. And, with favorable minds, they will all react compassionately toward him or her, as one would a son or daughter or a brother or sister. It should be expected that the virtuous qualities of the bodhisattva who is looked upon in this way with a favorable mind and sympathy will increase greatly and they will not decline. It should be understood that [the buddhas and great bodhisattvas thus] recognize this announcement regarding the acceptance of the discipline of [bodhisattva] morality.

This acceptance by a bodhisattva of the discipline of [bodhisattva] morality is the most distinguished among all the forms of accepting a [system of] moral discipline. It is unsurpassed, it is accompanied by an immeasurable heap of merit, it is generated by a supreme mental attitude, and it is the antidote to every form of misdeed that relates to all sentient beings. All the acceptances of the discipline of individual liberation[746] do not reach a hundredth part of this acceptance of a [system of] moral discipline, nor do they even reach a thousandth part. In relation to the [amount of] merit that is attained, [all the acceptances of the discipline of individual liberation] do not reach [any level of] calculation, portioning, reckoning, or factoring [that can be compared to the merit attained through the acceptance of the discipline of bodhisattva morality].

Moreover, the bodhisattva who is abiding in the acceptance of the discipline of bodhisattva morality should continually examine [any possible course of action so as to determine] “This is proper for a bodhisattva to do. That is not proper to do.” Subsequent to this very [process of reflection, his or her determinations] should be put into action and the training should be carried out. He or she should also diligently study either the collection of bodhisattva sutras or this composition that represents a manual[747] for the collection of bodhisattva sutras in order to carry out a [form of] training that practices in accordance with the many thousands of precepts for bodhisattvas that the Blessed One taught in those scriptures.[748]

In addition, the acceptance of this [system of] moral discipline should not be received from all bodhisattvas, even though they may be knowledgeable. A bodhisattva should not receive it from someone who lacks faith—[which is to say], from someone who, from the outset, feels no devotion toward the acceptance of this form of moral discipline, does not take up its practice, and does not accommodate him- or herself to it in a well-regulated manner. Nor [should he or she receive it] from someone who is greedy, who is overcome by attachment, whose desires are great, or who is not satisfied with what he or she has; nor from someone whose morality is ruined, who has no regard for the trainings, or who is lax; nor from someone who is inclined to anger, who is resentful, who is highly impatient, or who is intolerant of others’ transgressions; nor from someone who is slothful, who is lazy, who indulges excessively in the enjoyment of sleep during the day and night, the enjoyment of leaning on one’s side, and the enjoyment of lying down, or who spends his or her time socializing with others; nor from someone whose mind is easily distracted and cannot meditate one-pointedly on a virtuous object even for the length of time it takes to a milk a cow; nor from someone who is dull-witted, who is of a confused nature, whose mind is excessively languid, or who disparages the collection of bodhisattva sutras and the manuals [that present the instructions contained in] the collection of bodhisattva sutras.

Why is that?
It is because upon hearing about it, those who feel no devotion [toward this form of discipline] and who are greatly obscured by the obscurations to that which needs to be known will be led to speak ill of it. Moreover, one who speaks ill of it will remain bound fast to an immeasurable heap of wickedness that is commensurate with the immeasurable heap of merit that is possessed by the bodhisattva who is abiding in the discipline until he or she completely and entirely abandons that evil speech, that evil view, and that evil notion.
Moreover, the precepts of the training and the occasions for [the occurrence of] transgressions that are set forth in this manual for the bodhisattva collection [of scriptures] should be made known beforehand to the bodhisattva who wishes to undertake the acceptance of the [system of] moral discipline. If, he or she is eager [to accept the discipline] after having earnestly examined [the precepts], and after having considered them carefully[749] with his or her wisdom, rather than at the instigation of others or out of rivalry with others,[750] then [such a person] should be known as a resolute bodhisattva. This act of accepting the [system of] moral discipline should be conferred by such a one [who was described above]; it should be given to such a one [who was just described]; and [it should be carried out] by means of the ritual [that was described here].

<d e="2">
What are the four?
Praising oneself and disparaging others by one who is attached to gain and honor is an act that represents an extreme form of defeat for a bodhisattva.
The refusal to give material objects, because of a greedy nature and hardheartedness, to petitioners who have approached in a correct manner, who are suffering, miserable, and impoverished, and who lack a protector and someone to rely upon, even though one has and possesses wealth, and the refusal to share Dharma teachings with those who seek them and who have approached in a proper manner, because of one’s stinginess about the Dharma, are acts that represent an extreme form of defeat for a bodhisattva.
The perturbation of anger can be of a kind that a bodhisattva will cause to become stronger and, therefore, it will not come to an end merely by uttering harsh speech. [A bodhisattva] who has been overcome by [such a form of] anger may strike, harm, or cause injury to sentient beings with [his or her] hand, a clod of earth, a club, or a weapon. Furthermore, by harboring this attitude of anger in a strong form, [a bodhisattva] may not accept and forgive an acknowledgment of wrongdoing made by others, and he or she may fail to let go of that attitude [of anger]. This, too, is an act that represents an extreme form of defeat for a bodhisattva.
Disparaging the bodhisattva collection [of scriptures] and taking pleasure in, teaching, or establishing counterfeit forms of Dharma by one who is firmly devoted to a counterfeit Dharma [and who behaves in this way] either on his or her own or in imitation of others, is an act that represents an extreme form of defeat for a bodhisattva.

Moreover, a bodhisattva does not lose the acceptance of the [bodhisattva system of] moral discipline [by committing any of] these four acts that represent an extreme form of defeat [if they are done] on the basis of a lesser or middling perturbation. However, he or she does lose it [if they are committed] on the basis of a great perturbation. When [the basis for committing any of these acts is such that] a bodhisattva does not develop even a small amount of shame and abashment because he or she has engaged continually in these four acts that represent an extreme form of defeat and, due to that [lack of shame or abashment], he or she is both pleased with and delights in [that conduct], and he or she looks upon that very [conduct] as a good quality, this should be understood as constituting a great perturbation.[753] However, a bodhisattva does not immediately lose the acceptance of the discipline of bodhisattva morality as soon as he or she has engaged in an act that represents an extreme form of defeat, as, for example, a bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī does with the discipline of individual liberation by committing [any of the four] acts that constitute an extreme form of defeat.[754] Moreover, even if a bodhisattva has lost the acceptance [of the system of moral discipline], he or she is still capable of once again receiving the acceptance of the discipline of bodhisattva morality in that same life. He or she is not incapable [of receiving it again], as, for example, a bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī who has accepted the discipline of individual liberation is [incapable] when he or she has incurred [any of] the extreme forms of defeat. In short, there are only two causes that can bring about the abandonment of the acceptance of the discipline of bodhisattva morality: (1) giving up the aspiration to attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment and (2) committing an act that represents an extreme form of defeat on the basis of a great perturbation.

In addition, a bodhisattva who has neither given up the aspiration [to attain supreme enlightenment] nor committed any of the extreme forms of defeat on the basis of a great perturbation does not abandon the acceptance of the discipline of bodhisattva morality even after having exchanged his or her life and wherever he or she is reborn—whether a higher [rebirth], a lower one, or one that is at the same level.[755] Even though a bodhisattva whose recollection has been clouded due to having exchanged his or her life may accept [the bodhisattva system of discipline] repeatedly [in successive rebirths] after coming in contact with a spiritual teacher, he or she does so for the purpose of awakening his or her recollection; this does not constitute a new acceptance [of the bodhisattva discipline].

A bodhisattva abiding in the discipline of bodhisattva morality who allows a night and day[756] to go by without performing on a daily basis the preeminent form of homage, whether small or extensive, to the Tathāgata in the form of a caitya[757] that represents the Tathāgata, to the Dharma in the form of a scripture from the bodhisattva sutra collection or a manual on the bodhisattva sutra collection [either of which] represents the Dharma, or to the Sangha which is made up of [all] the bodhisattvas in the ten directions who have attained the great [ārya] stages—[homage that consists of] at least a single prostration with the body; a recitation by speech of at least one verse of four lines describing the virtuous qualities of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha; or at least a single [attitude of] reverence with the mind that is preceded by recollection of the qualities of the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha—commits an offense and commits a transgression.
If [this misdeed] occurs out of disrespect [for the precepts of moral training], or out of idleness and laziness, [a bodhisattva] acquires an afflicted offense. If it occurs because of a lapse of recollection, he or she acquires an unafflicted offense. There is no offense for [a bodhisattva] who is mentally disturbed.[758] There is no offense for [a bodhisattva] who has attained the stage of a pure [superior] attitude. That is, a bodhisattva who has attained the purity of attitude is like a bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī who, after having attained the faith born of insight,[759] naturally and at all times serves and honors the Master, the Dharma, and the Sangha with supreme forms of homage.

A bodhisattva who, while in a hostile or angry state of mind, abandons or neglects immoral and violent persons because of their bad conduct or violence commits an offense and a transgression, and he or she acquires an afflicted offense. If he or she abandons them due to idleness and laziness, or neglects them due to a lapse of recollection, then he or she commits an offense and a transgression, but does not acquire an afflicted offense.
Why is that?
It is because a bodhisattva does not feel the same amount of sympathy toward and does not have the same eagerness to act on behalf of moral individuals and those who are subdued in the performance of their physical, verbal, and mental deeds as he or she does toward those who are violent and immoral, and who are engaged in [conduct that represents] the cause of [their own future] suffering.
There is no offense for [a bodhisattva] who is mentally disturbed [to fail to act on behalf of immoral and violent persons]. There is no offense if, by that means, [a bodhisattva] wishes to spiritually tame [immoral and violent individuals], etc., as [described] before. There is no offense for [a bodhisattva] who is preserving the opinion of a great many other individuals. There is no offense for [a bodhisattva] who is observing a rule of the Sangha.

A bodhisattva trains him- or herself in the same way that listeners do and not in any different way with regard to those [transgressions] that the Blessed One established in the moral code of individual liberation as being objectionable by virtue of having been condemned[774] based upon [the principle of] preserving the opinion of others in order to engender faith in those who lack it and further increase the faith of those who have already acquired it.

Why is that?
The listeners are indeed chiefly occupied with [achieving] their own aim; yet they train themselves in the moral precepts in such a manner that they do not fail to preserve the opinion of others in order to engender faith in those who lack it and further increase the faith of those who have already acquired it. How much more, then, should bodhisattvas [train themselves in this same way], since they are chiefly occupied with [achieving] the aims of others.

Why is that?
It is becoming for a listener who is completely devoted to his or her own aim and who does not take an interest in the aims of others to be one who, as relates to the aims of others, has few concerns, engages in few activities, and abides with few worries. However, it is not becoming for a bodhisattva who is completely devoted to the aims of others to be one who, as relates to the aims of others, has few concerns, engages in few activities, and abides with few worries. For example, if a bodhisattva, for the sake of others, has been offered [as many as] a hundred sets of monks’ robes or a thousand sets of monks’ robes that were sought from brahmins and householders who do not have a close family relation with him or her, he or she should accept from these individuals as many [robes] as are needed after having considered whether [their resources] are sufficiently strong. As with monks’ robes, [a bodhisattva] should do the same for food bowls. As with those objects that are sought [from others, a bodhisattva] should also cause [monastic robes] to be woven by weavers who are unrelated to him or her using yarn that [a bodhisattva] him- or herself has solicited [from someone else]. For the sake of others, [a bodhisattva] should also provide [as many as] a hundred silk beds and a hundred sitting mats. He or she should also accept [as much as] a trillion agra[778] of gold and silver.

There are also certain naturally objectionable acts[779] such that, when they are performed by a bodhisattva with a particular kind of skillful means, he or she not only remains free of any offense but also generates a great amount of merit. An example would be a situation in which a bodhisattva sees a thief or a robber who is intent upon killing many hundreds of living beings—great persons [such as] listeners, solitary realizers, or bodhisattvas—for the sake of a small amount of material wealth, [making this person] someone who is preparing to commit many instances of an immediate misdeed.[780] Having seen this, [a bodhisattva] then forms the following thought with his or her mind: “Even though I shall have to be reborn in the hells for depriving this living being of his or her life, it is better that I should be reborn in a hell than that this sentient should end up in the hells because of having committed an immediate misdeed.” After a bodhisattva who has had such a thought determines that his or her state of mind toward this living being is either virtuous or indeterminate,[781] and after developing a single-minded attitude of sympathy about the future[782] while experiencing [a sense of] abhorrence,[783] he or she then deprives [this living being] of his or her life. [Having done this, a bodhisattva] will not only remain free of any offense but will also generate a great amount of merit.

Another example would be a situation in which a bodhisattva [sees] men of a royal tribe or a king’s high officials who are highly prone to violence, lacking in compassion toward sentient beings, and wholly devoted to inflicting harm on others. If he or she has the authority to do so, a bodhisattva, while maintaining a sympathetic mind and an attitude that wishes to benefit and bring happiness [to these individuals], deprives them of their royal power and the position of authority during whose tenure they generated great demerit. Also, [if a bodhisattva sees that] thieves and robbers who steal others’ property have stolen the extensive wealth of the Sangha or a stupa and made it their own because they are desirous of enjoying it, he or she confiscates it from them, thinking to him- or herself, “Indeed, the enjoyment of [this ill-gotten] wealth must not be allowed to bring harm and disadvantage to these [thieves] that would last for a very long time!” After confiscating [the wealth] on the basis of this very conviction, [a bodhisattva] returns that which belongs to the Sangha to the Sangha and also that which belongs to a stupa to the stupa. Further, [when a bodhisattva sees that] administrators and caretakers of [temple] groves, by their bad conduct, are mismanaging the wealth of the Sangha or a stupa and making personal use of [that wealth], he or she considers this [matter] and then thinks to him- or herself, “Indeed, this action and this wrongful enjoyment [of wealth] must not be allowed to bring harm and disadvantage to these [administrators and caretakers] that would last for a very long time!” and then causes them to be removed from their position. Even though, [by proceeding] in this manner in situations such as these, a bodhisattva is carrying out [acts of] taking what was not given, he or she not only remains free of any offense but also generates a great amount of merit.

Another example would be a situation in which a householder bodhisattva engages in sexual intercourse with a woman who is tormented by the desire not to remain chaste, someone whose mind is fixed on that [act] and who is not married to someone else. After having placed his mind [in a state that is characterized] exclusively by sympathy and thinking to himself, “Indeed, [this woman] must not be allowed to generate great demerit through having gained an attitude of hostility. May she become a docile wife[784] [who is devoted] both to the pursuit of whatever roots of virtue she desires and to the abandonment of the roots of nonvirtue,” [the householder bodhisattva] who does not remain chaste and engages in the act of sexual intercourse not only remains free of any offense but also generates great merit. On the other hand, it is never acceptable for a bodhisattva who has gone forth [into the state of a celibate ascetic][785] and who is someone who is guarding himself against doing any harm to the [Buddhist] teaching of the listeners to violate the [the vow of] chastity.

In short, in those situations where a bodhisattva perceives that it would be wholly in the interest of sentient beings [to utter false speech], and he or she perceives that it would not be harmful [to do so], and his or her mind is free of any corporeal desire,[786] and, after having altered his conception [of the facts] motivated exclusively by a desire to benefit beings, he or she deliberately utters speech that is at variance [with the truth], he or she remains free of any offense by speaking [such falsehoods] and also generates great merit.

Having adopted a completely sympathetic mind, he or she then reflects, “May these beings not have to undergo harm and disadvantage for a very long time because of their association with these evil companions.” A bodhisattva who, in this way, causes a division between friends not only remains free of any offense but also generates great merit.

This is because a listener is dedicated to the pursuit of his or her own welfare, but a bodhisattva is dedicated to the welfare of all sentient beings. Thus, [a bodhisattva] must attain a state of self-discipline in which [his or her] mind remains so free of afflictions that, even though not an arhat, he or she can interact with entities that have the potential to cause the outflows to arise in such a manner that the unafflicted state of mind which he or she possesses is even superior to that of an arhat.

A bodhisattva who, after hearing the profound subjects [contained] in the bodhisattva collection [of scriptures], fails to develop [proper] devotion toward those supremely profound [subjects] that pertain to the nature of reality or to the powers of the buddhas and bodhisattvas and denigrates them by saying, “These [teachings] do not possess any meaning, they do not possess [any genuine] Dharma, they were not spoken by the Tathāgata, they do not [provide] benefit or happiness to sentient beings,” commits an offense and a transgression, and he or she acquires an afflicted offense, [regardless of] whether he or she denigrates them because of his or her own improper manner of thinking or because of his or her [desire] to comply with [the views of] others.

After hearing such profound and supremely profound subjects, a bodhisattva may indeed fail to develop an attitude of devotion [toward them]. Regarding this [point], a faithful and sincere bodhisattva should train him- or herself about this matter [as follows]: “It is not right that I, who am blind and lacking in vision, and who can proceed only by relying on the Tathāgata’s vision, should reject the Tathāgata’s enigmatic statements.”[801] A bodhisattva who considers him- or herself to be lacking in understanding in this way and who regards the Tathāgata as the sole being who is unobscured with regard to a buddha’s qualities becomes one who is correctly established [in the practice]. [Thus,] there is no offense for [a bodhisattva] who, though lacking in devotion, does not reject [the teachings on profound subjects].

There is no offense if [a bodhisattva] was not aware [of the event] or if he or she was ill and unable [to attend].

There is no offense for [a bodhisattva] who [does not attend in order to] preserve the opinion of his or her Dharma teacher. There is no offense for [a bodhisattva] who [does not attend because he or she] recognizes that [the subject of] the talk is one that he or she has heard repeatedly, and [therefore] it has [already] been learned and its meaning has been realized. There is no offense if [a bodhisattva] is very learned and has both retained and stored[804] what he or she has learned. There is no offense for someone who is engaged in the cultivation of a bodhisattva’s one-pointed concentration [not to attend], since [that is an exercise for which] the mind must be continually fixed on a meditation object. There is no offense for [a bodhisattva not to attend] if he or she has a very slow intellect and, therefore, would be slow at taking up Dharma, slow at retaining [Dharma], and slow at fixing his or her mind [one-pointedly] on a meditation object.

[A bodhisattva] who does not comply [with the minds of others] due to idleness and laziness, or due to lack of mindfulness, acquires an unafflicted offense.
There is no offense if [a bodhisattva does not comply with the minds of others] because their intention is [for him or her to do] something that is unwholesome.[808] There is no offense if [a bodhisattva does not comply with the minds of others because] he or she is sick and unfit to carry out [some activity that others would like to have done]. There is no offense if [a bodhisattva does not comply with the minds of others] in observance of a rule of the Sangha. There is no offense if [a bodhisattva does not comply with the minds of others] because although [the activity] that one individual would like [a bodhisattva to do] is wholesome for that person it is neither desired nor wholesome for a great many other persons. There is no offense if [a bodhisattva does not comply with the minds of others because] the person [who would like a bodhisattva to do something] is a heretic who deserves to be suppressed.[809] There is no offense if, by that means, [a bodhisattva] wishes to spiritually tame or train [some individual or individuals], as described previously.

A bodhisattva who, having become angry, does not make mention of the genuine good qualities of others, does not express genuine praise [of others], and does not voice his or her approval of an eloquent statement that is made by another commits an offense and a transgression, and he or she acquires an afflicted offense. [A bodhisattva] who fails to make such statements due to idleness or laziness, or due to lack of mindfulness, acquires an unafflicted offense.
There is no offense if [a bodhisattva] believes that [the praiseworthy individual] is someone who naturally has few desires[810] [and, therefore, he or she does not make such statements] because of the desire to preserve that person’s opinion. There is no offense if [a bodhisattva] is sick and unable [to make such statements]. There is no offense if, by that means, [a bodhisattva] wishes to spiritually tame or train [the praiseworthy individual], etc., as described previously. There is no offense if [a bodhisattva does not make such statements] in observance of a rule of the Sangha. There is no offense if [a bodhisattva] believes that it would be harmful [to make such a statement] as it would cause [that individual] to develop a mental affliction, [such as] conceit[811] or the swelling up[812] [of pride], and so [he or she refrains from making such statements] in order to avoid that [result]. There is no offense if the [person’s apparent] good qualities are counterfeit and not genuine; or if the statements [made by that person] only seem to be excellent but they are not truly excellent. There is no offense if the person is a heretic and someone who ought to be suppressed. There is no offense for [a bodhisattva] who is waiting for the conclusion of the discourse.

A bodhisattva who, having developed an afflicted mind, fails to censure those beings who deserve to be censured, or who censures but fails to correct by means of punishment those who deserve to be punished, or who punishes but fails to banish those who deserve to be banished commits an offense and a transgression, and he or she acquires an afflicted offense. [A bodhisattva] who fails to censure, etc., up to fails to banish, due to idleness and laziness, or due to lack of mindfulness, acquires an unafflicted offense.
There is no offense for [a bodhisattva] who ignores a person who is incorrigible, unfit to be spoken to, difficult to talk to, and very hostile.

These precepts that pertain to the spiritual training of the bodhisattvas were actually spoken by the Blessed One here and there throughout the sutra scriptures and they were set forth in relation to the morality of restraint, the morality of acquiring virtue, and the morality that acts on behalf of beings. A bodhisattva who has gained respect for the precepts that have been collected and presented in this manual on the bodhisattva collection of scriptures should undertake to practice the training [only] after having generated the utmost reverence [for the bodhisattva system of discipline] and after having accepted the discipline from another person with an attitude that is extremely pure in its desire to practice the training, an attitude that [seeks to attain] enlightenment, an attitude that is dedicated to the welfare of sentient beings, and with a [form of] reverence that [is committed to] not violating [any of the precepts] from the very outset.

If a bodhisattva commits an offense that represents an extreme form of defeat on the basis of a great perturbation, his or her moral discipline will be abandoned. [Nevertheless,] it can be received again for a second time.[815] If [a bodhisattva] commits an offense [of the type that represents an extreme form of defeat] on the basis of a middling form of perturbation, he or she should confess this form of wrongdoing before three or more persons. After initially declaring the circumstances [of the offense], [the bodhisattva] should seat him- or herself before [those to whom the confession is to be made] and state the following: “O long-lived ones, please give heed to me. I, who am named so-and-so, in the circumstances that have been declared, have committed an offense that is a form of wrongdoing and [an act] that violates the bodhisattva code of ethics.” The remainder [of the statement of confession] should be expressed in the same manner that a bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī confesses the forms of wrongdoing [that violate the individual liberation code of ethics].[816] It should be understood that confession of an act that represents an extreme form of defeat [and that was performed] on the basis of a lesser form of perturbation, as well as [confession] of all the other [secondary] offenses, should be done before one person. If there is no suitable person before whom [one] can make confession, one should earnestly generate the conviction not to commit [such forms of wrongdoing] again. In the future, one should also observe such restraint. In this way, [a bodhisattva] is said to be raised up from those offenses.

Moreover, regarding the acceptance of the bodhisattva discipline, if no individual possessing the [requisite] good qualities is available, the bodhisattva should then, by him- or herself, accept the discipline of bodhisattva morality before an image of the Tathāgata. This should be done in the following manner. After placing the upper garment on the shoulder, he or she should either place the right knee on the ground or sit in a squatting position and say the following: “I, who am named so-and-so, make a declaration to all the Tathāgatas of the ten directions and [all] the bodhisattvas who have attained the great [ārya] stages. Before them, I accept all of the bodhisattva precepts and all aspects of the bodhisattva morality—[namely,] the morality of restraint, the morality of acquiring virtuous qualities, and the morality of acting on behalf of sentient beings—with regard to which all the bodhisattvas of the past have trained themselves, all the bodhisattvas of the future will train themselves, and all the bodhisattvas of the present are now training themselves throughout the ten directions.” This should be repeated a second and a third time. After making this recitation, [the bodhisattva] should stand up. It should be understood that the remainder [of the ritual] in its entirety is the same as was described previously.

As relates to the bodhisattva’s manner of [committing] offenses, there is no offense that is beyond remediation.[817] Moreover, concerning the declaration made by the Blessed One that, “It should be understood that a bodhisattva’s offenses are for the most part brought forth by hatred; they are not brought forth by desire,” the intent [of this statement] should be understood as follows. Any and all actions that a bodhisattva carries out due to his or her attachment to sentient beings—[which is to say,] one that is due to his or her affection for sentient beings—are proper for a bodhisattva to do; they are not improper for him or her to do. Nor would it be fitting for someone who is doing what is proper to incur an offense. However, a bodhisattva who feels anger toward sentient beings does not act in a way that benefits either him- or herself or others. Nor is that something that is proper for a bodhisattva to do. Thus, it is fitting that someone who is doing what is improper should incur an offense.
The lesser, middling, and great offenses of a bodhisattva should be understood as [they are explained] in the Collection on [Canonical] Topics.[818]

When [a bodhisattva] is one who has gone forth [into the life of a homeless ascetic] with the aim of pursuing Dharma and not with the aim of gaining an [easy] livelihood, when he or she is one who longs for great enlightenment and not one who fails to long for it, when he or she is one who longs for asceticism[820] and nirvana and not one who fails to long for them, and when [a bodhisattva] who possesses such forms of [spiritual] longing does not abide continuously as one who is lazy, one whose effort is inferior, one who lacks effort, and one who is filled with evil, nonvirtuous qualities that are afflicted, that promote [samsaric] rebirth, that are related to the fevers,[821] that have a painful ripening, and that bring about birth, old age, and death in the future, this is referred to as “excellence of attitude.”

What is excellence of a former cause?
For example, when a bodhisattva has previously—[that is,] in former lives—carried out meritorious acts and virtuous acts by reason of which he or she is not currently distressed by [a lack of] robes, food, seats, bedding, medicine for curing the ill, and [other] personal belongings, and he or she is also able to share them with others, this should be known as a bodhisattva’s excellence of a former cause.
A bodhisattva who possesses these three forms of excellence and who is engaged in the training that relates to the [Great Vehicle’s] code of ethics abides continuously in a contented state. It should be understood that [a bodhisattva] who possesses the three forms of misfortune that are the opposite of those [forms of excellence] abides continuously in a discontented state.
This [topic], then, which has been presented in both a succinct and an extensive manner, is referred to as the “all-inclusive morality” of a bodhisattva. It relates both to the faction that is made up of householders and to the faction that is made up of those who have gone forth [into the homeless state]. Furthermore, the remaining [topics—namely,] the morality that is difficult to carry out, etc.—should be understood as subdivisions of this very [category of] all-inclusive morality.

Regarding [the remaining categories], what is the morality of a bodhisattva that is difficult to carry out?
It should be regarded as being of three types. When a bodhisattva who possesses great wealth and who has great authority and power gives up his or her wealth and gives up his or her great authority and power and accepts the discipline of [bodhisattva] morality, this is called “the morality of a bodhisattva that is difficult to carry out.”
Also, when a bodhisattva who has accepted the morality has fallen into distress and is losing his or her life but refuses even to damage the acceptance of morality, much less to cause its destruction, this is a second form of what is called “the morality of a bodhisattva that is difficult to carry out.”
When a bodhisattva is so attentive and his or her recollection remains so closely placed with regard to all the forms of attention that pertain both to moving about and meditative practice[822] that during his or her entire lifetime he or she does not acquire even a minor offense and commits no error in relation to the morality, much less a weighty [offense], this is a third form of what is called “the morality of a bodhisattva that is difficult to carry out.”

What is the morality of a bodhisattva that is directed everywhere?
It should be regarded as being of four types: (1) [the morality] that is accepted, (2) natural morality, (3) [the morality] that has been practiced repeatedly, and (4) [the morality] that is accompanied by means.
Regarding these, the morality that is accepted is the threefold acceptance of the discipline of bodhisattva morality—namely, [the acceptance of] the morality of restraint, the morality of acquiring virtue, and the morality of acting on behalf of sentient beings.
Regarding this [topic], natural morality is [the form of morality] that is possessed by a bodhisattva who abides in the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage and who carries out pure deeds of body, speech, and mind due to the natural goodness of his or her mind continuum.
Regarding this [topic], the morality that has been practiced repeatedly is the threefold morality that has already been explained and that a bodhisattva has carried out previously—[that is,] in former lives. Through having generated the strength of this former cause, he or she does not delight in any kind of evil conduct whatsoever, recoils from evil, delights in virtuous conduct, and desires [to engage in] virtuous conduct.
Regarding this [topic], the morality that is accompanied by means is a bodhisattva’s [form of morality] that relies upon the four principles for attracting a following to carry out virtuous deeds of body and speech on behalf of sentient beings.

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s morality of every form?
It should be understood as the thirteen forms [that result from] combining together six forms and seven forms. They are [that a bodhisattva’s morality is] (1) abundant because it is dedicated to great enlightenment and because it includes extensive precepts; (2) it is irreproachable and (3) rests in a state of joy because it avoids the two extremes of indulging in sense pleasures and engaging in self-mortification; (4) it is uninterrupted because the training is not given up for as long as one lives; (5) it is firm because it is not capable of being overcome or taken away by any form of gain, honor, false teacher, or the root and secondary mental afflictions; and (6) it possesses the ornament of morality. The ornament of morality should be understood as it is described in The Stage of a Listener.[824] [A bodhisattva’s morality] is also (1) a morality of cessation [of bad actions], in that it gives up the taking of life, etc.; (2) it is a morality of performance [of good actions], in that it acquires virtue and acts on behalf of sentient beings; (3) it is a morality of preservation, in that it safeguards the morality of cessation and performance; and it is also (4) a morality that brings about the ripening of the marks of a great person,[825] (5) a morality that brings about the ripening of [the training of] superior concentration, (6) a morality that brings about the ripening of a desirable migratory state, and (7) a morality that brings about the ripening of the welfare of sentient beings.

What is the morality of a bodhisattva that relates to the distressed and what they want?
It should be understood to be eightfold. Here a bodhisattva him- or herself reflects in the following manner: “I am one who does not want anyone to deprive me of my life, who does not want anyone to take anything of mine that was not given, who does not want anyone to engage in sexual misconduct with me, who does not want anyone to lie to me, engage in divisive speech about me, or express harsh speech or idle speech to me, and who does not want anyone to inflict undesirable and injurious forms of [physical] contact on me—such as the [physical] contact of [being struck by] a hand, a clod of earth, or a whip. If others should carry out against me the opposite of what I want, that would cause me to become distressed and it would be unpleasant for me. Other persons are just like me in that they also do not want anyone to deprive them of their lives, etc., up to they do not want anyone to inflict undesirable and injurious forms of [physical] contact on them. If I were to carry out against them the opposite of what they want, that would cause them to be distressed and it would be unpleasant for them.” When [a bodhisattva], after making the determination, “How could I commit against others that which is so unpleasant both for myself and others?” avoids committing against others any of these eight unwanted things, even to save his or her life, this is the [type of] morality that consists of eight aspects and is called “the bodhisattva’s morality that relates to the distressed and what they want.”

Regarding this [topic], what is the morality of a bodhisattva that brings happiness here and in the next world?
It should be regarded as being ninefold. (1) Here a bodhisattva forbids [sentient beings from acting in] those situations that are forbidden to sentient beings. (2) He or she urges [sentient beings to act in] those situations that are recommended. (3) He or she draws [to the Dharma] those beings who are worthy of being drawn. (4) He or she suppresses those beings who need to be suppressed. The pure deeds of body and speech that are engaged in by a bodhisattva in relation to [these four situations] constitute the first four forms of this type of morality. In addition, there are five more forms: (5) the morality that accompanies generosity, (6) [the morality] that accompanies patience, (7) [the morality] that accompanies effort, (8) [the morality] that accompanies meditative absorption, and (9) [the morality] that accompanies wisdom. When [all of] these are combined into a single group, they make up a [type of] morality that consists of nine aspects. [This type of morality] is conducive to happiness in this life and in future lives, both for the bodhisattva [who performs it] and for [those] others [in relation to whom it is performed]; therefore, it is called “[the morality that] brings happiness here and in the next world.”

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s pure morality?
It should be understood as being tenfold. (1) At the very outset, [a bodhisattva’s morality] is adopted properly—that is, out of a desire [to pursue] asceticism and [achieve] complete enlightenment, not for the purpose of securing a livelihood. (2a) It is not overly slack, because [all forms of] faint regret[826] with regard to [committing] transgressions are absent. (2b) It is not carried too far,[827] because [all forms of] unwarranted regret are absent. (3) It is free of laziness, because the ease of sleep, lying on one’s side, and reclining [at inappropriate times] are avoided and strong effort is exerted day and night toward [everything] that pertains to virtue. (4) It is embraced by mindfulness through cultivating the five limbs of mindfulness that were described earlier. (5) It is dedicated correctly, because desire for gain and honor are absent and because [the practitioner] does not agree to abide in a pure spiritual life after having dedicated him- or herself to [the attainment of] a [worldly] god’s status. (6) It is embraced by excellence of conduct, because [the four modes of] physical behavior,[828] regular activities,[829] and practices that pertain to virtue[830] are engaged in with physical and verbal conduct that is most excellent and exemplary. (7) It is embraced by excellence of livelihood, because it has abandoned the fault of carrying out [any of the] wrong forms of livelihood, such as hypocrisy, etc. (8) It has abandoned the two extremes, because it has abandoned the practices of indulging in sense pleasures and engaging in self-mortification. (9) It leads to deliverance because it has abandoned all forms of heretical views. (10) The [pure] morality of bodhisattvas is one whose acceptance has not become ruined, because it has not been damaged or destroyed. This [type of] the bodhisattvas’ morality, which is made up of ten aspects, is one that is referred to as “pure.”

It should be understood that all of the morality that has been explained here, with its nine aspects of essential morality, etc., is contained within the three types of morality—that is, the morality of restraint, the moral ity of acquiring virtuous qualities, and the morality of acting on behalf of sentient beings. Moreover, this threefold morality accomplishes, in brief, three actions for a bodhisattva. The morality of restraint promotes [the attainment of the levels of] mental stability.[831] [The morality] of acquiring virtuous qualities promotes the ripening of a buddha’s qualities in oneself. The morality of acting on behalf of sentient beings promotes the [spiritual] ripening of sentient beings [other than oneself]. [These actions] constitute the full extent of everything that a bodhisattva needs to accomplish. That is to say, mental stability is [needed] for one to abide in a state of ease in this life, and a person whose body and mind are not weary [is able] to ripen a buddha’s qualities [in him- or herself] and [is able] to ripen [other] sentient beings. This is the [full] extent of a bodhisattva’s morality. This is the [full] extent of the benefits of a bodhisattva’s morality. This is the [full] extent of what a bodhisattva’s morality needs to accomplish. There is nothing of greater significance than this and nothing besides this. [These are the aims] with regard to which the bodhisattvas of the past, present, and future—those who were, are, and shall be desirous of achieving great enlightenment—have trained themselves, are training themselves, and shall train themselves throughout the limitless world spheres that lie in the ten directions.

Regarding this [topic], what is the essence of a bodhisattva’s patience?
In brief, the essence of patience should be understood as consisting of the forbearance of harm caused by others, both the forbearance of everyone[832] and the forbearance of everything,[833] by relying upon the strength [that is gained by] careful consideration[834] or [a form of forbearance which occurs] naturally,[835] as well as a forbearance [that is accompanied] by a mind that is free of corporeal desire[836] and by a [form of] compassion that is absolute.[837]

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s all-inclusive patience?
It should be regarded as being of two types: (1) [the patience] that relates to the faction that is made up of householders and (2) [the patience] that relates to the faction that is made up of those who have gone forth [into the homeless state]. [The patience] that relates to both factions should be understood as being of three types: (1) the patience that forbears the harm that is inflicted by others,[838] (2) the patience that tolerates suffering,[839] and (3) the patience of the conviction [that is gained by] reflecting upon entities.[840]

Here a bodhisattva rightly learns[841] the following [four points] in relation to intense, continuous, varied, and long-lasting suffering that is being directly experienced and that has arisen from harm inflicted by others. (1) “This [suffering] is the fault of my own karma, because this suffering that I am experiencing is the result of nonvirtuous deeds that I myself carried out.” (2) “It is equally true that I do not want suffering[842] and that this impatience represents a cause that will bring me suffering again in the future. If I continue to take up this attitude that is a cause of [future] suffering, by doing so it will certainly be true that I alone am bringing upon myself the very thing that I wish to avoid. Therefore, it will be a case in which I have inflicted harm upon myself and not [one in which the harm was inflicted] by others.” (3) “It is also the case that, by their very nature, all formations[843]—both those of my own mental continuum and those of others’ [mental continua]—have a basic condition that consists of suffering. Others who create additional suffering for us, whose basic condition is one that consists of suffering, may well do so because they are unaware of this [fact]. However, it would be unseemly for those of us who are aware [of this fact] to create more suffering for others whose basic condition is also one that consists of suffering.” (4) “Moreover, if it is improper for those listeners who are devoted to their own welfare [to develop] the impatience that creates suffering for oneself and others, then how much more should this be true for those of us who are devoted to the welfare of others.”

How does a bodhisattva meditate on the conception that conforms to [the condition of others being a] mere [collection of] entities, in relation to those beings who have harmed him or her?
Here a bodhisattva rightly learns the following: “This [person] is someone who is subject to causal conditions. He or she is a mere [collection of] formations. He or she is a mere [collection of] entities. There is no self here of any kind, no [real] sentient being, no [real] living being, no [real] person that has taken birth who could scold [someone], who could anger [someone], who could beat [someone], who could speak abusively [to someone], and who could criticize [someone], or who could be scolded, who could be angered, who could be beaten, who could be spoken to abusively, and who could be criticized.” For [a bodhisattva] who cultivates proper attention in this way, the notion of [someone] being a [real] sentient being will disappear and the notion of [him or her] being a mere [collection of] entities will remain.

How does a bodhisattva meditate on the conception of impermanence in relation to those beings who have harmed him or her?
Here a bodhisattva rightly learns the following: “Any and all sentient beings who have been born and currently exist are impermanent and subject to death. Moreover, this is the ultimate form of retribution—that is to say, the [individual’s] life will come to be extinguished. In addition, it is certainly improper for a knowledgeable person even to develop an agitated[846] state of mind toward those impermanent sentient beings who are naturally subject to death, let alone to strike them with the hand, or with a clod of earth or a club, much less to deprive them completely of their life.” For [a bodhisattva] who cultivates proper attention in this way, the notion of [all beings] being permanent and substantial will disappear and the conception of [their] being impermanent and insubstantial will remain. By relying on this conception of [others] being impermanent and insubstantial, [a bodhisattva] forbears and endures all the harms [that are done to him or her].

How does a bodhisattva meditate on the conception of suffering in relation to those beings who have harmed him or her?
Here a bodhisattva perceives that even those sentient beings who live in a state of great prosperity are closely bound to the three forms of suffering[847]—the suffering of conditioned existence, the suffering of change, and the suffering of suffering—not to mention those [sentient beings] who are abiding in a state of misfortune. Perceiving this, he or she rightly learns the following. “I should be striving to remove the suffering of those beings who are always undergoing suffering in this way; [I should] not [be striving] to cause them suffering.” For [a bodhisattva] who cultivates proper attention in this way, the notion [that there is any genuine form] of happiness [in samsara] will be relinquished and the conception of suffering will arise. By relying on this conception of suffering, [a bodhisattva] forbears and endures all the harms that are done [to him or her] by others.

How does a bodhisattva meditate on the conception of embracing those beings who have harmed him or her?
Here a bodhisattva rightly learns the following. “Now in generating the mind [that aspires] to [attain] enlightenment, I have embraced all sentient beings in the manner that a spouse[848] [is embraced] and I have pledged to accomplish what is beneficial for all sentient beings. Therefore, having declared, ‘I shall do what is beneficial as relates to all sentient beings,’ it would be unseemly for me to do something injurious [to a particular sentient being because] I was unable to endure the harm [inflicted by him or her].” For [a bodhisattva] who cultivates proper attention in this way, the notion of being a foe that is held toward those sentient beings who harm him or her will be relinquished and the conception of embracing them will arise. By relying on this conception of embracing [sentient beings], [a bodhisattva] forbears and endures all the harms that are done [to him or her] by others.

What is a bodhisattva’s patience that tolerates suffering?
Here a bodhisattva rightly learns the following: “Formerly, as a person who engaged in the enjoyment of sense pleasures and who pursued those pleasures, I accepted, tolerated, and experienced a multitude of intense forms of suffering as I engaged in [such occupations as] farming, commerce, and service to the king, for the sake of sense pleasures whose [true] nature consists of suffering, knowing full well that [those occupations] would be a cause of suffering [to me]. My willing acceptance of that meaningless great suffering for the sake of what [actually] consists of nothing but suffering was due to the fault of a lack of understanding. However, now, with the recognition that I am pursuing a virtuous activity that will bring about [genuine] happiness, it would be proper for me to willingly tolerate suffering that is a trillion times greater than that [former suffering], let alone some smaller form of suffering.”
A bodhisattva who is pursuing enlightenment and who is cultivating proper attention in this way tolerates the suffering that occurs in all situations.

There are four supports[850] that are relied upon in order to go forth and achieve full ordination into the state of a bhikṣu or bhikṣuṇī within this well-proclaimed [spiritual system of] Dharma and Vinaya, namely, (1) monastic robes, (2) alms food, (3) beds and seats, and (4) medicine for curing the ill and [other permitted] personal belongings. A bodhisattva does not experience distress[851] or become discouraged when poor forms of these [supports] are acquired, when they are acquired in small quantity, when they are provided in a disrespectful manner, or when they are acquired only after some delay. Nor does he or she, due to any of these causes, relax his or her effort. This is the manner in which [a bodhisattva] tolerates the suffering that is based upon the supports [of a spiritual life].

There are seven forms of embracing[853] the Dharma: (1) honoring and serving the Three Jewels; (2) honoring and serving those who are venerable; (3) taking up[854] Dharma [teachings]; (4) teaching others extensively [the Dharma teachings] that one has taken up; (5) reciting [sacred texts] aloud and at length; (6) correctly reflecting upon, pondering, and closely investigating [the meaning of Dharma teachings], alone and having gone to a secluded place; and (7) meditating upon forms of quiescence and insight that are supported by forms of attention that relate to mental application. The suffering that arises for a bodhisattva who is striving in relation to these seven forms of embracing the Dharma is also something that he or she tolerates and that does not cause him or her to relax effort.

It should also be understood that there are seven aspects[855] to a mendicant’s way of life: (1) acceptance of an unattractive physical appearance, through having abandoned the marks of a householder by such actions as shaving the head and face; (2) acceptance of unattractive outer appearance,[856] through wearing clothing that is patched and has an unattractive color; (3) undertaking a distinct [form of] behavior, through abiding in a state of restraint as relates to all worldly conduct; (4) relying upon others for one’s livelihood, through [adopting] the practice of one who has abandoned all occupations such as agriculture, etc., and who sustains him- or herself with what is received from others; (4) seeking monastic robes, etc., from others for as long as one lives, by [adopting the principle of] not using things that were acquired and then hoarded; (5) abstaining from the human activities of [indulging in] sensory pleasures for as long as one lives, through turning away from a noncelibate life and sexual intercourse; and abstaining from the human activities [of pursuing activities of] pleasure and amusement for as long as one lives, through (6) refraining from attending [performances by] actors, dancers, comedians, and female dancers, etc., as well as through (7) refraining from [behavior that involves] laughing, playing, delighting, and amusing oneself in the company of friends, favorably disposed acquaintances, and lifelong companions. A bodhisattva also tolerates the suffering that arises in relation to a mendicant’s way of life that is tightly bound by these kinds of austerities, and he or she does not relax effort because of them.

For homeless ascetics, regular activities are those [that relate to] monastic robes, alms bowl, etc.[858] By contrast, for householders, they are those that relate to the correct pursuit of [such occupations as] agriculture, commerce, service to the king, etc. A bodhisattva also accepts the suffering that is caused by these [activities]; however, he or she does not relax effort because of [the suffering that is caused by] them.
No matter what kind of suffering may occur, a bodhisattva [steadfastly] applies him- or herself to [the pursuit of] complete and unsurpassed enlightenment; he or she does not fail to apply him- or herself. And having done so, he or she does not turn away [from that pursuit]. He or she remains unperplexed and maintains a trouble-free mind while applying him- or herself. This is what is called [a bodhisattva’s] tolerance of suffering.

<d e="2">
What is a bodhisattva’s patience of the devotion [that is gained by] reflecting upon entities?
Here, by means of [a form of] understanding that derives from having thoroughly examined entities using correct discernment,[859] a bodhisattva’s devotion becomes well and deeply absorbed in relation to eight objects of devotion: (1) the virtuous qualities of the [Three] Jewels, (2) the nature of reality, (3) the great powers of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, (4) causes,[860] (5) results,[861] (6) the goal that is to be achieved for oneself, (7) the means of achieving that goal, and (8) the field of that which needs to be known.[862]
Moreover, this devotion becomes well and deeply absorbed [in those objects] on the basis of two causes: (1) through repeated practice over a long period of time and (2) through the attainment of perfectly pure knowledge.
This [explanation] constitutes the bodhisattvas’ all-inclusive patience that relates to the two groups [of individuals, householders and homeless ascetics,] and it should be understood that [this category] forms the basis for [all the other] extensive categories [of patience], such as the patience that is difficult to carry out, etc.

What is a bodhisattva’s patience of a true spiritual being?
It should be regarded as being of five types. Here a bodhisattva, from the very outset, regards patience as advantageous. He or she regards it as advantageous in the following ways: (1) in the future, a patient person will not have many enemies; (2) he or she will not frequently experience becoming estranged [from friends]; (3) he or she will experience much comfort and ease of mind; (4) he or she will not pass away in a state of regret; and, (5) following the dissolution of the body, he or she will be reborn in a happy migratory state—[that is,] in the celestial realms among the gods.[863]
[A bodhisattva] is patient and also establishes others in patience. He or she extols patience [to others]. Upon seeing a person who possesses patience, [a bodhisattva] becomes happy and gives rise to joy.

<d e="2">
What is a bodhisattva’s patience of every form?
It should be understood as the thirteen forms [that result from] combining together six forms and seven forms. (1) Here a bodhisattva develops patience due to the fear [that arises from] having realized the undesirable maturations of impatience. (2) [A bodhisattva] who possesses a sympathetic mind and a compassionate mind and an affectionate mind toward sentient beings also develops patience due to affection. (3) [A bodhisattva] who has an intense aspiration to [attain] unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment and who is desirous of completing the perfection of patience also develops patience due to [its being] a productive cause.[864] (4) The Blessed One also referred to those who have gone forth [into the homeless state] as “the ones who possess the strength of patience.” Accordingly, because impatience is not a befitting trait for one who has gone forth and who has accepted the [bodhisattva] morality, [a bodhisattva] also develops patience based upon [the principle of] taking up what is right.[865]

(5) By abiding in and being firmly established in the excellence of his or her spiritual lineage and his or her prior repeated practice of patience, [a bodhisattva] also develops patience naturally. (6) Having realized that all entities are devoid of a [real] sentient being, [a bodhisattva] who has perceived the ineffable [reality that sentient beings are a] mere [collection of] entities also develops patience through his or her meditation upon entities. (7) [A bodhisattva] develops patience with regard to every kind of harm. (8) [A bodhisattva] also develops patience with regard to everyone.[866] (9) [A bodhisattva] also develops patience everywhere, whether [he or she is] in an isolated place or in the presence of a great number of people. (10) [A bodhisattva] develops patience at all times—[that is,] during the morning, the middle of the day, and the evening; during the day as well as during the night; with regard to the past, present, and future; both when he or she is sick and when he or she is well; and [also does so] both when he or she is in a fallen state and when he or she is in an elevated state. (11) [A bodhisattva] develops patience with his or her body, by refraining from striking [others]. (12) [A bodhisattva] also develops patience with his or her speech, by refraining from expressing unpleasant speech. (13) And [a bodhisattva] also develops patience with his or her mind, by not becoming angered and by not remaining in an agitated[867] state of mind.

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s patience that relates to the distressed and what they want?
It should be regarded as being of eight types: (1) the patience [that endures] the inconvenience of being approached by beggars who are suffering; (2) the patience that refrains from developing hostility toward violent persons who commit great evil deeds, by relying upon the Dharma and great compassion; and (3) the patience that refrains from developing hostility toward those homeless ascetics who engage in misconduct, by relying upon the Dharma and great compassion.
[This form of patience] also [consists of] five aspects of patience that constitute the ability to endure [putting forth] strenuous exertion. [They are] the ability to endure [putting forth] strenuous exertion (4) in connection with striving to eliminate the suffering of those beings who are experiencing suffering; (5) in connection with seeking Dharma teachings; (6) [in connection with] being a person who is engaging in the form of practice that accords with Dharma;[868] (7) [in connection with] explaining in detail those very same Dharma teachings to others; and (8) in connection with correctly assisting beings with their activities and the things that need to be done.
This [category] is called “the eightfold patience that relates to the distressed and what they want” because it is the [form of] patience that both removes those [conditions] that cause sentient beings to be distressed and provides [sentient beings] with the things that they want.

<d e="2">
What is a bodhisattva’s patience that brings happiness here and in the next world?
It should be regarded as being of nine types. Here a bodhisattva is patient (1) as he or she abides in a state of mindfulness with regard to virtuous activities. He or she is patient with regard to (2) cold, (3) heat, (4) hunger and thirst, (5) being bitten by gadflies, (6) being bitten by mosquitoes, (7) the wind and the sun, and (8) being bitten by snakes [and other creeping animals]. He or she is patient with regard to (9) the fatigue and weariness of body and mind that arise from exertion. [All of these forms of patience are] accompanied by sympathy for sentient beings, who are tormented by the suffering of birth, old age, sickness, and death, etc., [as they roam continuously] throughout samsara.
The bodhisattva who is patient in these ways will abide in a state of ease in that same life, and he or she [will do so] without becoming contaminated by evil, nonvirtuous qualities. In future lives, he or she will also be intent on taking up the causes of happiness. He or she will also be one who is dedicated to achieving the happiness of others in both their present lives and their future lives. Therefore, this is referred to as “the patience that brings happiness here and in the next world.”

What is a bodhisattva’s pure patience?
It should be regarded as being of ten types. Here a bodhisattva who is the recipient of harm, distress, or wrongdoing from others (1) does not harm [them] in return, (2) does not develop an angry mind, and (3) does not harbor the attitude of being their adversary. (4) Just as he or she was before [being harmed], [a bodhisattva] remains disposed to providing assistance after [being harmed]; he or she does not abandon doing acts of assistance for the person who harmed [him or her].[869] (5) [A bodhisattva] offers a conciliatory statement to those who committed harmful acts [against him or her]. (6) [A bodhisattva] does not, after having caused [someone] to be disturbed, receive an apology from him or her while thinking, “Let [this person] be disturbed.” (7) Regarding the impatience [that might occur] under those very conditions, [a bodhisattva] develops strong shame and abashment.[870] (8) Regarding patience, [a bodhisattva] develops strong affection and reverence toward the Master. (9) Regarding the avoidance of harm toward sentient beings, [a bodhisattva] develops a strong feeling of compassion toward sentient beings. (10) Alternatively, [a bodhisattva] becomes free of attachment for the desire realm after having abandoned completely the qualities that support impatience.[871] It should be understood that these ten aspects cause a bodhisattva’s patience to be pure and free of stains.
By relying upon the patience that begins with the essential nature of patience and ends with pure patience, [a form of practice that is] extensive and immeasurable and [that] gives rise to the fruit of great enlightenment, a bodhisattva attains unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment.

Regarding this [topic], here is [a description of] a bodhisattva’s armor-like effort. By initiating effort beforehand, a bodhisattva here dons the armor that accompanies mental exertion [when he or she reflects] in the following manner: “Even if I had to remain exclusively in the hells and not in any other migratory state for days and nights that last for a thousand great kalpas in order to liberate even a single sentient being from [his or her] suffering, and it took me one trillion times as long to arrive at unsurpassed and complete enlightenment as it does for [other] bodhisattvas[874] to attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment, I would still [continue to] exert myself. I would not give up striving for unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment. I would not give up the effort I had undertaken. How much more would this be true [if I only had to strive] for a much shorter period of time and [I only had to endure] a much smaller amount of suffering.” This kind [of unwavering determination] is what constitutes a bodhisattva’s armor-like effort.
A bodhisattva who even generates mere devotion and mere reverence for such armor-like effort of bodhisattvas is a resolute bodhisattva and he or she nourishes the constituent element[875] of the immeasurable effort that is exerted for the sake of enlightenment. How much more would this be true for a bodhisattva who actually achieves this kind of armor-like effort. Moreover, for such a bodhisattva there is no arduous deed whatsoever that needs to be done for the sake of enlightenment or [that needs to be done] on behalf of sentient beings with regard to which this bodhisattva would become fainthearted or that he or she would consider too difficult to accomplish.

Moreover, this [form of effort], in brief, should be understood as being of seven types: (1) It is unshakable in that it cannot be moved [from its place] by any thought, false notion,[876] [root] mental affliction, secondary mental affliction, verbal challenge from another person, or painful experience. (2) It is strong in that it is applied zealously. (3) It is immeasurable in that it is dedicated to the attainment of complete knowledge regarding all the branches of learning. (4) It is accompanied by [proper] means both in the sense that it follows the unerring path to [any] aim that is worthy of being achieved and in the sense that it has attained a state of equanimity.[877] (5) It is right effort in the sense that it is dedicated to the attainment of aims that are both meaningful and worthy of being achieved. (6) It is prolonged in the sense that it is applied continuously. (7) It is free of pride in the sense that one does not become swollen with pride because of having initiated effort. With these seven aspects, the practice of initiating effort in order to collect virtuous qualities promotes the swift completion of the bodhisattvas’ perfections and the [swift] attainment of unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment. In addition, because effort alone is the principal and most excellent cause for attaining all the virtuous qualities that bring about enlightenment and nothing else is comparable to it, the tathāgatas point to effort when they are pointing out [what is needed] for [the attainment of] unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment.

What is a bodhisattva’s effort that is difficult to carry out?
It should be regarded as being of three types. [The quality by means of] which a bodhisattva remains engaged in meditation upon virtuous qualities uninterruptedly and continually without forming any notion[879] of monastic robes, alms food, a bed and seat, or a self [should be understood as] the first form of a bodhisattva’s effort that is difficult to carry out. Moreover, [while exerting him- or herself] with this form of effort, [the quality by means of which] a bodhisattva remains engaged at all times [in the practice of virtuous qualities] until his or her class affiliate has been abandoned[880] [should be understood as] the second form of a bodhisattva’s effort that is difficult to carry out. In addition, [the quality by means of which] a bodhisattva gains a [form of] effort that is accompanied by the attribute of having attained equanimity[881] and [therefore] is neither overly listless nor overly energetic, and that it is directed toward an unerring object, should be understood as the third form of a bodhisattva’s effort that is difficult to carry out. Now then, it should be understood that compassion toward sentient beings and wisdom are the acquiring causes[882] [by means of which] bodhisattvas [obtain] the strength that relates to the effort that is difficult to carry out.

What is a bodhisattva’s effort that is directed everywhere?
It should be regarded as being of four types: (1) that which avoids afflicted qualities; (2) that which gains possession of pure qualities; (3) that which refines deeds; and (4) that which increases knowledge. Concerning this [topic], a bodhisattva’s effort that avoids afflicted qualities is [the form of effort that strives] to prevent the arising of those fetters,[883] bonds,[884] latencies,[885] secondary mental afflictions,[886] and perturbations[887] that have not yet arisen and to abandon those that have arisen. Concerning this [topic], a bodhisattva’s effort that gains possession of pure qualities is [the form of effort that strives] to generate those virtuous entities that have not yet arisen and to maintain [possession of], avoid indistinctness about, and increase and augment those [virtuous entities] that have arisen. Concerning this [topic], a bodhisattva’s effort that refines deeds is [the form of effort that strives] to refine and collect the three types of deeds—that is, the virtuous deeds of body, speech, and mind. Concerning this [topic], the form of a bodhisattva’s effort that increases knowledge [is the form of effort that] promotes the attainment and development of the forms of wisdom that derive from learning, reflection, and meditation.

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s effort of every form?
It should be understood as the thirteen forms [of effort that result from] combining together six forms and seven forms. [The first six are] (1) continuous effort, in that it is practiced at all times; (2) zealous effort, in that it is applied earnestly;[889] (3) effort that is a natural consequence, in that it is generated on the strength of being caused by a former effort; (4) effective[890] effort, in that it is applied to [everything] that pertains to virtue after having made careful consideration; (5) imperturbable effort, in that it cannot be disturbed by any painful experience and because it has attained the quality of being unalterable; and (6) insatiable effort, in that it is not satisfied by merely attaining distinctive qualities that are small or insignificant. These six types of the effort of every form cause a bodhisattva who possesses them to be described in relation to virtuous qualities as “one who has taken hold of effort,” “one who possesses strength,” “one who possesses vigor,” “one who is energetic,” “one whose courage is firm,” and “one whose obligation has not been relinquished.”[891]

In addition, [the remaining] seven types [of a bodhisattva’s effort of every form are as follows]: (1) A bodhisattva’s effort is one that is accompanied by aspiration in that it is strengthened by repeated and fervent aspiration for and dedication to unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment. (2) A bodhisattva’s effort that is endowed with equipoise is [the effort] of one who remains unperturbed by keeping his or her mind from becoming afflicted by any of the root or mental afflictions [and] it is a [form of] effort by means of which a bodhisattva becomes one who abides in [a state of] equal suitability toward [all] virtuous qualities. (3) A bodhisattva’s exceptional effort is that which, in order to abandon any secondary mental affliction that may have afflicted and perturbed his or her mind, resembles the effort of a person whose head has caught fire to put out the flames. (4) A bodhisattva’s effort is one that seeks in that it pursues all the branches of learning. (5) A bodhisattva’s effort is one that pertains to the training in that it accomplishes the practice that accords with the Dharma, suitably and appropriately, with regard to those very qualities that are being sought. (6) A bodhisattva’s effort that accomplishes the aims of others should be understood as being of eleven types in the manner that was described earlier. (7) A bodhisattva’s seventh [form of] effort [strives] to safeguard his or her own correct practice and to counteract his or her errors in a manner that accords with Dharma. These thirteen types of a bodhisattva’s effort are called “the effort of every form.”

<d e="2">
What is a bodhisattva’s pure effort?
In brief, it should be understood as being of ten types. [They are effort that is] (1) appropriate, (2) experienced, (3) free of laxness, and (4) well informed; (5) [effort in which] the practice is applied according to the occasion; and [effort that is] (6) accompanied by the perception of signs, (7) free of dejection, (8) not deficient, (9) balanced, and (10) dedicated to great enlightenment.
Whichever one of the secondary mental afflictions greatly distresses a bodhisattva here, he or she cultivates the appropriate antidote for that secondary mental affliction in order to abandon it. One meditates on unattractiveness as the antidote for attachment to sense pleasures. [One meditates] on loving-kindness as the antidote for malice. One meditates on the principles of conditionality [taught in the doctrine of] dependent origination as an antidote for ignorance. One meditates on recollection of the breath as an antidote for discursive thoughts. One meditates on the diversity of the constituents[892] as an antidote for pride. This kind [of effort] is called a bodhisattva’s “appropriate effort.”

</d>
<d e="2">
Here a bodhisattva does not possess the effort of a novice and a beginning practitioner—that is, [when striving] to fix the mind upon the instruction and counsel. He or she [strives] in no other way than as one who has repeatedly practiced the application and one who has become familiar with the application. This [type of effort] is called a bodhisattva’s “experienced effort.”

<d e="2">
A bodhisattva also is not one who has finished repeatedly practicing the application that relates to fixing his or her mind upon the instruction and upon counsel. Rather, the bodhisattva is [one who resembles] a novice whose application is free of laxness with regard to this [form of] application in the sense that one applies oneself continuously and zealously. This [type of effort] is called a bodhisattva’s “effort that is free of laxness.”

Moreover, [a bodhisattva] initiates effort in order to fix his or her mind by means of an unerring form of understanding, whether it is [gained] from venerable beings or due to the bodhisattva’s own kindling of the strength of extensive learning. This [type of effort] is called a bodhisattva’s “well-informed effort.”

<d e="2">
Moreover, the bodhisattva who possesses such an unerring understanding meditates on quiescence at a time [when the goal is to develop] quiescence, takes hold of the mind at a time [when the goal is to develop the quality of] retention,[893] and meditates on equanimity[894] at a time [when the goal is to maintain] equanimity. This [type of effort] is called [a bodhisattva’s] “effort that is applied according to the occasion.”

Moreover, having heard the most extensive, most profound, inconceivably great, and immeasurable instructions on the undertaking of effort that is carried out by bodhisattvas, a bodhisattva does not disparage him- or herself, does not become disheartened, and is not satisfied merely by attaining a small or insignificant distinctive quality. He or she does not strive for something that is not superior. This [type of effort] is called a bodhisattva’s “effort that is free of dejection.”

Moreover, regularly and at the appropriate time, a bodhisattva takes up and attends to [the practices of] guarding the doors of the senses, observing moderation with regard to food, maintaining wakefulness during the first and last parts of the night, remaining vigilant, and other similar forms of the requisites for one-pointed concentration.[895] He or she also applies him- or herself to them zealously. He or she initiates an unerring exertion that is directed toward a [genuine] aim in all situations. This [type of effort] is called a bodhisattva’s “effort that is not deficient.”

Regarding this [topic], what is the essence of a bodhisattva’s meditative absorption?
It is a virtuous one-pointedness of mind that is possessed by bodhisattvas and is preceded by listening to and reflecting upon the collection of bodhisattva scriptures. It can be either mundane[896] or transcendent[897] in nature. [Moreover,] it is a state of mental stability that pertains to quiescence, insight, or both of them in that it constitutes a path in which the two [forms of meditation] are practiced in combination. This should be understood as the essence of the meditative absorption[898] that is practiced by bodhisattvas.

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s meditative absorption that is difficult to carry out?
It should be regarded as being of three types. Having dwelt in extensive, manifold states of meditative absorption which they have attained and to which they have become well accustomed, bodhisattvas voluntarily turn away from the supreme ease of those meditative absorptions and, [motivated] by sympathy toward [all] sentient beings, carefully consider the [kinds of] extensive actions [that will accomplish] the aims of sentient beings. Then, remaining vigilant about the spiritual ripening of sentient beings, they take birth in the desire realm [in order to fulfill those aims]. This should be understood as the first form of bodhisattvas’ meditative absorption that is difficult to carry out. Moreover, a bodhisattva relies upon meditative absorption to attain immeasurable, countless, and inconceivable forms of one-pointed concentration that are achieved by bodhisattvas but that are beyond the grasp of all listeners and solitary realizers. This should be understood as the second form of a bodhisattva’s meditative absorption that is difficult to carry out. Further, a bodhisattva relies upon meditative absorption to attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment. This should be understood as the third form of a bodhisattva’s meditative absorption that is difficult to carry out.

What is a bodhisattva’s pure meditative absorption?
It should be regarded as being of ten types. [They are] (1) the meditative absorption that is pure by virtue of the mundane purity of not being relished; (2) the meditative absorption that is pure by virtue of the transcendent purity of being unafflicted; (3) the meditative absorption that is pure by virtue of having a pure form of preparation; (4) [the meditative absorption that is] pure by virtue of having a pure main stage; (5) the meditative absorption that is pure by virtue of having [attained] a pure [level] that is higher than and superior to the main stage; (6) the meditative absorption that is pure by virtue of [having attained] the purity of possessing mastery over entering, abiding in, and arising from [states of one-pointed concentration]; (7) the meditative absorption that is pure by virtue of [having attained] the purity that, even after having turned away from states of meditative absorption, still has the power to enter them again [at will]; (8) the meditative absorption that is pure by virtue of [having attained] the purity of mastery over the exercise of supernatural knowledge; (9) the meditative absorption that is pure by virtue of [having attained] the purity in which all forms of [mistaken] views have been eliminated; and (10) the meditative absorption that is pure by virtue of [having attained] the purity of abandoning the obscurations of the mental afflictions and the obscurations to that which needs to be known.
These immeasurable forms of meditative absorption [give rise to] the fruit of great enlightenment and they are [spiritual qualities] on the basis of which bodhisattvas, after having completed the perfection of meditative absorption, have attained, shall attain, and are currently attaining unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment.

Another [fivefold] formulation [of the wisdom of a true spiritual being] is the following: (1) [wisdom that is] subtle in that it gains an understanding of objects of knowledge in terms of the mode of being that represents their true nature; (2) [wisdom that is] skillful in that it gains an understanding of objects of knowledge in terms of the mode of being that represents their complete extent; (3) [wisdom that is] innate in that it is attained through a prior accumulation of wisdom; (4) [wisdom that is] endowed with [knowledge of] the scriptural teachings in that it takes up and upholds the meanings of Dharma [teachings] that have been imparted by buddhas and the bodhisattvas who have attained the great [ārya] stages; and (5) [wisdom that is] endowed with spiritual realization in that it has attained the levels ranging from the stage of a pure superior attitude[928] to the stage that is the perfect manner of going.[929]

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s wisdom of every form?
It should be understood as being of the thirteen types [that result from] combining together six types and seven types.

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s pure wisdom?
In brief, it should be understood as being of ten types. Two types [of pure wisdom] relate to the nature of reality,[933] in that they grasp reality in terms of (1) the mode of being that represents their complete extent and (2) the mode of being that represents their true nature. Two types [of pure wisdom] relate to the subject of progression,[934] in that they correctly grasp (3) causes and (4) effects. Two types [of pure wisdom] relate to the subject of grasping,[935] in that they have a complete understanding of (5) error and (6) absence of error. Two types [of pure wisdom] relate to the subject of [what constitutes a proper] means, in that they have a complete and true understanding of (7) actions that should be carried out and (8) actions that should not be carried out. Two types [of pure wisdom] relate to the subject of perfection,[936] in that they have a complete and true understanding of both (9) the process by which afflicting entities cause affliction[937] and (10) the process by which purifying entities bring about purification.[938] These five aspects and ten types of wisdom [that are attained] by bodhisattvas should be understood as being pure in terms of the highest form of purity.

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s all-inclusive agreeable speech?
It should be regarded as being of three types. (1) Here it is the speech of a bodhisattva that is friendly,[940] and it is the speech by which a bodhisattva who refrains from frowning, who speaks politely,[941] and who shows a welcoming facial expression accompanied by a smile, following social custom and polite behavior, extends a friendly greeting to persons by asking if they are well and enjoying good fortune, if they are in good health, if their day or night has gone well, or expresses some other form of greeting, such as, “Welcome, please draw near.” (2) It is also the speech of a bodhisattva that pleases [beings], and the speech by which a bodhisattva, having seen sentient beings’ good fortune relating to their children that had not [previously] been known—or their good fortune relating to a wife or husband, their good fortune relating to family relatives, their good fortune relating to wealth, and their good fortune relating to crops—comments on [that good fortune] and [in doing so] pleases them. Alternatively, he or she pleases them [by commenting on] their development of faith, morality, learning, generosity, or wisdom. (3) It is also a bodhisattva’s speech that contains Dharma teachings endowed with every type of [spiritual] good quality, that is continuously and uninterruptedly concerned with bringing benefit and happiness to sentient beings, and that is beneficial to them in terms of the highest kind of benefit. These should be understood as the varieties of bodhisattvas’ all-inclusive agreeable speech.

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s agreeable speech that is difficult to carry out?

(2) Moreover, when a bodhisattva, after having engaged in careful consideration and without becoming discouraged, engages in conversation that pertains to Dharma with beings who are very ignorant and whose faculties are [very] dull, and when he or she, after having [willingly] accepted any trouble [relating to this effort], causes them to take up a [form of] Dharma that is proper and virtuous, this should be understood as the second type of agreeable speech that is difficult for a bodhisattva to carry out. (3) In addition, when a bodhisattva utters friendly, pleasing, or beneficial speech with a mind that is free of animosity and anger to beings who are devious and deceitful, who are established in wrongful forms of practice, and who mislead teachers, preceptors, venerable persons, and persons who are worthy of being honored, this should be understood as the third type of agreeable speech that is difficult for a bodhisattva to carry out.

Regarding this [topic], what is the agreeable speech of a true spiritual being that relates to bodhisattvas who are true spiritual beings?
It should be regarded as being of five types. Here the bodhisattvas who have become true bodhisattvas[944] and [the bodhisattvas] who have become like the tathāgatas[945] teach their disciples (1) a [form of] Dharma that is accompanied by the occasion, (2) [a form of Dharma] that is accompanied by the means of remediation, (3) [a form of Dharma] that is accompanied by the reliances, (4) [a form of Dharma] that is accompanied by strength,[946] and (5) [a form of Dharma] that is accompanied by the marvelous abilities.
[Bodhisattvas] make known the precepts of the spiritual training in an appropriate situation together with the circumstances in which they originated. Therefore, their Dharma is one that is accompanied by the occasion. They make known [the means of] recovering from transgressions to those individuals who have undertaken the trainings and incurred violations. Therefore, their Dharma is one that is accompanied by the means of remediation. They make known the unerring practice that relates to this [spiritual system of] Dharma and Vinaya and that is governed by the four reliances.[947] Therefore, their Dharma is one that is accompanied by the reliances. They proclaim the path that irreversibly delivers one from all suffering. Therefore, their Dharma is one that is accompanied by strength. They cause all the instructions to become fruitful by means of the three forms of marvelous ability. Therefore, their Dharma is one that is accompanied by the marvelous abilities.

Regarding this [topic], what is the agreeable speech of bodhisattvas that relates to the distressed and what they want?
It should be regarded as being of eight types. A bodhisattva’s speech that relates to the eight noble forms of verbal behavior on the basis of four types of purity of speech is what is called “the agreeable speech of bodhisattvas that relates to the distressed and what they want.” Regarding this [topic], these are the four types of purity of speech: (1) the abandonment of false speech; (2) [the abandonment of] divisive speech; (3) [the abandonment of] harsh speech; and (4) the abandonment of meaningless speech. Regarding this [topic], these are the eight noble forms of verbal behavior:[949] (1) saying that you saw what you saw; (2) [saying that you heard] what you heard; (3) [saying that you thought] what you thought; (4) saying that you understood what you understood; (5) saying that you didn’t see what you didn’t see; (6) [saying that you didn’t hear] what you didn’t hear; (7) [saying that you didn’t think] what you didn’t think; and (8) saying that you didn’t understand what you didn’t understand.

Regarding this [topic], what is the all-inclusive beneficial conduct of bodhisattvas?
It should be regarded as being of two types: (1) the ripening of sentient beings who are not yet spiritually mature and (2) the liberation of sentient beings who are spiritually mature. These [two types] should further be understood in terms of three modes: (1) causing [others] to adopt an aim that pertains to this life; (2) causing [others] to adopt an aim that pertains to future lives; and (3) causing [others] to adopt an aim that pertains both to this life and to future lives.
Regarding this [topic], causing [others] to adopt an aim that pertains to this life should be understood in terms of correctly causing [others] to acquire, preserve, and increase their wealth by means of [various] qualities [gained from] actions that are in accord with Dharma.[958] [This is the aim] by means of which an individual acquires praise from others and abides in a state of ease during this life through being benefited by the ease [achieved with] objects [that provide] a means of subsistence.
Regarding this [topic], causing [others] to adopt an aim that pertains to future lives should be understood as [the act of] causing [others] to abandon wealth and adopt the lifestyle of going forth [into the homeless state] in which one’s subsistence is dependent upon being a mendicant. [This is an aim] by means of which an individual definitely becomes one who experiences happiness in the future but does not necessarily do so in this life.
Regarding this [topic], causing [others] to adopt an aim that pertains both to this life and to future lives should be understood as [the act of] causing [others], whether they are householders or homeless ascetics, to adopt [the course that] gradually leads to [the state of] freedom from attachment. [This is an aim] by means of which [an individual] abides in a state of happiness in this life through gaining physical and mental agility and, in future lives, is reborn among the pure gods. [Ultimately,] he or she will [also] attain the complete extinction [of all samsaric rebirth] within the realm of the [form of] nirvana in which the support [of the heaps] does not remain.[959]

(2) The beneficial conduct [that occurs] in relation to beings who possess a great abundance of wealth and who have attachment for it is a [form of] bodhisattvas’ [beneficial conduct] that is difficult to carry out, because [those persons’ minds] are occupied with a great object of heedlessness and a great cause of heedlessness. (3) The beneficial conduct [that occurs] in relation to those heretics who fall outside this [Buddhist tradition] and [that occurs] in relation to those who formerly embraced the views of heretical traditions is [a form of] bodhisattvas’ [beneficial conduct] that is difficult to carry out, because [those persons] have caused themselves to be confused about, and they have biased opinions about, this [spiritual system of] Dharma and Vinaya.

Regarding this [topic], what is the bodhisattvas’ beneficial conduct that relates to the distressed and what they want?
It should be regarded as being of eight types: [A bodhisattva] causes those beings who are disturbed by the perturbation of shamelessness to dispel and remove (1) the perturbation of shamelessness [that occurs] in relation to those objects toward which one ought to feel shame. Just as with the perturbation of shamelessness, he or she also causes [those beings who are disturbed by the other seven perturbations] to dispel and remove (2) the perturbation of lack of abashment [that occurs] in relation to [those objects] toward which one ought to feel abashment, as well as [causes them to dispel and remove] (3) the perturbation of torpor,[961] (4) the perturbation of sleep, (5) the perturbation of excitation, (6) the perturbation of regret, (7) the perturbation of envy, and (8) the perturbation of stinginess.[962]

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s beneficial conduct that brings happiness here and in the next world?
It should be regarded as being of nine types. [They are as follows:] In relation to the purity of physical deeds [that is to be carried out] by other beings, it is (1) the act of causing [others] to adopt every form of abstaining from taking [another being’s] life; (2) the act of causing [others] to adopt every form of abstaining from taking what was not given; (3) the act of causing [others] to adopt every form of abstaining from sexual misconduct; and (4) the act of causing [others] to adopt every form of abstaining from [drinking] grain-based[963] or juice-based[964] intoxicating drinks that are a cause of heedlessness. In relation to the purity of verbal deeds, it is (5) the act of causing [others] to adopt every form of abstaining from telling lies; (6) the act of causing [others] to adopt every form of abstaining from divisive speech; (7) the act of causing [others] to adopt every form of abstaining from harsh speech; and (8) the act of causing [others] to adopt every form of abstaining from meaningless speech.

They are (1) that which is irreproachable, (2) that which is not misdirected, (3) that which is systematic, (4) that which reaches everywhere, and (5) that which is [carried out] according to the circumstances.
Here a bodhisattva does not direct sentient beings to engage in nonvirtuous deeds that are accompanied by misconduct, that are preceded by misconduct, that are blameworthy, or that are afflicted. This is the form of [a bodhisattva’s] beneficial conduct toward sentient beings that is irreproachable.

Moreover, in order to enable [beings] to attain virtuous qualities in a systematic manner, a bodhisattva initially gives a Dharma teaching that is easily comprehended and imparts instruction and counsel that is easily comprehended to those beings whose wisdom is immature. After realizing that their wisdom has reached a middling level [of understanding], he or she gives them a Dharma teaching of a middling level [of difficulty] and imparts instruction and counsel of a middling level [of difficulty]. After realizing that their wisdom is extensive, he or she gives them a profound Dharma teaching and imparts subtle [forms of] instruction and counsel. This is [a bodhisattva’s] beneficial conduct toward sentient beings that is systematic.

Regarding this [topic], what are the five inner forms of purity that relate to bodhisattvas’ beneficial conduct toward sentient beings?
[They are as follows:] (1) Here a bodhisattva applies him- or herself to the aims [of sentient beings] with a wide-ranging compassionate attitude that is devoted to sentient beings. (2) Moreover, a bodhisattva is one whose mind is not made weary despite all the pain and exertion [that occurs] in [the course of pursuing] the aims of sentient beings and he or she is ever joyful in applying him- or herself to the aims of sentient beings. (3) Further, even though a bodhisattva might be living in a state of foremost and most excellent prosperity, he or she applies him- or herself to the aims of sentient beings like a servant, a slave, an obedient son or daughter, or a young low-caste boy or girl, with a humble mind that has overcome [all] conceit, pride, and haughtiness. (4) Further, a bodhisattva applies him- or herself to the aims of sentient beings with an affection of the highest form that is genuine and free of desire for material reward. (5) In addition, a bodhisattva applies him- or herself to the aims of sentient beings with a mind that possesses a [form of] loving-kindness that is absolutely irreversible. These should be understood as the five inner forms of purity that relate to bodhisattvas’ beneficial conduct toward sentient beings.
When the five forms of outer purity and the five forms of inner purity are combined together, this is called the bodhisattvas’ “tenfold purity of beneficial conduct.”

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s sameness of purpose?[965]
Whatever purpose and whatever root of virtue a bodhisattva here directs others to adopt, he himself or she herself should be observed[966] to adopt a purpose and a root of virtue that is [at least] equal to that [if not] one that is greater. Therefore, a bodhisattva’s purpose that is equal to that of others in this way is what is referred to as “sameness of purpose.” Having perceived the bodhisattvas’ sameness of purpose, those other disciples become firm in their conviction and irreversible with regard to taking up roots of virtue.

Why is that?
They have the following thought: “The [practice] that this bodhisattva has urged us to adopt is certain to benefit us and bring us happiness, because [this bodhisattva] him- or herself carries out the very [same practice] that he or she has enjoined us to follow and would not carry out [a practice] that he or she knew to be one that did not [bring any] benefit and was not [a source of] happiness.” Moreover, those other [disciples] will not say of a bodhisattva who has the same purpose: “You yourself are not living as someone who has adopted virtue. Why do you believe that you should be one who urges others in such an extreme manner to take up virtue, or that you should be one who teaches others and instructs others? Rightfully, you are the one who should be taught, instructed, and corrected by others.”
There are bodhisattvas who have the same purpose as others but do not show that sameness of purpose to others. There are those who do not have the same purpose [as others] but who show themselves as having the same purpose. There are those who have the same purpose [as others] and also show their sameness of purpose [to others]. There are those who neither have the same purpose [as others] nor show themselves as having the same purpose.

Regarding this [point], the first alternative is a bodhisattva whose virtuous qualities and [spiritual] power are equal to bodhisattvas of equal virtue and power who have acknowledged themselves to be teachers of the bodhisattva path.

The second alternative is a bodhisattva who, after having carefully considered [the value of doing so], shows him- or herself to be a follower of the same Dharma[968] as those beings of inferior disposition who are frightened of the profound subjects, in order to spiritually tame them by [employing] this [expedient] means. [In addition,] he or she knowingly takes birth in the same station as that of persons of the lowest caste[969] as well as that of dogs, [because] he or she is desirous of accomplishing the aims of [beings] as low as those of the lowest caste and [beings] as low as dogs, [because] he or she is desirous of removing their misfortune, and [because] he or she is desirous of taming them spiritually.

Regarding this, it should be understood that their greatness stems from their absence of limitation regarding sentient beings, their absence of limitation regarding entities, and their absence of limitation regarding time. Regarding this [point], the absence of limitation regarding sentient beings is the quality by which a bodhisattva practices these roots of virtue of generosity, etc., on the basis of all sentient beings and in relation to all sentient beings; he or she does not do so only in relation to his or her own exclusive benefit. Regarding this [point], the absence of limitation regarding entities is the quality by which a bodhisattva abides in these roots of virtue of generosity, etc., after having adopted all of them [and having adopted them] in every form. Regarding this [point], the absence of limitation regarding time is the quality by which a bodhisattva practices these roots of virtue of generosity, etc., during this life, both day and night, continuously and uninterruptedly, with an application in which one’s duty is not neglected and one’s obligation is not discarded, and, for this very reason, he or she also [practices them] in future lives.

Regarding this [point], freedom from affliction should be understood in terms of four aspects. (1) Here a bodhisattva cultivates these virtuous qualities with a joyful mind; he or she does not do so with a sense of pain or an unhappy disposition. For these reasons, he or she remains free of regret. (2) Moreover, a bodhisattva practices the roots of virtue of generosity, etc., without harming others, without adhering to [mistaken] doctrines, and without allowing [these roots of virtue] to become commingled with [any forms of] misconduct. (3) Further, having undertaken these virtuous qualities with the devotion of his or her entire being, a bodhisattva practices them as one who regards them as advantageous,[972] one who regards them as valuable,[973] one who regards them as free from passions,[974] one who is firmly resolved about them, one who does not rely upon others [in order to practice them], and one who does not have to be led by others [in order to practice them]. (4) In addition, a bodhisattva does not long for the ripening of those virtuous qualities of generosity, etc. [in the form of bringing him or her] the status of a wheel ruler or [birth as such deities as] Śakra, Māra, or Brahmā, nor does he or she expect [some form of] recompense from others. He or she is not one who clings to [any of] these [goals]. [He or she is not one who clings] to any form of gain, honor, or fame, nor even one who clings to his or her body or life.
In this manner, the practice of these virtuous qualities, beginning with generosity and ending with sameness of purpose, [that is carried out] in terms of these [four] aspects—namely, (1) that it is accompanied by serene delight,[975] (2) that it is free of adversity, (3) that it is carried out with devotion, and (4) that it is done without attachment [to any personal goal]—is called their “freedom from affliction.”

The purity [of the practice] should be understood in terms of the qualities of intensity, steadfastness, and complete purity. Regarding this [point], the virtuous qualities of a bodhisattva who has entered the stage of a pure [superior] attitude are possessed of intensity and steadfastness. Regarding them, the quality of intensity is that in which all the virtuous qualities of a bodhisattva who has attained the purity of attitude are able to be carried out without the need for any close consideration. Regarding them, the quality of steadfastness is that in which a bodhisattva who has attained the purity of attitude does not lose any of the virtuous qualities that he or she has attained and accumulated. Nor is he or she vulnerable to their loss in future [lives]. With the passage of successive days and nights and the passage of a multiplicity of lives, the bodhisattva does nothing other than increase these virtuous qualities, like a moon during its waxing phase; he or she does not allow them to diminish.
Moreover, it should be understood that these virtuous qualities reach complete purity for a bodhisattva who has reached the stage that is the perfect manner of going[976]—both one who is [only] subject to one [additional] rebirth[977] and one who is in his final existence.[978] There are none which might attain some greater form of purity on a higher bodhisattva stage.
This is how it should be understood that the practice of the virtuous qualities beginning with generosity and ending with sameness of purpose [is carried out] by means of three causes, their excellence [is accomplished] by means of two causes, and their complete purity [is achieved] by means of three causes.

Regarding this [topic], when a bodhisattva who is desirous of performing an act of worship in relation to a tathāgata or a tathāgata shrine does not carry out that act exclusively by him- or herself but rather [also] causes his or her mother and father to carry out [such an act], or causes his or her children and spouse, male or female servants, workmen, hired persons, friends, advisers, near relations, and kinsmen to do so, or causes other members of the royal family, high royal officials, brahmins, householders, townspeople, countrymen, persons of wealth, heads of guilds, or leaders of caravans to do so, or [also] even causes [ordinary] men and women, sons and daughters, poor persons, those afflicted by pain, and even those who are outcasts to carry out [such an act], or [also] causes teachers and preceptors, fellow residents of a monastery, fellow spiritual practitioners, homeless ascetics, and even other heretics to perform acts of worship in relation to a tathāgata or a tathāgata shrine, this should be understood as an act of worship in which [the characteristic of] being done by oneself and [the characteristic of] being done by others both apply.

Moreover, when a bodhisattva only possesses a limited quantity of objects to give and [a limited quantity of objects] that are suitable for performing acts of worship, and yet, after having developed a compassionate state of mind, he or she gives those objects to others, thinking, “These beings who are undergoing suffering possess only a small amount of merit and are unable [to practice acts of worship on their own]. [However,] after they have performed acts of worship, they will experience happiness [in the future],” and when those individuals make an offering to a tathāgata or a tathāgata shrine with those objects but the bodhisattva him- or herself does not do so, this should be known as an act of worship that [has been prompted] by a bodhisattva and is carried out exclusively by others.

Moreover, a bodhisattva performs such an eminent act of worship that is free of affliction and that is accomplished with wealth and honor in relation to a tathāgata or a tathāgata shrine, either with objects of wealth that he or she obtained with the strength of his or her own arms,[991] [objects of wealth] that were solicited from others, or [objects of wealth] that were obtained through the controlling power over implements.[992] Regarding this [point], a bodhisattva who has attained the controlling power over implements emanates one, two, or many bodies, up to many trillions of trillions[993] of bodies, and then makes prostration to the tathāgatas with all of these bodies. Moreover, after emanating a hundred hands, a thousand hands, or even more than that for each of these bodies, he or she, with all of these [hands], scatters over the tathāgatas supremely fragrant and supremely beautiful flowers that surpass those of the gods. All of these exalted bodies that possess the excellent physical qualities of a tathāgata voice hymns of praise. With all of these bodies, he or she offers various kinds of excellent and exceptional armlets, bracelets, and jewel earrings to the tathāgatas and holds up [for them various kinds of excellent and exceptional] parasols, banners, and pennants. These [acts], as well as others of a similar type, are acts of worship that are subject to [the power of] one’s mind and are carried out by a bodhisattva who has attained the controlling power over implements.
This [kind of bodhisattva] also does not need to wish for or long for the appearance of a buddha.

Even though a bodhisattva may not possess objects of wealth that were acquired by the strength of his or her own arms or [objects of wealth] that were acquired through having been solicited from others, and even though he or she may not be a bodhisattva who has attained the controlling power over implements, a bodhisattva who possesses faith can expand his or her mind that is possessed of joy and great devotion [so as to consider] all the lesser, intermediate, and great acts of worship that are being carried out [by others] in this Rose Apple Continent,[994] in this [world that is made up of] four continents, or in the thousand world spheres, the double-thousand world spheres, and the great triple-world spheres, up to the limitless world spheres of the ten directions, and rejoice at them.

Regarding this [topic], a bodhisattva who carries out these ten forms of worship of the Three Jewels does so with six types of superior attitude that hold the tathāgatas as their object. [They are] (1) the superior attitude [that regards the tathāgatas] as the unsurpassed field of virtue; (2) the superior attitude [that regards the tathāgatas] as the unsurpassed benefactors; (3) the superior attitude [that regards the tathāgatas] as the foremost of all sentient beings—whether they have no feet or are two-footed, etc.; (4) the superior attitude [that regards the tathāgatas] as extremely rare, like the udumbara flower; (5) the superior attitude [that regards the tathāgatas] as unique in that they appear as the sole [enlightened being] within a world system consisting of a great triple-thousand worlds; and (6) the superior attitude [that regards the tathāgatas] as the refuge for all matters relating to mundane and transcendent forms of excellence. Even [a bodhisattva’s] minor act of worship of a tathāgata [that is carried out] with these six types of superior attitude, or his or her [minor act of worship] of the Dharma or the Sangha [that is carried out with similar forms of these six types of superior attitude], yields an immeasurably great result; how much more would it be so for [an act of worship] that is extensive.

Regarding this [topic], a bodhisattva’s spiritual teacher who is possessed of eight attributes should be known as one who is complete in every aspect.[996] (1) He or she is one who maintains a virtuous way of life by being one who adheres to [the precepts of] a bodhisattva’s morality of restraint and one who keeps them whole and unflawed.[997] (2) He or she is one who possesses extensive learning by not being one who has failed to develop understanding. (3) He or she is also one who is endowed with knowledge by being one who has attained any of the virtuous qualities that derive from meditation and by being one who has attained [any of the virtuous qualities that pertain to] quiescence and insight.

Regarding this [topic], a spiritual teacher takes on the status of being an object of faith on the basis of five aspects in such a way that others will feel great reverence toward him or her even when they have [only] heard [about the spiritual teacher from others], let alone when they have seen him or her face-to-face. (1) [A spiritual teacher] possesses [proper] physical behavior, physical behavior that is composed, and excellent physical behavior in which he or she avoids holding all the major and minor parts[1001] of the body in an unbecoming manner. (2) [A spiritual teacher] is one who remains firm in that he or she is unwavering and free of excitation in conducting physical, verbal, and mental activities. (3) [A spiritual teacher] is free of pretense in that he or she does not deliberately affect [a certain type of] physical behavior or [the quality of] steadfastness as an act of hypocrisy.[1002] (4) [A spiritual teacher] is free of envy in that he or she does not become upset in relation to a Dharma discourse that is given by others or the gain and honor that they have received. Instead, when requested by others to give a Dharma discourse or when receiving extensive amounts of gain and honor, he or she directs [that request to teach or that gain and honor] to others with a sincere and gracious mind. Moreover, regarding the Dharma discourses given by others or the gain and honor that they receive, he or she is much more deeply pleased by their gain and honor than by his or her own gain and honor. (5) [A spiritual teacher] is also one who practices simplicity[1003] in the sense of having few possessions and few personal belongings, and giving away all the property that is received.

Regarding this [topic], a bodhisattva who is listening to the Dharma in the presence of a spiritual teacher should avoid bringing to mind five circumstances that relate to the person who is a Dharma teacher and, having done so, he or she should listen to the Dharma attentively and with a reverential mind.

[That is,] he or she should not form thoughts like the following: “This is [a person] whose conduct is bad. He or she does not maintain the [system of moral] discipline. I shall not listen [to the Dharma] from him or her.” (2) He or she should avoid bringing to mind that [a spiritual teacher’s] family is in [a state of] ruin. [That is,] he or she should not form thoughts like the following: “This [person] is from an inferior family. I shall not listen [to the Dharma] from him or her.” (3) He or she should avoid bringing to mind that [a spiritual teacher’s] appearance is in [a state of] ruin. [That is,] he or she should not form thoughts like the following: “This is a person who is physically unattractive. I shall not listen [to the Dharma] from him or her.” (4) He or she should avoid bringing to mind that [a spiritual teacher’s] form of expression is in [a state of] ruin. [That is,] he or she should not form thoughts like the following: “This is a person whose speech is unrefined. I shall not listen [to the Dharma] from him or her.” One should rely only upon the meaning [of a Dharma teaching], not its literal form of expression. (5) He or she should avoid bringing to mind that [a spiritual teacher’s] pleasantness[1008] [of manner] is in a state of ruin.

How does a bodhisattva meditate on the four immeasurables—[namely, those of] loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity?
Here, in brief, a bodhisattva meditates on three forms of the four immeasurables: (1) [the form] in which sentient beings are the mental object, (2) [the form] in which entities are the mental object, and (3) [the form] in which there is no mental object.
After having arranged all sentient beings into three groups—[namely,] those who are experiencing happiness, those who are experiencing suffering, and those who are neither experiencing happiness nor experiencing suffering—when a bodhisattva, in relation to sentient beings who have a desire for happiness, radiates into the ten directions the loving-kindness that consists of the superior attitude [that wishes] to provide them with happiness and he or she abides with a conviction [that believes in the existence of] sentient beings, this should be understood as his or her [form of] loving-kindness in which sentient beings are the mental object.

On the other hand, when [a bodhisattva] who possesses an understanding of [the existence of] mere entities[1009] meditates on that very [form of] loving-kindness [that was just described] while recognizing with deep conviction that this mere [collection of] entities is designated a sentient being [only] in a figurative sense, this should be understood as his [or her form of] loving-kindness in which entities are the mental object.
Moreover, when [a bodhisattva] meditates on that very [form of] loving-kindness while avoiding even generating a conception of entities, this should be understood as his [or her form of] loving-kindness in which there is no mental object.

It should be understood that [immeasurable] compassion, joy, and equanimity are also [practiced] in the same way as [the three forms of] loving-kindness—[namely,] that in which sentient beings are the mental object, that in which entities are the mental object, and that in which there is no mental object. Regarding those [latter three practices], when a bodhisattva, in relation to sentient beings who are experiencing suffering, meditates upon a mind that is accompanied by compassion [and he or she radiates it] into the ten directions with a [form of] superior attitude [that wishes] to remove [sentient beings’] suffering, this is his or her [immeasurable] compassion. Further, when [a bodhisattva], in relation to sentient beings who are experiencing happiness, meditates upon a mind that is accompanied by joy [and he or she radiates it] into the ten directions with a [form of] superior attitude that rejoices at their happiness, this is his or her [immeasurable] joy. When [a bodhisattva] meditates upon a mind that is accompanied by equanimity [and he or she radiates it] into the ten directions with a [form of] superior attitude [that wishes] to free those very same three types of sentient beings—[namely,] those who are neither experiencing happiness nor experiencing suffering, those who are experiencing suffering, and those who are experiencing happiness—respectively, of their ignorance, hatred, and desire, this is his [or her immeasurable] equanimity.

Regarding these [four practices], it should be understood that [the forms of] a bodhisattva’s immeasurable loving-kindness, etc., in which sentient beings are the mental object are [forms of practice] that are shared by others who are followers of non-Buddhist traditions.[1010] Moreover, it should be understood that those [forms of the four immeasurables] in which entities are the mental object are [forms of practice] that are shared by listeners and solitary realizers, but they are not [forms of practice] that are shared by others who are followers of non-Buddhist traditions. However, it should be understood that [those forms of] a bodhisattva’s [practice of] the immeasurables in which there is no mental object are not [forms of practice] that are shared by any listeners, solitary realizers, or followers of non-Buddhist traditions.

It should be understood that one of the immeasurables consists of a [form of] superior attitude [that wishes to] benefit [sentient beings]—namely, equanimity. All [four] of the immeasurables are referred to as [forms of] a bodhisattva’s “sympathy.”[1011] Therefore, those bodhisattvas who possess these [immeasurable attitudes] are described as “the ones who are sympathetic.”

What are the one hundred and ten forms of suffering?
Suffering has one form. As relates to “the suffering of [a state of] progression,”[1012] all sentient beings, without exception, are experiencing the suffering that occurs in a continuous manner.
Suffering has two forms. (1) “[The suffering] that is rooted in desire” is the suffering that arises when objects that are held dear undergo change and turn into something different. (2) “The suffering that is [caused by] a ripening of ignorance” is those painful physical sensations that cause the individual who experiences them to become bewildered in the sense of [forming the erroneous notions of] an “I” or a “mine” in relation to his or her individual existence[1013] and then to undergo exceedingly great distress. [These two forms of suffering] cause two [types of] painful feelings to be experienced, [one] physical and [the other] mental.

Compassion is called “great compassion” on the basis of four causal factors: (1) [It is a form of compassion] that is developed after one has [mentally] taken hold of the suffering of sentient beings that is profound, subtle, and difficult to realize. (2) [It is a form of compassion] that one has become acquainted with over a long period of time and that one has cultivated for many hundreds of thousands of kalpas. (3) [It is a form of compassion] that has engaged its object with an effort of such intensity that the bodhisattva who is filled with compassion would give up even a hundred lives in order to remove the suffering of beings, let alone a single life or the material possessions [that sustain his or her] physical body. (4) [It is a form of compassion] that is exceedingly pure due to the purity of the [ārya] bodhisattva stage that [has been attained by] those bodhisattvas who have reached the [path’s] culmination and [a form of compassion that is exceedingly pure] due to the purity of the stage of a tathāgata that [has been attained by] the tathāgatas.

Now then, those bodhisattvas who meditate upon compassion in relation to sentient beings using these one hundred and ten forms [of suffering] meditate on the complete [form of] bodhisattva compassion. Moreover, they also quickly attain the [form of] compassion that constitutes a purity of attitude—[namely, the compassion] of one who has entered into the [ārya bodhisattva] stage that constitutes a purity of attitude.

Moreover, the mind continuum of a listener ārya who has attained the culmination [of understanding] and possesses a [direct] realization of the truth of suffering, [a mind continuum] that has long since been accompanied by a sense of dissatisfaction [for samsara’s suffering], does not engage[1030] [in activities] with the same degree of urgency as [the mind continuum] of a bodhisattva who perceives, with a mind that possesses [great][1031] compassion toward [all] sentient beings, the great mass of one hundred and ten forms of suffering that is being undergone.
There is not any [form of] inner or outer entity that a bodhisattva whose mind is permeated with such compassion would not give up. There is no [form of] moral discipline that he or she would not accept. There is not any [form of] harm inflicted by another that he or she would not endure. There is no application of effort that he or she would not undertake. There is no meditative absorption that he or she would not cultivate. There is no [form of] wisdom that he or she would not develop. Therefore, when the tathāgatas are asked, “Upon what [foundation] does the enlightenment of a bodhisattva rest?” the Ones Who Expound Things Correctly declare: “The enlightenment of a bodhisattva rests upon the foundation of compassion.”

(2) [Meditation upon the immeasurables] promotes the acquisition and collection of immeasurable [forms of] the merit accumulation. (3) It promotes a firmness of attitude in relation to [the pursuit of] true and complete enlightenment.

Regarding this [topic], what are the shame and abashment of bodhisattvas?
In brief, they should be understood in two ways: in terms of (1) their essential nature and (2) their basis.
Shame[1033] is a bodhisattva’s [sense of] embarrassment [that is felt] toward objectionable conduct through having realized its impropriety as relates to oneself. Abashment[1034] is the [sense of] embarrassment [that is felt] toward that very same object out of respect for, or fear[1035] of, others. This [sense of] embarrassment [that is felt] by a bodhisattva is naturally strong, not to mention after it has been developed through repeated practice. This is how a bodhisattva’s shame and abashment should be understood in terms of their essential nature.

<d e="2">
On the other hand, their basis, in brief, is fourfold. The embarrassment [that is felt] with regard to failing to carry out the practice that a bodhisattva ought to pursue is the first basis. Likewise, the embarrassment [that is felt] with regard to performing activities that a bodhisattva ought to avoid is the second basis. Likewise, a bodhisattva’s embarrassment [that is felt] with regard to the concealment of his or her evil deeds is the third basis. Likewise, a bodhisattva’s embarrassment [that is felt] with regard to the regret that arises [in response to] his or her own [wrongdoing], along with [the embarrassment that is felt] toward the object that is necessarily relied upon afterward, is the fourth basis.[1036] This is how [shame and abashment] should be understood in terms of their basis.

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s development of firmness?
This [quality] also should be regarded in two ways: in terms of (1) its essential nature and (2) its basis.
The quality of restraining one’s mind when it has become afflicted, the quality of not allowing oneself to come under the power of the mental afflictions, the quality of having a nature that tolerates suffering, the quality of not wavering from correct practice even in the face of many different and substantial kinds of fear and terror, and the firmness that [arises] either from possessing courage naturally or through careful reflection should be understood as the essential nature of the development of firmness.

In brief, the basis for that development of firmness by bodhisattvas should be understood as being fivefold. [The five aspects are] (1) the occurrence of a variety of samsaric forms of suffering and a variety of mistaken forms of practice that are carried out by disciples; (2) the acceptance of a samsara that is very long-lasting for the sake of sentient beings; (3) teaching the Dharma in a great assembly while one’s views are being scrutinized by rivals; (4) the acceptance of all the bodhisattva precepts; and (5) listening to the profound and extensive forms of the Dharma.[1037]

Regarding this [topic], the bodhisattvas’ quality of remaining mentally tireless in relation to all their correct forms of practice should be understood as being due to five causes. (1) Here a bodhisattva is naturally strong, which keeps him or her from becoming tired. (2) Moreover, that very attribute of remaining mentally tireless is cultivated repeatedly, which keeps him or her from becoming tired. (3) He or she is endowed with [the ability] to initiate a [form of] effort that is supported by skillful means, which, by enabling [the bodhisattva] to perceive different [circumstances] as they occur successively, keeps him or her from becoming tired. (4) [The bodhisattva] possesses a sharp and powerful [form of] discriminating wisdom, which keeps him or her from becoming tired. (5) A bodhisattva’s compassionate mind and sympathetic mind remain fixed with great intensity upon sentient beings continually and uninterruptedly, which keeps him or her from becoming tired.

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s knowledge of treatises?
Here a bodhisattva is one who has correctly taken up from others the Dharma that is made up of the collections of names, assertions, and syllables[1038] and that relates to the five branches of learning. He or she also has become well acquainted with [the Dharma] by reciting it aloud. Alternatively, he or she is someone who has become very learned regarding the meaning of that very Dharma [by receiving explanations] from others. Or he or she is someone who on his or her own has reflected well [on those meanings] and reached correct conclusions about them. In addition, the bodhisattva who has gained knowledge of these teachings and their meanings in this manner does not give up this activity, in order to avoid forgetting those teachings and meanings [that have already been learned] and in order to learn additional new and more advanced teachings and meanings. Further, with the perfection of this learning and contemplation, a ripening[1039] [of those activities] created by the passage of time [results in] the attainment of a [form of] clarity[1040] regarding both these teachings and their meanings. It should be understood that, by means of these elements, a bodhisattva’s knowledge of treatises becomes unlimited, complete, and unmistaken.

Moreover, [a bodhisattva] gains a true realization of an era in which the degeneracies[1044] possessed by the world of beings are exceedingly great, as well as an era that is free of the degeneracies and one in which the degeneracies are not exceedingly great. That is to say, he or she does so with regard to the five degeneracies, which are (1) the degeneracy of life spans, (2) the degeneracy of sentient beings, (3) the degeneracy of the mental afflictions, (4) the degeneracy of views, and (5) the degeneracy of a kalpa. For instance, nowadays the life spans of humans are short; an individual who lives a long time lives for [at most around] a hundred years. For instance, nowadays beings to a large extent do not honor their mothers, do not honor their fathers, do not honor spiritual asceticism, do not honor the position of brahmins, do not respect family elders, do not do what is advantageous, do not do what ought to be done, are not fearful of what is objectionable in relation to this world or the next world, do not practice generosity, do not carry out meritorious acts, do not observe the [one-day] fasting observance,[1045] and do not abide in morality after having accepted it.

For instance, nowadays it is evident that [beings] are attached to wickedness[1046] and attached to dishonest ways,[1047] and they become acquainted with many kinds of evil, nonvirtuous activities related to such improper conduct as taking up a weapon, taking up a staff,[1048] strife, quarreling, discord, arguing, guile, deception, dishonesty, and lying. For instance, nowadays many forms of false teachings have appeared that are preceded by the formation of judgments about the meaning of false teachings and that will contribute to the destruction of the true Dharma and the disappearance of the true Dharma. For instance, nowadays frequent famines, which take place when an intermediate kalpa[1049] ends with famine, are being perceived; widespread diseases, which take place when an intermediate kalpa ends with disease, are being perceived; and the widespread taking of life by means of weapons, which takes place when an intermediate kalpa ends with weapons, are being perceived. However, these circumstances did not exist in the past. This is the way in which a bodhisattva is one who knows the world in terms of the world of sentient beings.

A bodhisattva also gains a true realization of the world,[1050] the origination of the world, the cessation of the world, the path that leads to the origination of the world, the path that leads to the cessation of the world, [the manner in which there is] enjoyment[1051] of the world, the disadvantages [of the world], and deliverance[1052] [from the world].
A bodhisattva also realizes in a true manner that the full extent of what is called “the state of being a human”[1053] consists of [the six inner bases] that range from the eye to the mind, the [four] heaps that do not have the nature of form, and a person’s body that is made up of the four great elements; that, regarding this [topic], the term “self” or “being” is [nothing more than] a mere appellation; that, regarding this [topic], the assertions “I see forms with the eye,” up to “I realize entities with the mind,” are mere assertions; and that, regarding this [topic], the expressions [that describe an individual’s life, such as,] “He or she was the Long-Lived One who had this name, he or she was from this particular family, he or she was from this particular clan, he or she ate this kind of food, he or she experienced these kinds of happiness and suffering, he or she was long-lived to such an extent, he or she remained alive for such a period, his or her life ended in this way” are [nothing more than] mere expressions.
In this way, a bodhisattva realizes in a true manner (1) the progression of the world of sentient beings,[1054] (2) the progression of the external world,[1055] (3) the eight subjects of investigation that relate to the world,[1056] and (4) the nature of the world in an ultimate sense.[1057] Therefore, he or she is said to be “one who knows the world.”

After realizing that an individual is seeking some matter of a spiritual or material nature, [a bodhisattva] does not turn away or frown. Nor does [a bodhisattva] ridicule that person if he or she should stammer. [A bodhisattva] also does not humiliate a person who has fallen into misfortune. Likewise, [a bodhisattva] speaks in an agreeable manner to all persons—[no matter whether they are] inferior, equal, or superior to him or her. One greets them [all] saying, “Welcome, please draw near,” and sets them at ease[1058] in a proper manner. According to one’s abilities, one draws them [to the Dharma][1059] in a proper manner, using both spiritual and material methods. [A bodhisattva] does not falsely display toward beings [the appearance] that he or she possesses [a great] depth [of understanding].[1060] One is not haughty because of [possessing] a somewhat elevated status.[1061] One does not fail to attend to beings in whatever manner they are received, whether they are ill or in good health, using all one’s resources[1062] and employing benevolent physical and verbal actions.

Just as with those with whom he or she is acquainted, [a bodhisattva] is also a friend and companion toward all those with whom he or she is not acquainted, and refrains from all antagonism. To the utmost of his or her abilities and with all his or her strength, [a bodhisattva] does what is beneficial for all sentient beings who have no protector and have no refuge. [A bodhisattva] does not, in any manner, cause suffering or mental unhappiness for others but thinks, “I sincerely hope that these [beings] do not remain in a discontented state for even a moment.” For this very reason, when he or she laughs with others it is only a proper form of laughter, not one that is improper. He or she also does not use vulgar speech[1063] even when conversing with friends whom there is no risk of offending and in whom he or she has supreme confidence. He or she also does not remain angry with others for a long period of time. Even when angry with others, [a bodhisattva] does not make known sensitive matters relating to them that ought to be kept secret.[1064] When attacked by others, either physically or verbally, after considering the situation carefully, [a bodhisattva] either resorts to the rule of Dharma[1065] or perceives him- or herself alone as being the one who is at fault. He or she is steadfast in mind and avoids being fickle.

Steadfast in conduct of body, speech, and mind, [a bodhisattva] turns away from the fourteen impure activities,[1066] covers the six directions,[1067] avoids the four kinds of evil companions,[1068] and is assisted by the four kinds of virtuous friends.[1069] All of these expressions should be understood as they are described in the sutra.[1070]
In relation to the possession of wealth for the purpose of benefiting this life, [a bodhisattva] is energetic, watchful, one who shares the same way of living,[1071] and attains skill in the worldly crafts and occupations. He or she does not engage in guile or deceit and is not disposed to cheating others. He or she possesses a sense of shame in relation to blameworthy conduct. He or she is possessed of excellent conduct by being earnest about that [quality] and by being watchful of his or her conduct. He or she avoids doing harm to the property of others that has been entrusted to him or her. He or she does not break his or her word [by defaulting] on a loan that is taken from others.

Similarly, [a bodhisattva] is also skilled in the principles of ordinary secular behavior and the acts that are beneficial to the world. When requested by others to provide assistance with regard to various matters that need to be accomplished, [a bodhisattva] does so; he or she does not shrink from [that request] and does not equivocate.[1073] He or she undertakes [to carry out] an activity in an excellent manner, not in an improper manner. When governing, [a bodhisattva] does so in a just manner, not in an unjust manner. He or she also does not take pleasure in [meting out] punishments. After turning the general populace away from immorality, he or she causes them to take up morality. Similarly, [a bodhisattva] is endowed with the eight forms of noble expression—that is, he or she is endowed with the qualities of saying in relation to something that was seen, “I saw it”; in relation to something that was heard, “I heard it”; in relation to something that was thought, “I thought it”; in relation to something that was realized, “I realized it”; in relation to something that was not seen, “I did not see it”; in relation to something that was not heard, “I did not hear it”; in relation to something that was not thought, “I did not think it”; and in relation to something that was not realized, “I did not realize it.” A bodhisattva who is endowed with these kinds of qualities knows in a true manner everything as it ought to be understood in relation to the world and [everything] as it relates to [the conduct] that ought to be observed in the world. Therefore, he or she is said to be “one who knows the world.”

Regarding this [topic], how does a bodhisattva apply him- or herself to the four reliances?[1074]
Here a bodhisattva listens to the Dharma from another person as one who is seeking meaning, not as one who is seeking an excellent form of literary expression. As one who seeks meaning when listening to the Dharma and not one who seeks [an excellent form of] literary expression, the bodhisattva who relies on meaning even listens respectfully to Dharma teachings that are given using vernacular speech.

Moreover, a bodhisattva knows both “black” expressions and “great” expressions[1075] as they truly are. Knowing this, he or she relies on correctness;[1076] he or she does not rely on a person, thinking “These teachings were spoken by an elder,[1077] a learned person,[1078] the Tathāgata, or [a member of] the Sangha.” Relying on correctness in this way and not relying on the person, he or she does not waver from those meanings that relate to the true nature of things and also does not depend upon others as relates to [how to properly understand the meaning of] Dharma teachings.

Moreover, a bodhisattva whose faith and purity of mind toward the Tathāgata are firmly placed, and who is singularly devoted to [the Tathāgata’s] speech, relies upon the Tathāgata’s sutras that are of definitive meaning; he or she does not rely on [the sutras] that are of provisional meaning. A bodhisattva who relies on the sutras that are of definitive meaning cannot be led away from this [spiritual system of] Dharma and Vinaya. That is to say, the distinctions relating to the subjects that are mentioned in a variety of ways in the sutras of provisional meaning are such that one cannot form definite opinions about them and [therefore] they are a source of uncertainty. Furthermore, if a bodhisattva is uncertain about [how to correctly understand] the sutras of definitive meaning, then he or she can be led away from this [spiritual system of] Dharma and Vinaya.

Moreover, a bodhisattva is one who regards the [transcendent] knowledge that is gained through realization [of the Dharma’s meaning] as most important, not the [ordinary] comprehension of the Dharma teachings and their meanings that is gained merely through listening and reflection. Having realized that what one understands with the [transcendent] knowledge that derives from meditation cannot be understood with the [ordinary] comprehension that is gained merely through [the activities of] listening and reflection, he or she does not, after having listened to the most profound Dharma teachings that were explained by the tathāgatas, reject or criticize them.
This is the manner in which a bodhisattva practices the four reliances. Moreover, this is also the manner in which he or she becomes skilled in their practice. Regarding this [topic], in relation to these four reliances there is, in brief, an authoritativeness of the four that is revealed: (1) that which pertains to the meaning that was taught, (2) that which pertains to its correctness, (3) that which pertains to the Teacher, and (4) that which pertains to the knowledge that consists of spiritual realization and that derives from meditation. Moreover, the four reliances jointly elucidate the unerring means of [attaining] deliverance for a bodhisattva who has undertaken the correct form of practice.

What are the four [forms of] informative knowledge[1079] that are possessed by bodhisattvas?
The knowledge that derives from meditation and is unimpeded[1080] and unhampered[1081] with regard to all the verbal formulations that pertain to all Dharma teachings, both in terms of the full range [of entities] and in terms of their true nature, is [the bodhisattvas’] informative knowledge of the Dharma.[1082] Further, the knowledge that derives from meditation and is unimpeded and unhampered with regard to all the [defining] characteristics [of the entities mentioned] in all Dharma teachings, both in terms of the full range [of entities] and in terms of their true nature, is [the bodhisattvas’] informative knowledge of meanings.[1083] Moreover, the knowledge that derives from meditation and is unimpeded and unhampered with regard to all the [forms of] clear expression that pertain to all Dharma teachings, both in terms of the full range [of entities] and in terms of their true nature, is [the bodhisattvas’] informative knowledge of clear expression.[1084] In addition, the knowledge that derives from meditation and is unimpeded and unhampered with regard to every manner and kind of point relating to all forms of Dharma teachings, both in terms of the full range [of entities] and in terms of their true nature, is [the bodhisattvas’] informative knowledge [that confers] eloquence.[1085]
It should be understood that, on the basis of these four forms of informative knowledge, bodhisattvas attain immeasurably great skill regarding five subjects: (1) skill regarding the heaps,[1086] (2) skill regarding the constituents,[1087] (3) skill regarding the bases,[1088] (4) skill regarding dependent origination,[1089] and (5) skill regarding proper and improper conditions.[1090] By means of these four types [of informative knowledge], a bodhisattva becomes highly realized regarding all Dharma teachings and most proficient at revealing [that knowledge] to others. If there is nothing higher than this about which [a bodhisattva] can gain perfect knowledge, how could there be anything [higher] to reveal to others?

How does a bodhisattva come to know the thirty-seven spiritual qualities that are conducive to enlightenment as they truly are according to the system of the Great Vehicle?
Here a bodhisattva dwells in relation to the body as one who watches the body, but he or she does not conceive of the body as a body that exists. Nor does he or she [conceive of the body] as being completely, and in every way, nonexistent. [That is to say], he or she accurately realizes the ineffable state of being that is the body’s true nature. This is his or her ultimate form of closely placed recollection that consists of watching the body in relation to the body. Moreover, it should be understood that, for the conventional method of practice, the closely placed recollection that consists of watching the body in relation to the body corresponds to a bodhisattva’s knowledge of an immeasurable number of doctrinal formulations.[1096] The remaining [three] forms of closely placed recollection and the remaining forms of the [thirty-seven] spiritual qualities that are conducive to enlightenment should be understood in a manner that is similar to [this description of] the closely placed recollection that consists of watching the body in relation to the body.

[A bodhisattva] does not conceive of the entities that consist of the body, etc.,[1097] as [constituting a real form of] suffering or [constituting a real form of] origination. He or she also does not conceive of the abandonment that is accomplished by means of this [practice] as a [real form of] cessation and does not conceive of the causes that bring about the attainment of that [abandonment] as a [real] path. Moreover, he or she accurately realizes the true nature of suffering, the true nature of origination, the true nature of cessation, and the true nature of the path, in terms of the ineffable state of being that is their true nature. This represents [a bodhisattva’s] meditation on the ultimate nature of the [four noble] truths, in a manner that relies upon meditation upon the [thirty-seven] spiritual qualities that are conducive to enlightenment. By contrast, the bodhisattva’s conventional form of meditation upon the object of the [four noble] truths should be regarded as corresponding to [his or her] knowledge of an immeasurable number of doctrinal formulations.

Here a bodhisattva causes any being whatsoever to give even an insignificant object, including something as small as a handful of barley meal, to an insignificant “field,”[1104] even one as lowly as a sentient being of the animal birth state. Having completed an act of giving, [a bodhisattva] causes [that being] to dedicate [his or her virtue] to unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment. In this manner, by the power of dedication, a root of virtue that is small, both in terms of its object and its field, is caused to have an unlimited result.

Here, too, it should be understood that, in brief, there are six types of method that a bodhisattva uses to accomplish these four aims that relate to sentient beings: (1) the benevolent [method], (2) [the method] of standing as an obstacle, (3) [the method] that has a dissimilar attitude, (4) [the method] that derives from suppression, (5) [the method] that relates to returning a favor, and (6) the pure method.

Regarding this [topic], a bodhisattva’s benevolent method is as follows. Here, at the very outset, a bodhisattva uses gentle and pleasant physical and verbal conduct and conduct that is magnanimous and compliant to remove the animosity within those beings to whom he or she is desirous of teaching the Dharma. Having removed their animosity, he or she engenders in them [feelings of] affection and respect. Having engendered affection and respect, he or she engenders in them an aspiration for the Dharma. Following that, he or she teaches them the Dharma.

Moreover, the Dharma that he or she teaches is one that is appropriate and easily undertaken, [one that] generates an understanding, is meaningful, and [one that is revealed] at a suitable time, in an orderly manner, and correctly. He or she is forbearing of hostility and possesses a sympathetic mind that has the utmost desire to bring spiritual self-discipline to beings. He or she brings spiritual self-discipline to beings by means of miraculous powers, reading [others’] minds, and teaching a form of Dharma that is efficacious, by requesting others [to instruct them], or by emitting abundant and manifold kinds of magical emanations.
[A bodhisattva] benefits beings and carries out their aims by explaining in detail those treatises that are filled with meaning [but are composed] in an abbreviated form and by giving a condensed explanation of those that are [composed] in an extremely extensive form. Likewise, [he or she benefits beings and carries out their aims] by correctly revealing the meanings of Dharma teachings that have been memorized through giving explanations of them and [exposing the meanings of teachings] that have been taken up through causing them to be recited and answering questions about them. [He or she] also [benefits beings and carries out their aims] by teaching systematic instructions that relate to all the meditation objects associated with the various methods of pursuing one-pointed concentration.

There are persons who have not understood the intended meaning of the tathāgatas [as presented] in the profound sutras that were spoken by the tathāgatas with regard to [the topic of] emptiness. These are the sutras that declare that entities lack an essential nature, that they are insubstantial, that they do not arise, that they do not cease to exist, that they are identical with space, and that they resemble illusions and dreams. Having failed to understand the meaning of these [sutras], these persons who are frightened by them reject them completely and totally, declaring, “These were not spoken by the Tathāgata.” Using the benevolent form of skillful means, a bodhisattva properly explains in an orderly manner the intended meaning of these sutras and causes these beings to comprehend them.

Moreover, this is how he or she gives that orderly explanation. These entities are not completely and totally nonexistent. However, they do not possess an essential nature that can be expressed in words. Therefore, they are described as “lacking an essential nature.” Even though a real substance[1108] that is capable of being described is considered to exist and verbal expressions occur in relation to that [perceived substance], nevertheless the essential nature that is described by means of verbal expressions does not have such a mode of being in an ultimate sense. Therefore, [entities] are said to be “insubstantial.”[1109] And, because this is so, the essential natures of entities that are expressed in words have, from the very beginning, been completely and totally incapable of being found. So how could it be that they arise or cease to exist? Therefore, it is said that they “do not arise” and they “do not cease to exist.”

Consider the following analogy. A great variety and profusion of physical objects as well as their actions are observed [to exist] in space. It is also the case that space makes room for those physical objects and their actions, such as those of going, coming, remaining still, rising, falling, retracting [a limb], or extending [a limb], and the like. Moreover, when those physical objects and their actions are removed, the pure space whose nature is a mere absence of physical objects becomes evident. In a similar way, the conceptions and false notions that resemble physical objects and their actions and that are both created by a variety of expressions and accompanied by attachment to [verbal] elaborations arise in the ineffable reality that resembles space. In addition, the ineffable reality that resembles space makes room for all those conceptions and false notions that resemble the variety of physical objects and their actions and that are both created by a variety of expressions and accompanied by attachment to [verbal] elaborations. Moreover, when bodhisattvas, by means of an excellent knowledge, have completely and totally removed those false conceptions and notions that are caused to arise by expressions and that are accompanied by attachment to [verbal] elaborations, the ārya knowledge of those supremely excellent bodhisattvas causes the ineffable reality that is a mere absence of all the essential natures that are expressed in words and that is a space-like purity to become evident. [Bodhisattvas] do not seek [a realization of] any other essential nature which is superior to that. Therefore, entities are said to be “identical with space.”

For example, an illusion is something that does not truly exist in the way that it appears. Nor is an object that is created by a magical illusion something that is completely and totally nonexistent. Similarly, entities do not truly exist in the way that they appear to immature beings by the power of their habituation to expressions. Nor are they completely and totally nonexistent, by virtue of their ultimate, ineffable nature. Through the application of this method, [entities] are [determined to be] beyond duality—that is, neither existent nor nonexistent—like illusions. Therefore, they are said to “resemble illusions.” In this way, a bodhisattva does not put forward anything, does not reject anything, does not subtract anything, does not add anything, and does not cause anything to disappear in relation to this entire “entity-source.”[1110] He or she perceives reality as it is and makes it known in just that manner. This should be known as a bodhisattva’s benevolent method.

Here a bodhisattva stands as an obstacle to beings who are seeking the ten personal articles for the body,[1111] such things as food and drink, etc., by saying, “If you honor your mother, honor your father, honor spiritual asceticism, honor the position of brahmins,” and so on as described earlier,[1112] up to “If you in abide in morality after having accepted it, I shall give you as much of the personal articles for the body, food and drink, etc., as you desire.

On the other hand, when those beings for whom a bodhisattva has stood as an obstacle to [the attainment of] the objects that were just described do not ever so quickly behave in the manner that is desired, he or she refuses to give the objects that were described to the beings who seek them, out of a desire to benefit them. However, he or she should not do so with an attitude that [genuinely] wishes to withhold [those objects]. Rather, out of a desire to benefit those beings who are experiencing misfortune, those who are in a state of danger, those who are desirous of meeting with something agreeable or being separated from something disagreeable, and those who are afflicted by the suffering of an illness, he or she should remain indifferent to them for a certain period of time. However, he or she should not do so with an attitude that is [genuinely] indifferent to them or an attitude that genuinely refuses to protect them.

In addition, a bodhisattva should cause those beings who are not seeking something from him or her, those beings who are not experiencing misfortune, and so on, up to those beings who have not been stricken by an illness, but who are his or her acquaintances and friends, to take up these very same forms of virtue—namely, that of honoring one’s mother, and so on, up to that of observing the morality that has been undertaken. If those beings who have been urged by a bodhisattva to take up virtue in this manner should fail to practice it due to an inconstant temperament, a bodhisattva should, out of a desire to benefit them, give the appearance of having become angered. However, he or she should not genuinely be angry. Out of a desire to benefit [such persons], he or she should give the appearance of being in opposition to their interests; however, he should not genuinely be opposed to them. Out of a desire to benefit, he or she should even bring about some worldly[1113] [form of] harm; however, he or she should not genuinely have a desire to inflict harm.

Here a bodhisattva who is a lord[1115] or a king or who has attained [some form of regional] authority should correctly govern his own retinue or his own subjects [by saying] the following: “I shall discontinue or revoke [any] privilege bestowed by me or [any right of] food or clothing to anyone among my retinue or my subjects who does not honor his or her mother,” and so on, up to “[I shall discontinue or revoke . . . to anyone who] adopts and abides in [a state of] immorality,” or, [he should correctly govern by saying,] “I shall cause him or her to be beaten,” or “I shall cause all his or her wealth to be confiscated,” or “I shall cause him or her to be banished completely and totally from this country.” He should also entrust this action to his skilled and intelligent subordinates. The beings who are frightened by these great forms of punishment will then abandon evil deeds and, having adopted virtuous deeds, abide in them. On the basis of this method, which constitutes a form of forceful suppression, even those beings who do not wish to engage in virtuous deeds will do so. Therefore, it is called “the method that derives from suppression.”

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s method that relates to returning a favor?
Here a bodhisattva who has done something that was of benefit to beings in the past, whether small or great, either in the form of generosity or rescuing them from some misfortune or danger, or helping them to meet with something agreeable or be separated from something disagreeable, or helping them to be cured of an illness, requests and accepts as an [act of] recompense from those who are grateful for and appreciative of the help they have received, and from those who are desirous of doing something favorable in return, only that they take up virtuous deeds; he or she does not [request] the slightest form of worldly material gift. And he or she should express the wish that they return the favor by taking up virtue by saying the following: “If you would honor your mother, honor your father,” and so on, up to “[If you would] abide in morality after having accepted it, this alone would be the greatest way for you to repay my assistance.” Using this means, he or she causes others to take up these forms of virtue. Therefore, this is called “the method that relates to returning a favor.”

Then, after having passed away from Tuṣita Heaven and its assembly of deities, he is reborn in an exalted or a highly regarded family—that is, in a royal family or the family of a [brahmin] priest. Likewise, he gives up [a life filled with] great pleasures and departs [the worldly life] in order to cause beings to develop great regard [for him]. After that, he takes up the practice of austerities in order to cause those beings who are devoted to austerities to give up that desire. Then, he attains unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment in order to cause beings other than himself to long for the shared form of enlightenment and liberation.[1117] Then, after having attained unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment, he reflects to himself, “So that the declaration of Dharma does not become something of little consequence, now Brahmā himself should request that the Blessed One teach the Dharma,” and waits for Brahmā to make this request before he teaches the Dharma to beings, in order to engender in beings respect for the Dharma. Then, with the eye of a buddha, he gazes upon the world[1118] in order to dispel the following wrong belief among certain beings, “Upon receiving a request from Brahmā, he has taught the Dharma out of respect for Brahmā. [Thus, he has taught] because he was prompted by someone else, not because of his own compassion for sentient beings and not because he realized that it was fitting for him alone to do so.” Following that, he sets in motion in the world the wheel of the Dharma that has not been set in motion before. In this manner, he teaches the Dharma and declares the precepts that relate to the training. This is called a bodhisattva’s “pure method,” compared to which there is no other method that is higher, more superior, or more excellent.

Here a bodhisattva attains a development of power[1120] consisting of wisdom and recollection such that by means of it he or she can retain [in the mind] for an immeasurable period of time[1121] immeasurable numbers of scriptures containing collections of words, assertions, and syllables that were not committed to memory and were not recited aloud, in the order that they were created and in the order that they were arranged, merely by having listened to them.

They do not contain any meaning. Their meaning is that they have no meaning.” Following that, he or she does not seek any further meaning. In this way, he or she gains a correct realization of the meanings of these mantra spells.

Having gained a correct realization of the meanings of these mantra spells, he or she then gains a correct realization of the meanings of all entities that conforms with that very [understanding of the mantra spells]. Without having heard [the meaning of all entities] from anyone else, he or she realizes it in the following manner: “No meaning that pertains to a [real] essence can be established by means of any expressions in relation to any entity. This ineffable essential nature is the meaning that represents their essential nature.” After he or she has correctly realized the meaning that represents the essential nature of all entities in this way, [a bodhisattva] does not seek any other meaning. Through having gained a realization of that meaning, he or she attains a joyful rapture. What a bodhisattva attains on the strength of these mantra spells is called a “forbearance.” Through having gained that [forbearance], a bodhisattva will before long attain the purity of his or her superior attitude. He or she has advanced to the great form of forbearance that occurs on the stage in which conduct is based upon devotion. This should be understood as the [form of mental] retention that is directed toward the attainment of a bodhisattva’s forbearance.

Regarding this [topic], after having gone beyond the first span of time that is made up of countless kalpas,[1126] a bodhisattva who has entered the stage of a pure superior attitude[1127] attains forms of the retention of the Dharma and the retention of meanings that are sure, firm, and exalted. Prior to that time, they are attained on the strength of aspirational prayers or on the basis of meditative absorptions, but they are not sure, firm, or exalted. As with the retentions of the Dharma and meanings, the same should be understood as being true for the retention by means of spells. However, the retention that is directed toward the attainment of a bodhisattva’s forbearance is only attained in the manner that was just described.
Furthermore, a bodhisattva will attain all of these [forms of] retention if he or she possesses four qualities; he or she will not do so if any one of them is missing.

The brief or extensive form of aspirational prayer to obtain in the future all the spiritual qualities and all the virtuous qualities of a bodhisattva is called a bodhisattva’s “correct aspirational prayer.”
The great aspirational prayer of a bodhisattva should be understood on the basis of that very correct aspirational prayer. Moreover, it is of ten types: (1) The first aspirational prayer that is called a “great aspirational prayer” is [the wish] to carry out every manner of immeasurable worship and honor of the tathāgatas in the future. [The remaining nine are] (2) the great aspirational prayer to follow and protect the true Dharma of the buddhas, the blessed ones, and to preserve the way of the Dharma; (3) the great aspirational prayer to [carry out the activities] that range from [approaching the buddhas who are] abiding in Tuṣita Heaven, and so on, [and worshipping and honoring them, as well as following and protecting the true Dharma] as described previously, up to [the activity of approaching the buddhas who are] entering complete nirvana [and worshipping and honoring them]; (4) the great aspirational prayer to correctly practice every form of bodhisattva activity; (5) the great aspirational prayer to spiritually ripen all sentient beings; (6) the great aspirational prayer to fully perceive all world spheres; (7) the great aspirational prayer to purify a buddha field; (8) the great aspirational prayer to enter the Great Vehicle by having the same thoughts and deeds as all bodhisattvas; (9) the great aspirational prayer that all one’s correct activities should be fruitful; and (10) the great aspirational prayer to attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment.[1130]

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s one-pointed concentration on emptiness?
The stability of mind[1131] in which [a bodhisattva] perceives the reality that is an ineffable essential nature that is free of all forms of essential nature that can be described with verbal expressions is called his or her “one-pointed concentration on emptiness.”

Having perceived here how that very reality that is an ineffable essential nature becomes defiled by numerous faults through one’s having been overpowered by the mental afflictions and suffering that are generated by [forming] wrongful concepts [about the nature of reality], a bodhisattva’s state of mental stability that is preceded by the avoidance of any future aspiration for those [faults] is called “one-pointed concentration on wishlessness.”

What, then, is the reason for setting forth these three forms of one-pointed concentration?
It is because there are none that are more significant or greater than these.
The two [principal logical categories] are existence and nonexistence. Regarding them, conditioned and unconditioned [entities] are what exist, and the self and [the quality of] belonging to a self are what do not exist. Regarding this, the formulation of the one-pointed concentration on wishlessness is based on the fact that one should not have any aspiration for the conditioned entities that do exist, meaning that one should [view them] as disagreeable.[1132]
In addition, the formulation of the one-pointed concentration on signlessness is based on the fact that one should have an aspiration for the unconditioned entity of nirvana, meaning that one should apprehend it with a correct attitude of delight.
On the other hand, a bodhisattva should neither develop an aspiration for, nor avoid developing an aspiration for, the reality that relates to what does not exist.[1133] Rather, that [reality] should be regarded accurately as relates to what is nonexistent. And it should be understood that the formulation of the one-pointed concentration on emptiness [is made] on the basis of this perception.
This is how a bodhisattva practices in relation to these three [forms of] one-pointed concentration and it is also how he or she accurately understands their formulations. In addition, by taking up the accurate doctrinal formulations of the alternate versions[1134] of these three [forms of] one-pointed concentration and by taking up the [corresponding] methods of meditating upon them, he or she will also accurately understand [those alternate versions] in relation to which the listeners train themselves and attain realization.

Therefore, they are called summary Dharma statements. They are also called summary statements because [they are utterances] that were constantly repeated by the ancient munis, [those beings] who possess tranquil minds. In addition, they are called summary statements because they constitute a path that leads to great fortune[1136] and [a path] that leads to [a place that is] higher than the peak of existence.

[A bodhisattva] considers past formations that have already arisen and passed away, and does not ascertain either a cause or an essential nature that relates to them. Therefore, he or she perceives that they do not have any mode of existence that relates either to a cause or an essential nature. He or she considers the [formations] of the present that have arisen but not yet passed away, and does not ascertain a cause in relation to them, because they are results that have been produced.[1139] On the other hand, he or she does ascertain[1140] an essential nature in relation to them, because they have not yet ceased to exist. Therefore, he or she perceives that they have a mode of existence that relates to an essential nature, but not one that relates to a cause. He or she considers the future formations that have neither arisen nor passed away, and ascertains a cause [in relation to them], because they are not results that have been produced. However, he or she does not [ascertain] an essential nature, because they have not yet come into being. Therefore, a bodhisattva perceives that they have a mode of existence that relates to a cause but not one that relates to an essential nature.

Taken altogether, these four attributes of conditioned entities, in brief, can also be characterized in relation to two states: those that are characterized as being existent and those that are characterized as being nonexistent. Regarding this [point], [the quality of being] existent is one attribute of conditioned entities that was formulated by the Blessed One. [The quality of being] nonexistent[1141] is a second attribute that was formulated. Moreover, the existence of formations that is characterized as the “modification of [a conditioned entity’s] duration”[1142] is a third attribute that was formulated.[1143] Regarding this [topic], except for a formation’s bare reality, a bodhisattva perceives that [the attributes of] its arising, duration, aging, and impermanence never achieve [the quality of having] a substantive essence.[1144]

Why is that?
[A bodhisattva] does ascertain a formation’s bare reality that arises, but he or she does not [ascertain] an arising, a duration, an aging, or an impermanence that are separate from that [bare reality]. He or she also ascertains a formation’s bare reality that endures [for an instant], that [undergoes] aging, and that [undergoes] destruction but does not [ascertain] a duration, an aging, or an impermanence [that are separate] from that.

By means of reasoning too, a bodhisattva examines these [attributes of] arising, etc., and fails to ascertain that they exist as real substances. Moreover, he or she fails to ascertain [any substantive reality] by examining [those attributes] in the following manner. If [the attribute of] arising were an entity that existed separately from the formations of form and the rest, it would be something that arises [on its own], just as the formations of form, etc., arise on their own. If that were so, there would be two births, the birth of the formation and the birth of its arising. Regarding this, the birth of the arising would have to be either something that is identical with the birth of the formation or something that is distinct from it. If it were identical with it, then the notion that [the attribute of] arising is a real substance would be incoherent, because it would be logically untenable to maintain that a distinct [attribute of] arising exists as a real substance. On the other hand, [if the birth of the arising] were distinct [from the birth of the formation], then [the attribute of arising] would not be an arising that brings a formation into being. In that case, [the notion that the attribute of arising is] an arising that brings a formation into being would not be one that is logically sound.

Just as with [the attribute of] arising, it should be understood that the same [kind of] detailed [explanation can be made] for [the attributes of] duration, aging, and destruction. If that which is called “destruction” were an entity that existed absolutely in the sense of having its own essential nature, then that [entity] would also be something that both comes into being and ceases to exist. And when that destruction came into being, then it would bring about the cessation of all formations. If this were so, then just as with one who has entered the state of composure that is a cessation,[1145] the suspension of the mind and mental factors would occur with little difficulty.[1146] In addition, with the [subsequent] cessation of that destruction, those formations that had previously been made to cease would once again come into being, because the destruction of those [formations] no longer existed. Therefore, it is unreasonable that [the attribute of] destruction could [be a real entity] that comes into being and ceases.

However, it is reasonable for one who perceives the opposite of these [positions] to do so.[1150]

Furthermore, a bodhisattva accurately realizes the two types of insubstantiality that relate to conditioned and unconditioned entities—[that is,] the insubstantiality of the person and the insubstantiality of entities. Regarding them, this is [what is meant by] the insubstantiality of the person: None of these existing entities constitutes a person, nor is there anything else, separate from these existing entities, that constitutes a person. This is [what is meant by] the insubstantiality of entities: There is no entity whose essential nature is capable of being described in words that exists in relation to all the objects that are described in words.

The subsequent complete cessation of those very formations whose causes were previously eradicated and the absolute inability for any others to be produced or appear again is called “nirvana.” Further, it should be understood as a state of peace because it is one in which the mental afflictions and suffering have been brought to an end. Moreover, a bodhisattva who has not yet attained a pure superior attitude or a follower of the Listeners’ Vehicle who has not [directly] perceived truth develops a firm conviction[1153] about such a nirvana and declares, “Nirvana is a state of peace.” However, he or she does not have an accurate understanding of this nirvana and does not engage it with a correct [form of] knowledge-perception.

Nevertheless, there is this[1154] proper [form of] attention[1155] [about the topic of nirvana]. For example, consider the son of a king, or the son of an eminent householder, who has been raised within the inner apartments [of a home] by a king or an eminent householder. Suppose that the king or the eminent householder provides a toy deer-cart, an ox-and-horse cart, or elephant-cart for that tender youth. As the young son of the king or the young son of the eminent householder plays with, enjoys, and amuses himself with those [toy carts], he thinks of the toy deer as [real] deer, the toy oxen and horses as [real] oxen and horses, and the toy elephants as [real] elephants.

Then, one day, after the son has grown up and his faculties have matured, the king or the eminent householder describes real deer, and so on, up to [the king or the householder] describes real elephants.

Then, on a different occasion, the king or the eminent householder takes his son outside the home and shows him real deer, and so on, up to [the king or the eminent householder] shows [him] real elephants.

In the same way, the father-like buddhas, as well as the bodhisattvas who have attained the great [ārya] stages and perceived nirvana directly, describe nirvana exactly as they have seen it to those son-like bodhisattvas who have been raised inside the home of samsara and who do not yet possess the pure superior attitude, and they also [describe it] to those listeners who have not yet seen truth. On the basis of an understanding that relies merely upon the sound [of words], those [disciples] also maintain a strong conviction regarding the excellent qualities of nirvana for a long time.
When those bodhisattvas who have gained a pure superior attitude[1156] through the ripening and growth of their virtuous accumulations and those listeners who have perceived truth develop a direct [form of] knowledge[1157] in relation to nirvana, they also develop a [form of] realization that accords with reality [in which they reflect to themselves,] “This is the nirvana that pertains to all the listeners and solitary realizers and [the one] that the buddhas and bodhisattvas describe. Previously, due to our immature understanding, we did not develop an accurate conviction about it. It was a counterfeit [form of conviction] about this [nirvana]; it was a mere semblance of it.” Based upon this subsequent accurate conviction, they are embarrassed by the former one.

A bodhisattva should be understood as being even-minded toward all sentient beings in five ways.
What are the five?
(1) [A bodhisattva is even-minded] by virtue of the initial aspiration in which he or she generates the intention to achieve enlightenment, for a bodhisattva generates that mind equally on behalf of all sentient beings. (2) He or she is even-minded by virtue of his or her sympathetic mind. (3) A bodhisattva is even-minded by virtue of his or her affectionate mind, in that he or she [views] all sentient beings in the same way as [the parent] of an only child [views that child]. (4) Having realized [the meaning of] the term sattva[1161] both in relation to all sentient beings and in relation to dependently arisen formations, a bodhisattva maintains an even mind toward all sentient beings by virtue of having a mind that [understands] the sameness of [all] entities, which is to say, “The true nature of any single sentient being is [the true nature] of all [sentient beings].” (5) A bodhisattva maintains an even mind toward all sentient beings by virtue of having a mind that pursues the welfare [of others] in such a way that he or she acts on behalf of all [sentient beings] in the same way that he or she does on behalf of a single sentient being. These are the five ways in which a bodhisattva is even-minded toward sentient beings.

Five conditions render fruitful the methods of practice that a bodhisattva undertakes in order to carry out beneficial activities on behalf of sentient beings.
What are the five?
From the very outset, a bodhisattva here desires to (1) benefit and (2) bring happiness to sentient beings. He or she truly knows what will (3) benefit and (4) bring happiness [to them]. (5) He or she is one whose mind is free of error. This entire [topic] should be understood as it was described previously in the chapter entitled “Worship, Service, and the Immeasurables.”[1165]

Regarding this [topic], using the method of practice that safeguards, a bodhisattva preserves his or her intelligence by means of an innate [form of] understanding that takes up spiritual qualities very quickly. He or she preserves recollection by means of a [form of] recollection that retains those spiritual qualities that have been taken up. He or she preserves knowledge by means of a [form of] understanding that examines the meanings of those spiritual qualities that have been retained. He or she achieves penetrating insight[1166] by means of a [form of] right wisdom that both avoids the causes that contribute to the diminishing of one’s intelligence, recollection, and understanding and cultivates the causes that contribute to their retention and development. He or she watches over his or her own mind by guarding the doors of the faculties. He or she watches over the minds of others by correctly complying with their minds.[1167]

There are four formulations of teachings that are made by bodhisattvas and that tathāgatas and bodhisattvas alone correctly make known and establish. No one else can make them—not a god, a human, an ascetic, or a brahmin—unless they have heard them from those [tathāgatas and bodhisattvas].
What are the four?
They are (1) the formulation of teachings on the Dharma, (2) the formulation of teachings on truth, (3) the formulation of teachings on the applications, and (4) the formulation of teachings on the vehicles.

For its part, the formulation of teachings on truth is made up of numerous classifications. In the sense of not being false, there is only one truth;[1187] it has no second form. Truth is twofold [in the sense of] relative truth and ultimate truth. Truth is threefold [in the sense of] the truth that relates to attributes,[1188] the truth that relates to speech,[1189] and the truth that relates to actions.[1190] Truth is fourfold [in the sense of] the truth of suffering, etc., up to the truth of the path. Truth is fivefold [in the sense of] the truth that relates to causes, the truth that relates to results, the truth that relates to knowledge, the truth that relates to objects of knowledge, and the foremost truth.[1191]

The seven ways in which a formulation of teachings is made for each of the three vehicles is called “the formulation of teachings on the vehicles”—[that is to say,] the Listeners’ Vehicle, the Solitary Realizers’ Vehicle, and the Great Vehicle.
It should be understood that the formulation of teachings on the Listeners’ Vehicle in its entirety is made up of these seven elements: (1) the wisdom that relates to the four noble truths, (2) the basis of that very wisdom, as well as (3) the object, (4) the concomitants, (5) the action, (6) the requisites, and (7) the fruit of that very wisdom.
The formulation of teachings on the Solitary Realizers’ Vehicle is similar to the formulation of teachings on the Listeners’ Vehicle.
It should be understood that the formulation of teachings on the Great Vehicle is made up of these seven elements: (1) the wisdom that, having taken hold of the ineffable reality, has developed an awareness of the suchness that pertains to all entities and the sameness that does not engage in conceptualization about them, (2) the basis of that very wisdom, as well as (3) the object, (4) the concomitants, (5) the action, (6) the requisites, and (7) the fruit of that very wisdom.
Any bodhisattvas of the past, future, or present who have made, shall make, or are making correct formulations of teachings, all do so by means of these four subjects. There are none of greater significance than these and there are none besides these.

Regarding this [topic], what distinguishes the constituent of those to be trained from the constituent of sentient beings?
The constituent of sentient beings is made up of all sentient beings without making any distinction—which is to say, both those who abide in a spiritual lineage and those who do not abide in a spiritual lineage. By contrast, [the category of sentient beings] that is limited to those who abide in a spiritual lineage and who have reached this or that stage [of spiritual development] is called “the constituent of those to be trained.”
The means of training [those beings who are to be trained] should be understood as indicated previously.[1207] This [topic] is also immeasurable in terms of the variety of its individual forms.

Why is that?
Here those sentient beings on whose behalf a bodhisattva undertakes activities make up the first immeasurable. Furthermore, the [world spheres] in which those sentient beings find a place to live make up the second immeasurable. Moreover, the entities by means of which those beings who live in those various world spheres undergo both the process of affliction and the process of purification make up the third immeasurable. In addition, among those sentient beings, the ones who are suitable for and capable of being permanently freed of their suffering make up the fourth immeasurable. The methods by which those very sentient beings are liberated make up the fifth immeasurable. Therefore, these [categories] make up the five immeasurables that are conducive to making bodhisattvas skillful in all their activities.

What are the five?
(1) At the very time that the true Dharma is being taught, certain beings develop the Dharma eye that is free of dust and free of impurities toward all entities. (2) Certain beings attain the termination of the outflows while the true Dharma is being taught. (3) Certain beings develop the mind that aspires [to attain] unsurpassed complete and true enlightenment. (4) Certain beings attain the supreme bodhisattva forbearance immediately after hearing the true Dharma. (5) Furthermore, the teaching of the true Dharma by buddhas and bodhisattvas is conducive to the longstanding existence of the eye of the Dharma that guides [beings], [a result] that occurs through its being successively taught, recited, and correctly practiced. These five should be understood as the extensive fruits and benefits of teaching [the true Dharma].

Because the vehicle of the bodhisattvas possesses seven forms of greatness, it is called the “Great Vehicle.”
What are the seven?
They are (1) the greatness of the Dharma, that is, the bodhisattva collection of extensive discourses that is included among the twelve divisions of the [Buddha’s] speech;[1208] (2) the greatness of mental development, that is, certain individuals develop the mind that aspires to attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment; (3) the greatness of devotion, that is, certain individuals are devoted to that very greatness of the Dharma; (4) the greatness of superior attitude, that is, certain individuals enter the stage of a pure superior attitude once they have transcended the stage of conduct that is based upon devotion; (5) the greatness of the accumulations, [that is,] the accumulation of merit and the accumulation of wisdom, whose perfection brings about the attainment of unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment; (6) the greatness of time, [that is,] the three spans of “countless” kalpas that represent the length of time it takes to attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment; and (7) the greatness of attainment, [that is, the attainment of] unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment itself, [an attainment] whose nature is such that no other attainment has a nature that is its equal, much less one that is higher or greater.
Regarding this [topic], it should be understood that six of these [forms of] greatness—that is, the greatness of the Dharma, the greatness of mental development, the greatness of devotion, the greatness of superior attitude, the greatness of the accumulations, and the greatness of time—make up the causes of the greatness of attainment, while that single greatness of attainment is [the form of greatness] that represents the result of those six.

These eight qualities serve as a summary of the entire Great Vehicle: (1) teaching the bodhisattva collection of scriptures; (2) elucidating the true nature[1209] of all the entities [that are presented] in that very bodhisattva collection of scriptures; (3) elucidating the inconceivable and supremely vast powers of the buddhas and bodhisattvas [that are mentioned] in that very bodhisattva collection of scriptures; (4) properly listening to those [topics]; (5) attaining the superior attitude[1210] that is preceded by proper reflection upon those [topics]; (6) devoting oneself to the forms of meditation[1211] that are preceded by attainment of the superior attitude; (7) perfecting the results of meditation[1212] that are preceded by devotion to the [various] forms of meditation; and (8) the state of permanent deliverance[1213] that is achieved by having perfected those very results of meditation. This is the manner in which the bodhisattvas who train themselves achieve unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment.

Regarding this [topic], a bodhisattva who abides in the spiritual lineage, is practicing the trainings, and has developed [enlightenment] mind is called “the one who has entered [the path].” As long as that very [bodhisattva] who has entered [the path] has not yet achieved the stage of a pure attitude, he or she is called “the one whose attitude is not pure.” However, once he or she has entered [that stage], he or she becomes “the one whose attitude is pure.” Moreover, as long as that very [bodhisattva] whose attitude is pure has not yet achieved the stage that is the perfect manner of going, he is called “the one who is not spiritually ripe.” However, once he has entered [that stage], he becomes “the one who is spiritually ripe.” As long as [a bodhisattva] who is not spiritually ripe has not yet attained the stage of certainty or the stage of certain conduct, he is called “the one for whom certainty has not occurred.” However, once he has attained [either of those stages], he becomes “the one for whom certainty has occurred.” Moreover, there are two types of [bodhisattvas] who are spiritually ripe: (1) [a bodhisattva] hindered by one rebirth who will attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment in his next rebirth, and (2) [a bodhisattva] in his final existence who will attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment within that very lifetime.

These ten bodhisattvas who have been described from the [point at which they are abiding in their] spiritual lineage up to [the point at which they are on the verge of attaining] unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment are the ones who train themselves in the bodhisattva trainings. There are no higher forms of training for them than these, [which include the seven subjects] in relation to which they should train themselves[1215] and [the manner] in which they should train themselves.[1216] Nor is there any bodhisattva who surpasses the bodhisattvas described [here] and who is someone who should train in the bodhisattva trainings.

Regarding this [topic], there are two aspects to the essential nature of [a bodhisattva’s] sympathy: (1) that which relates to his or her attitude and (2) that which relates to his or her activities. Regarding this, [the essential nature] that relates to [a bodhisattva’s] attitude is the attitude of wanting to benefit [sentient beings] and the attitude of wanting to bring [them] happiness. This is called a bodhisattva’s “sympathy toward sentient beings.” The essential nature of [a bodhisattva’s] sympathy that relates to his or her activities is a bodhisattva’s use of his or her body and speech to provide sentient beings with [the aims of] that very attitude, as much as he or she is able and with all his or her strength.
Regarding this [topic], the essential nature of agreeable speech should be understood as those forms of speech that were described previously in the chapter entitled “The Principles for Attracting a Following” as [speech that is] pleasing, friendly, and provides assistance.[1234]

The four forms of informative knowledge, as well as the understanding that arises from correctly applying oneself to develop those [forms of informative knowledge], should be understood as the essential nature of the bodhisattvas’ [ability to] explain profound meanings and intents.

Any sentient beings, including those in the hells, who have entered a state in which they uninterruptedly and continuously experience feelings[1240] characterized by suffering are called “those who are suffering.” Moreover, those beings who are not unavoidably experiencing suffering but who are engaging in physical misconduct and are engaging in verbal and mental misconduct to a great degree, and who have a nature that delights in those [forms of misconduct], are called “those who engage in misconduct.” Examples [of this type of being] are individuals who slaughter sheep, hogs, poultry, and the like. Moreover, those beings who are not unavoidably experiencing suffering and not engaging in misconduct but who are highly attached to sensory pleasures and repeatedly enjoy them; who are chiefly devoted to spending time watching actors, dancers, jesters, and those who perform expressive dance; and who are chiefly concerned with amusing themselves are called “those who are heedless.” An example of a portion [of this overall group] is those individuals who are fond of sensory pleasures. Moreover, those beings who are not unavoidably experiencing suffering, who are not engaging in misconduct, and who are not heedless but who have undertaken to free themselves from suffering by relying upon views that are ruinous are called “those who have undertaken a wrongful [form of] practice.” An example is those who have abandoned sensory pleasures and gone forth into a badly taught system of spiritual discipline. Moreover, those beings who are not necessarily experiencing suffering, etc., up to those who have not undertaken a wrongful [form of] practice but who are completely bound or partially bound by the mental afflictions are called “those who are closely attached to the mental afflictions.” Examples are those virtuous ordinary persons who have applied themselves [to the Dharma] correctly, as well as those [āryas] who are still undergoing spiritual training. This represents the full extent of the [beings who constitute] bases for the sympathy of bodhisattvas. They are the bases and the [mental] objects by means of which sympathy is generated. There are none of greater significance than these and there are none besides these.

Those profound sutra scriptures that the Tathāgata taught in which the profound is illuminated, those that contain [discussions of] emptiness, and those that conform to the [doctrine of] dependent origination [in which] the nature of the particular causes [by which entities are conditioned is revealed] represent the first basis. Further, the skillfulness that relates to [understanding the nature of] transgressions and the skillfulness that relates to turning away from transgressions [as revealed] in the Vinaya scriptures represent the second basis. Moreover, the unerring formulations of the attributes of entities [that are found] in the [Abhidharma] summary listings[1248] represent the third basis. The clear ascertainment of terms and meanings that are associated with obscure Dharma teachings that possess an underlying meaning represents the fourth basis. The differentiation of the entities, meanings, interpretations, and distinct classifications associated with all Dharma teachings represents the fifth basis. [Each of these] is a basis and a [mental] object by means of which the explaining of profound meanings and intents comes into being. There are none of greater significance than these and there are none besides these.

At the very outset, a bodhisattva’s sympathy serves to abandon animosity toward sentient beings. A bodhisattva who is sympathetic in this way applies him- or herself to all the activities that are beneficial to sentient beings without having a dispirited mind. He or she does not become weary of these undertakings. The sympathy that remains dedicated to this [aim] to a high degree is conducive to abiding in a state of irreproachable happiness in this life and also to receiving benefits in future lives. In addition, it should be understood that all the benefits that the Blessed One declared in relation to loving-kindness—that neither poison nor weapons have any [harmful] effect upon [the bodhisattva’s] body, etc.[1249]—are also [acquired] by a bodhisattva who is sympathetic. These should be regarded as the fruits and benefits of the sympathy that is possessed by bodhisattvas.

A bodhisattva who engages in agreeable speech abandons four types of verbal faults in the present life. [The four are] (1) lying, (2) divisive speech, (3) harsh speech, and (4) idle talk. His or her speech is intent upon bringing benefit to self and bringing benefit to others. Both in this life and in future lives, a bodhisattva who engages in agreeable speech becomes one whose speech is accepted and one whose speech is adhered to.

What is the successive order of these [marks]?
First of all, a bodhisattva assists sentient beings on the basis of sympathy. [On the basis of this quality], he or she is also attentive toward them and desirous of acting on their behalf. As a consequence of that, he or she tells them what is proper, causes them to learn [what is proper], and points out to them [what is proper], in order to turn them away from opportunities [to engage in] nonvirtuous [actions] and establish them in opportunities [to engage in] virtuous [actions]. Because of refusing to abandon either beings who are [properly] engaged in practice or beings who are engaged in erroneous practice, [a bodhisattva] is willing to endure hostile encounters with those individuals who have undertaken [to conduct themselves] in the manner [that has been suggested] but who are behaving badly toward [other] beings and who are oppressed in manifold ways by the mental afflictions. [The bodhisattva] who is resolute in this way ripens some beings by attracting them [to the Dharma] using material objects; [he or she ripens] some by attracting them on the basis of the Dharma; and [he or she ripens] some by attracting them using both material objects and the Dharma. It should be understood that this is the order in which the five marks of a bodhisattva [become evident].

These five marks of a bodhisattva are [forms of] the six perfections.
Among the six perfections, which mark is included within which perfection?
Sympathy is included with the perfection of meditative absorption. Agreeable speech is included within both the perfection of morality and the perfection of wisdom. Fortitude is included within the perfection of effort, the perfection of patience, and the perfection of wisdom. Openhandedness is only included within the perfection of generosity. The quality of explaining profound meanings and intents is included within both the perfection of meditative absorption and the perfection of wisdom.
This is how the five marks of a bodhisattva should be understood according to five ways of being considered—that is, according to their essential natures, their bases, their fruits and benefits, their order, and their [manner of] inclusion.

How does a bodhisattva become one who carries out activities in an irreproachable manner, for instance in relation to generosity?
Here a bodhisattva avoids those afflicted forms of generosity that were described in the chapter entitled “Generosity” and practices acts of generosity that are free of affliction.[1253]
This is how a bodhisattva completes the spiritual activities well in relation to generosity. As with generosity, this topic should be understood in a manner that accords with the circumstances for the perfections of morality, patience, effort, meditative absorption, and wisdom in terms of these very same four aspects of (1) carrying out activities in a definite manner, (2) carrying out activities in a proficient manner, (3) carrying out activities continually, and (4) carrying out activities in an irreproachable manner.

In brief, it should be understood as being of ten types: (1) the skillful means that removes the enmity of those beings who have hostile intentions; (2) [the skillful means] that causes those beings who are indifferent [toward the teaching] to enter it; (3) [the skillful means] that spiritually ripens those beings who have entered [the teaching]; (4) the skillful means that liberates those beings who have become spiritually ripe; (5) skillfulness in all worldly treatises; (6) skillfulness gained through carefully considering the errors [that can occur] in relation to adoption of the discipline associated with bodhisattva morality; (7) skillfulness regarding [how to perform] correct aspirational prayers; (8) skillfulness regarding the Listeners’ Vehicle; (9) skillfulness regarding the Solitary Realizers’ Vehicle; and (10) skillfulness regarding the Great Vehicle. The particulars that relate to all these forms of skillfulness should be understood according to the previous descriptions that were made here and there in this very Stage of a Bodhisattva.

These ten forms of a bodhisattva’s skillfulness accomplish five actions: (1) By means of the first four forms of skillfulness, a bodhisattva unites sentient beings with their individual aims. (2) By means of skillfulness in all worldly treatises, a bodhisattva refutes all the verbal challenges made by adversaries. (3) By means of skillfulness gained through carefully considering the errors [that can occur] in relation to adoption of the discipline associated with bodhisattva morality, a bodhisattva avoids committing transgressions. If [a transgression] should be incurred, he or she remedies it in accordance with the Dharma. He or she reflects constantly on [how to keep] exceedingly pure the morality whose discipline has been adopted. (4) By means of skillfulness regarding [how to perform] correct aspirational prayers, a bodhisattva attains success in the future with regard to all his or her desired aims. (5) By means of skillfulness in the three vehicles, a bodhisattva teaches a form of Dharma that corresponds to the [particular] spiritual lineages, faculties, and forms of devotion that are possessed by beings and points out a suitable method of practice. This is how a bodhisattva carries out five actions by means of the ten forms of skillfulness. It is by means of these five actions that all of the duties relating to the aims of both this life and future lives are fully achieved.

Here a bodhisattva, by relying upon the four principles for attracting a following—[namely,] generosity, agreeable speech, beneficial conduct, and sameness of purpose—provides benefit to certain sentient beings, provides happiness [to others], and provides both benefit and happiness [to still others]. This is a brief statement of the assistance that bodhisattvas provide to others.

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s dedication?
Here, with deep-felt faith, a bodhisattva dedicates to unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment any and all roots of virtue of the past, present, or future that he or she has ever collected by these three methods, [namely,] the quality of having completed spiritual activities well, skillfulness, and providing assistance to others. He or she does not wish for the ripening of those roots of virtue in the form of any fruit other than unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment.
It should be understood that whatever elements of spiritual training the Blessed One taught to householder [bodhisattvas][1254] and homeless bodhisattvas, they are all included within these four categories: (1) the quality of having completed spiritual activities well, (2) skillfulness, (3) providing assistance to others, and (4) dedication.

Therefore, it should be understood that for a bodhisattva who has completed the spiritual activities well, who is skillful, who provides assistance to others, and who engages in [the act of] dedication, the enlightenment that is difficult to reach and difficult to attain becomes [a state that] is nearby and in close proximity.
Any and all bodhisattvas of the three times who train themselves in [the elements of spiritual practice that relate to] the factions of householder [bodhisattvas] and homeless bodhisattvas have attained, are attaining, and shall attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment on the basis of these very four spiritual qualities. There are none of greater significance than these and there are none besides these.

Moreover, [the above explanations describe] the manner in which a householder [bodhisattva] and a homeless bodhisattva become correctly applied to these four spiritual qualities. Nevertheless, it should be understood that, compared to [that of] a householder bodhisattva, [the lifestyle of] a bodhisattva who has gone forth into the homeless state is greatly superior and also has qualities that distinguish it greatly. For example, a bodhisattva who is a homeless ascetic is from the very outset free of the faults [associated with] a household that consists of such [family members] as a mother, father, children, and a spouse.[1255] However, it should be understood that a householder [bodhisattva] is not free [of these responsibilities]. Moreover, a bodhisattva who is a homeless ascetic is also free of the suffering associated with [activities] like agriculture, commerce, and service to the king [that are pursued] for the sake of [supporting] one’s household. However, it should be understood that a householder [bodhisattva] is not free [of these difficulties]. Moreover, a bodhisattva who is a homeless ascetic is able to engage in a form of pure spiritual conduct in which he or she adheres to it completely; however, a householder bodhisattva is not able to do so. Moreover, a bodhisattva who is a homeless ascetic quickly becomes knowledgeable about all the spiritual qualities that are conducive to enlightenment, and he or she is able to perfect very easily whatever form of virtue is undertaken. However, a householder bodhisattva cannot accomplish these things in the same way. Moreover, because a bodhisattva who has gone forth [into the homeless state] is observing religious austerities, he or she is one whose speech is accepted by others. However, a householder bodhisattva is not regarded in the same way. Because of such qualities as these, it should be understood that [the lifestyle of] a bodhisattva who is a homeless ascetic is very different from that of a householder bodhisattva.

(1) A bodhisattva is not affectionate due to fear of anyone. He or she acts with favorable deeds of body, speech, and mind that are attractive and that [bring about] both benefit and happiness. (2) Moreover, the affection that a bodhisattva develops toward beings is not one that is lacking in propriety. For example, [it does not occur] in order to induce [others] to take up any form of wickedness,[1257] immodesty,[1258] vulgar conduct,[1259] or conduct that is inappropriate for the occasion. (3) Similarly, a bodhisattva is affectionate toward beings in such a way that he or she never feels weary from all the exertions that are made on their behalf. (4) A bodhisattva also is affectionate toward beings in a manner that is unsolicited; [that is,] he or she has not been asked by anyone [to act favorably]. (5) [A bodhisattva] also possesses an affectionate mind that is free of any desire for material reward; [that is,] he or she does not expect to receive something in return from others nor does he or she hope for a desirable [karmic] maturation in the future. Therefore, he or she is a bodhisattva whose affection toward beings is not prompted by any motive. (6) The affection of such a bodhisattva toward beings is also great; it is not limited. It is so great that even though every kind of harm is done to him or her by other beings, [the bodhisattva] would not reject them. He or she lets them do whatever unkind things they may wish to do to him or her and does not desire [to do] any kind of evil deed to them. (7) Moreover, the affection of bodhisattvas that has such characteristics and that is endowed with these good qualities is felt equally toward all sentient beings in their entirety; it is not limited to a portion of the realm of sentient beings. Those bodhisattvas who are endowed with an affection having these seven aspects are described as “the ones who have a virtuous attitude”[1260] and “the ones who have a supremely virtuous attitude.”[1261]

(1) By means of the attitude that relates to the foremost objects, [bodhisattvas] undertake every aspect of worshipping the [Three] Jewels, which constitutes the foremost among all the accumulations [that are necessary] for enlightenment. (2) By means of the attitude that relates to virtuous conduct, they do not incur any deliberate transgressions in relation to the acceptance of the bodhisattvas’ moral discipline, even to save their lives, and, if they should incur [a transgression], they confess it very quickly. (3) By means of the attitude that relates to the perfections, they abide in a state of mindfulness and they abide in a state of supreme mindfulness through engaging in the continual practice of virtuous qualities. (4) By means of the attitude that relates to the nature of reality, they maintain a mind that is free of the afflictions as they continue to be reborn in samsara for the sake of sentient beings, and they also refrain from giving up the superior attitude [that seeks to attain] nirvana.

(5) By means of the attitude that relates to [spiritual] power, they impart [to others] a deeply felt reverence toward the teaching. They also value meditation highly and maintain a great eagerness [to practice it, that is,] they are not satisfied with learning and reflection alone. (6) By means of the attitude that seeks to benefit [others], the attitude that seeks to bring happiness [to others], and the detached attitude, they undertake every form of activity that accomplishes the aims of others and, having undertaken them, they do not become weary [as they continue to pursue them]. (7) By means of the firm attitude, they initiate and maintain a fervent effort and an extensive effort; they refrain from becoming lax in their practice and they do not develop a defective practice. (8) By means of the attitude that does not disagree with reality, they gain forms of supernatural knowledge that quickly accomplish various kinds of virtuous qualities. They also do not become satisfied merely by attaining lesser forms [of supernatural knowledge] that are smaller and ordinary. (9) By means of the attitude in which the mind needs to be curbed, they bring forth the natural superior attitude.

Regarding this [topic], it should be understood that whatever forms of superior attitude the Buddha, the Blessed One, declared, prescribed, and revealed to bodhisattvas in relation to a variety of different subjects, they can all be included within these very fifteen forms of superior attitude. Therefore, all bodhisattvas of the three times who have attained, are attaining, and shall attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment on the basis of virtuous superior attitudes do so on the basis of these very fifteen forms of superior attitude. There are none of greater significance than these and there are none besides these.

Spiritual lineage; likewise, devotion, joy,
Superior morality, superior mind training,
The three forms of wisdom, the two forms of signlessness—
That which requires effort and that which is effortless—
The [four] forms of informative knowledge, and the supreme.
The highest pleasurable state is that of a tathāgata.
There are, in brief, twelve pleasurable states[1264] that pertain to bodhisattvas, beginning with the excellence of the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage and [including the pleasurable states of those bodhisattvas] who are training themselves in the bodhisattva trainings that were described, who are displaying the marks of bodhisattvas that were described, who are correctly engaged in the practices that relate to the bodhisattvas, and who are refining the bodhisattva superior attitudes that were described. It should be understood that these pleasurable states of bodhisattvas are such that all [forms of] bodhisattva conduct are included within them. The thirteenth pleasurable state is that of a tathāgata and it is the unsurpassed pleasurable state of true and complete enlightenment.

Regarding this [topic], what are the twelve bodhisattva pleasurable states?
[Five are] (1) the pleasurable state of the spiritual lineage; (2) the pleasurable state in which conduct is based upon devotion; (3) the pleasurable state of great joy; (4) the pleasurable state of superior morality; and (5) the pleasurable state of superior mind training.
There are three pleasurable states of superior wisdom: (6) [the pleasurable state of superior wisdom] that relates to the spiritual qualities that are conducive to enlightenment; (7) [the pleasurable state of superior wisdom] that relates to the [four noble] truths; and (8) [the pleasurable state of superior wisdom] that relates to the forward and reverse forms of [the process of] dependent origination. [Of these three, the first represents the pleasurable state] by means of which a bodhisattva perceives reality, [the second represents the pleasurable state] that perceives reality, and [the third represents the pleasurable state which perceives] the manner in which the suffering of sentient beings arises because reality has not been realized as well as [the manner in which their suffering] does not arise because [reality] has been realized. These are the three pleasurable states of superior wisdom in which a bodhisattva employs wisdom to deliberate in three separate ways.
[The last four are] (9) the pleasurable state that is free of signs and is accompanied by both mental preparation and effort, [a pleasurable state] in which one proceeds by a path that is free of interruptions; (10) the pleasurable state that is free of signs and free of any mental preparation, [a pleasurable state] in which one proceeds by a path that is effortless; (11) the pleasurable state of informative knowledge; and (12) the bodhisattva’s supreme and fully developed pleasurable state. These are the twelve types of pleasurable states that pertain to bodhisattvas. They include all of their pleasurable states and they include all forms of bodhisattva conduct.

In addition, the pleasurable state of a tathāgata is the pleasurable state that transcends all the bodhisattva pleasurable states and pertains to the enlightenment of a complete buddha. Regarding this [topic], the final pleasurable state—that is, the one that pertains to a tathāgata—will be presented in its entirety in the final object of mental application, [that is,] the one that relates to the state of preeminence.[1265]
Now I shall describe the manner in which the twelve pleasurable states that pertain to bodhisattvas are formulated.

What is the bodhisattva’s pleasurable state of the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage? How does a bodhisattva who is established in the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage abide?
Here a bodhisattva who is abiding in the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage naturally possesses the qualities of a bodhisattva and the virtuous qualities that are appropriate to a bodhisattva because his or her mental continuum is one that is naturally excellent. He or she is also observed to engage in such forms of proper conduct. He or she engages in those virtues on the basis of natural excellence, not in a forced manner. Nevertheless, he or she is one who maintains restraint on the basis of careful consideration.[1266] The bodhisattva who is abiding in the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage is also one who holds the seeds of all the spiritual qualities possessed by a buddha. All the seeds of the totality of a buddha’s spiritual qualities are present within his or her being and within his or her substratum.
A bodhisattva who is abiding in the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage is also one in whom the coarse impurities are not present. He or she is not one who is capable of exhibiting the type of perturbation of the mental afflictions such that, having become upset by that perturbation, he or she would commit any of the [evil] deeds that have an immediate consequence[1267] or completely sever his or her roots of virtue.[1268]
The comportment of an individual who is established in the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage that was presented in the chapter entitled “The Spiritual Lineage” should be understood as a detailed account of [the conduct of] a bodhisattva who is abiding in the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage. This [mode of behavior] is called “a bodhisattva’s pleasurable state of the spiritual lineage.”

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s pleasurable state of conduct that is based upon devotion?
Here, any bodhisattva conduct whatsoever [that is performed] by a bodhisattva from the time that he or she first generates [enlightenment] mind and throughout the period that his or her attitude remains impure is called his or her “pleasurable state of conduct that is based upon devotion.”[1269]

Regarding this [topic], a bodhisattva who is abiding in the spiritual lineage is only occupied with the causes of all the other eleven pleasurable states of a bodhisattva, as well as [the causes of] the pleasurable state of a tathāgata, in the sense of [attempting to] gain mastery of those causes. However, he or she has not commenced any bodhisattva pleasurable state other than [the pleasurable state of the spiritual lineage], nor has he or she attained or perfected [any other bodhisattva pleasurable state], much less has he or she done so with regard to the pleasurable state of a tathāgata.

<d e="2">
By contrast, the bodhisattva who is abiding in the [pleasurable state of] conduct that is based upon devotion has commenced [the practices that lead to] all of the [other] bodhisattva pleasurable states as well as the pleasurable state of a tathāgata; however, he or she has not attained [any of them] nor perfected [any of them]. The only [pleasurable state] that he or she has attained is the pleasurable state of conduct that is based upon devotion. In addition, this is the only [pleasurable state] that he or she has set out to perfect.

When the pleasurable state of conduct that is based upon devotion has been perfected, [a bodhisattva] attains the initial onset of the pleasurable state of great joy and also becomes one who has set out to perfect that very [pleasurable state]. When the pleasurable state of great joy has been perfected, [a bodhisattva] attains the initial onset of the pleasurable state of superior morality and also becomes one who has set out to perfect that very [pleasurable state]. It should be understood that this process continues in the same way until [one reaches] the bodhisattva’s supreme and fully developed pleasurable state. It should also be understood that immediately after the bodhisattva’s supreme and fully developed pleasurable state has been perfected, the attainment of the initial onset of the pleasurable state of a tathāgata and the perfection [of the pleasurable state of a tathāgata] occur simultaneously. This [final point] should be understood as the characteristic that distinguishes the pleasurable state of a tathāgata from that of [all] the pleasurable states that pertain to bodhisattvas.

It is the pleasurable state that, on the strength of those three [forms of] the pleasurable state of superior wisdom, is accompanied by a [form of] meditation that employs mental preparation and effort [to cultivate] continuously and uninterruptedly the nonconceptual wisdom [that perceives] the suchness that pertains to all entities.

The bodhisattva who is established in this [pleasurable state] is one who has perfected the bodhisattva path and has received the great Dharma consecration that relates to unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment, and he is either one who is [only] subject to one [additional] rebirth or one who is in his final existence. It is the pleasurable state immediately following which and just after which [a bodhisattva] attains unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment and performs all the activities of a buddha.

During the pleasurable state of conduct that is based upon devotion, a bodhisattva practices the bodhisattva [forms of] meditation in a limited way. He or she practices in an intermittent and uncertain manner; that is, he or she repeatedly loses [whatever form of practice] has been gained.

A bodhisattva who is abiding in the pleasurable state of conduct that is based upon devotion is one who possesses the ability to engage in repeated analysis in a powerful manner. Having carefully considered the proper forms of bodhisattva practice, he or she employs wisdom to apply him- or herself to them. However, he or she has not attained [the ability] to practice the bodhisattva [forms of] meditation in that manner naturally, firmly, and irreversibly. As is the case with meditation, the same is true for the various types of informative knowledge, supernatural knowledge, liberations, one-pointed concentration, and states of composure that are the fruit of that meditation. In addition, he or she has not transcended the five fears: (1) the fear of having no livelihood, (2) the fear of gaining a bad reputation, (3) the fear of dying, (4) the fear of [being reborn in] the unhappy migratory states, and (5) the fear of being timid in a group.

Moreover, while he or she does pursue the welfare of sentient beings after having engaged in careful consideration, [a bodhisattva who is abiding in the pleasurable state of conduct that is based upon devotion] does not do so on the basis of an affection [for beings] that stems from a natural [form of] sympathy. Sometimes, he or she even carries out a mistaken form of physical, verbal, or mental practice as relates to sentient beings.[1272] Sometimes, he or she even develops attachment[1273] toward an object. Sometimes, he or she even exhibits the quality of acquisitiveness toward personal possessions.[1274]

These marks, signs, and aspects, and others like them, should be understood as the ones that are possessed by a bodhisattva who is abiding in the pleasurable state of conduct that is based upon devotion.
It should be understood that a bodhisattva who has reached the lesser level of forbearance[1282] on the pleasurable state of conduct that is based upon devotion possesses these [unfavorable] aspects, marks, and signs in a great form. It should be understood that [a bodhisattva] who has reached the middling level of forbearance possesses them in a moderate form. And it should be understood that a bodhisattva who has reached the great level of forbearance possesses these aspects, marks, and signs in a lesser and weakened form. Moreover, it should also be understood that immediately after a bodhisattva who is abiding in the great level of forbearance has completely abandoned these aspects, marks, and signs, he or she enters the pleasurable state of great joy, by virtue of having attained it.
For that [bodhisattva] who is abiding in the pleasurable state of great joy, all of those [unfavorable] qualities are completely and totally gone. Moreover, all those qualities that belong to the side of purity and that are the opposite of the ones that were said to be possessed by [a bodhisattva] who is abiding in the pleasurable state of conduct that is based upon devotion are now present there. By being endowed with these qualities, this bodhisattva is said to be “one who has a pure superior attitude.”
Moreover, for a bodhisattva who is abiding in the pleasurable state of conduct that is based upon devotion, no matter how much the purity of his or her conviction[1283] increases through lesser, middling, and great stages of development, it can never be called “a purity of superior attitude.”

Regarding this [topic], what aspects, what marks, and what signs should a bodhisattva who is abiding in the pleasurable state of great joy be understood to possess?
Here a bodhisattva who enters the pleasurable state of great joy after [having completed] the pleasurable state of conduct that is based upon devotion abandons the former [types of] bodhisattva aspirational prayers [that were dedicated] to [the attainment of] unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment—which did not properly fathom enlightenment and did not properly fathom the means of [attaining] enlightenment, and which were made, for the most part, through relying upon others and [were such that their unerring form] had not yet been fully ascertained—and gives rise to different and new forms of bodhisattva aspirational prayers which, on the basis of [the following] six aspects, are extremely well ascertained and the product of meditation that has been generated by oneself. (1) [These aspirational prayers] completely surpass all other [forms of] virtuous aspirational prayers, they are unequaled, and they have unique results. (2) They are both [an object] that relates to the world and one that completely surpasses all [other] objects that are found throughout all the worlds. (3) Because they have the effect of delivering all sentient beings from suffering, they are distinct from anything that pertains to all the listeners and the solitary realizers. (4) Even if this [type of] aspirational prayer is generated for only a single instant, its Dharma nature is such that it brings the result of immeasurable spiritual qualities that are desired by bodhisattvas. (5) Moreover, these aspirational prayers are not subject to change and they are inexhaustible. Once attained, they are not perceived to undergo any manner of diminution or alteration. (6) Their character is to become ever more excellent, they continue to be effective until the furthest end [of time], and they are conducive to great enlightenment.[1284]

Moreover, this bodhisattva aspirational prayer that has been extremely well ascertained is referred to as “the development of [enlightenment] mind.”[1285] Also, this development of [enlightenment] mind by a bodhisattva should be understood in brief as having four aspects.

Regarding this [topic], this [enlightenment] mind is developed by bodhisattvas who are abiding in the pleasurable state of conduct that is based upon devotion, who have fully collected every form of virtue roots, and who, in brief, have familiarized themselves completely with the correct forms of bodhisattva conduct.
This [enlightenment] mind is developed by bodhisattvas after they have mentally taken hold of [the following objects as things] to be swiftly and correctly accomplished in the future: the perfection of all the accumulations [that are necessary to achieve] enlightenment, the perfection of all the ways that a bodhisattva acts on behalf of sentient beings, [the attainment of] unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment, the perfection of every aspect of the spiritual qualities possessed by a buddha, and the perfection of the activities that are performed by a buddha.

This [enlightenment] mind is also developed [in a form] that swiftly and correctly accords with all the forms of all the accumulations [that are necessary to achieve] enlightenment, [in a form] that [swiftly and correctly] accords with all the kinds of bodhisattva activities that should be carried out in relation to sentient beings, [in a form] that [swiftly and correctly] accords with attaining the self-originated knowledge of unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment, and [in a form] that [swiftly and correctly] accords with carrying out every kind of a buddha’s activities.
In addition, through having developed this [enlightenment] mind, a bodhisattva has gone beyond the stage of an immature bodhisattva who is an ordinary person.[1287] He has entered into the bodhisattva’s state of certainty.[1288] He has been born into the family of the tathāgatas. He is a spiritual son born from the Tathāgata’s breast.[1289] He is one who with certainty is destined to reach complete enlightenment and one who is established in the lineage of the tathāgatas. Being of such a nature, he attains the faith that is born of insight[1290] and experiences great elation.

He greatly avoids being contentious, wanting to do harm, or developing anger toward others. With a pure superior attitude, [this bodhisattva] holds in mind every way in which bodhisattvas act on behalf of sentient beings and every way in which to perfect all the accumulations [that are necessary for] enlightenment, as well as every aspect of enlightenment, of a buddha’s spiritual qualities, and of the manner in which a buddha’s activities are carried out. He maintains strong devotion [toward these aims] and undertakes [to achieve] them. Seeing and realizing himself to be in accord with the swift attainment of these [goals], he feels great elation.
[He has the following thoughts:] “I am endowed with extensive virtue that relates to departure [from the world], is free of desire, and is unequaled; I am endowed with an elation that benefits both body and mind; and I am endowed with intense forms of virtuous qualities. I am also near to unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment. My superior attitude toward great enlightenment is completely pure. All my fears are gone.” For these reasons, too, he feels great elation.

The five fears that have ceased for a bodhisattva who has developed the extremely well-ascertained form of [enlightenment] mind are as follows. (1) Since belief in a self no longer arises for [the bodhisattva] who has cultivated well the knowledge of selflessness, how then could he develop attachment toward a self or attachment for those things that are a means of subsistence? Therefore, he has no fear of being without a livelihood. (2) He also does not hope to receive anything from others. This is what [such a bodhisattva] desires: “May I be able to provide these beings with every [kind of] object.” Therefore, he has no fear of gaining a bad reputation. (3) Because the view that believes in a self is gone, he no longer develops the belief that the self will cease to exist. Therefore, he has no fear of dying. (4) He forms the following certain conviction: “In the future [lives] following my death, I am sure to meet with buddhas and bodhisattvas.” Therefore, he has no fear of [being reborn in] the unhappy migratory states. (5) He thinks, “Throughout the entire world, no one[1291] is seen to have a [spiritual] attitude that is the equal of mine, much less one that is higher.” Therefore, he has no fear of becoming timid in a group.

In these ways, he is one in whom all fears are gone, one in whom all trepidation about instructions regarding the profound is gone, one in whom all arrogance and pride due to having an elevated status[1292] are gone, one in whom all hatred toward those who commit acts of harm and wrongful behavior is gone, and one in whom all excitement about worldly [forms of] enjoyment is gone.
With a [spiritual] attitude that is unimpaired because it is free of mental afflictions and that is extraordinary because of its fervor, he generates every form of bodhisattva effort in this life in order to attain every form of virtuous quality, and he does so governed by and preceded by faith. While on this pleasurable state of great joy, with regard to the future he also carries out, based upon the purity of his attitude, the ten great aspirational prayers that were described previously in the chapter entitled “The Spiritual Qualities That Are Conducive to Enlightenment.”[1293]

[That bodhisattva] also fixes [his aspirational mind] correctly in the following manner: “In an uninterrupted manner that resembles both the limitlessness of the realm of sentient beings and the limitlessness of worldly qualities, may these great aspirational prayers of mine never fail to come to pass, never be lost [from my mind], and never become disconnected [from their intended aims], in rebirth after rebirth until I reach the ultimate goal of enlightenment.”

In order to perfect the pleasurable state of great joy, ten spiritual qualities are developed by the [bodhisattva] who, in this manner, has carried out aspirational prayers that relate to the future and has generated effort in this life. He develops intense faith toward all the spiritual qualities of a buddha. Through perceiving how the entire mass of suffering that sentient beings experience comes about through the process of dependent origination, compassion [arises]. Through reflecting, “I must be the one who liberates sentient beings from this entire mass of suffering,” loving-kindness [arises]. Through having the intention to save [sentient beings] from their suffering, [there arises] a lack of concern for oneself. The renunciation [that gives away] inner and outer objects to sentient beings [is developed] by one who possesses such a lack of concern [for himself]. The tirelessness that seeks mundane and transcendent qualities from others for the sake of those very sentient beings also [is developed]. Knowledge of the teachings [is developed] by one who is tireless about perfecting the attainment of knowledge of the entire [body of] teachings. Knowledge of the world [is developed] by one who has knowledge of the teachings, in the sense of [knowing how] to engage in practices that accord with lesser, intermediate, and superior sentient beings in a manner that befits their circumstances. Shame and abashment concerning the observance of a [proper] time, opportunity, and measure in relation to those very activities also [is developed]. The power of firmness [is developed] in the sense that one never turns back from those very activities. In addition, the qualities of worshipping and serving the tathāgatas [are developed] through [cultivating] the practices of [offering] both [material] gain and honor.

Having taken up these ten qualities, the bodhisattva observes them and practices them extensively. In addition, he seeks [to learn] from the buddhas and bodhisattvas every aspect of the path’s virtuous qualities and faults that pertain to the remaining nine pleasurable states of superior morality, etc. Having become knowledgeable regarding these [subjects], it is easy for him to avoid losing the way on the path and he becomes one who has properly taken up the signs that relate to the aspects, the attainments, and their successive effects. After having proceeded through all the pleasurable states, he reaches great enlightenment. He also conveys a great company of sentient beings along the path that leads them out of samsara’s wilderness. It should be understood that these aspects are the ones by means of which [a bodhisattva] enters [the various pleasurable states]; entry [into the pleasurable states] is their attainment; and the arising and realization of those great results and benefits [that are achieved] by [a bodhisattva] who has entered [any of the pleasurable states] are their successive effects.

On the basis of two causes, many buddhas appear to the vision of [the bodhisattva] who is established in this pleasurable state. These [buddhas] are both the ones that he has learned about in the bodhisattva collection of scriptures and the ones toward whom he has developed devotion. They are tathāgatas who have many different names [and who exist] in world spheres having many different names that lie throughout the ten directions. With a mind possessed of great faith, he implores them to let themselves be seen. This entreaty of [the bodhisattva] who has such a nature continues to grow ever stronger. This is one of the causes. He also generates the following aspirational prayer: “May I take birth in that [world] where a buddha has appeared.” This aspirational prayer of [the bodhisattva] who has such a nature continues to grow ever stronger. Having seen these tathāgatas on the basis of a vision that is gained through sincere faith and by means of the strength of his aspirational prayers, he provides them with every form of worship and means of comfort. With all his ability and strength, he also honors the Sangha. He also listens to the Dharma from those tathāgatas, and then both takes up [the Dharma] and maintains it. He successfully implements [those Dharma teachings] by means of a [form of] practice that accords with the Dharma.[1296] He dedicates these roots of virtue to great enlightenment. He ripens sentient beings by means of the four principles for attracting a following.

By means of these three purifying causes—worshipping and paying homage to the tathāgatas, the Dharma, and the Sangha; ripening beings with the principles for attracting a following; and dedicating roots of virtue to enlightenment—[the bodhisattva’s] roots of virtue are purified to an ever-greater degree over a period lasting many trillions of trillions of kalpas. For example, gold that is in its natural state becomes ever more pure as it is repeatedly placed into fire by an expert smith. In the same way, the virtue roots of a bodhisattva who possesses a pure attitude become ever more refined by means of these purifying causes.

Moreover, as a form of birth, the [bodhisattva] who is established on this [pleasurable state] mostly becomes a wheel ruler who is lord of the Rose Apple Continent in rebirth after rebirth. Having become free of all forms of the stain of stinginess, he is a master at removing the stinginess that is possessed by [other] sentient beings. Whatever action he undertakes on the basis of [any of] the four principles for attracting a following never fails to be accompanied by thoughts that are directed toward the [Three] Jewels and the attainment of every aspect of enlightenment. He reflects, “How much I wish to become the foremost among all sentient beings and the one who is relied upon for every need.”

If he wishes to, he can initiate the kind of effort that is willing to give up home, spouse, and all his wealth, and go forth into the Tathāgata’s teaching. Having done so, he can enter a hundred bodhisattva concentrations within a single instant, moment, or brief period;[1297] see a hundred tathāgatas in their separate buddha fields with his divine eye; and perceive the magical emanations and supernatural power of those [buddhas] as well as the supernatural power of bodhisattvas. He can cause a hundred world spheres to shake[1298] and, similarly, can travel to them with his body. Having filled [those worlds] with light, he can reveal them to others. By [generating] a hundred magical emanations, he can ripen a hundred sentient beings who are suitable to be disciplined. If he wishes to, he can also empower himself to remain alive for a hundred kalpas. His knowledge-perception can reach a hundred kalpas into the past or the future.[1299] He can examine a hundred Dharma doors,[1300] which are Dharma doors for such topics as the heaps, the constituents, and the bases.[1301] He can magically create a hundred physical forms [of himself] and also manifest a hundred bodhisattvas as a retinue for each of those physical forms.

Beyond these qualities, it should be understood that bodhisattvas who are established in this pleasurable state of great joy are able to produce immeasurable numbers of supernatural magical creations on the strength of aspirational prayers, for they are beings who possess the power of aspirational prayers and, by means of special kinds of aspirational prayers, they generate [magical creations].[1302] It would not be easy to count the number of these correct aspirational prayers, even if one spent up to a trillion trillion kalpas trying to do so.
It should be understood that this represents a brief description of the bodhisattvas’ pleasurable state of great joy, in terms of [the aspirational prayers] that are extremely well ascertained, in terms of the four aspects of the [enlightenment] mind that is developed, in terms of the correct aspirational prayers that are carried out and the effort that is generated, in terms of the manner in which this pleasurable state is perfected, in terms of the manner in which the subsequent pleasurable states are caused to arise, in terms of the manner in which roots of virtue are refined, in terms of [the forms of] rebirth [that occur], and in terms of the spiritual powers [that are possessed].

Regarding this [point], it is called a “stage” in the sense of being [a position] that bodhisattvas take possession of[1304] and it is called a “pleasurable state” in the sense of being [a position] in which they remain in a state of enjoyment.[1305]

Regarding this [topic], what aspects, what marks, and what signs should the bodhisattvas [who are abiding] in the pleasurable state of superior morality be understood to possess?
In this case, a bodhisattva first attains a purity of attitude that is characterized by ten types of mental attitude while he is still [abiding] in the pleasurable state of great joy. They are (1) the superior attitude that never violates a promise made to any spiritual teacher, anyone worthy of respect, or anyone worthy of being venerated; (2) the attitude that is genial toward those bodhisattvas who are exemplary Dharma practitioners and dwells happily with them; (3) the attitude that exercises control over one’s own mind and overcomes all the root and secondary mental afflictions and deeds of Māra;[1306] (4) the attitude that all [conditioning] formations[1307] are flawed; (5) the attitude that nirvana is advantageous; (6) the attitude that the virtuous entities that are conducive to enlightenment are to be cultivated continually; (7) the attitude of [wanting to live in] solitude because it is conducive to meditation upon those [spiritual qualities]; (8) the attitude that is indifferent to worldly objects of desire and positions of eminence, as well as gain and honor; (9) the attitude that rejects the Lesser Vehicle and [seeks to] master the Great Vehicle; and (10) the attitude that [wants to] accomplish all the aims of all sentient beings. It is due to the arising of these ten correct attitudes in the mind that [a bodhisattva’s] attitude is said to be purified. Moreover, through having developed these same ten attitudes to a level of greatness and having brought them to a state of fullness, a bodhisattva enters into and advances along the second [of the ten ārya bodhisattva pleasurable states], which is the pleasurable state of superior morality.

While on the pleasurable state of superior morality, [a bodhisattva] becomes one who observes morality naturally. He does not engage in even very minor forms of immorality that are included among the wrongful action-paths,[1308] much less any of the middling or great forms. He also naturally displays complete forms of the ten virtuous action-paths. [The bodhisattva] who observes morality naturally in this way uses [wisdom] to discern correctly the process by which deeds that are afflicted or unafflicted action-paths constitute causes that give rise to the results of [being reborn in either] the unhappy or the happy migratory states, [as well as to discern correctly the process by which virtuous deeds constitute causes that give rise to the various respective results] within the three vehicles. He also correctly discerns [the nature of] deeds in terms of their maturation results and corresponding results.[1309]

[Such a bodhisattva] can be seen to abandon nonvirtuous deeds and take up virtuous deeds. He also wants to cause others to take up this same behavior and [in fact] causes them to do so. Through feeling sympathetic toward the entire realm of sentient beings who are defiled by the fault of having engaged in wicked deeds, who without exception are suffering in an ultimate sense whether they are in prosperous or unfortunate circumstances, and who live in a state of adversity that subjects them to multiple forms of calamity, [the bodhisattva] develops [toward all those sentient beings] a [form of] sympathy that is extensive and repeatedly considers [their condition].
It should be understood that, as in the previous [pleasurable state], [the bodhisattva] who is established in this pleasurable state of superior morality sees [many] buddhas and purifies his roots of virtue. In this case there is the following difference. For example, just as that same gold that is being placed into fire by an expert smith becomes even more pure when it is also dipped in vitriol, it should be understood that this bodhisattva’s roots of virtue similarly [achieve an even greater form of] purity.

Because the purity of [a bodhisattva’s] mental attitude in this pleasurable state has reached a point of culmination, he is mostly reborn as a wheel ruler with dominion over all four continents, and to a great degree causes beings to turn away from immorality and the nonvirtuous action-paths and to take up the virtuous action-paths. It should be understood that his powers are ten times greater than they were during the previous [pleasurable state].
It should be understood that this represents a brief description of the bodhisattvas’ pleasurable state of superior morality, in terms of the natural observance of morality, in terms of the elimination of every aspect of the impurity of immorality, in terms of the knowledge that fathoms every aspect of the causes and results that pertain to every [form of] action-path, in terms of the desire to cause others to take up virtuous deeds, in terms of the development of extensive sympathy [toward sentient beings], in terms of reflection upon the suffering and misfortune that [those in] the realm of sentient beings create by their deeds, in terms of the purification of roots of virtue, in terms of [the forms of] rebirth [that occur], and in terms of the spiritual powers [that are possessed].

In addition, a more extensive description can be found in the sutra itself, within the section of the Sutra on the Ten Stages that addresses the stainless stage. It is called the “stainless stage”[1310] because the stain of immorality is gone. It is called the “pleasurable state of superior morality” for the very same reason that the stain of immorality is gone. It should be understood that what is [referred to] there as the stainless stage is [referred to] here as the pleasurable state of superior morality.

Regarding this [topic], what aspects, what marks, and what signs are possessed by bodhisattvas [who are abiding] in the pleasurable state of superior mind training?
In this case, a bodhisattva previously brought to mind, delighted in, and thoroughly comprehended ten [forms of] pure attitude while he was still [abiding] in the pleasurable state of superior morality. By employing ten further ways of bringing to mind these pure attitudes in order to develop them to a level of greatness and bring them to fullness, he rises above the pleasurable state of superior morality and enters the pleasurable state of superior mind training. He enters [this pleasurable state] by bringing to mind the following ten mental attitudes: (1) the form of attention [in which he reflects], “My mental attitude is pure in ten ways”; (2) the form of attention [in which he reflects], “It is improper for me to lose [any of] these ten kinds of virtuous attitude”; (3) the form of attention [in which he reflects], “My mind does not rush toward [any of] the outflows or [any of] the entities that are related to the outflows; it remains in a state of opposition to them”; (4) the form of attention [in which he reflects], “My consciousness remains fixed in meditation upon their antidotes”; (5) the form of attention [in which he reflects], “It is improper for me to subsequently lose [any of] these antidotes”;

The bodhisattva who is established in the pleasurable state of superior mind training discredits[1311] conditioning formations on the basis of their manifold disadvantages. He also deliberately develops aversion[1312] toward them. He regards a buddha’s knowledge favorably on the basis of its manifold benefits, and develops a longing for it with an aspiration that is deeply felt.[1313] He observes that the realm of sentient beings is afflicted by manifold forms of suffering and develops a mind that has concern for sentient beings and a mind that resorts to what will benefit them. He remains mindful with regard to all conditioning formations and possesses a form of effort that pur sues enlightenment ardently. He possesses an attitude that feels abundant compassion toward sentient beings.

He recognizes that the sole means of liberating sentient beings from suffering permanently is the knowledge that is completely free of the obstruction caused by the mental afflictions. He also recognizes that, for the purpose of bringing about that liberation, wisdom regarding the “entity-source”[1314] is the antidote for all occurrences of conceptual thought and for the arising of afflicted existence.[1315] He further recognizes that true one-pointed concentration [is necessary] to perfect that light of knowledge. He recognizes as well that attainment of the meditative absorptions, the deliverances,[1316] [the forms of] one-pointed concentration, and the states of composure must be preceded by learning the bodhisattva collection of scriptures and that such learning constitutes their cause.
Having understood [these things], he undertakes to seek such learning by putting forth great effort. There is no [form of] property, possession, or inner or outer object that he would not give up for the sake of learning the true Dharma. There is no form of service to a venerable teacher that he would not accept. There is no act of humility[1317] that he would not accept. There is no physical pain that he would not accept. He is more pleased at hearing a single verse [of Dharma that consists] of four lines than if he [were to obtain] a great heap of jewels so large that it would fill the triple-thousand [world spheres]. He is more pleased at hearing a single Dharma saying on the purification of bodhisattva activities that was taught by a true and complete buddha than if he were to obtain birth in all such positions as those of Śakra, Māra, Brahmā, a Lokapāla, or a wheel ruler.

If someone were to say to him: “I will enable you to hear a Dharma statement on the purification of bodhisattva activities that was taught by a true and complete buddha if you will throw yourself into a great pit of fire and agree to undergo that great suffering,” upon hearing this, he would think, “For the sake of that Dharma statement . . . I would endure throwing myself from Brahmā’s domain into a pit of fire equal in size to the great triple-thousand [world spheres], let alone into an ordinary [pit of fire]. We should seek the Buddha’s Dharma teachings even if it means having to endure the suffering of the hells multiple times, not to mention having to undergo ordinary [forms of] suffering.”
Having sought Dharma teachings while putting forth this kind of effort, he properly brings to mind the following thought: “The Buddha’s Dharma teachings should be pursued in accordance with the form of practice that accords with Dharma, not merely by perfecting [one’s knowledge of] the form of expression and sound [with which the teachings are conveyed].” After having gained such an understanding and relying upon that very learning, by correctly taking up the signs of entities[1318] as meditation objects, [the bodhisattva successively] achieves and abides in the first, second, third, and fourth mundane meditative absorptions, the four mundane states of composure of the formless realm, the four immeasurables, and the five forms of supernatural knowledge,[1319] which are described in the scriptural passages that declare “separated from the objects of desire,”[1320] etc.

After having stayed in these [meditative states] extensively, [the bodhisattva] turns away from the meditative absorptions, one-pointed concentrations, and states of composure, and by the strength of aspirational prayers is reborn in the desire realm in places where he perceives that the welfare of beings [can be accomplished] and the spiritual qualities that are conducive to enlightenment can be perfected. It is not the case that he takes birth by the power of those [meditative states].[1321]
Through having overcome desire for the desire realm, [a bodhisattva’s] bonds of desire are abandoned.[1322] Through having turned away from the meditative absorptions, one-pointed concentrations, and states of composure, [a bodhisattva] abandons the bonds of existence.[1323] The bonds that were generated by [erring] views were previously abandoned while [that bodhisattva] was still on the stage in which practice is based upon devotion, on the strength of his conviction about the suchness [that is the ultimate nature] of [all] entities. His wrongful [emotions of] desire, anger, and ignorance have become completely inactive.

The manner in which he sees [many] buddhas and purifies his roots of virtue should be understood as it was described at length previously.[1324] In this instance there is the following difference. For example, just as the gold from which impurities and contaminants have been removed retains the same weight and measure in the hands of a skillful smith, it should be understood that this [bodhisattva’s] roots of virtue also become purified in the same way.[1325] In terms of rebirth, for the most part he becomes Śakra, the lord of gods, and one who is skilled at turning sentient beings away from desire for sensory pleasures. It should be understood that the spiritual powers described in the previous pleasurable state in a magnitude of a thousand are possessed here in a magnitude of a hundred thousand.

In addition, a more extensive description can be found in the sutra itself, within the section of the Sutra on the Ten Stages that addresses the stage that produces light. Because this stage is characterized by the appearance of the light of the Dharma in the form of learning and the appearance of the light that consists of one-pointed concentration, it is called “[the stage that] produces light.”[1326] This light comes into being due to the inner purity of the mind. Therefore, this pleasurable state is called [the pleasurable state of] “superior mind training.” [As such,] it should be understood that the very same reason [for calling this] the stage that produces light is also the reason [for calling it] the pleasurable state of superior mind training.

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s pleasurable state of superior wisdom that relates to the spiritual qualities that are conducive to enlightenment?
In this case, a bodhisattva previously attained ten [forms of] entry into the light of the Dharma[1327] on the strength of his having pursued learning, while he was still in the pleasurable state of superior mind training. Through developing those to a level of greatness and bringing them to fullness, he goes beyond the pleasurable state of superior mind training and enters the first pleasurable state of superior wisdom. Furthermore, the wording for the ten forms of entry into the light of the Dharma should be understood just as it appears in the sutra. The essential import of what is indicated by these [ten forms of entry] into the light of the Dharma should be understood as follows: (1) the beings who are nominally designated; (2) the place where it is nominally designated that they exist; (3) the reason that they are nominally designated entities;[1328] (4) what those [nominally designated sentient beings] resemble in an ultimate sense; (5) the entity whose affliction and purification causes [nominally designated sentient beings] to become afflicted and undergo purification; (6) the state of affliction their relation to which causes them to become afflicted; and (7) the unsurpassed form of purity which causes them to be purified.[1329]
The bodhisattva who is established in this pleasurable state possesses [a series of] spiritual qualities, beginning with an adamantine attitude, that bring about the ripening of his knowledge. They are described in the sutra as causing one’s knowledge to be ripened in ten ways. Through acquiring the [ten] qualities that possess this nature, he becomes one who has joined the family of the tathāgatas.

As described in the sutra, [these bodhisattvas] meditate upon the thirty-seven spiritual qualities that are conducive to enlightenment, beginning with the [four] closely placed recollections, [and they do so] on the basis of every aspect of the bodhisattva perspective.[1330] Through cultivating those spiritual qualities in a manner that is supported by skillful means, even subtle forms of the perishable collection view, as well as all the impulses to believe that the heaps, bases, and constituents are real, are abandoned in the sense that they become completely inactive. Through their abandonment, [the bodhisattva] completely and entirely refrains from engaging in those acts that the Tathāgata disapproves of. In addition, he also pursues in a proper manner all those acts that the Tathāgata approves of. Having developed such a nature, he becomes one whose mind is increasingly more agreeable, gentle, and endowed with fitness.[1331] Likewise, he becomes one whose mind is extremely pure in a variety of ways. He becomes one who possesses a range of virtuous qualities that are in keeping with those attitudes, including gratitude and appreciation [for past benefits], etc. Seeking [to cultivate] the acts that purify the higher stages, he achieves and maintains the ability to put forth great effort. Because of that, the constituent elements of his attitude, superior attitude, and [form of] devotion[1332] become fully developed. Because of that, he also becomes incapable of being led astray or shaken [in resolve] by any heretics, [influence of] Māra, or persons who are hostile to the teaching.

The manner in which [a bodhisattva] sees [many] buddhas and purifies his roots of virtue should be understood as it was described at length previously. In this instance there is the following difference. For example, just as that same gold that a skillful smith has fashioned into decorative objects cannot be outshone by gold that has not been made into ornaments, this bodhisattva’s roots of virtue cannot be outshone by the virtue roots of bodhisattvas who are established on other less developed pleasurable states. For example, the light that is emitted by the [wheel ruler’s] precious jewel[1333] cannot be outshone by that of any other jewels and its splendor cannot be destroyed by any form of wind, water, or rain. Similarly, this bodhisattva cannot be outshone by all the listeners and solitary realizers nor can the light of his wisdom be destroyed by any form of Māra or other adversary.

In terms of rebirth, he becomes a king of the class of gods known as Suyāma[1334] and one who is skilled at removing the perishable collection view that is possessed by sentient beings.

Regarding this [topic], what is the bodhisattvas’ second pleasurable state of superior wisdom—that is, the one that relates to the truths?
Here a bodhisattva enters the second pleasurable state of superior wisdom by developing to a level of greatness and bringing to fullness the ten [forms of] sameness of purified attitude[1336] that were attained on the previous pleasurable state of superior wisdom. The wording for the ten [forms of] sameness of purified attitude should be understood as it appears in the sutra. The essential import of [the forms of] sameness of purified attitude should be understood as follows: The buddhas are the same in the sense that they are the enlightened ones who are unequaled and because they have gone completely beyond the sphere of [unenlightened] sentient beings from whom they are distinct. They are also the same in terms of the spiritual qualities that they possess and in terms of the manner in which they possess them.

[The bodhisattva] who in this manner has developed skill regarding [the ten forms of] truth uses his wisdom to correctly discredit all conditioning formations. He strengthens a compassionate attitude toward the realm of sentient beings. He correctly discerns the wrong forms of practice that immature sentient beings carry out in relation to both the past and the future. He firmly fixes his [mind] upon [the aim of] acquiring a great quantity of the merit and wisdom accumulations in order to liberate those [beings] and also develops an attitude that is directed toward that [aim]. He becomes abundantly endowed with a multitude of different kinds of virtuous qualities, beginning with recollection, understanding, and realization.

Out of compassion for sentient beings and with the aim of ultimately establishing them in enlightenment, [this bodhisattva] engages in every kind of secular occupation and craft that is beneficial to sentient beings, such as scribal work, treatises, signing, counting, keeping security deposits, etc.,[1339] as mentioned in the sutra. The summary import of the occupations and crafts that are beneficial to sentient beings should be understood as follows: With the aim of [benefiting sentient beings] progressively until they have been brought to enlightenment, [the bodhisattva engages in these occupations] in a manner that conforms with the affairs of secular life, using methods for overcoming poverty; by removing imbalances of the [body’s four] elements and the harm that is inflicted by humans and nonhuman [spirits]; by turning [sentient beings] away from wicked forms of pleasure through providing them with objects [that can be used to engage in] irreproachable forms of entertainment and enjoyment; by enabling those who desire the [structural and environmental] elements that are needed for communal living to obtain those elements with little difficulty; by providing protection from the harm that is inflicted by the king, robbers, and the like; by approving of proper activities and forbidding improper ones; by causing beings to take up auspicious subjects and abandon inauspicious ones; and by teaching beings not to injure one another in this life and [to pursue] the correct paths [that will lead] to a high status in future lives.

[The descriptions regarding] everything else [about this pleasurable state] are the same as the ones that were given previously. Regarding this [pleasurable state], there is the following difference. For example, just as that same gold which a skillful smith has embellished with sapphires and adorned in an incomparable manner cannot be outshone by any other kinds of gold, this bodhisattva cannot be outshone by any of the listeners and solitary realizers or by the bodhisattvas who are established in any of the other [lesser] stages. For example, just as the light of the moon, the sun, and the stars remains undiverted by all the whirlwinds even as [these sources of light] all share the quality of being conveyed by the wind,[1340] the wisdom of this bodhisattva cannot be diverted by any of the listeners and solitary realizers even as it also operates in concert with worldly activities.[1341]

It should be understood that this represents a brief description of the bodhisattvas’ pleasurable state of superior wisdom that relates to the truths, in terms of its being entered by perfecting [forms of] a sameness of pure attitude; in terms of strengthening the manner in which [skillful] means and the truths are investigated; in terms of discrediting all [forms of] conditioning formations; in terms of the strengthening of one’s compassionate attitude toward sentient beings; in terms of generating aspirational prayers to collect the merit and wisdom accumulations for the sake of those [sentient beings]; in terms of strengthening such virtuous qualities as recollection, understanding, and realization; in terms of having no other thought except applying oneself to the ripening of sentient beings in every manner; in terms of their engaging in secular occupations; in terms of the purification of roots of virtue; in terms of [the forms of] rebirth [that occur]; and in terms of the spiritual powers [that are possessed]. A more extensive description can be found in the sutra itself, in the section of the Sutra on the Ten Stages that addresses the stage on which it is very difficult to be overcome. [This is a stage where] it is very difficult for the knowledge [of a bodhisattva] that possesses certainty about the truths to be overcome. This is also what has been elucidated here. That is why this stage is called [the stage on which it is] “very difficult to be overcome.”[1342] For the very same reason, [this stage] should also be regarded as the pleasurable state of superior wisdom that relates to the truths.

Regarding this [topic], what is the bodhisattva’s pleasurable state of superior wisdom that relates to dependent origination?
In this case, a bodhisattva attains ten [forms of] sameness that apply to all entities while still on the pleasurable state of superior wisdom that relates to the truths. The wording [that describes] them should be understood as it appears in the sutra. Through developing these [ten forms of sameness] to a level of greatness and bringing them to fullness, he gains entry to this pleasurable state. The individual meanings of these ten forms of sameness that apply to [all] entities should be understood as follows:[1343] [The bodhisattva enters this pleasurable state] by means of (1) the sameness in which all entities [are perceived to] lack any sign of an essence that exists in an ultimate sense, (2) the sameness in which [all entities are perceived to] lack any attribute [that is possessed] by the appearances that are described with words and that carry out actions, (3) the sameness in which [all entities are perceived] not to have been born [in such a way that they exist] on their own due to the nonexistence of that very attribute, (4) the sameness in which [all entities are perceived] not to have arisen from a cause, (5) the sameness in which [all entities are perceived to] have always been completely tranquil[1344] because they have not arisen [in such a way that they exist] on their own and [they have not arisen] from causes, (6) the sameness in which [all entities are perceived to be] free of elaboration[1345] when the [transcendent] awareness that apprehends reality is present,

[The bodhisattva] who is established in this pleasurable state is one whose compassion toward sentient beings has increased greatly and one who has generated an intense aspiration and desire for enlightenment. He exam ines and discerns the origin and disintegration of the worlds by correctly scrutinizing [the doctrine of] dependent origination in every way. He also develops [an understanding of] the three doors to liberation that is based upon this knowledge of dependent origination—namely, [the door to liberation] of emptiness, [the door to liberation] of signlessness, and [the door to liberation] of wishlessness.[1350] Because of that, he does not give rise to the conceptions of self and other, an agent [that performs actions] and a being that experiences[1351] [the results of those actions], or existence and nonexistence.

[The bodhisattva] who in this manner has developed skill regarding ultimate truth and who possesses concern for sentient beings correctly comprehends the following: “Conditioned entities—which are naturally weak, which neither constitute a self nor belong to a self, and which are marred by a multitude of faults—come into being through a connection with the mental afflictions and through the convergence of causal conditions. They will not [come into being] in the absence of a connection with the mental afflictions and when those causal conditions have not converged. Therefore, I should disrupt the connection with the mental afflictions and the convergence of the causal conditions in order to safeguard myself, but I should not completely and totally put an end to conditioned entities so that I may continue to benefit sentient beings.”

Through being one whose face is turned toward the pleasurable state [in which one abides in the form of] the perfection of wisdom that is called “facing unobstructed knowledge,” [the bodhisattva] collects the causal factors that bring forth enlightenment but does not remain in a state of continuous association with worldly conditioned entities. He perceives the quietude[1352] [represented by their emptiness] to be a state of peace but does not settle down in it. A hundred thousand sets of ten doors to one-pointed concentration [on emptiness], beginning with the [set of ten in which the first] one-pointed concentration [is the one named] “the emptiness that enters,” become manifest to [the bodhisattva] who has attained this knowledge that includes [both] means and wisdom. It should be understood that, just as with the [hundred thousand sets of] one-pointed concentration on emptiness, the same also occurs for one-pointed concentration on wishlessness and [one-pointed concentration] on signlessness.

[The rest of this analogy is] as was described previously. For example, just as the light of the moon refreshes the bodies of sentient beings and is a light that cannot be destroyed by any of the four spheres of wind, similarly the light of wisdom possessed by this bodhisattva extinguishes the burning fires of all sentient beings’ mental afflictions and it cannot be destroyed by any [of the forms of] Māra or by any hostile persons.

Regarding this [topic], what is the bodhisattvas’ pleasurable state that is free of signs and is accompanied by both mental preparation and effort?
In this case, immediately following the [third] pleasurable state of superior wisdom, a bodhisattva attains ten extraordinary ways of undertaking a distinct path[1355] which are accomplished by both means and wisdom, and which, though mundane in nature, have nothing in common with all [ordinary] sentient beings and all [samsaric] worlds. Through developing them to a level of greatness and bringing them to fullness, he enters the seventh pleasurable state. The extensive wording [that describes] them should be understood as it appears in the sutra. In brief, the principal concerns of these ten extraordinary ways of undertaking a distinct path, which are qualities that are produced by both means and wisdom, should be understood as follows. They relate to (1) the acquisition of the merit that produces mundane forms of excellence; (2) the attitude that wishes to benefit and bring happiness to sentient beings; (3) increasing to a higher level the merit accumulation and the spiritual qualities that are conducive to enlightenment, in order to [achieve] enlightenment; (4) being separate from the listeners; (5) being separate from the solitary realizers; (6) the entity-source of sentient beings; (7) the entity-source of the worlds; and knowledge of a tathāgata’s (8) body, (9) speech, and (10) mind.

Endowed with these [qualities, the bodhisattva] comprehends the immeasurable and innumerable objects that constitute a tathāgata’s sphere of action. Perceiving as well that a tathāgata’s immeasurable sphere of action arises by means of [the attributes of] effortlessness, signlessness, and becoming free of concepts and conceptual thoughts,[1356] he applies himself continuously and without interruption, in all physical behavior, conduct, pleasurable states of abiding, and forms of attention, to the aim of generating that [ability]. In every situation that [the bodhisattva] is in, he never strays from the path. In each moment of thought, all the spiritual qualities that are conducive to enlightenment, headed by the ten perfections, are being developed to an extraordinary degree.

This [activity] is not, however, accomplished in the same way in other pleasurable states. In the first pleasurable state of great joy, [all the spiritual qualities that are conducive to enlightenment are developed] by strongly taking hold of aspirational prayers. In the second, [they are developed] by removing the stains of immorality from the mind; in the third, by strengthening aspirational prayers and attaining the light of the Dharma; in the fourth, by entering the path; in the fifth, by engaging in worldly activities; and in the sixth, by becoming absorbed in the profound. By contrast, in this seventh pleasurable state, the limbs of enlightenment are developed in a way that creates all the spiritual qualities of a buddha, because the culmination of the bodhisattva conduct that derives from the application of effort occurs within this pleasurable state and also because [this pleasurable state] brings entry into the eighth state of abiding in which transcendent awareness, supernatural knowledge, and conduct have become pure. That is to say, immediately following this pleasurable state, a bodhisattva enters the eighth pleasurable state, and that pleasurable state is one that is absolutely pure. These [first] seven pleasurable states, however, have a [form of purity that is] mixed. They are unafflicted in that they are the precursors of the [eighth] pleasurable state that is completely pure; however, because they have not yet attained that [complete purity], they are said to be [pleasurable states] where afflicted conduct has occurred.

All of the [bodhisattva’s] mental afflictions—beginning with desire, etc.—are abandoned on this [seventh] state of abiding. He should be understood as one who is neither subject to mental affliction nor completely free of affliction, because he no longer generates [the mental afflictions] and because he desires [to attain] a buddha’s knowledge. [The bodhisattva] who possesses such a nature gives rise to unlimited acts of body, speech, and mind that are endowed with a pure superior attitude. He [becomes one who has transcended] those acts that were condemned by the Tathāgata, [and so on,] as [was described] previously. The knowledge of the worldly crafts that was pursued by him during the fifth pleasurable state is perfected here. He is esteemed as a teacher throughout the great triple-thousand [world spheres by everyone] except for the tathāgatas and those bodhisattvas who are established in higher pleasurable states. No one is his equal in thought or action. All the [forms of] meditative absorption, etc., that are spiritual qualities conducive to enlightenment become manifest [in him] through his being turned toward the [various] kinds of meditation. They do not, however, [become manifest in him] through being a condition that is a ripening [of earlier practice], as they do on the eighth pleasurable state. Having applied himself in this way, he achieves, among the bodhisattva forms of one-pointed concentration, a hundred thousand sets of ten forms of one-pointed concentration, beginning with the [ten in which the first] one-pointed concentration [is the one named] “well-examined examination.”[1357] Through having attained these [forms of one-pointed concentration, the bodhisattva] goes completely beyond the range of the [forms of] one-pointed concentration that are possessed by listeners and solitary realizers.

In this way, [the bodhisattva] abides in a state that is difficult to comprehend, one in which his actions of body, speech, and mind are isolated from all the mental afflictions, and in which all occurrences of conceptual thought have disappeared. With a sympathetic regard for sentient beings, he does not relax the effort to seek higher forms of excellence. In order to bring about enlightenment, he gives rise to acts of body, speech, and mind that are limitless, free of all signs, and extremely purified, and that will cause the appearance of the forbearance of the nonarising of entities.[1358]

On this pleasurable state, [bodhisattvas] completely surpass all the listeners and solitary realizers on the basis of the range of their intellect. However, on the other six [pleasurable states, bodhisattvas surpass all the listeners and solitary realizers] on the basis of [the manner in which] they strongly take hold of [the intention to attain] the qualities of a buddha. Also, while a bodhisattva [is able to] enter the state of composure that is a cessation on the sixth pleasurable state, on this [pleasurable state] he [can] enter it in each instant [of thought]. It is also a marvelous and inconceivable quality of [the bodhisattva’s] actions that, although he abides in the summit of reality,[1359] he does not manifest that [state of] cessation.[1360]
On the strength of practicing this very [combination of] skill and knowledge, he carries out a [form of] bodhisattva conduct that is distinct from that of all sentient beings [in the sense that], while it has the appearance of being worldly [conduct], it does not have such a nature. [This can be understood] as [it is described] in the sutra.[1361] Nevertheless, an abbreviated [statement of the] meaning of this [passage] is as follows. [This conduct] has to do with (1) [carrying out] activities that generate merit, as well as (2) taking care of a spouse and a following, (3) undertaking the desire [to achieve] a specific result,[1362] (4) abiding in the three doors to liberation, (5) exercising the skill that enables one to lead beings away from their devotion to the Lesser Vehicle, (6) enjoyment of sensory pleasures, (7) seeking specific forms of sensory pleasures, (8) turning [beings] away from heretical teachers, (9) complying with the minds of others, and (10) complying with a great multitude of people.

The remaining [descriptions regarding this pleasurable state] are the same as the ones that were given previously. With regard to this [pleasurable state], there is the following difference. For example, just as the same gold which a skillful smith has embellished and adorned all over with [wheel rulers’] precious jewels, and that glitters so strikingly, cannot be outshone by any other of the Rose Apple Continent’s ornaments, similarly the roots of virtue of [this bodhisattva] that have been purified to such a high extent cannot be outshone by the roots of virtue that are possessed by any of the listeners and solitary realizers or the roots of virtue that are possessed by any other bodhisattvas who are established in much lower pleasurable states. For example, just as the light of the sun causes the great majority of whatever wet things there are in the Rose Apple Continent to become completely dry and it also cannot be outshone by the light of any other [luminous bodies], similarly the light of wisdom that is possessed by this bodhisattva destroys all the poison of the mental afflictions that is possessed by sentient beings and it cannot be outshone by the light of the knowledge possessed by all the listeners, etc., as described before.

[The bodhisattva] becomes a king of the Vaśavartī[1363] class of gods and one who is skilled at causing listeners and solitary realizers to attain spiritual realizations. It should be understood that [his] spiritual powers are described [as being possessed] in a magnitude of one trillion trillion.[1364]
It should be understood that this represents a brief description of the pleasurable state that is free of signs and is accompanied by both mental preparation and effort, in terms of its being entered by perfecting the [ten] extraordinary ways of undertaking a distinct path that are accomplished by both means and wisdom, in terms of how [the means of] generating a tathāgata’s sphere of action is comprehended and [the activities that generate that quality] are carried out uninterruptedly, in terms of how all the spiritual qualities that are conducive to enlightenment are developed each moment, in terms of how it is formulated that [the first seven pleasurable states] are both afflicted and unafflicted, in terms of how the culmination of the bodhisattva conduct that derives from the application of effort occurs within this pleasurable state, in terms of how every kind of mundane occupation and craft, etc., becomes perfected on the strength of actions that are brought forth with a pure attitude, in terms of how immeasurable forms of one-pointed concentration that are distinct from those possessed by listeners and solitary realizers are attained, in terms of being able to enter the state of composure that is a cessation in each instant [of thought], in terms of how worldly conduct that is distinct from that of all sentient beings is carried out, in terms of the purification of roots of virtue, in terms of [the forms of] rebirth [that occur], and in terms of the spiritual powers [that are possessed]. As stated previously, a more extensive description can be found in [the section of the sutra that discusses] the stage that goes a long way. It is called [the “stage that] goes a long way”[1365] because the culmination of the form of bodhisattva conduct that derives from the application of effort occurs within it. It should be understood that this very reason also [explains the name of] this pleasurable state.

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s pleasurable state that is free of signs and also free of effort?
In this case, on the immediately prior pleasurable state a bodhisattva attains ten[1366] forms of knowledge that penetrate into the highest truth as it relates to all entities. With regard to the three times and according to the particular circumstances, [these forms of knowledge] have to do with the fact that [all entities] are primordially without origination, that [all entities] do not undergo birth, and that [all entities] lack any attributes; they have to do with the fact that [all entities] are neither produced nor destroyed by some other entity that has a causal nature; they have to do with the fact that the very same essence which appears to be capable of verbal description and [appears] to carry out an action, but which, in relation to the reality that is ineffable in an ultimate sense, does not exist by way of an attribute or a causal nature, also is not something by which the [samsaric] process of affliction is set in motion or terminated; they have to do with the fact that, in relation to the ineffable reality that does exist, [the process of] affliction—which is caused by ignorance of that [ultimate reality] or a belief that apprehends it wrongly—is characterized by a sameness that applies at all times [as indicated by the terms] beginning, middle, and end; and they have to do with [the fact that] the process of affliction is eliminated by means of the sameness that does not conceptualize and that correctly enters into suchness. Through developing these ten forms of knowledge to a level of greatness and bringing them to fullness, [the bodhisattva] enters into this eighth pleasurable state that is totally pure. [The one who is] established here attains the supreme and exceedingly pure form of a bodhisattva’s forbearance of the nonarising of entities.

What is that [forbearance] like?
Having investigated all entities by means of the four investigations,[1367] when a bodhisattva fully comprehends them on the basis of the four kinds of thorough knowledge of the way things truly are, and after all forms of adherence to mistaken concepts have been dispelled, he perceives, in that life, a condition that is favorable to the nonarising of any afflictive states in relation to all entities.[1368] Moreover, he [will] perceive, in a future life, the complete and total nonarising without remainder [of those afflictive states] in relation to those very entities that previously arose because of adherence to mistaken conceptual thoughts. The four investigations [should be understood] as they were previously described in the chapter entitled “The Nature of Reality.”

Moreover, from the pleasurable state of conduct that is based upon devotion until the pleasurable state that is free of signs and is accompanied by effort, the four kinds of thorough knowledge of the way things truly are do not possess the characteristic of being completely pure. However, on this pleasurable state, they do become totally pure. Therefore, the bodhisattva [who has reached this state of abiding] is said to be “one who has attained the forbearance that relates to the nonarising of entities.”[1369] Through having attained this forbearance, he becomes one who has achieved the bodhisattva’s pleasurable state that has a profound nature.
[The bodhisattva’s] four defects that occur on the previous pleasurable state that is free of signs are abandoned: (1) the form of preparation that is accompanied by effort is abandoned; (2) the concern about [needing to attain] the higher, pure forms of pleasurable states is abandoned; (3) the concern about [needing to gain] the power to act on behalf of sentient beings in every manner is abandoned; and (4) the activity of generating subtle conceptions is abandoned.[1370] Therefore, this pleasurable state is one that is said to be “perfectly pure.”

In addition, [the bodhisattva] who is reposing in this profound pleasurable state is urged and prompted by the tathāgatas to collect, within this stream that is a [form of] entry into the Dharma, unlimited ways of attaining transcendent knowledge, supernatural knowledge, and deeds. The way in which [the bodhisattva] who has been urged in this manner develops knowledge using immeasurable varieties of bodies and his attainment of the ten controlling powers[1371] should be understood as they are described at length in the sutra.

[The bodhisattva] who has attained the [ten] controlling powers is able to live for as long as he wishes.[1372] He is able to remain in such mental states as the meditative absorptions and the deliverances for as long as he wishes.[1373] He can obtain an abundance of every kind of implement, such as food, etc., merely by forming the determination [to acquire it].[1374] He is able to perform any artistic craft or occupation that he wishes to. He can also take birth however may be desired in relation to deeds that are conducive to every [kind of] rebirth and in relation to every place that one can be reborn.[1375] He can perform every feat of miraculous power according to his wishes.[1376] All his aspirational prayers are achieved just as they were intended.[1377] However [the bodhisattva] may form a desiderative intention toward some particular substance, that [substance] comes into being in exactly that form and not in any other.[1378] Whatever object he is desirous of knowing, he realizes it exactly as it is.[1379] He is able to obtain whatever is wished for in relation to the collections of names, assertions, and syllables. He is skilled at presenting a correct formulation for every form of Dharma teaching.[1380] These are the controlling powers that are attained by this bodhisattva.

It should be understood that this represents a brief description of the pleasurable state that is free of signs and is also free of effort, in terms of how it is entered by perfecting the ten forms of knowledge that penetrate into the highest truth; in terms of the forbearance that is attained in relation to the nonarising of entities; in terms of the attainment of the profound form of a bodhisattva’s pleasurable state in which all faults are gone; in terms of how [the bodhisattva of this pleasurable state is urged] by the buddhas to collect, within the stream that is a [form of] entry into the Dharma, unlimited ways of attaining transcendent knowledge, supernatural knowledge, and deeds; in terms of how knowledge is developed using immeasurable varieties of bodies; in terms of the controlling powers that are attained; in terms of the benefits of the controlling powers that are experienced; in terms of the purification of roots of virtue; in terms of [the forms of] rebirth [that occur]; and in terms of the spiritual powers [that are possessed]. A more extensive description can be found in [the section of] the sutra that discusses] the stage of immovability. This stage is called [the “stage of] immovability”[1381] because the mental preparation that occurred previously is gone and because on this stage the [bodhisattva’s] mind has entered a path where no effort is required and where it can proceed in an unwavering manner. This very reason should also be regarded as [explaining the name of] this pleasurable state.

Regarding this [topic], what is the bodhisattvas’ pleasurable state of informative knowledge?
In this case, the bodhisattva, being unsatisfied even with the profound pleasurable state, pursues ever higher and more excellent forms of knowledge. In doing so, he realizes everything as it truly is about the formative actions of entities[1382] and [the formative action of] the knowledge [regarding those entities]—which enable a bodhisattva to teach every aspect of the Dharma to others—and also [realizes everything as it truly is] about what ought to be done in relation to [the activity of] proclaiming the Dharma. Regarding this, what ought to be done in relation to [the activity of] proclaiming the Dharma is [to gain] true knowledge of the following subjects that relate to the [ten] impenetrable processes:[1383] (1) the things that undergo affliction and purification, (2) the things that bring about affliction and purification, (3) the things that constitute affliction and purification, (4) the thing that constitutes a state of uncertainty regarding those [conditions of affliction and purification], (5) the thing that constitutes a state of certainty regarding those [conditions of affliction and purification], and (6) the thing that constitutes both a state of certainty and a state of uncertainty regarding those [conditions of affliction and purification].[1384]

It should be understood that this represents a brief description of the bodhisattvas’ pleasurable state of informative knowledge, in terms of how it is entered by his not being satisfied with a state of tranquil liberation, in terms of knowledge of the formative actions and its relation to [the activity of] proclaiming the Dharma, in terms of knowledge of what ought to be done in relation to that [activity of proclaiming the Dharma], in terms of [the bodhisattva’s] attaining the quality of being an inconceivably great Dharma teacher, in terms of the purification of roots of virtue, in terms of [the forms of] rebirth [that occur], and in terms of the spiritual powers [that are possessed]. A more extensive description can be found in [the section of] the sutra [that discusses] the stage of excellent understanding. This stage is called “excellent understanding”[1387] because it is a position of spiritual authority in which the Dharma is correctly explained on the strength of a form of understanding that consists of the bodhisattva forms of informative knowledge and that is thoroughly pure in its intention to benefit and bring happiness to all sentient beings. This very reason should also be regarded as [explaining the name of] this pleasurable state.

Regarding this [topic], what is the bodhisattvas’ supreme pleasurable state?
A brief description of the supreme pleasurable state should be understood in terms of [the following points]. When every aspect of the pleasurable state of informative knowledge has been purified, the bodhisattva who here has become worthy of the rank of a Dharma king and has reached the point where he is about to undergo the Dharma consecration attains immeasurable numbers of one-pointed concentrations, beginning with the one named “stainless,” and completes their aims. After coming face-to-face with the final concentration, [which is named] “consecration into the excellence of omniscient knowledge,” [the bodhisattva] who has attained a seat, bodily form, and retinue that are suitable for this [event], through emanating and drawing back light rays, receives from all the buddhas the consecration of the knowledge that is omniscient in every way. After having been consecrated, [the bodhisattva] realizes [how to] assemble all those beings who are to be converted as well as the means of liberating them, and [realizes all] the buddha activities. [The bodhisattva] attains immeasurable numbers of deliverances, forms of mental retention, and supernatural knowledge. The great [form of] recollection and knowledge that is developed by the influence of those [qualities] is [the basis for] establishing the literal explanation [of the name of this stage]. Great forms of supernatural knowledge are developed. There are also [descriptions of] the extraordinary purity of the roots of virtue, the [extraordinary] manner of rebirth, and the [extraordinary] spiritual powers. A more extensive description can be found in [the section of] the sutra [that discusses] the Dharma cloud stage.

The bodhisattva who has completed the bodhisattva path and who has fully completed the accumulations [that are necessary] for enlightenment receives from the tathāgatas an extremely vast shower of the true Dharma, one that resembles a [massive] cloud of Dharma and that cannot be borne by all other sentient beings. [That bodhisattva] resembles a great cloud—[manifesting both forms that] do not represent the enlightenment of a complete buddha and [forms that] do represent the enlightenment of a complete buddha—and causes the dust of innumerable sentient beings’ mental afflictions to be settled by an incomparably great rain of true Dharma. While established in this stage, he also causes manifold roots of virtue to sprout, grow, and ripen. Therefore, this stage is called “the Dharma cloud.”[1388] This very reason should also be regarded as [explaining the name of] this pleasurable state.

It is not the case that the elements that were described [as being present] in the higher pleasurable states are completely absent in the preceding pleasurable states.

Moreover, concerning this [topic], each pleasurable state is achieved and then perfected over [a period lasting] many trillions of great kalpas, or over [a period lasting] even a much larger number [of great kalpas]. All of these pleasurable states [collectively] are completed during three spans of time that are each made up of a countless number of kalpas. The [first] interval of countless great kalpas is [the period during which] one goes beyond the pleasurable state of conduct that is based upon devotion and attains the pleasurable state of great joy. Moreover, [only the practitioner] who strives with [unwavering] firmness [will reach] that [pleasurable state within that period of time], not one who fails to strive [continuously]. During the second interval of countless great kalpas, [a bodhisattva] goes beyond [the seven pleasurable states that range from] the pleasurable state of great joy up to the pleasurable state that is free of signs and is accompanied by effort and attains the [pleasurable state that is] free of signs and also free of effort. This [process of spiritual development] is also one that occurs within a definite period of time, since a bodhisattva whose attitude has become pure strives constantly. During the third interval of countless great kalpas, [a bodhisattva] goes beyond the pleasurable state that is free of signs and also free of effort as well as the [pleasurable state of] informative knowledge, and attains the bodhisattva’s supreme pleasurable state.

Regarding this [topic], it should be understood that [the expression] “countless kalpas” has two senses. A great kalpa itself is said to be “countless” because it is a [period of] time that cannot be measured by an enumeration of days, nights, months, and half-months. “Countless” also means that the number of those great kalpas is something that is beyond all forms of reckoning.[1389] According to the former sense of countless kalpas, enlightenment is attained over a period lasting a great many countless kalpas. In addition, according to the latter sense, [it is attained] over a period of three [intervals of] countless kalpas, and a greater number [than three such intervals] is not required. Nevertheless, some of those individuals who exert themselves with the greatest of the great forms of effort can reduce [the three intervals of innumerable great kalpas] by a great many intermediate kalpas.[1390] Others can reduce [the time it takes to reach enlightenment] by as much as [a large number of] great kalpas. However, it should be understood that no one reduces [the overall amount of time] by an [entire interval of] countless [great kalpas].

In addition, over the course of these twelve bodhisattva pleasurable states and three [intervals of] countless [great kalpas], both the [form of] indisposition that is associated with the obscurations of the mental afflictions and [the form of indisposition] that is associated with the obscurations to that which needs to be known are abandoned. Regarding this, it should be understood that the abandonment of the form of indisposition that is associated with the obscurations of the mental afflictions occurs during three pleasurable states. On the pleasurable state of great joy, [the form of indisposition associated with] the portion of the mental afflictions that lead to [rebirth in] the lower realms has been completely and totally abandoned. However, in terms of the active arising [of the mental afflictions], [only] that of the great and middling portions of all the [innate] mental afflictions [has been abandoned].[1391]

However, in terms of the active arising [of the mental afflictions], that of all [portions of] the mental afflictions [has been abandoned].[1392] By contrast, it should be understood that, on the supreme pleasurable state, all of the mental afflictions, together with the obscurations that relate to their traces and latencies, are abandoned. Moreover, this takes place at the time of entering the tathāgata’s pleasurable state.

It should also be understood that the [form of] indisposition that relates to the obscurations to that which needs to be known is of three types: (1) that which constitutes the outer covering;[1393] (2) that which constitutes the underlying layer;[1394] and (3) that which constitutes the innermost core.[1395] Regarding these, the form [of indisposition] that constitutes the outer covering is abandoned upon [attainment of] the pleasurable state of great joy; the form [of indisposition] that constitutes the underlying layer is abandoned upon [attainment of] the pleasurable state that is free of signs and also free of effort; and the form [of indisposition] that constitutes the innermost core is abandoned upon [attainment of] the tathāgatas’ pleasurable state. This [last event] also [constitutes the attainment of] the state of knowledge in which all the obscurations have been purified. The other [eight] pleasurable states, in due succession, represent the stages for collecting the accumulations that are needed to abandon the obscurations of the mental afflictions and [the obscurations] to that which needs to be known on those three pleasurable states.

It should be understood that, in brief, there are eleven types of purity that relate to these thirteen pleasurable states: (1) The purity of the [bodhisattva’s] spiritual lineage [is present] in the first [pleasurable state]. (2) The purity of faith and devotion [is present] in the second [pleasurable state]. (3) The purity of superior attitude [is present] in the third [pleasurable state].

(8) The purity that generates knowledge of reality [is present] in the tenth [pleasurable state]. (9) The purity of the informative knowledge that correctly explains the meaning of that [reality] to others [is present] in the eleventh [pleasurable state]. (10) The purity of the knowledge that realizes every aspect of all objects of knowledge [is present] in the twelfth [pleasurable state]. (11) The purity of [having eliminated] all the obscurations of the mental afflictions and [all the obscurations] to that which needs to be known, together with their traces, [is present] in the thirteenth [pleasurable state, which is the] pleasurable state of the tathāgatas.

It should also be understood that these thirteen pleasurable states are included within the eight qualities that constitute a summary of the Great Vehicle and that were presented earlier.[1396] It should be understood that [the acts of] listening to and reflecting upon the bodhisattva collection of scriptures [occur] on the first and second pleasurable states [and they are carried out] by [a bodhisattva who] has generated faith and developed firm devotion; [the act of] practicing a superior attitude that is preceded by the attainment of various forms of meditation [occurs] on the third pleasurable state; [the act of practicing] an abundance of meditation [occurs] on all the other pleasurable states up to [and including] the pleasurable state that is free of signs and is accompanied by effort; [the act of] perfecting the fruits of meditation [occurs] on the three pleasurable states that lie above those [preceding ones] and that contain conduct that is completely pure; and the state of [having attained] absolute deliverance [is present] on the pleasurable state of the tathāgatas.

It should be understood that the succession of the twelve bodhisattva pleasurable states is comparable to that of the listeners’ pleasurable states. [A bodhisattva’s] first [pleasurable state] should be understood to resemble a listener disciple’s pleasurable state of abiding in his or her own spiritual lineage. [A bodhisattva’s] second [pleasurable state] resembles [a listener’s] pleasurable state that prepares him or her for entry into the flawlessness [that leads to] ultimate correctness.[1397] [A bodhisattva’s] third [pleasurable state] resembles [a listener’s] pleasurable state of entry into flawlessness. [A bodhisattva’s] fourth [pleasurable state] resembles [a listener’s] pleasurable state of the superior morality that is dear to the āryas, which [is attained] by one who has achieved the faith that is born of insight[1398] in order to terminate additional forms of the outflows. [A bodhisattva’s] fifth [pleasurable state] resembles [a listener’s] pleasurable state in which the superior form of mind training is completed on the basis of that superior morality. It should be understood that [a bodhisattva’s] sixth, seventh, and eighth [pleasurable states] resemble [a listener’s] pleasurable state in which the training of superior wisdom [is cultivated] in accord with the knowledge of the [four noble truths] that was [previously] achieved. [A bodhisattva’s] ninth [pleasurable state] resembles the pleasurable state in which [a listener] who has closely examined objects of knowledge prepares him- or herself to enter the [form of] one-pointed concentration that is free of signs. [A bodhisattva’s] tenth [pleasurable state] resembles [a listener’s] perfected pleasurable state that is free of signs. [A bodhisattva’s] eleventh [pleasurable state] resembles [a listener’s] pleasurable state of [abiding in] the seat of liberation, which is attained by one who has arisen from [those signless forms of one-pointed concentration]. It should be understood that [a bodhisattva’s] twelfth [pleasurable state] resembles [a listener’s] pleasurable state of abiding in every aspect of the status of an arhat.

Regarding this topic, what is a birth that puts an end to calamities?
In this case, during times of famine, distress, and great catastrophe, after having made aspirational prayers [to achieve that result],[1399] a bodhisattva is born in such birth states as that of a large fish, etc., in order to become a means of sustenance for sentient beings that only requires little effort. Possessing a large body wherever he or she has taken birth, [the bodhisattva] satiates an entire populace with his or her own flesh. After having made aspirational prayers [to do so], he or she assumes the physical form of a great physician who has attained mastery of magic spells in the midst of sentient beings who are afflicted by many illnesses, in order to cure those afflicted beings. With regard to sentient beings who are being attacked by a powerful and hostile army, he or she becomes a strong monarch in order to quell the attack made by a hostile army in a just manner, peacefully, and using skillful means.

With regard to sentient beings who are at odds with one another, he or she becomes a person whose speech is accepted [by others], for the purpose of bringing about their reconciliation and causing them to abandon their hostile attitudes. With regard to kings who engage in all manner of harmful actions toward their subjects, [such as] punishing and imprisoning them, he or she takes birth in the royal families of such kings, in order to put an end to the misfortune that is being experienced by such beings. He or she also becomes a just monarch who is compassionate toward beings. Out of compassion for sentient beings who hold wrong views and commit evil deeds, and who also have devotion toward some particular deity’s abode, he or she takes birth in that deity’s abode, in order to cause those [beings] to give up their wrong views and evil conduct.[1400] It should also be understood that this [type of] birth—which is generated on the strength of aspirational prayers and through the controlling power [over rebirth], and which is preceded by compassion—can occur in immeasurable ways. An extensive presentation would include [examples of bodhisattvas who] were reborn in a variety of [different] birth states and among many different kinds of sentient beings.

What are births that conform by taking on a semblance of shared qualities?[1401]
In this case, after having made [appropriate] aspirational prayers or through having achieved the controlling power [over rebirth], a bodhisattva takes birth among a variety of sentient beings who have been reborn in the animal birth state, as well as among deities, yakṣas, nāgas, asuras, and the like, and among beings who are at odds with one another and trying to harm one another. Likewise, [he or she takes birth] among brahmins who hold wrong views, as well as among sentient beings who engage in misconduct, [among beings] who pursue a form of livelihood [that involves engaging in misconduct], or [among beings] who take pleasure [in engaging in misconduct]. Likewise, [he or she takes birth] among sentient beings who have a strong attachment or devotion to sensory pleasures. [A bodhisattva takes birth] in a form that is the same as these sentient beings [and he or she does so] as their chief, in order to turn them away from those faults. Having become their chief, he or she abstains from carrying out the [kinds of wrongful] conduct that those beings carry out, and he or she actively pursues the [kinds of] virtuous deeds that they do not carry out. In addition, he or she teaches them the Dharma so that they will carry out virtuous deeds. By these [actions of] teaching the Dharma and engaging in dissimilar conduct, he or she exercises the skillful means that turns [these sentient beings] back from those faults. As with the previous [type of birth], it should be understood that this [type of] birth is also one that can occur in immeasurable ways.

Regarding this [topic], what is a bodhisattva’s final birth?
It is the birth that is taken into the family of a religious priest or the family of a king[1405] by a bodhisattva who has completed the accumulations for enlightenment, and the one in which true and complete enlightenment is attained. [It is] also [the one in which a bodhisattva] carries out all the activities of a buddha. This birth is called the “final [birth]” and the “last [birth].”
Whatever bodhisattvas have been reborn, are being reborn, or shall be reborn in splendid, auspicious, and excellent births of the past, present, or future, all [of those bodhisattvas] do so within these very five [types of birth]. Excluding the births that take place [while a bodhisattva is still] on the stage of an immature being, there are none that are higher than these and none that are greater than these, for these five [types of] birth are the ones that have been approved of by wise bodhisattvas. Indeed, these are the births that yield the fruit of great enlightenment and they are the ones on the basis of which bodhisattvas quickly attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment.

Using all his or her abilities and powers, he or she causes beings to turn away from evil. He or she acts as a parent to his or her subjects. He or she is naturally disposed to share [wealth] even with strangers, needless to say with those who are his or her own dependents. He or she avoids doing injury [to others] and speaks truthfully. [He or she is one who has] given up doing such forms of harm to sentient beings as killing, imprisoning, punishing, cutting off [limbs], and beating, etc.

Regarding this topic, the act of correctly leading a body of followers is called “embracing by acceptance.”[1409] [A bodhisattva] correctly embraces a following on the basis of two causes: (1) He or she embraces [a following] with a mind that does not seek any selfish gain and (2) he or she directs each individual to his or her own aim. [A bodhisattva] does not employ a wrongful means to deceive them. In all forms of embracing [a following], he or she maintains an impartial mind and does not fall into [the error of showing] favoritism. He or she is not stingy with the Dharma in relation to them and also is not a teacher who withholds instructions [from them].[1410] He or she does not expect them to engage in the service of waiting on him or her. However, he or she does not turn back those who do so of their own accord from a desire to be virtuous, in order that they may build up an accumulation of merit. When the circumstances are appropriate, [that bodhisattva] also carries out the service of waiting on them.

It should also be understood that there are twelve encounters with stressful and difficult situations that can be experienced by bodhisattvas who are engaging in correct forms of embracing sentient beings. Moreover, a bodhisattva should exercise sagacity in dealing with them. (1) [To decide] whether to oppose or ignore sentient beings who are committing transgressions is an encounter with a difficult situation that is stressful. (2) To protect one’s own mind from mental afflictions while carrying out a harsh procedure in relation to a sentient being is an encounter with a difficult situation that is stressful. (3) To have only a few Dharma teachings to give when one has been approached by a large number of petitioners for the purpose of requesting [teachings] is an encounter with a difficult situation that is stressful. (4) To be asked by many persons to assist them with a multitude of activities that have arisen when one is by oneself is an encounter with a difficult situation that is stressful. (5) For one who does not possess fitness of mind, [to develop] an agreeable mundane state of composure that represents a [potential] source of lack of mindfulness which will result in rebirth in a divine realm is an encounter with a difficult situation that is stressful.[1414]

(6) For someone who desires to benefit sentient beings, to be unable to accomplish that aim is an encounter with a difficult situation that is stressful.

(8) To regard samsara as defective at all times while [at the same time] not allowing oneself to escape from samsara is an encounter with a difficult situation that is stressful. (9) To die in a state of clouded recollection without having attained a pure form of superior attitude is an encounter with a difficult situation that is stressful. (10) To be requested by others to give them the object of foremost importance that is held to be extremely precious when one has not yet attained a pure form of superior attitude is an encounter with a difficult situation that is stressful. (11) [To decide] whether to provide instruction to sentient beings who have a variety of different opinions and diverse aspirations or to ignore them is an encounter with a difficult situation that is stressful. (12) To maintain a very great form of mindfulness while [at the same time] refraining from completely abandoning all of the mental afflictions is an encounter with a difficult situation that is stressful.

A bodhisattva who encounters any of these stressful and difficult situations should take action only after having considered its relative importance. In some cases, he or she should investigate the persons who are involved. In some cases, he or she should maintain composure and, after having adopted a [particular] motive, carry it out. He or she should also make correct aspirational prayers. In some cases, he or she should not allow the mind to engage [the matter]. In some cases, after having given [the matter] intense consideration, he or she should maintain tireless patience. In some cases, he or she should remain indifferent. In some cases, he or she should generate effort and act with fervor. In some cases, he or she should employ skillful means. In this way, a bodhisattva who is skilled at [applying] the correct remedy does not become despondent no matter what kind of encounter with a stressful and difficult situation he or she may be faced with, and he or she also protects him- or herself correctly.

It should be understood that seven stages correspond to the thirteen pleasurable states that were already described. Six [of the seven] are stages that pertain to a bodhisattva and one is a stage that is a mixture of a bodhisattva’s stage and a tathāgata’s stage. The seven bodhisattva stages are (1) the stage of the spiritual lineage, (2) the stage of conduct that is based upon devotion, (3) the stage of a pure superior attitude, (4) the stage of practicing conduct, (5) the stage of certainty, (6) the stage of certain conduct, and (7) the stage that is the perfect manner of going. The last of these is a mixed [stage].
Regarding this [topic], the pleasurable state of the spiritual lineage and the pleasurable state of conduct that is based upon devotion correspond to [the first] two [of these] stages. The pleasurable state of great joy corresponds to the stage of a pure superior attitude. The [two] pleasurable states that relate to superior morality and superior mind training, the three pleasurable states that relate to superior wisdom, and the pleasurable state that is free of signs and is accompanied by effort [collectively] correspond to the stage of practicing conduct. The pleasurable state that is free of signs and free of effort corresponds to the stage of certainty. In this [latter] stage, a bodhisattva enters the third occurrence of a certainty.[1415] The pleasurable state of informative knowledge corresponds to the stage of certain conduct. The supreme pleasurable state and the pleasurable state of a tathāgata [together] correspond to the stage that is the perfect manner of going. The pleasurable state of a tathāgata and the stage of a tathāgata will be described later in the chapter [entitled “Preeminence,”] which addresses the preeminence of a buddha’s qualities.

Regarding this [topic], how does a bodhisattva who is entering the stage of a pure superior attitude following the stage of conduct that is based upon devotion transcend [having to be reborn in] the lower realms?
In this case, relying on a purified mundane meditative absorption, the bodhisattva who is on the stage of conduct that is based upon devotion and who has accumulated extremely well the accumulations [that are necessary] for enlightenment meditates with attention focused exclusively on compassion toward sentient beings, using the one hundred and ten aspects that were described previously.[1416] As a consequence of this meditation, he or she attains a sympathetic and compassionate attitude toward sentient beings having the form [that corresponds to those one hundred and ten aspects]. [This attitude is one] on the strength of which [a bodhisattva] would [be willing to] remain in the lower realms for the sake of sentient beings in a manner that resembles inhabiting [one’s own] dwelling.[1417] In order to dispel the suffering of sentient beings, he or she reflects, “If I could attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment while residing in those very [lower realms], I would be able to endure that.” On the strength of that pure attitude, he or she is also desirous that all sentient beings’ deeds [that would cause rebirth in] the lower realms might ripen on him- or herself. He or she also generates the wish that [sentient beings] never commit any form of nonvirtuous deed. The purified mundane meditative absorption that is being cultivated by him or her in this way removes from [that bodhisattva’s] being the [type of] indisposition that relates to the mental afflictions that bring rebirth in the lower realms. Not long after that [indisposition] has been abandoned, the individual nature of that bodhisattva is transformed in such a manner that he or she never again commits the type of evil deed that causes rebirth in lower realms and he or she [never again] has to go to the lower realms. This is how a bodhisattva transcends all forms of the lower realms and also how he or she transcends the stage of conduct that is based upon devotion and enters the stage of a pure superior attitude.

What are the ten?
The condition of having never, at any time, generated enlightenment mind or accepted the precepts of the bodhisattva training is the quality that opposes faith and [the quality] for which faith serves as an antidote. The mind that wishes to harm sentient beings is the quality that opposes compassion and [the quality] for which compassion serves as an antidote. Malice toward sentient beings is the quality that opposes loving-kindness and [the quality] for which loving-kindness serves as an antidote. The concern for possessions and for remaining alive is the quality that opposes generosity and [the quality] for which the willingness to give up [inner and outer objects] serves as an antidote. Developing a wrong form of practice that harms sentient beings and the quality of [thinking] that one has too much to do are the qualities that oppose tirelessness and [the qualities] for which tirelessness serves as an antidote. The undertaking of ineffective activities is the quality that opposes knowledge of the teaching and [the quality] for which knowledge of the teaching serves as an antidote. Unfriendliness and the unwillingness to comply with others’ minds are the qualities that oppose knowledge of the world and [the qualities] for which knowledge of the world serves as an antidote. Heedlessness and laziness with regard to the cultivation of virtuous qualities are the qualities that oppose shame and abashment and [the qualities] for which shame and abashment serve as an antidote. Being afraid of the manifold, continuous, intense, and long-lasting forms of suffering in samsara is the quality that opposes developing the power of firmness and [the quality] for which developing the power of firmness serves as an antidote. Uncertainty, ambivalence, and doubt toward the Master are the qualities that oppose worshipping and serving the tathāgatas and [the qualities] for which worshipping and serving the tathāgatas serve as an antidote. This is the formulation of those [ten spiritual qualities] in terms of how they serve as antidotes.

A bodhisattva who has intense faith in enlightenment feels compassion for sentient beings who are afflicted by suffering. [A bodhisattva] who feels compassion reflects, “I must save these [sentient beings],” and develops loving-kindness. Similarly, [a bodhisattva] who has [developed] loving-kindness in his or her mind is willing to give up everything and is indifferent to possessions and remaining alive. [A bodhisattva] who is indifferent [to those two aims] will apply him- or herself on behalf of [sentient beings] and not become tired. [A bodhisattva] who is tireless will develop knowledge of the teaching. [A bodhisattva] who possesses knowledge of the teaching will know the proper way to apply him- or herself in the world and thus will develop knowledge of the world. He or she will feel shame and abashment if he or she should develop any of the mental afflictions. [A bodhisattva] who feels shame and abashment will not let him- or herself be controlled by the mental afflictions and will attain the power of firmness. Through engaging in correct practice, [a bodhisattva] who has attained the power of firmness will not become deficient, will strengthen the virtuous qualities, and will worship and serve the tathāgatas, by means of the form of worship that consists of spiritual practice and by means of the form of worship that is carried out with wealth and honor. It should be understood that this represents the successive order in which these ten qualities are attained. The purification of all the stages is accomplished by means of these ten qualities.

Regarding this [topic], the combination of these ten perfections is called “conduct relating to the perfections”: the six perfections that were presented earlier, the perfection of skillful means, the perfection of aspirational prayer, the perfection of power, and the perfection of knowledge.
Regarding this, the twelve types of skillful means that were described earlier[1420] constitute the perfection of skillful means. The five types of aspirational prayer that were described earlier[1421] constitute the perfection of aspirational prayer. The purification of the practice [that leads to] the ten powers[1422] constitutes the perfection of power. The knowledge of [how to present] a systematic formulation of all entities as they truly are constitutes the perfection of knowledge.
Regarding this, the wisdom that is occupied with grasping ultimate truth is the perfection of wisdom. By contrast, [the wisdom] that is occupied with grasping conventional truth is the perfection of knowledge. This represents the difference between these two [perfections].
Another formulation [is the following]: (1) Immeasurable knowledge is the perfection of skillful means. (2) The aspiration [to achieve] higher and higher forms of excellent knowledge is the perfection of aspirational prayers. (3) The quality that makes one incapable of being cut off from the path by any of Māra’s forces is the perfection of power. (4) The proper realization of that which needs to be known is the perfection of knowledge.

How does [their order] relate to the manner in which they arise?
In this case, at the very outset a bodhisattva who is indifferent to possessions adopts morality after having given up the sensory pleasures that relate to the householder’s state. Out of respect for morality, he or she bears patiently the harm that is carried out [against him or her] by others and does not carry out harm against others. [A bodhisattva] whose morality is pure both through having adopted it and through [having developed] patience undertakes activities that relate to virtue in an unwavering and continuous manner. Having become free of heedlessness in this way through effort, he or she attains a one-pointedness of mind that is virtuous in nature. Having become one whose mind is composed in this way, he or she realizes those objects that need to be known and perceives those objects that need to be seen, as they truly are. It should be understood that this is how their formulation corresponds to the successive manner in which they arise.

What is the fivefold excellence of one’s individual existence?
The first excellence is [that of being born] in a happy migratory state as a god or a human being who possesses [qualities such as] a life span, etc., that are superior to those of other beings. The second excellence is [the qualities of] being naturally tireless about carrying out virtuous activities, [naturally] tolerant of the wrongs committed [against one] by others, and [naturally] averse to harming others. The third excellence is the quality of being naturally firm in one’s efforts [to pursue] all activities that are undertaken. The fourth excellence is the fact that a person who [only] possesses weak forms of the mental afflictions possesses a natural ability to control the mind and a natural fitness of mind, both of which lead to the swift [attainment of] supernatural knowledge regarding all matters. The fifth excellence is to possess a vast intellect from birth and to achieve erudition and sagacity with regard to all matters. These are [the qualities] that are produced through the ripening of results. It should be understood that this represents another [reason] for the order in which the six perfections are arranged.
Regarding this [topic], it should be understood that the bodhisattvas’ training of superior morality is completed by means of four of the [six] perfections—which constitute its requisite, essential nature, attendant factor, and [method of] preservation; the training of superior mind practice [is completed] by means of the perfection of meditative absorption; and the training of superior wisdom [is completed] by means of the perfection of wisdom. Moreover, there is no higher course of training for a bodhisattva to attain [than these]. Therefore, because the entire course of training for bodhisattvas is included within these three [trainings], it is established that there are just six perfections. Moreover, there are none of greater significance than these and there are none besides these.

The sixty previous [secondary signs] combined with these latter twenty make up the eighty secondary signs. These are the excellent marks and signs that a bodhisattva who has entered the stage of a pure [superior] attitude attains through a [karmic] maturation. It should be understood that beyond that [stage], their purity becomes ever greater until [the bodhisattva] becomes seated at the seat of enlightenment. [At that time,] he also attains the unique and thoroughly excellent [buddha qualities] of the [four] purities, etc., that are most pure and perfectly complete in every respect. However, prior to that time, he or she also possesses [the marks and secondary signs] in an incomplete form while still a bodhisattva, beginning with the stage of a pure superior attitude.
Without distinction, the accumulation [of the requisites] for enlightenment, in its entirety, [is the factor that] brings about all of the marks and secondary signs. Moreover, the accumulation [of the requisites] for enlightenment is of two types: that which is distant from enlightenment and that which is near to it. Regarding this [topic], the type [of accumulation] that is distant [from enlightenment] is the one that occurs during the time that the marks and secondary signs have not yet been attained in the form of a [karmic] maturation. The type [of accumulation] that is near [to enlightenment] is the one that occurs after the marks and secondary signs have been attained initially in the form of a maturation, as well as following that point, during the time that they are becoming more excellent as their purity increases to an ever-greater degree.

However, these marks and secondary signs are results that are formed by a variety of deeds, which the Blessed One taught for the sake of those disciples who are desirous [of attaining them].
Why is that?
Sentient beings delight in carrying out many different kinds of evil deeds. On the other hand, upon hearing about the variety of virtuous deeds that are antidotes for those manifold evil deeds that are inimical to [spiritual development], and that also [are the factors that] bring about the marks and secondary signs, as well as that [those virtuous deeds] have a variety of beneficial results, they develop a strong aspiration [to gain] those great beneficial results and they turn away from those evil deeds. They also aspire to take up those virtuous deeds and abide in them. [These virtuous deeds and their beneficial results should be understood] as they are described in the Lakṣaṇa Sūtra.[1447]

By having been firmly established in [the acts of] morality, austerities, patience, and liberality [in giving], one attains the quality of having feet that are placed down well.
Through traveling about here and there, etc., in order to serve one’s father and mother in manifold ways, and in order to protect beings from many kinds of calamities, one attains the quality of [hands[1448] and] feet that are marked with a wheel.
By abandoning doing harm to others and taking what was not given, by making verbal salutations, honoring, standing up [as a gesture of deference], and greeting with joined palms and performing acts of homage to those worthy of being venerated, by pleasing others, by not diminishing their cherished wealth, and by overcoming one’s own pride, one attains the quality of having long fingers [and toes] that is a mark of a great person.
By [carrying out] a combination of all three [types of] deeds that were taught [as producing] those three marks of a great being, one attains the quality of having feet with heels that are prominent.

A person who is faithful and compassionate, who provides medicine and is kind[1454] attains the quality of [experiencing all] tastes as a supreme taste through protecting sentient beings as one would one’s own children. [This mark is] also [attained] through having given [others] the taste of the Dharma, through having experienced [oneself] the taste of the Dharma, and through having restored the taste [of the Dharma] that was lost.[1455]
By taking up oneself and safeguarding the five precepts of training that consist of refraining from taking lives, etc.,[1456] by prompting others to take them up, and by being a person who, on the basis of a compassionate mind, practices taking up the Dharma to a high degree, one attains the quality of having a crown protrusion on the head and the quality of having a tongue that is large and slender.

By speaking truthfully, by speaking agreeably, and by speaking the Dharma at suitable times, one attains the quality of divine speech.
By viewing the entire world sympathetically with an attitude of loving-kindness, as a mother and father do [toward their offspring], one obtains the quality of eyes that are an intensely dark shade of blue and the quality of eyelashes that are like those of an ox.
A person who expresses genuine approval and praise for those who possess virtuous qualities attains the circle of hair between the eyebrows that is as white as a conch shell and turns to the right.
It should be understood that, without distinction, morality is the cause for attaining all of the thirty-two marks of a great person.

Why is that?
A bodhisattva whose morality is ruined will indeed not even attain the status of a human being, let alone the marks of a great person.
Regarding this [topic], it should be understood that the quality of having a crown protrusion on the head is one and the same mark of a great person as the quality of [others] not being able to see the top of [a tathāgata’s] head, because [the latter] is not considered to be distinct from [the former].
This constitutes a detailed formulation of the various kinds of deeds that accord with the creation of the marks [of a great person].

It should be understood that the creation of all the marks is accomplished by means of the four aspects of the quality of having completed one’s spiritual activities well,[1457] which pertains to the two factions.[1458] Regarding this [topic], the quality of having feet that are placed down well is produced by having carried out [spiritual] activities in a definite manner. The qualities of having [the design of] a wheel on the [hands and] feet, having feet [with ankles] that do not protrude, having hands and feet with a weblike membrane, having fine[1459] skin, having seven elevated areas, having the area between the shoulders well filled out, having shoulders that are well developed, having a body that is large and straight, and having a tongue that is large and slender are produced by having carried out [spiritual] activities in a complete manner. The qualities of having long fingers [and toes], having feet with prominent heels, having an erect body, having [a body that is] symmetrical, like the nyagrodha tree, and having teeth without gaps are produced by having carried out [spiritual] activities continually. The remaining marks are produced by having carried out [spiritual] activities in an irreproachable manner.

Regarding this [topic], the quality of having hands and feet that are soft and youthful and the quality of having skin that is smooth and fine are produced by employing a method of practice that does not harm sentient beings. The quality of having calves like those of the eṇeya deer is produced by employing a method of practice that is both orderly and timely. The qualities of emitting light that extends a distance of one fathom, having golden-colored skin, white teeth, and a white circle of hair [between the eyebrows] are produced by practicing virtue with a clear mind that is joyful and glad. The quality of having a sexual organ that is concealed in a sheath is produced by not being devoted to fame, renown, and praise, and by concealing one’s good qualities. The qualities of having body hairs that point upward, having forty even teeth, [experiencing all] tastes as a supreme taste, and having a crown protrusion on [the top of] the head are produced by dedicating one’s virtue roots to enlightenment. The qualities of having a body whose upper part resembles that of a lion and jaws that resemble those of a lion are produced by employing a method of practice [that pursues] virtue insatiably and [with a mind that is] free of dejection. The qualities of having even teeth, eyes that are intensely dark blue, and eyelashes that are like those of an ox are produced by regarding all sentient beings equally and with a mind that seeks to benefit them. The quality of divine speech is produced by employing a method of practice that is not satisfied with anything that is deficient.
This is the manner in which the thirty-two marks of a great person are attained and perfected by means of the four aspects that relate to the quality of having completed one’s spiritual activities well.

Regarding this [topic], it should be understood that these marks exist for bodhisattvas merely in a seedlike condition during the stage of the spiritual lineage. It should be understood that the course of action that is devoted to the means of attaining them [occurs] during the stage of conduct that is based upon devotion. It should be understood that [the initial form of] their attainment occurs during the stage of a pure superior attitude. It should be understood that their refinement occurs during the remaining bodhisattva stages that lie above these [first three stages]. It should be understood that their complete perfection and the state in which they have become unsurpassed occurs on the tathāgatas’ aspect of the stage that is the perfect manner of going.
Regarding this [topic], because among all the spiritual qualities that are possessed by a buddha and that represent distinguishing characteristics of a great person, these marks [in particular] can be easily observed by lesser, middling, and superior beings due to their physical nature, they alone are the ones that are designated as “the marks of a great person.” Moreover, [the eighty secondary attributes] are called “secondary signs” because they support the thirty-two marks of a great person by serving as their seat,[1460] and [because] they enhance the physical beauty of [a tathāgata] by their agreeable form.

Regarding this [topic], in brief, each individual body pore of a tathāgata is produced by a heap of merit that is equal to the merit that is possessed by all sentient beings. Each individual secondary sign is produced by the same amount of merit as that which is contained in the heap of merit [necessary to create] all the body pores [of a tathāgata]. A single mark of a tathāgata is produced by a heap of merit that is a hundred times greater than that which is contained in the heap of merit [necessary to create] all the secondary signs. The circle of hair [between the eyebrows] is produced by a heap of merit that is a thousand times greater than that which is contained in the heap of merit [necessary to create] all the marks excluding the circle of hair [between the eyebrows] and the crown protrusion. The crown protrusion on top of the head, [which is also described as] the quality of not being able to see the crown of [a tathāgata’s] head, is produced by a heap of merit that is a hundred thousand times greater than that which is contained in the heap of merit [necessary to create] the circle of hair [between the eyebrows]. Another quality of a tathāgata, called “the Dharma conch shell,”[1461] which is not included among the marks and secondary signs, is produced by a heap of merit that is a trillion times greater than that which is contained in the heap of merit [necessary to create] the crown protrusion. [This quality is one] by which a tathāgata, if he wishes to, can cause his voice to be understood throughout [all] the endless and limitless world systems. This is the manner in which the inconceivable and unsurpassed physical body of the tathāgatas is produced, [a body] that is attained by an immeasurable collection of merit and [a body] that encompasses every aspect of excellence.[1462]

Moreover, in brief, it should be understood that the characteristic of being immeasurable that pertains to the virtuous qualities that produce the marks and secondary signs is due to three reasons. Since [the marks and secondary signs] are attained by practicing [virtuous activities] for three [periods of] countless kalpas, there is an immeasurability of time. Since [the virtuous activities that produce the marks and secondary signs] are governed by an attitude that seeks to bring benefit and happiness to an immea surable number of sentient beings, there is an immeasurability of attitude. Since [the marks and secondary signs] are produced by an immeasurable variety of virtuous deeds, there is an immeasurability of the types [of deeds]. Therefore, the attainment of an immeasurable collection of merit is called “the creation of the marks and secondary signs” that are possessed by the tathāgatas.

Regarding this [topic], he is called “the Tathāgata” because everything whatsoever that he utters, speaks, or declares is unerring and exists in the manner [that he declares it to be].[1472]
Regarding this [topic], a cause that is not at variance with both pleasant and unpleasant results and that will truly lead to their occurrence is called their “proper condition,”[1473] their “base,”[1474] their “foundation,”[1475] and their “originating factor.”[1476] A cause that is incompatible with those very pleasant and unpleasant results is called their “improper condition” by virtue of its being the opposite of [a proper condition].

Because it is [a quality that is] unsurpassed, because it possesses the ability to act on behalf of all sentient beings in every manner, and because it defeats absolutely[1479] all the forces of Māra, it is called a “power.”
The quality of having control over the use [of this power] in whatever way is desired, through having correctly acquired the causes [that bring about its] attainment, is called its “possession.”
Because it is unsurpassed, nirvana is called an “exalted” [state]. Because it is attained by means of the eightfold ārya path and because it [is a state] in which all misfortune and fear have been eliminated, [nirvana] is called the “most excellent”[1480] [state].

Because of the [Buddha’s] assertion regarding his own attainment [of this state, the sutra] states that he “affirms” [this].

Why is [his act of teaching described in] that [way]?
The following are epithets of the Tathāgata: “Divine One,”[1481] “Tran quil One,”[1482] and “Emancipated One.”[1483] He is the one who turned [the wheel of the Dharma] and the one who did so for the first time; [then] other persons [turned] it again for [still] others. In this way, through an uninterrupted series [of teachers], [the wheel] that was set in motion by the Divine One reached the entire collection of sentient beings. Therefore, it is called “the divine wheel.”
Because he proclaimed himself to be the one whose instruction is supreme and the one who attained the perfection of [being] the unsurpassed teacher, because he defeats all false doctrines by teaching the [true] path, because he remains completely undaunted in the presence of those who voice opposition to his path, and because he raises his exalted and unsurpassed voice to defeat all opponents, [the sutra] states “he utters the true roar of a lion in an assembly.”

In short, [this passage] lays open, reveals, points out, and expresses the perfection of knowledge regarding what is beneficial to oneself, the perfection of knowledge regarding what is beneficial to others, and the unique nature of the perfection of knowledge regarding what is beneficial both to oneself and to others.
Another formulation of the summary meaning [of this passage is that it indicates the following.] “There is [a goal] to be attained, a method of attaining it, and the protection [provided] to all beings by that method. Any and all human beings or gods who wish to can obtain that method from me.”
Regarding this [topic], the exalted and most excellent state [of nirvana] should be regarded as resembling [a state in which] an illness has been cured. The turning of the divine wheel should be regarded as resembling the means of curing that illness. The utterance of the true roar of a lion in an assembly should be regarded as resembling the refutation of all the assertions made by inferior physicians as well as the [the Buddha’s] affirmation that he is the one who will surely cure the illness.

Those deeds that have been performed and accumulated,[1485] and that have since ceased, are said to be [deeds] of the “past.” Those that have not yet been performed, have not yet ceased, and are not [currently] being performed but will be performed in the future are said to be those of the “future.” Those deeds whose performance has not yet been completed and has not yet ceased but which have been resolved [to be done] and are in the course of being carried out are said to be those of the “present.” Moreover, these [deeds] are classified as being of three kinds: physical deeds, verbal deeds, and mental deeds.
As was described earlier,[1486] there are four ways of taking up what is right—that is to say, “there is a way of taking up what is right that is pleasant in the present but has a ripening that consists of suffering,”[1487] and so forth. These [four ways of taking up what is right] should be understood, in the appropriate manner, in terms of how they are beneficial or harmful in the present life and in future lives.

The region in which [deeds] are carried out is called their “place.” The animate or inanimate entities in relation to which [deeds] are carried out is called their “basis.” The particular root of nonvirtue or root of virtue that is the motivating factor which causes [deeds] to be carried out is called their “cause.” The desirable results that have beneficial qualities and the undesirable [results] that have adverse qualities are called the “ripening” [of deeds].
Combining all of these [elements] together, [the meaning of this power is that] the tathāgatas possess knowledge of deeds in all their aspects—[including those of] all the [three] times, in all their varieties, in all the circumstances in which they are carried out, in all the regions [where they are carried out], as well as all the bases [in relation to which deeds are carried out], all their motivating factors, and all their disadvantages and benefits.

There are four “meditative absorptions” and eight “liberations.” The way in which those who have gained fitness of mind[1489] and control of the mind by means of the meditative absorptions and liberations are able to enter various forms of one-pointed concentration that conform to those [absorptions and liberations] in order to achieve any aim that is desired is called “entering a state of one-pointed concentration.”[1490] As a portion [of a sutra passage] declares, “The Blessed One entered a state of one-pointed concentration that conformed to that [aim]. In accordance with the way his mind was composed, the entire Brahmā realm became filled with extraordinary light. The sound of his speech was also heard, but no one could see him.” In just this way, whatever common worldly aim or unique [transcendent aim] a tathāgata desires to accomplish, he does so with great ease by entering a state of one-pointed concentration that conforms to that [aim].
Regarding this [topic], the successful attainment of all the desired aims that depend on the mind [comes about] by means of the meditative absorptions and the liberations and through gaining power over the mind. That is the full extent of what all practitioners of meditative absorption need to accomplish. There is nothing superior to this and nothing beyond this. And the tathāgatas have attained every aspect of what practitioners of meditative absorption need to accomplish. This is the reason for the phrase: “the meditative absorptions, the liberations, and entering states of one-pointed concentration.”

<d e="2">
Moreover, in brief there are two [ways of] “becoming afflicted” that pertain to the meditative absorptions, etc. [One is] the [form of] affliction [that acts as] an obstruction to the attainment of those [meditative absorptions, etc.,] that have not yet been attained, such as making use of an ineffective means [of attaining them] or engaging in any of the [five] hindrances.[1491] [The second is to be overcome by] the perturbing action of an [overt] mental affliction that occurs on the particular level [of a meditative absorption, etc.,] that has been attained or [to be adversely affected by] the latency[1492] [of such a mental affliction]. By contrast, there are two [ways of] “becoming more refined.” They should be understood as being the opposites of those [two ways of becoming afflicted].
The [verbal act of] formulating, in an appropriate manner and using suitable words and expressions, those various states of meditative absorption, etc., that have been achieved is called their “formulation.”[1493]
The further development of those very states of meditative absorption, etc., that have been attained, by means of [continued] meditative practice, as well as the attainment [of a level of development] in the manner desired and the attainment of a state of excellence [and the ability to do so] without difficulty is called [the method of] their “purification.”[1494]
Regarding this [topic], a tathāgata knows everything about how these [meditative absorptions, etc.,] fail to be achieved, how they are achieved, what is inferior about them, what is excellent about them, the terms [to use in explaining] them, as well as the culmination of their development. Therefore, this unsurpassed [power] of the tathāgatas is called “the power of knowledge regarding the absorptions, the liberations, and entering states of one-pointed concentration.”

They are (1) the name by which one is addressed; (2) the caste, such as the ruling class,[1513] etc., to which one belongs; (3) one’s mother and father; (4) the type of food and drink that one consumes; (5) one’s good and bad fortune; and (6) the diversity of one’s life span.
Thus, when individuals describe themselves or others in the world, they make reference to these six circumstances that are based on the eight basic elements of life. [For example,] one says, (1) “This is my name,” or “That is his or her name.” (2) “I belong to the ruling class,” or “He or she belongs to the ruling class,” or “I belong to the priestly class,” or the working class, or the servile class; or, “He or she belongs to the priestly class,” or the working class, or the servile class. (3) “This is my father,” or “This is his or her father.” Just as with someone’s father, the same applies to that [person’s] mother. (4) “I eat this type of food,” whether it is mixed beverages,[1514] cakes, or different kinds of porridge and sour gruel; or, “Others [eat them].” (5) Similarly, “I experienced such a misfortune or good fortune,” or “This person [experienced them].” (6) “I have reached such a stage of life,” whether a youth, a middle-aged person, or an elderly person; or, “This person [has reached some stage of life].” These are the six circumstances that correlate with the [eight] basic elements of life.

Regarding this [topic], the divine abodes [of the gods] are said to be those that are related to the [four] meditative absorptions. Because [the Tathāgata’s] eye is based upon those [meditative absorptions], because it is the fruit of those [meditative absorptions], and because it is taken hold of by those [meditative absorptions], it is called the “divine eye.” Because [the Tathāgata’s] eye is the fruit of the meditative absorptions that have been most highly accomplished and fully perfected, it is called [the divine eye that is] “perfectly pure.” Because [the Tathāgata’s eye] is distinct even in name from that of humans, it called [the divine eye] “which surpasses that of humans.” There is also a divine eye that the gods who live in the desire realm obtain at birth and that resembles [the Tathāgata’s eye] only to the extent that it has the same name. By contrast, [the ordinary eye] of humans does not even have the quality [that would allow it to be referred to by that name].

Sentient beings who are dying are described by the expression “[those] who are passing away.” Those who are in the intermediate state are described by the expression “those who are being reborn.” Those two types [of sentient beings] who are traveling into darkness[1516] are proceeding to their next existence as intermediate state beings whose [subtle] mental body resembles either a [piece of] black felt cloth or a night that is enveloped in thick darkness. Therefore, they are called “those [sentient beings] of bad appearance.” On the other hand, those two types [of sentient beings] who are traveling into light[1517] are proceeding to their next existence as intermediate state beings whose [subtle] mental body resembles either a moonlit night or a fine [piece of] Varanasi cloth. Therefore, they are called “those [sentient beings] of good appearance.” Regarding this [topic], those of bad appearance are “inferior”; those of good appearance are “excellent.” Those who are inferior are the ones who are proceeding to the unhappy migratory states. Those who are excellent are the ones who are proceeding to the happy migratory states.
Due to their errant conduct, along with [the errant thoughts] that gave rise to [their conduct], they are described as “those who possess physical, verbal, and mental misdeeds.” Those who hold the two types of wrong understanding and errant views—[namely,] the discrediting of everything[1518] and the discrediting of those āryas who abide in the opposite of that opinion[1519]—are called “those who hold wrong views” and “those who discredit the āryas.”

Due to these wrong views, [sentient beings] develop wrong beliefs about causes and results. For that reason and due to that condition, they carry out wrongful deeds. Those who carry out wrongful deeds adopt either the way of taking up what is right that is pleasurable in the present but has a painful ripening in the future or the way of taking up what is right that is both painful in the present and also has a painful ripening in the future. Therefore, [the sutra] states: “on account of their deeds that relate to taking up what is right in the form of wrong views.”
Because they will proceed to the lower realms on the basis of those very [wrong views and wrongful deeds], even though they may possess many other virtuous qualities, [the sutra] states: “due to that cause, due to that condition.”

Regarding this [topic], wicked and crude conduct is called “a downward path,” because it leads to a [lower] place. Therefore, [the places that one is led to by such conduct] are called “the lower realms.”[1520] They are called “unhappy migratory states”[1521] because one encounters suffering there and because many kinds of intense suffering are experienced there continually and for a long time. They are called “states of downfall”[1522] because [beings who are born there] abide in a lower region, because those [regions] resemble a great abyss, and because [the beings who are born there] wail [in the form of] anguished, pitiful, wretched, and loud cries of woe.

In the appropriate manner, the opposite of the above explanations should be understood as constituting the virtuous side of this topic. With regard to that, the following [two comments] are of a distinct nature. A migratory state that is preceded by good conduct is called a “happy migratory state.”[1524] Because it is a place where the highest forms of happiness are experienced, it is called a “celestial world.”[1525]

The mind that is free of the outflows and is their antidote in that it abandons in their entirety the latent forms of all the outflows, as well as the wisdom that is free of the outflows—which together constitute the supreme forms of superior mind [training] and superior wisdom [training]—are referred to as “the liberation of mind and the liberation of wisdom” [that are manifested] “through having terminated the outflows.”
Moreover, after having attained that liberation of mind and that liberation of wisdom in their final existence on the basis of the path of seeing and on the basis of the path of meditation, [the tathāgatas] realize for themselves, by means of the sixth [form of] supernatural knowledge,[1527] their own attainment as it truly is, and they announce [their attainment] to those others who are desirous of knowing it. Therefore, [the sutra passages] declare [in part,] “and after having manifested and attained by means of his own supernatural knowledge and within his very lifetime [the liberation of mind and the liberation of wisdom that are free of the outflows], the tathāgatas proclaim[1528] . . .” The statement “Birth has come to an end for me,” along with the various other statements [that occur in this passage] should be understood as [they are explained] in the Collection of Canonical Expressions.[1529]

Regarding this [topic], what is the essential nature [of the ten powers]?
Their essential nature is the five [spiritual] faculties;[1530] however, they are described as having the essential nature of wisdom, because of wisdom’s predominance. For example, [the first power is described] as “the power of knowledge regarding proper and improper conditions”; it is not described as the power of faith nor is it described as the power of any of the other [faculties]. As is the case with the power of knowledge regarding proper and improper conditions, the same [explanation] should be regarded [as applying to] the remaining powers.

Regarding this [topic], what are the categories [of the ten powers]?
In brief, it should be understood that they possess three types of immeasurability. This is because, in relation to the category of time, they engage all the entities that exist in the past, present, and future; in relation to the category of kinds of entities, they engage every form of individual and general characteristic that relates to each and every conditioned entity; and, in relation to the category of mind continuum,[1531] they engage all the needs of every individual mind stream that exists within the sphere of all sentient beings that extends throughout the ten directions. In this way, it should be understood, on the basis of these categories, a tathāgata’s ten powers possess the quality of being immeasurable.

Draw near, O child of good family. Having gone alone and unaccompanied to an isolated dwelling place, direct your attention inwardly to that very name given to you by your mother andfather, or [that very name given to you] by your teacher and preceptor. Also direct your attention further in the following manner: “Is there any inherently established entity apart from my six [inner] bases[1534] that exists internally, externally, or [in some way] other than those two, and [that constitutes the object] in relation to which this name, this appellation, this designation, and this figure of speech occur?” As you direct your attention properly in this way, you will not perceive any such entity. You will have no thought other than the following: “This adventitious appellation only occurs in relation to these adventitious entities.”
O child of good family, when this conception of being adventitious has arisen in you and been understood [by you] in relation to your name, then also direct your attention inwardly in a proper manner to the name “eye,” the appellation “eye,” and the designation “eye” [that occur] in relation to your eye. Also direct your attention further in the following manner: Two things are perceived in relation to the eye. [One is,] “This is the name, the appellation, and the designation ‘eye,’” and [the other is,] “That is the bare substance[1535] in relation to which this name, appellation, and designation [occur].” There is nothing beyond that and nothing more than that.
Regarding this [point], not only are the name, appellation, and designation [that occur] in relation to the eye not the eye, that substance in relation to which the appellation “eye” [occurs] is also not an eye that exists inherently.

<d e="2">
Why is that?
Concerning this [point], without the name “eye,” the appellation “eye,” and the designation “eye,” no one could develop the awareness of an eye. [However,] if that substance were truly established in the sense of possessing an essence that could be described by a name, then the awareness of [that which is called] an “eye” would no longer come into being in such a way that is dependent [upon the name “eye”]; [instead,] the awareness of [that which is called] an “eye” would simply occur naturally in relation to that substance, even without [one’s] ever having heard or conceived of any names. Nevertheless, its [continuous] occurrence is not [so] perceived. Therefore, this name “eye” and [this] appellation “eye” are also adventitious [phenomena that occur] in relation to an adventitious entity. Through directing your attention to the eye in this way, inwardly and in a proper manner, the conception of being adventitious will also arise and be understood in relation to the appellation “eye.”
As is the case with respect to the eye, the same is true with respect to the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, and so on at length up to those [entities] that are seen, heard, thought about, and realized, those that have been attained, those that are sought after, as well as those that are deliberated about and reflected upon with the mind. In short, the conception of being adventitious will also arise and be understood in relation to all the appellations that occur in relation to entities.

In this way, you will correctly take hold of the path of preparation whose aim is to remove the settled conception that you have regarding your personal self. [This point is repeated] at length [for all other entities] up to: You will correctly take hold of the path of preparation whose aim is to remove the settled conception that you have regarding all entities. In this way, having repeatedly cleared away all the elaborative conceptions that occur in relation to all entities by means of an awareness that effectively examines all objects of knowledge and by means of the conception that all the appellations regarding entities are adventitious, abide at length in the [real] substance[1536] with a nonconceptualizing mind that is free of signs and is engaged in apprehending merely the true mode of being. In this way, through the lineage of one-pointed concentration that pertains to a tathāgata’s pure knowledge, you will attain one-pointedness of mind. If you direct your attention to [the meditation object of] unattractiveness, you should not relinquish this form of attention [that apprehends ultimate reality]. If you direct your attention to [any other meditation object, such as those of] loving-kindness, the mere conditionality of dependent origination, the diversity of the elements, recollection of one’s breath, the first meditative absorption, and so on up to the sphere in which there is neither conception nor absence of conception, or [any of] the immeasurable bodhisattva forms of meditative absorption, supernatural knowledge, one-pointed concentration, and states of composure, you should not relinquish this very form of attention. In this way, this bodhisattva form of attention [that is being practiced] by you will eventually arrive at unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment.

By means of the power of knowledge regarding death and rebirth, a tathāgata declares where listeners who died at some time in the past were reborn. He also repudiates those ascetics and brahmins who profess a nihilistic doctrine.

He also repudiates the exaggerated pride of those ascetics and brahmins [who wrongly believe they have attained] the status of an arhat. This, then, should be understood [to constitute a description of] the actions of the ten powers.

Regarding this [topic], what is the successive order of a tathāgata’s ten powers?
A tathāgata acquires all of the ten powers at the same time that he attains unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment. Though acquired simultaneously, they become evident in a successive manner. As soon as a tathāgata has attained enlightenment, he correctly observes the systematic arrangement of causes and effects that relate to entities by means of the power of knowledge regarding proper and improper conditions. Having observed that, by means of the power of knowledge regarding [the fact that] one’s deeds are one’s own, he correctly reveals to those in the desire realm who wish to attain certain kinds of favorable results that correspond to that realm [the need to] avoid nonvirtuous karma and undertake virtuous karma. Moreover, by means of the power of knowledge regarding the absorptions, the liberations, and entering states of one-pointed concentration, he provides instruction in a correct manner for achieving the paths that will bring about attainment of the worldly form of detachment to those beings who are desirous of gaining the worldly form of detachment. In addition, by means of a tathāgata’s remaining seven powers, he reveals the path for attaining the transcendent form of detachment to those [beings] who are desirous of gaining the transcendent form of detachment.

Regarding this [latter point], by means of the power of knowledge regarding inferior and superior faculties, [a tathāgata] first examines the faculties of those who desire the transcendent form of detachment. Then, by means of the power of knowledge regarding diverse forms of devotion, he examines the attitudes that accompany those faculties. Following that, by means of the power of knowledge regarding diverse constituent elements, he examines the latent propensities that accompany those attitudes. Having realized the faculties, attitudes, and latent propensities [of such beings] in this way, he introduces them in an appropriate manner to the [meditation] objects that represent the starting points [for their spiritual practice] by means of the power of knowledge regarding the paths that lead everywhere. Following that, once they have been caused to take hold of mental stability by practicing the appropriate meditation object that represents the starting point for engaging in [spiritual practice] and after they have purified themselves of their unfavorable mental traits,[1537] he reveals, by means of the power of knowledge regarding recollection of former lives and the power of knowledge regarding death and rebirth, the middle way that rejects grasping at the eternalistic and nihilistic extremes that are rooted in the perishable collection view, so that they will abandon all the mental afflictions. After that, by means of the power of knowledge regarding the termination of the outflows, he likewise causes those who have applied themselves to the practice correctly and who are established in quiescence to abandon the form of exaggerated pride that, as a consequence of no longer exhibiting overt forms of the mental afflictions even though they have not been abandoned, wrongly leads them to believe they have completed [the practice] when they have not done so. This, then, constitutes one formulation of the order of the powers.

Here is another formulation [of the successive order of a tathāgata’s ten powers]. In this case, after having attained unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment, a tathāgata first manifests the power of knowledge regarding proper and improper conditions and ponders well the supreme knowledge of the settled nature of entities[1538] in relation to all entities that arise dependently. Relying upon the knowledge [that perceives] the settled nature of entities, he observes the faction of [beings that is made up of] householders with the power of knowledge regarding [the fact that] one’s deeds are one’s own. [By doing so, he perceives] all the various kinds of deeds that have brought about, will bring about, and are currently bringing about the [temporary] attainments of those who rely upon the householder state of existence.

After observing the faction of [beings that is made up of] householders, he observes the faction of [beings that is made up of] those who have gone forth [into the homeless state] with the power of knowledge regarding the absorptions, the liberations, and entering states of one-pointed concentration, and reflects, “Is there or is there not anyone in the faction of [beings that is made up of] those who have gone forth who has attained deliverance from suffering and who teaches [others] the path [that leads] to deliverance from suffering?” Realizing that there is not [any such person] and gazing upon the entire world that has no [source of] protection and has no [source of] refuge, he surveys it using the buddha eye and motivated by great compassion. As he surveys [the world], he manifests the knowledge of inferior and superior faculties and realizes, “There are sentient beings who have been born in the world and who have become full-grown in the world whose faculties are weak, [there are sentient beings] whose faculties are moderately developed, and [there are sentient beings] whose faculties are sharp.” Having realized this, his mind moves toward [the act of] teaching the Dharma. Following that, it should be understood that the succession of the remaining powers of knowledge regarding diverse forms of devotion, etc., takes place in the manner [that was described] previously. This is a second formulation of the successive order of the [ten] powers.

Here is yet another formulation. At the very outset, as soon as a tathāgata has attained enlightenment, he examines the sphere of dependently arisen entities with the power of knowledge regarding proper and improper conditions. Following that, he examines the sphere of sentient beings—[which is to say, that sphere] among the dependently arisen entities that is universally recognized as [being made up of] sentient beings—and [recognizes,] “These sentient beings are experiencing this type of result of this type of deed that each one has carried out him- or herself.” Having closely examined in accordance with reality the sphere of entities and the sphere of sentient beings by means of the power of knowledge regarding the absorptions, the liberations, and entering states of one-pointed concentration, he correctly instructs those very sentient beings on the basis of the three marvelous abilities in order to free them from their suffering. [A tathāgata] who instructs [those sentient beings] after having realized their faculties, etc., and who then causes them to enter the path, [finally] liberates them from their suffering by means of the remaining powers in the successive manner that [was described] previously. This is the third formulation of the successive order of the [ten] powers.

Regarding this [topic], what is the difference between the power of knowledge regarding proper and improper conditions and the power of knowledge regarding [the fact that] one’s deeds are one’s own?
The way in which [a tathāgata realizes that] virtuous and nonvirtuous deeds bring about desirable and undesirable results is through the power of knowledge regarding proper and improper conditions. On the other hand, the way in which [a tathāgata realizes that] only that very individual who performs a particular virtuous or nonvirtuous deed will experience its [corresponding] desirable or undesirable result is through the power of knowledge regarding [the fact that] one’s deeds are one’s own.
The way in which [a tathāgata realizes that] only that very individual who enters a particular meditative absorption, liberation, etc., will possess it and not anyone else is through the power of knowledge regarding [the fact that] one’s deeds are one’s own. By contrast, the way in which [a tathāgata] relies upon those very same meditative absorptions, etc., to instruct his followers using the three marvelous abilities is through the power of knowledge regarding the absorptions, the liberations, and entering states of one-pointed concentration.
The way in which [a tathāgata] perceives minds that are naturally accompanied by [the faculties of] faith, etc., is through the power of knowledge regarding the absorptions, the liberations, and entering states of one-pointed concentration. By contrast, the way in which [a tathāgata] distinguishes the different types of lesser, middling, and great faculties is through the power of knowledge regarding inferior and superior faculties.
The way in which [a tathāgata] perceives [sentient beings’] attitudes, which are accompanied by the [spiritual] faculties and [are directed] toward a variety of different objects, is through the power of knowledge regarding inferior and superior faculties. By contrast, the way in which [a tathāgata] distinguishes the diversity of those very attitudes is through the power of knowledge regarding diverse forms of devotion.

Moreover, in brief, it should be understood that there are six different types of attitude: (1) the attitude that does not lead to deliverance—such as that of beings who aspire to [be reborn in] such worlds as those of [the worldly gods] Maheśvara, Narāyana, and Brahmā; (2) the attitude that does lead to deliverance—such as that of beings who aspire to [pursue any of] the three vehicles; (3) the attitude that is far from purity—such as that of beings who are established in a [form of spiritual] ripening that is small or middling; (4) the attitude that is near to purity—such as that of beings who are established in a [form of spiritual] ripening that is great; (5) the attitude that can bring attainment of nirvana within the same lifetime—such as that of beings who aspire to attain nirvana by means of the Listeners’ Vehicle; (6) the attitude that will bring attainment of nirvana in the future—such as that of beings who aspire to attain nirvana by means of the Great Vehicle.
The way in which [a tathāgata] perceives the seeds that correspond to and are awakened by those [particular] forms of devotion is through the power of knowledge regarding diverse forms of devotion. By contrast, the way in which [a tathāgata] distinguishes and perceives the different forms of those very seeds is through the power of knowledge regarding diverse constituent elements.

The scriptural description of the four forms of intrepid confidence should be understood as it appears in the sutras.[1542]
Regarding this topic, these four states are ones that the tathāgatas affirm in an assembly. [They affirm that they have attained a state] that is not shared with the listeners, [that is to say,] the supremely perfect understanding [that realizes] all aspects of all entities through having become liberated from the obscurations to that which needs to be known. This is the first state. [They affirm having attained a state] that is shared with the listeners, [that is to say,] liberation from the obstructions of the mental afflictions. This is the second state. [They affirm that] the path [which they teach] is one whose purpose is to transcend [all] suffering and it is one that will lead those beings who are desirous of attaining liberation to deliverance [from samsara]. This is the third state. [They affirm that] the qualities that [they have declared] to be obstacles and that are obstructions to the attainment of that very path are, [in fact, qualities] that ought to be abandoned. This is the fourth state.

<d e="2">
A tathāgata is also one who makes affirmations that accord with reality about these four states. Therefore, not seeing [any] actions of body, speech, or mind that are at variance with the affirmations made in relation to the prior two states, [not seeing any] internal contradictions or occurrences of unreasonableness that are at variance with the affirmations made in relation to the latter two states, and [not seeing anything] that constitutes a reason which those who possess divine vision as well as those who lack divine vision and those who are able to discern others’ thoughts as well as those who are not able to discern others’ thoughts could use to argue [justifiably] against the states [being set forth] in the affirmations, he affirms these states with intrepid confidence, with a mind that is undaunted, free of any apprehension, and free of any fear.
This also constitutes the extent of what the Master has affirmed—namely, that the [form of] practice [that accomplishes] what is beneficial to oneself and the [form of] practice [that accomplishes] what is beneficial to others have been fulfilled. Regarding this [point], fulfillment of the [form of] practice [that accomplishes] what is beneficial to oneself is affirmed by the former two states and fulfillment of the [form of] practice [that accomplishes] what is beneficial to others is affirmed by the latter two states.

Regarding this [topic], through his own [attainment of] the supremely perfect understanding [that realizes] all entities, a tathāgata affirms true and complete buddhahood to those bodhisattvas who are firmly established in the Great Vehicle. In addition, he affirms the termination of all the outflows to those who are firmly established in the Listeners’ and Solitary Realizers’ vehicles. He affirms the path that leads to deliverance [from samsara] and the qualities that are obstructive to [those who are firmly established in] both of those [types of vehicles].
This is how the tathāgata taught this sutra statement: “The path that leads to deliverance which I taught to bodhisattvas and listeners . . . ,” and so on. The compilers of the listener collection of scriptures have taken out the word “bodhisattva” from that section [of the canon]. By contrast, in the bodhisattva collection of scriptures, the word “bodhisattva” alone is mentioned.

The scriptural description of the three closely placed recollections should be understood as it appears in the sutras.[1543] The Tathāgata has long held the following aspiration: “Having taught the Dharma well to my disciples, I hope that they will become properly established in the practice.” In brief, [the ability of] the Master of the Dharma and the leader of a group of followers who has long held this aspiration to remain free of mental affliction in response to both the fulfillment of that prayer and its lack of fulfillment [is a quality that] derives its strength from the three closely placed recollections.

The scriptural description of the three forms of having nothing that needs to be concealed should be understood as it appears in the sutras.[1544] In brief, the condition of having abandoned any form of misdeed that needs to be covered up is what is indicated by a tathāgata’s three forms of having nothing that needs to be concealed. A tathāgata also never at any time incurs any form of those slight indeterminate misdeeds that even arhats sometimes, occasionally, commit due to a lapse of recollection. Therefore, a tathāgata’s nature is exactly as he has affirmed it to be.

He proclaims [this nature] to listeners as a way of suppressing[1545] them repeatedly. He censures some of them as a way of continually subduing them.

[Since he has no faults,] it does not occur to him to preserve their goodwill [by thinking:] “I do not want the listeners to become aware of my impure physical, verbal, and mental conduct through their close association with me and, because they have become displeased and upset by that, to admonish me. Nor do I want them to report it to others.”

All of these [attributes] combined together constitute a buddha’s one hundred and forty unique qualities. Among them, the marks and secondary signs are attained in their most perfect form by a bodhisattva in his final existence. When a bodhisattva who is in his last existence and who has fully completed the path of the [two] accumulations [that are needed] for enlightenment sits down at the seat of enlightenment, and as he is meditating on the thirty-seven qualities that are conducive to enlightenment without [the aid of] a teacher, he attains a [form of] one-pointed concentration called [the one-pointed concentration] “that bestows in an instant the knowledge that is free from any obstructions.” [This concentration is] included in the diamond-like one-pointed concentration that is possessed by a bodhisattva who is still pursuing the spiritual training. In the moment immediately following that, he attains the unsurpassed state of perfect purity in which all the remaining qualities ranging from the ten powers up to the knowledge of all aspects and what is most excellent arise simultaneously. By virtue of their attainment, the perfectly pure and immaculate [transcendent] awareness that engages the totality of objects of knowledge is free of any resistance or obstruction and is subject to nothing more than the turning [of the mind].[1554] He becomes one who has fulfilled all his aims. Having become one who in this manner has fulfilled his desired object, he has transcended the conduct of a bodhisattva and the stage of a bodhisattva, and has entered upon the conduct of a buddha and the stage of a buddha.

Regarding this [topic], how should the distinguishing characteristics of the transcendent awareness possessed by a bodhisattva who is established in the stage that is the perfect manner of going and those of [the transcendent awareness] possessed by a tathāgata be understood? [How should it be understood that the two represent] distinct [forms of] transcendent awareness?

In this instance, the transcendent awareness of a bodhisattva who is established in the stage that is the perfect manner of going should be understood [to perceive] all objects of knowledge in a manner that resembles the way a sighted person perceives visible objects that are covered by a thin cloth. By contrast, the transcendent awareness of a tathāgata should be regarded [as perceiving all objects of knowledge] in a manner [that resembles the way a sighted person perceives visible objects] that are not covered by anything.

For example, the transcendent awareness of the bodhisattva [of this stage] should be regarded as being like a painting that has been filled in with every type of color but has not yet been completed by [applying] the last, perfected paint strokes. A tathāgata’s transcendent awareness should be regarded as being like a perfectly completed [painting].

For example, the transcendent awareness of the bodhisattva [of this stage should be understood to perceive all objects of knowledge] in a manner that resembles the way a sighted person perceives visible objects under slightly darkened conditions.

For example, [the transcendent awareness] of the bodhisattva [of this stage should be understood to perceive all objects of knowledge] in a manner that resembles the way a sighted person [perceives] visible objects from a distance.

The mental activity of a bodhisattva who is situated on the stage that is the perfect manner of going should be regarded as resembling that of an arhat while he or she is in the dream state.[1558] A tathāgata’s [mental activity] should be regarded as resembling that of the very same [arhat] when he or she is awake.

Regarding this [topic], what are a buddha’s activities?
In brief, the following ten are the deeds of a tathāgata that ought to be done and the activities of a tathāgata that ought to be carried out. Each of the deeds carried out by a tathāgata accomplishes the aims of immeasurable sentient beings. There are none that are higher than these and none that are greater than these.

</d>
<d e="2">
What are the ten?
The first deed of a tathāgata is to engender, at the very outset, a clarity of mind[1559] [in others] toward his own nature as a great being and to generate [in them] a firm conviction[1560] about the state of a great person. He accomplishes this by means of the marks and secondary signs.

Providing every kind of instruction to all sentient beings is the deed of a tathāgata that he accomplishes by means of the four forms of complete purity. This is the second deed of a tathāgata.

<d e="2">
The ability to accomplish all sentient beings’ aims combined with the ability to remove all their doubts represents the third deed of a tathāgata and it is one that he accomplishes by means of a tathāgata’s ten powers. That is to say, a tathāgata is able to accomplish all the aims of all sentient beings by means of the ten powers that were described earlier. And, whatever persons ask questions of a tathāgata relating to his [ten] powers, he answers their questions by expounding those things that are known, seen, understood, and realized by a tathāgata, in exactly the manner that they are known, seen, understood, and realized by him.

<d e="2">
The condition of remaining free of mental affliction toward both those followers who abide by his directives and those who do not abide by them is the fifth deed of a tathāgata and it is one that a tathāgata accomplishes by means of the [three] closely placed recollections.

</d>
<d e="2">
The quality of never failing to do everything that needs to be done for all sentient beings is the eighth deed of a tathāgata and it is one that a tathāgata accomplishes by possessing a nature that is completely free of confusion.

The rejection of [both] those entities that are disadvantageous and those entities that are neither advantageous nor disadvantageous, followed by the naming, explaining, and revealing of those entities that are advantageous, is the tenth deed of a tathāgata and it is one that a tathāgata accomplishes by means of his knowledge of all aspects and what is most excellent.
This is the manner in which a tathāgata, by carrying out the ten deeds of a tathāgata, accomplishes all the activities of a buddha by means of a buddha’s one hundred and forty unique qualities. Furthermore, it would not be easy to give a detailed enumeration of the different forms of a buddha’s activities even [if one described them] for up to a trillion trillion kalpas.

All of these buddha qualities that the tathāgatas possess are conducive to accomplishing others’ aims to an exceedingly great degree and they are distinguished by [the characteristic of] accomplishing others’ aims, unlike [the qualities] that the listeners and solitary realizers possess. Therefore, those [qualities of a tathāgata] are said to be “unique.”[1561] There are certain qualities of a buddha that are not seen in any form at all among the listeners and solitary realizers. These include, for example, great compassion, the nature of being completely free of confusion, the complete destruction of the traces, and the knowledge of all aspects and what is most excellent. There are others that are perceived [among the listeners and solitary realizers] but not in a form that is complete in every respect. However, all of those that are possessed by a tathāgata are perceived in a form that is complete in every respect, that have greatly surpassed [others], and that are most excellent. Therefore, they are called “unique.” It should be understood that the meaning of the term “unique” is that of being exclusive.

Why is that?
It is because all the most important brief and extensive explanations [found throughout] the entire bodhisattva collection [of scriptures] have been included and set forth in this Stage of a Bodhisattva. Moreover, as long as the [Buddha’s spiritual system of] Dharma and Vinaya that has been revealed at length in this Stage of a Bodhisattva shall endure, develop widely, and achieve greatness through being frequently explained, recited, and practiced in a manner that accords with the Dharma, for that length of time the counterfeit forms of the true Dharma that bring about the disappearance of the true Dharma will not abound. On the other hand, as soon as the counterfeit forms of the true Dharma abound, that will bring about the disappearance of the true Dharma that is connected with what really exists.

The following represents the successive order [of the topics that are presented] in The Stage of a Bodhisattva.
A bodhisattva who abides in the [Great Vehicle’s] spiritual lineage generates the thought to [achieve] unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment. [The bodhisattva] who has generated that thought applies him- or herself to [the attainment of] one’s own aim and that of others. The person who is applying him- or herself to [the attainment of] one’s own aim and that of others finds the means by which to avoid becoming afflicted. The person who remains unafflicted finds the means by which to remain free of weariness. The person who is unwearied finds the means by which to increase [his or her] roots of virtue. The person who increases his or her roots of virtue [ultimately] achieves unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment.
The person who is pursuing the practices [that will accomplish] one’s own aim and that of others, [pursuing] the means by which one can avoid becoming afflicted, the means by which one will remain free of weariness, the means by which one will increase [one’s] roots of virtue, and [ultimately pursuing] the attainment of enlightenment, at the very outset fixes his or her devotion upon the profound and extensive subjects. The person who has fixed his or her devotion upon those subjects will seek them. Having sought them, one will both teach them to others and [strive to] achieve them by one’s own practice.

As one [strives to] achieve them, one practices in whatever way, in relation to whatever object, and for the sake of whatever purpose one ought to practice. While proceeding in that way, in relation to that object, and for that purpose, one practices in whatever way will bring about the accumulation of merit and the accumulation of wisdom. The person who has accumulated merit and wisdom practices the means by which to avoid abandoning samsara. While practicing in that way, one undertakes to avoid developing the mental afflictions [while remaining] in samsara. While practicing in that way, one undertakes to avoid becoming attached to one’s own happiness. While practicing in that way, one undertakes to avoid being made weary by the suffering of samsara.

<d e="2">
While avoiding being made weary by that [suffering], [a bodhisattva] relies upon the [inner and outer] bodies of teachings and becomes one who is proficient in all the bodies of teachings. Having become a person who knows the [various] bodies of teachings, [one] learns what should be taught to whom and how to go about doing so, thereby becoming one who knows the world. The person who knows the bodies of teachings and who knows the world in this way seeks the Dharma in a proper manner.
The person who is seeking [the Dharma] in this way develops the ability to remove all doubts possessed by all sentient beings. As the person who possesses this ability increases his or her merit through removing the doubts of others, he or she will complete the accumulation of merit. By increasing one’s knowledge, one will also complete the accumulation of wisdom. While completing [the two accumulations], one will apply oneself in a genuine manner to [the practice of] meditating upon the [spiritual] qualities that are conducive to enlightenment. One will also know the [proper] method of [engaging in] meditation. The person who has applied him- or herself in this manner will dedicate his or her meditation [practice] to [the attainment of] the Great Vehicle’s form of complete nirvana, not to [the attainment of] the form of complete nirvana [that is pursued in] the vehicles of the listeners or the solitary realizers.

The person who possesses this kind of skillful means will retain [in his or her mind those teachings that were] uttered by all the buddhas and bodhisattvas and that were [previously] heard. Through the power of meditation, every aspect of the Dharma [teachings] that one has not previously heard will also become clear. The person who possesses this power of retention and this clarity of understanding will practice the three doors to liberation with the aim of abandoning all the obscurations.[1563] The person who practices in this way will become one who is established in the aim of abandoning one’s own [forms of] erring belief and exaggerated pride as well as those of others. This constitutes [a bodhisattva’s] form of practice that is excellent in every respect.

Regarding this [point], the differences in the qualities of their spiritual practice [are as follows]. A bodhisattva is established [in the spiritual practice] in order to benefit [both] oneself and others, and he or she is also one who considers one’s duty to be the pursuit of others’ aims. A listener and a solitary realizer do not consider their duty to be the pursuit of others’ aims in the same way. [A bodhisattva] is one who has the same attitude toward all sentient beings as one does toward oneself. With this mind that views [everyone] equally, he or she is always intent upon aiding [everyone], and does not wish for anything in return. As one [whose mind] is directed in this way, [a bodhisattva] always desires to benefit others and bring them happiness. Having such an intention to benefit and bring happiness [to others], he or she puts forth fruitful efforts on their behalf. This constitutes the distinguishing characteristic that relates to the qualities of [bodhisattvas’] spiritual practice, one that [over time] is accomplished to an ever-increasing degree.

<d e="2">
Regarding this [point], the differences in their favorable qualities[1564] [are as follows]. A bodhisattva receives a prophecy [regarding his or her enlightenment] from the buddhas. A listener and a solitary realizer disciple do not. [A bodhisattva] who has received a prophecy is one who resides on the stage of irreversibility. [A bodhisattva] who abides there obtains the nature of being completely free of confusion with regard to what is to be done out of necessity and what is to be done continually. A declaration about the quality of being completely free of confusion in this way is made by buddhas and bodhisattvas when they are making pronouncements about those who are the best among all sentient beings. [A bodhisattva who resides on the stage of irreversibility] also does not fail to carry out all those activities that ought to be done. Nor does one leave unfinished those [goals] that are unattained and still incomplete.
By not leaving anything unfinished, [a bodhisattva] is always increasing his or her virtuous qualities. Because [that bodhisattva] increases his or her virtuous qualities like [the moon] during the waxing half [of the month], he or she is a genuine bodhisattva, not a counterfeit one. By being a genuine bodhisattva, one knows every aspect of every method for [attaining spiritual] self-discipline. By knowing this, one becomes skilled about all the circumstances that relate to why something should be investigated, what subjects should be investigated, and the means by which they should be investigated. Through engaging in these investigations, one causes these matters to be ascertained.

By becoming skilled regarding these circumstances, [a bodhisattva] will become skilled about giving instruction. By becoming skilled about giving instruction, he or she attains the king of one-pointed concentrations, one whose objects are immeasurable. Having attained this concentration, [a bodhisattva] becomes one who teaches the Dharma in a fruitful manner. He or she becomes a teacher [whose efforts are] productive in a variety of ways. He or she becomes one who is completely familiar with [the doctrine of] the Great Vehicle. Having become familiar with that [doctrine] to a high degree, one becomes a supporter of the Great Vehicle. On any of a variety of occasions when one has become completely familiar with [the doctrine of] the Great Vehicle, one receives any of a variety of names, and the buddhas and bodhisattvas refer to and praise one with a name that is common to all bodhisattvas. These should be understood to be distinguishing characteristics that relate to the [bodhisattvas’] favorable qualities.

The ones who have such names[1565] should be understood to [have been given them because] they are a mark of being a bodhisattva. By possessing these marks, one can be successful in every aspect of the practice both within the householder faction and within the faction of those who have gone forth [into the homeless state]. [The bodhisattva] who can be successful within either of these two factions becomes one whose practice is meaningful and one whose superior attitude is solely devoted to the side of virtue. Whether adopting the householder faction or the faction of those who have gone forth, the person who has such an attitude will remain on the side of virtue for as long as he or she lives.

Following that [life], one will knowingly take birth where one can meet with buddhas and bodhisattvas and be of benefit to sentient beings. One will experience circumstances in which buddhas and bodhisattvas continually and uninterruptedly provide the support of their instruction and [will experience circumstances] in which one will [continually and uninterruptedly have the opportunity to] attain superior qualities that relate to the side of virtue. Seizing the benefits of that experience, one enters into that situation in which superior qualities can be attained in a manner [that resembles entering one’s own] abode.[1566] With a mind that is established in that situation, one advances in every way to ever-higher extraordinary states, without being satisfied until the state of perfection has been reached. Advancing in this way, one will obtain the state of perfection beyond which one no longer seeks anything higher or greater and where the unsurpassed state has been attained.
