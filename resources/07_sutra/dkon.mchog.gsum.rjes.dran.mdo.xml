The holy dharma is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good at the end. Its meaning is excellent, its wording is excellent. It is not adulterated, is totally complete, is total purity, is total purification. The bhagavat has taught dharma well. It is authentic sight. It is free from sickness. Its time has no interruption. It brings one in. This is meaningful to see. It is known to the experts through personal self-knowing. The dharma spoken by the bhagavat was well taught for taming. It is renunciation. It causes one to go to complete enlightenment. It is without dishar- mony and it has inclusion. It has reliability. It does end the journey.

</d>
<d e="2">
Recollection as it is used here means to look into the way in which something has good qualities. This recollection, which is the root of positive dharmas in their entirety, is done for the purpose of arousing faith in the supreme objects[32].
</d>
</f>
<f>
<d e="1">

</d>
<d e="2">
The words “faith”, “appreciation[33]”, and “respect” often are used to refer to aspects of mind that are very different in character. However, they are sometimes used as different names for the same thing[34]. In this text, the three terms are used with basically the same meaning, each one presenting a different shade of that basic meaning.
</d>
</f>
<f>
<d e="1">

</d>
<d e="2">
Faith is of three types: admiring, trusting, and aspiring. The first one is that, having heard here of the good qualities of the Three Jewels, they are understood and believed to be supreme and, moreover, there is a joy of mind with it that is complete in every way, a joy that amounts to being supreme[35].
</d>
</f>
<f>
<d e="1">

</d>
<d e="2">
Then, trusting faith[36] is like this. There is trust that the tathāgata has such and such good qualities, trust that the explanations coming from the dharma of authoritative statement are true in meaning and correct in their wording, and trust that the dharma of realization and the saṅgha too have such and such good qualities[37].
There is trust that the superfactual dharma[38] is the truth of cessation and free of all faults, and that that, which is free of all faults, has all good qualities because that which does not have beneficial features is faulty[39].
</d>
</f>
<f>
<d e="1">

</d>
<d e="2">
Then, for aspiring faith: aspiring and wanting[40] to attain the rank of buddha and saṅgha, wanting to fully absorb the dharma of authoritative statement, wanting to manifest the dharma of the superfactual expanse, and wanting to produce the dharma of realization within the mindstream all are the actual aspiring faith. Those things that must be included with them, such as wanting to make offerings to the Jewels, wanting to broadcast their good qualities, wanting to spread the dharma of authoritative statement, and so on are put with aspiring faith[41]. To take this further, when admiring and trusting faith have been engendered ahead of such activities, those activities are of the faithful kind but, when wanting the things mentioned is joined with offerings, and so on made for profit, fame, or competitive purposes, that is merely aspiration for the things mentioned, not faith in connection with them.

<d e="2">
“Appreciation” in general means to see certain qualities in something that does have those qualities. Here, it specifically means to know that something which has good qualities and is not deceptive does have good qualities and is not deceptive[42]. For the most part it is trusting faith, though the Abhidharma also says that it is, “joy, respect, and wonder” and these do indeed accompany it. Here, “respect” means holding up the object as special, so it is mostly contained within admiring faith. Note that the Abhidharma explains a type of trusting faith, which it calls “respect for the trainings”, and mentions “respectful application” in relation to it, which it explains as a “strong perseverance”, but this subject does not apply here[43].

Someone who has a very complete type of faith in the Three Jewels will take up going for refuge, take on the vows of individual emancipation, and also will arouse the enlightenment mind. That person will then engage in the three principal trainings and the pāramitās. Thus, the root of all paths is faith and that in turn only comes about through recollecting the Three Jewels. The recollection is initially done in relation to the Buddha.[44]

<d e="2">
Of those, his having defeated obstructors is connected with the with bhagavat at the start of the recollection. This term stands for “the buddha characterized as a bhagavat, where bhagavat is one who has the quality of having defeated obstructors”. The obstructors he has defeated are the four maras: the aggregates, the afflictions, the lord of death, and the son of the gods. He has the good quality of having defeated the four māras because he has abandoned the first three and has gone past being an object that could be harmed by the fourth.[47]

</d>
<d e="2">
The Sanskrit term “bhagavan” has various meanings such as “chom ldan ‹› possessing the quality of having defeated”, “skal ldan ‹› possessing the quality of being fortunate”, “legs ldan ‹› possessing the qualities of goodness”, and so on, because of which Ṛiṣhi Kapila, Kṣhatriya Kriṣhṇa[48], and others were also known as “bhagavan”. Therefore, the term “ ’das ‹› transcendent” for “ ’jig rten las ’das pa ‹› transcendent over the world” was added to it in order to make a term that would be distinguished compared to the original term. The bodhisatva translators[49] of the past chose to highlight the specific meaning involved despite the fact that in the Indian language this term does not include the equivalent of “ ’das ‹› transcendent” in it.

<d e="2">
A perfection of explanation is connected with tathāgata which was translated into Tibetan with “de bzhin gshegs pa ‹› gone to suchness”. Perfection of explanation is connected with the fact that he himself realized suchness without mistake, then taught it, unmistakenly and just as he had realized it, to others. “Tathā ‹› suchness” means the non-mistakenness of something just exactly as it is and “gata ‹› gone and also going” is used to indicate both that he realized it himself and that others will realize it[50].

</d>
<d e="2">
A perfection of abandonment is connected with arhat which was translated into Tibetan with “dgra bcom pa ‹› one who has defeated the enemy”. In regard to this, “afflictions together with their latencies” can be re-stated in more ordinary terms as “that which harms the dharmas of virtue”, and that can be further restated as “dgra ‹› an enemy”. Then, corresponding to that, abandonment of the afflictions will be referred to as “bcom ‹› defeated”.[51]

<d e="2">
A perfection of wisdom is connected with truly complete buddha. He has cleared off the entirety of not knowing—similar to a man clearing off the thickness of sleep, which is related with his coming to know unmistakenly the totality of the spheres of knowables. And the illumination of his intelligence has expanded, like a lotus that has bloomed, so that it spreads throughout all superficies.[52]

<d e="2">
Those two perfections of abandonment and wisdom paired together are known as “a perfection of accomplishment”. Then, those two plus the perfection of explanation make a set of three that refer to his being a perfect teacher because of his ability to act unmistakenly—that is, flawlessly—for the purpose of migrators. Now this kind of teacher is found only in a buddha. Raudra, Viṣhṇu, and others like them[53] do not have this ability at all; it is a good quality not found amongst ordinary beings.

In regard to that, Ṛiṣhi Vyāsa, and so on whose works focus on disagreements between parties but which are not able to resolve the matters involved which anyway are of no account, are people whose intelligence has not fully spread throughout all dharmas[54]. Nandaka, and so on who were controlled by desire, and those who are embroiled in suffering and living in evil deeds, have lost control of themselves to their own afflictions, so what capacity could they have for protecting others[55]? The pratyekas and others like them have realized the authentic but they do not talk about it so are not able to take on others as followers[56]. That is why the perfection of explanation is mentioned here.

The cause of his attainment of the teacher perfect in those ways is insight[57] which is right view and its feet which are thought, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and samādhi of the path of the noble ones[58]. Alternatively, higher prajñā is insight and the trainings of discipline and mind are the feet[59]. Alternatively again, insight is the three types of insight[60] and feet is the four perfections—discipline, conduct, reversal, and the blissful higher mind of seen dharmas[61].

Those three ways of enumerating them can be condensed into one key point of meaning. That is because right view, the higher training of prajñā, and the insight of the exhaustion of outflows[62] are contained in one thing; because the three insights of right insight, and so on and the training of discipline and the three of discipline, conduct, and reversal are all one entity; and because right samādhi and the training of mind and blissful higher mind of seen dharmas also have the same principal meaning.

The three insights mentioned above are the insights of former limits, of later limits, and of the exhaustion of outflows. A perfection of conduct is that he abides continuously in knowledge throughout all types of conduct and a perfection of reversal is that the doors of his faculties are restrained; those two make for a pure discipline and concentration at the same time. The blissful higher mind of seen dharmas mentioned above means that he is a person of pure four dhyānas and, in terms of them being without outflows, the fourth one is the main one among them. The extraperceptions are produced from them, therefore the three insights arise from them[63]. That sort of insight is knowing what is and unmistakenly seeing in direct perception the topics of what is to be abandoned and what is to be taken up. Having that insight in conjunction with accomplishment and conduct consistent with it can be likened to going on a road that is being watched with the eyes, so they are called “feet”. Alternatively, according to someone else’s explanation, “insight is the six extra-perceptions” in accordance with the meaning explained above in “and the feet are the four legs of miracles”.

How he went is as follows. The Tibetan term is bde bar gshegs pa.

</d>
<d e="2">
Of those, “bde bar gshegs pa ‹› gone pleasantly to pleasantness” indicates that he has, due to a pleasant path, gone to a pleasant or blissful fruition. At the time of the path, he abandoned activities that were not to be done, did not let arise what some others might find praiseworthy, did not shrink from the task and practised avoidance, and generally practised many things that were pleasing to mind. Thereby, at the time of the fruition, he had abandoned all types of unsatisfactoriness and obtained a perfection of unoutflowed bliss. Therefore, being and not being engaged with limits of accomplishment no longer matters to him[64]; he has distinguished himself from samsaric beings with their accomplishment of the resultant suffering that comes from causal suffering. This might lead you to think, “The ones who live within the desire realm have that sort of suffering but not the ones who dwell in the dhyāna and formless places”, but it is not like that and you should remember that the fruitions that result from being in those upper places definitely involve suffering.

</d>
<d e="2">
Now for those who do not understand that, there is “legs par gshegs pa ‹› gone well to goodness” which is connected with the fact that he has finalized abandonment and does not relapse into samsara. As with a contagious disease where, once one has been well cured of it there will be no relapse into it again, for him all the obscurations of the afflictions, etcetera, that he has abandoned have been abandoned and are done with. Thus, what he has done is different from what the Tīrthikas who engage the equilibria accomplish.[65]

You might think, “Yes, but this is the same as what the śhrāvakas and prateyakabuddhas have done, isn’t it?!”[66] For this, there is “rab tu shegs pa ‹› gone utterly to utterness” meaning that going by realizing every single one of the entirety of the dharmas to be realized, he has realized them utterly and gone to such; it is like saying “filling every single vase, the vases are utterly filled”. This quality is found only in the tathāgata—having gone this way, he has permanently entered the wisdom that unimpededly knows every one of the knowables.

Of the nine topics, looking at the world is connected to knower of the world. He looks on constantly at all sentient beings and, with his great compassion and his knowledge of whether sentient beings are happy or pained, successful or in failure, and with good fortune or not and his knowledge of whether it is time to tame them or not, he knows all the methods needed to tame them. In other words, given that he knows the sufferings and their source without exception, he is the knower of the world.

His doing the deed of taming fortunate ones[67] is connected with unsurpassed driver who tames excellent humans meaning excellent beings. Excellent humans, that is, excellent beings, are those who have good fortune. For them, he does the deed of taming their mind streams and thereby placing them in the three enlightenments. For those who do not have the good fortune required to be tamed by actually following the path of emancipation, he does the deeds of drawing them back from the bad migrations, lessening the sufferings of those with great suffering, and placing them on the paths to the higher levels. It does not matter where someone is stationed within the higher levels or on the paths to liberation, there is never a case when someone’s great level of good fortune is diminished because of him; such a thing is never possible.

Driver concerns his skill at taming beings. He is like the drivers of horses, elephants, and chariots who take a good road because they are knowledgeable about the roads that can be taken. Unsurpassed is an adjective modifying driver which is explained like this: “It shows that his activity is such that he can put even the most difficult-to-tame ones into the śhrāvaka’s enlightenment, as he did with his younger brother Nanda who had very great desire, Aṅgulimāla who had raging anger, Dasa’s Son and Pāla and others who had extremely thick delusion, and Kāśhyapa of Uruvilva who had particularly great pride”. The tathāgata’s enlightened activity is indeed able to engage everyone, those who are vessels and those who are not vessels[68].

There is the statement which says that he is “the tamer of fortunate ones and tamer of excellent men”. The statement sets out a group of people who can take advantage of his enlightened activity. It consists both of those who have the good fortune needed for liberation because they are vessels fit for it compared to those who are not and of those who are from the human world because, among all the worlds, the human world is the one that is the principal source of buddhas. Note that this group is not a group made up of the only beings that the Buddha’s enlightened activity can engage.

His being a teacher in whom such enlightened activity is present connects with teacher of gods and men. In fact, he is the teacher of all sentient beings within the three realms, but gods and men are mentioned here because seeing truth or seeing the attainment of fruition through training in virtue or the attainment of the noble ones’ levels are things not seen by anyone other than the excellent ones among migrators. Thus, gods and men are considered to be the principal ones to be tamed and are accordingly mentioned here. Note that that explanation is given from the standpoint of the common vehicle[69] but, in fact, in the world too, if one says, “the king bowed and prostrated”, even if it is not explicitly stated that the retinue also bowed and prostrated, it is understood by implication[70].

Now, to show the teacher in whom those kinds of good qualities are based, the words buddha bhagavat are repeated.

The two phrases The tathāgata corresponds to a cause of merit. His roots of virtue do not go to waste go with his having a definite situation, that is, with his being present in a steady way. In the expanse without remainder with good qualities that do not end, he perpetually shows deeds for the purpose of sentient beings. Samsaric beings’ virtues come to an end because they are used up in full-ripening[71] and śhrāvaka and pratyeka’s virtues also come to an end, being used up in the expanse of no-remainder[72]. Therefore these beings do not perpetually have an existence that corresponds to a cause of merit. The Buddha, previously when he was a bodhisatva, did not dedicate his generosity and the rest for the purpose of everyone’s happiness, but dedicated every bit of it to the emancipation of every sentient being. Because such merit does not end for as long as its aim has not been completed and because he cultivated it in a way that made it equal in extent to the expanse of all dharmas, the fruition, in correspondence with its cause, also never ends.

Anything that he does—going, staying, sleeping, begging for alms, looking, speaking, and so on—never becomes a cause for thinking, “This is afflicted”, never scares others off, never causes them pain, and never produces craving or anything else of the sort. Every activity connected with his body which is seen or heard gives birth to compassion, renunciation, perseverance, correct discernment of the authentic, pacifies suffering, and so on; it only ever becomes a cause of others’ virtue and brings them to admire him.
Disharmony here refers either to the being who is viewing his body not having faith in him or having afflicted thoughts aroused because of seeing him.

A person who comes before the teacher will come with one of two thoughts, either of faith or of outdoing him. The faithful includes a group of people who come driven by roots of virtue from the past but who have some doubts. It also includes a group of people who come with the highest level of faith; with that kind of faith, these people come intent on attaining the teacher’s dharma. For all of the faithful, on seeing his body and hearing his speech, total admiration and overt joy arises in them. Those who come with the thought to outdo him also are of two types: those who want to outdo him with prajñā such as the Nirgrantha Jains who went to argue the case for true existence, and those who want to outdo him with body strengths such as Ātavika Yakṣha. These beings must
first be tamed[76]. Because the tathāgata of no not-knowing and of infinite knowing has the confidence of knowledge to be able to teach dharma precisely in accord with any vessel, the tathāgata’s prajñā cannot be outdone by that of others.

The meaning of his strengths cannot be challenged is that, because the tathāgata has infinite strengths of body, other beings’ strengths cannot not challenge the strengths of his body. This has been taught, for example, in the Hurling A Boulder Sutra[77]. The Great Vehicle’s way of classifying the strengths of the body of the tathāgata appears extensively in the Sutra of Samādhi that Incorporates All Merit.

The first phrase is given in relation to showing the pleasant path, or you could say cause, to all sentient beings. For example, for some beings in the bad migrations, he sends light rays from his
body that alleviate their sufferings and, having produced faith in them, places them in the good migrations. Then, for those in the happy migrations, he places them in various things such as generosity, discipline, and so on and so gradually ripens them into the three enlightenments.[78]

The remaining three phrases of this group of four are given in relation to showing the pleasant path to those sentient beings who have entered a vehicle. Among them, a father to the bodhisatvas is for those who belong to the Great Vehicle; they are bodhisatvas belonging to the family of the buddhas. Because they are born from the buddha’s dharma[79] to begin with and then because, in terms of body, speech, mind, and activities, they come to abide as buddhas[80] or something corresponding to it, they are the sons of the buddhas. The tathāgata is their father because he is the object from whom they get their good qualities. That is how it works.

Then, a king to the noble persons is for those of the śhrāvaka and pratyeka families. Stream-enterers, returners, non-returners, śhrāvaka and pratyeka arhats, and so on are nourished by the buddha’s dharma but do not make it as far as the tathāgata side of dharma[81]. Therefore, they remain like ordinary commoners and, because of that, buddha is a king for them.

The enlightened activity of speech is that his knowledgeability is inconceivable[83]. It is inconceivable based on attempting to write it out: if one started with one phrase about it then explained that with more and more other phrases, even if one were to do that for unfathomable kalpas, one would not finish the task. It is conceivable based on presentation of its meaning: if during unfathomable kalpas infinite sentient beings were at the same time to ask a completely different question, the Buddha could just one time,
effortlessly giving a reply in various different ways, supply an ungarbled answer to each being; there would be only one instance of his speech but it would convey infinite meanings that would come forth in different, individual replies. There would be an infinite amount of speech yet each single being to be tamed would have his wisdom limitlessly increased because of it. “Knowledgeability” relates to his teaching dharma; “inconceivable” relates to its amazing, wondrous presentation.

His speech is complete purity is like this: it has been made completely pure because all faults of speech—lying, intonation with an unpleasant sound, functioning in ways which create unhappiness of mind and the like, styles of expression such as being too fast, and so on—have been removed in their entirety. In addition, from the perspective of good qualities, his speech has an intonation or melody that is pleasing to hear—according to the Lesser Vehicle his speech has five main aspects of intonation, according to the Great Vehicle it has sixty main aspects, and so on.

In regard to that, when he is acting for the purpose of sentient beings in the desire realm, he is not contaminated by hankering after desirables or by harmful states of mind.

Moreover, this way of talking means that his body and speech were involved with the desire and form realms but that he was not contaminated with the things connected with those places.

This also applies to those places where there is form; that form is extremely subtle so there is no contradiction if it is explained like that.

The three phrases[85] He is utterly completely liberated from the skandhas. He does not possess dhātus. His āyatanas are restrained teach that when he is acting for the purposes of sentient beings,
he has no attachment at all. Because the skandhas belong to those who have the character of taking birth again and again and the tathāgata has no birth, he is utterly completely-liberated from them. The dhātus were defined in relation to the birth of consciousness that grasps an object. Thus, given that he has abandoned the afflictions that depend on object and consciousness, he does not possess dhātus. The āyatanas were defined in relation to the cause of the production of visual and the other sense consciousnesses. Thus, given that he has restrained the afflictions that depend on them, his āyatanas are restrained. To sum this up, his is a body of wisdom which is transcendent over the meaning understood from the terms skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas.

Next, the way of enacting the purpose of migrators through abandonment and wisdom is shown. The first four phrases
He has cut the knots. He is completely liberated from the torments. He is liberated from craving. He has crossed over the river[86]
teach his enactment of the purpose of sentient beings from the perspective of what his abandonment is like. If afflictions as a whole are summarized, they come to craving, which has the character of being a knot that occurs on meeting with an object and to a river which has the characteristic of torment on not meeting with an object.
</d>
</f>
<f>

</d>
<d e="2">
The four are then connected with this teaching: “Because he has cut what are the knots, he is liberated from craving. Because he has liberated himself from torment, he has crossed over the river”. In that, knot means a restraint that holds non-liberation in place and its having been cut means that the craving for an object— body, possessions, and so on—that has been met with has been cut. In that, torment, which is the acting always within a greater level of affliction when an object thought of is not met with, has been
abandoned. That is what it is saying. Thus, becoming is none other than craving that wholly incorporates the three realms, and the river of the afflictions is a current that carries mind off helplessly in its direction. Moreover, that is fourfold; there are the rivers of desire, becoming, ignorance, and views.[87]

Wisdom is threefold: the wisdom of the knowledge of all superficies that knows all knowables; the wisdom of the knowledge of non-difference that views all buddhas within equality; and the wisdom of knowledge that is non-abiding because it does not abide in the extremes of samsara and nirvana even though it abides in the limit of the authentic[88]. These connect sequentially to the first three phrases as follows. From the standpoint of the first, wisdom is something that totally and completely pervades without one exception the spheres of knowables belonging to the three times. Then, the wisdom of all buddhas of the past, future, and present is the wisdom of a single buddha and that wisdom of a single buddha is also the wisdom of all the buddhas of the three times, so his knowledge is one that is not different from theirs. Next, does not abide means that he does not abide in the limited nirvana of lesser
types, an expanse in which the continuity of others’ purposes is severed[89].

<d e="2">
The limit of the authentic is the limit of being in the authentic only, meaning that he abides in the dharmakāya of utter completepurity, the suchness expanse of dharmas. It implies that he does not abide in samsara, which, combined with the last epithet, exposes the meaning of his non-abiding nirvana.

He abides on the level of looking upon all sentient beings is a phrase that sums up the meaning of all three. Of the tathāgata’s three kāyas, the dharmakāya abides looking on the nature of the situation of all sentient beings, seeing at the same time its own nature, and while not wavering from either. The saṃbhogakāya abides looking on the mindstreams of sentient beings of the pure levels, the mahāsatvas[90], and teaching them dharma. The supreme nirmāṇakāya[91], because it functions as a liberator of the mindstreams of the śhrāvakas, and so on and of the ordinary beings who have a very pure eye of intelligence, abides on the level of a dwelling place from which it views their elements and inclinations.

In that way, this later portion of the recollection was contained within nine topics: definite situation, body’s nature, what he is
based on, function, methods, dwelling, detachment, how he enacts the benefit of migrators through abandonment and wisdom, and a conclusion at which we have now arrived.

These are the true qualities of the greatness of the body of the buddha bhagavat is saying “all of the good qualities shown above are not found in others, they are the greatnesses owned by the tathāgata”. It means that, even though it is possible that others might have something of this sort to some small extent, no-one else has all of this and has it complete like this.

That was an explanation of the meaning of the recollection of the Buddha. There are explanations made by both noble one Asaṅga and his brother of the first part of the recollection in nine parts and a commentary made by master Vasubhandu to the later part of the recollection. Compared to them, this explanation includes both parts and is clearer.

It is good in the beginning refers to the fact that at the time of hearing it, its meaning is ascertained and a trusting faith in it is produced. Good in the middle means that at the time of contemplating it, joy will be produced from understanding that there will be an attainment of benefits and fruitions just as they were stated in the explanations of dharma.

It is not adulterated means that it has uncommon good qualities which are not like the ordinary versions found in the doctrines of the Tīrthika’s and others; its versions of impermanence, formatives’ suffering, lack of self, and so on are subtle presentations[93]. It is totally complete means that it is not a partial sort of antidote that works only against afflictions of desire, rather, it works against the afflictions of each of the three realms[94]. It is total purity means that it is the nature whose actuality is complete purity, the dharmadhātu, and the wisdom that observes it. It is total purification means that it is both the purifier of the adventitious stains and the fruition that comes from that, separation from the adventitious stains due to their abandonment.

Those three goodnesses together with excellent meaning and wordings makes a set of five that primarily shows the good qualities of the dharma of authoritative statement. The four of being not adulterated and so on, which are called “possessing the four qualities which are brahmacharya[95]”, are the greatnesses of the
holy dharma of an object that is uncompounded and holy dharma of perceiver of it that is realization. These four are explained in a commentary to the Abhisamayālaṅkara by Vasubhandu.

The buddha has taught dharma well or, as seen in some other editions, buddha’s dharma is well taught. The dharma shown by the Tīrthikas is badly taught because what it considers to be a path is not a path of emancipation, and because, as someone else said, what it considers to be a path to higher levels of being is actually a path to the bad migrations, and because, as someone else again said, although it shows a path to the higher levels, it shows it with impurities and incompleteness. The dharma that the bhagavat has shown is the opposite of that, therefore, it is well taught.

The phrase Its time has no interruption has the meanings of: the uncompounded expanse that is changeless and fearless; the wisdom of the noble ones’ path that is without corruption; and what is to be abandoned having been abandoned, there is no need to abandon it yet again.

The phrase It brings one in is explained like this. From the term “upanāyika” we get “draws in close” which has the meaning that,
through the approach of abandoning samsara which subsumes afflictions and unsatisfactoriness, one is brought or drawn into the un-outflowed expanse. One translator commented that this should be translated with “having insight”; if that were so, it would have to be “uparyayika”, so his translation does not quite fit.[97]

This is meaningful to see means that someone sees the dharma then gains the excellence of the fruitions and does not return, therefore it is meaningful.

It is known to the experts through personal self-knowing. In this phrase, the term experts refers to the noble ones. Their equipoise of wisdom without involvement in conceptual thinking realizes the dharma[98] in direct perception. It is not an object of consciousness and sophistry.

The phrase The dharma spoken by the bhagavat was well taught for taming is explained like this. It might be that the dharma is to be known through personal self-knowing but that does not mean that it is not known in authoritative statement[99]. The word of the tathāgata corresponds in cause to the dharmakāya, therefore his expression of dharma in authoritative statement accords with how he knows that dharma with his dharmakāya. Thus, the implication contained in this epithet is that “what is known in personal self-knowing is also explained in authoritative statement”. The phrasing well taught appears in some Indian language texts as “supragedita” which would have to be translated with “well and thoroughly distinguished”.

It causes one to go to complete enlightenment means that coming into contact with the dharma of authoritative statement causes a person to go along the path. The path that they are caused to go along is, according to the literal meaning of the words, that of the Great Vehicle[101]. However, putting that aside, the paths of the śhrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas are implied because even śhrāvakas who have chosen to enter no-remainder do, after a long time has passed, without doubt, enter the Great Vehicle. Thus, this epithet actually shows a single, ultimate vehicle.

The phrase It is without disharmony means that the dharmatā of what is to be realized also being one[102], the noble ones who are on the same level definitely do not have differing dharmas of their experience. And it has inclusion means that it has the good quality of the sort where one thing known allows total comprehension of many aspects, so the aspects are included in one; one wisdom realizes the entirety of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, lack of self, and so on.

It does end the journey means that all movements of mind and mental events are wholly cut by its application. At the level of a tathāgata this is the case at all times and in the equipoise of the bodhisatva noble ones it means that everything other than the ālaya is stopped.

The literal meaning of the saṅgha of the great vehicle[104] indicates that this recollection concerns the saṅghas of non-reversing bodhisatvas[105]. With that as the standpoint, they have entered into good means that they are abiding in the three types of discipline[106]. They have entered into the types means that they have entered infinite samādhis[107]. They have entered into straightness means that, not abiding in the extremes of permanence and nihilism, they have entered into the expanse of phenomena’s equality. Those three taken as a progression are the higher trainings of discipline, mind, and prajñā[108]. They have entered into harmony means that they have entered into a path in which there is not the slightest discordance between any of the above—view, conduct, referenced object, and conduct done for the purpose of migrators.

They are great ones thoroughly trained in gifts.

They are a place for generosity given that they are an outstanding field of generosity, like a field whose weeds have been removed.

This Sutra of the Recollection of the Jewels now under consideration is indeed a Great Vehicle sutra. For a recollection of the Three Jewels that belongs to the Lesser Vehicle there is a rough explanation by noble one Asaṅga, but I find myself wondering whether it is extracted from within a larger commentary[112]. Then, there are so many differences seen between the wordings of these sutras that there is the question of how the two come to be so different, still, in the two later recollections, the ones that are consistent do suggest a commonality.

Now[117], within this great ocean of becoming that has no endpoint, migrators in their entirety, myself and all others included, look for a solution to their problems only within passion and aggression. If they were to examine closely their vivid colour paintings that range from the peak of becoming down to Unceasing Torment[118], which come forth from previously created causes and now appear variously as pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral, their paintings would completely fall apart. Then they would know that all the highs and lows, rises and falls, happinesses and unhappinesses, and so on of these paintings— which are like the bubblings of gruel being cooked—cannot be
ascertained as a particular extreme but are merely momentary dances flickering in and out like lightning.[119]

Worse though, the minds of these beings exist within stupidity alone. This lack of knowledge means that these beings do not even begin to gravitate towards the merit of virtuous karma but, as a matter of habit, stay firmly within the state of non-virtue, just like swans inhabit lake areas and vultures inhabit charnel grounds. Because of that, their minds find it difficult to get happiness and, bearing an intense burden of unsatisfactoriness and being separated from the path of the noble ones, they wander in becoming without an end ever coming into sight.

Careful consideration of this situation leads an intelligent person to think, “Who or what could be relied on to give definite refuge from the failures of becoming for myself and all the other migrators who are equivalent to space and have been my mothers, and all of whom have been living long and deep in this kind of unsatisfactoriness?” That would lead to the thought, “Who in this world has knowledge of the methods that can put an end to unsatisfactoriness, has love that makes him willing to be a refuge for all migrators, and has activity for others that is capable of providing refuge for them? Who would that be?” Then, if that issue were examined using the Reasoning of the Force of the Thing[120], an intelligent person would come to this understanding: “Rather than merely accepting beings such as Brahmā, Indra, Kapila, and so on as a refuge because they are generally regarded as being capable of such, and rather than simply accepting the buddha bhagavat[121] as a refuge because he is someone convenient to cling to, I should accept someone who has the capacity to give definite refuge”[122]. Following that, the person could, through the application of the three analyses, understand that even though someone like the teacher, the king of the Śhākyas, is not with us now, the path that he taught is a true one[123]. When he has understood that,
a type of trust now arrives with the thought, “The teacher does have knowledge given that he himself manifested that knowledge using the very method of that true path. He does have the love to teach it to others. He does have the capability that is required for giving them assistance given that he has the capability to give definite refuge from the failings of becoming using that sort of method. The buddha bhagavat alone is someone who does have the three”.

Furthermore, if the person thinks it through using the perfectly correct prajñā[124] that accompanies the authoritative statements that came from that very refuge, the person will then understand the following. These sufferings of becoming mentioned earlier are not causeless for, if they were, they would be the excesses of permanent existence and non-existence. They also are not acausal as with Śhiva’s everlasting quality, and so on because those qualities are not stated by their advocates to be the forward and reverse modes of cause and effect. All of these sufferings are mere
appearances that originate from the interdependency of causes and conditions.[125]

If they did not originate in that way, then they would be similar to the son of a barren woman, and also, if the validator of no-change were to be applied to the course of their appearance, it would follow that they would have to remain even during the path that puts an end to such sufferings[126]. In addition to that, if they did
not originate in that way, it would also lead to the proclamation of perverted paths like harmful activity being proclaimed as the true way, and the proclamation of non-paths such as relying on five fires in order to exhaust karma as paths, none of which can be paths that oppose the causes of becoming[127].

As it says in a sutra,
Those humans who are scared with fear
Mostly take refuge in mountains, forests,
Parks, and in large trees used as a place of offerings;
Such refuges are not the principal one and Such refuges are not supreme.
Someone who relies on such a refuge Will not be liberated from all suffering.
Instead, when someone has gone to the buddha,
The dharma, and the saṅgha for refuge, he will, through Suffering, the source of suffering,
True transcendence of suffering, and The pleasant noble eightfold path, Go to nirvana. With that,
The four truths of the noble ones
Together with prajñā used to produce the view Is his principal refuge;
By relying on that refuge he will indeed Be liberated from all suffering.[129]

As it says there, it is faith that comes from trust based in the certainty that the Buddha bhagavat alone is the sole refuge of those wanting emancipation, that his teaching is the sole portal to it, and that his saṅgha is the unparalleled place of generosity and assistant for the path which establishes the cause for travelling the path. Up to here, the way to establish that cause has been shown. Once the cause has been established, it becomes necessary to bring to mind,
that is, to recollect, the good qualities of those places of refuge. This whole process is what the Praises in Alternating Verse and Prose is talking about when it says,
Deep and endless samsara
Is to dwell wholly inside an ocean
Where the desires, and so on are an unstoppable Sea monster who eats the body,
So, today, where will one take refuge?
If there is something which definitely has All faults always absent and
Which at all times has
All good qualities present and It has a mind, then
I take refuge in it and, Praising it, I esteem it, and
The families who dwell within its teaching …[130]

There is the term Jewels. The term “ratna” in this context leads to the term “rin po che ‹› jewel”. This term has six connotations —“dkon pa ‹› rare” and the rest—which are the features of “rin po che ‹› jewels (and similar precious things)” so that is the language used here. The literal translation of ratna—“rin chen ‹› something of value”—did not show this so the translation was done according to meaning. The result was the word “dkon mchog, Jewel” in which the two terms “dkon pa ‹› rare” and “mchog ‹› supreme” are actually present and the four terms which go with them are understood to have their meaning implied.[135]

Truly complete (saṃyaksaṃ) buddha. The term “buddha” principally means “rtogs ‹› realization” though it has additionally been given the two connotations “sangs ‹› cleared out” and “rgyas ‹› blossomed”. The meaning contained in the latter pair of words was used to derive the Tibetan word for buddha, “sangs rgyas ‹› cleared out and blossomed”, a word that shows the style of the realization. It shows that a buddha has “sangs ‹› cleared out” the sleep of ignorance and that his mind, having fully “rgyas ‹› blossomed”, includes all knowables. It presents an image of a buddha, as a lotus that has freed itself from the muck of the swamp and fully blossomed.[142]

Thus, the meaning of “buddha” was taken into the Tibetan language by arriving at the two words “sangs ‹› cleared out” and “rgyas ‹› blossomed”, then combining them into the final term “sangs rgyas ‹› cleared out and blossomed” as just shown. Then, the remaining part before “buddha” which starts with the upasargaḥ “saṃ” was translated into Tibetan with “yang dag par rdzogs pa ‹› truly complete”[143].

The term buddha alone can refer either to a self-conqueror or a tenth-level being[144], therefore to distinguish between them, the Sanskrit term “saṃ” meaning “rdzogs pa ‹› complete” was added to “buddha”. The combined term could still refer either to a bad māra appearing as a manifestation of buddha[145] or to someone who has actually finalized the wisdom of the tenth level, therefore the Sanskrit term “saṃyak”, which is “yang dag par ‹› truly”, was also added in order to provide the needed distinction.

To sum this up, the buddha that we are talking about here has obtained the realization, that is, the wisdom, of a buddha, to an unsurpassable degree—to the point where the wisdom has no impurity and is without any incompleteness.

Thus, a tathāgata is someone who has merged totally with the mind that knows the suchness of all dharmas. He is called an arhat from the perspective that he has abandoned without exception what is to be abandoned and is called a truly complete buddha from the perspective that he has realized without exception what is to be realized. Note that these two epithets are differing perspectives on the one thing; after all, one thing can be described in various ways![146]
This sort of buddha is now given epithets that show his different features in relation to causes and effects. First is cause.

Possessor of insight and its feet. Buddhahood involves infinite types of causal paths yet they are truly summed up within the three principal trainings[147]. At the noble ones’ levels, these three correspond to the sub-divisions of the eightfold path of the noble ones and, of those, right view is referred to with insight and the remaining seven are called its feet. In this context, insight is equivalent in meaning to sight. It is for example, like a person going along a road seeing the place with his eyes and making the journey with his feet on the place seen by his eyes. Thus, at the time of training in this insight and its feet, the two will, in general, be related to vipaśhyanā and śhamatha respectively, and, at the time of no more training[148], insight will be related to the three insights of recollection of former places, and so on and feet to the four feet of miracles, the four complete perfections, and so on. There are many other ways in which the two can be joined to other items but there is the one key point that there must always be a pairing of sight of the meaning and engagement in that meaning. If that is done, the understanding intended will be properly specified and appropriately comprehended. Note that in general it is not all right not to follow this approach with explanations of texts and that is especially the case when explaining sutras.

At the time of the path, right view, which is like an eye, and insight, which is like its sight, belong to the training of prajñā, and the remainder—right livelihood, and so on—belong to the two other trainings. When the path has been finalized, insight has to be defined as the three insights of no more training, given that all not-knowing of former and later limits[149] has been dispelled, though the insight does not change from being prajñā.

Someone who has followed that pleasant path and obtained the pleasant or blissful fruition of unsurpassable rank is called a sugata[150]. You might ask, “Why is it a pleasant path?” It has been said,
This vehicle, a great mansion immeasurable as space,
Is a supreme vehicle that makes for an attainment of manifest joy, happiness, and pleasantness.
Through riding on it, all sentient beings cross over to nirvana.

<d e="2">
Further, a person who has gone to that pleasant fruition is defined as having gone in three ways. Through relying on strengths that cannot be challenged which accomplish the two purposes[151], and on limitless dances of prajñā-emptiness and of upāya-compassion with its prayers of aspiration, dhyānas, extra perceptions, and so on, he has “legs par gshegs pa ‹› gone well to goodness”, “slar mi ldogs par gshegs pa ‹› gone irreversibly to irreversibility”, and “ma lus par gshegs pa ‹› gone not missing anything to nothing missed”, all of which add up to his having gone to a supreme fruition.

</d>
<d e="2">
Of the three ways of going just mentioned, the first means that he has gone to a situation that is without the slightest stain either of suffering or its source, both of which belong to the side of total affliction, samsara, so has gone to goodness or “mdzes par gshegs pa ‹› has gone beautifully to beauty” and is like a person with a beautiful form. In this way, he has distinguished himself from those in samsara because of having gone beyond the cause-andeffect-based suffering of those who live in becoming.

<d e="2">
His having gone irreversibly means that, because he has removed the seed of views of a self, he will not relapse into samsara. This is like firewood which has been consumed cannot give rise to a flame again. It is comparable to a person who has fully recovered from a contagious disease like pox, given that someone who has been sick with pox disease and properly recovered from it cannot fall sick with that disease again in that life.

<d e="2">
Those two ways of having gone set this path apart from the paths of outsiders[152] because their paths do not include abandonment of the seed of views of a self. Their paths lead up as far as the summit of existence but are not capable of crossing over the boundary of becoming.

His having gone not missing anything to nothing missed or it is also said “rdzogs par gshegs pa ‹› gone completely to completion”, means that he has obtained the dharmas belonging to the qualities of finalized abandonment and realization without even the smallest part of them not having being obtained, like a vase that has been filled totally with liquid. This way of going distinguishes him from the śhrāvakas and pratyekas who, although they have irreversibility, have an abandonment and realization which is not complete.

This mode of going to buddhahood begins with the fact that mind’s nature is luminosity but has adventitious stains on it. That leads to a path to be travelled that has a specific antidote for removing the stains—prajñā that realizes lack of self—and which also has methods to assist that prajñā. There is a force that comes from familiarization using the methods and, if the familiarization is taken through to the finish, the methods have the ability to produce a complete abandonment and realization. For this type of path, trust developed through logical establishment using Reasoning of the Force of the Thing is important, more about which can be known from the Indian texts of Dharmakīrti, and so on[153].

Knower of the world. The term “world” has many connotations— such as container, contents, suffering, and so on. Here it refers to all of the pervasive[154] sentient beings being looked upon and seen without obscuration by wisdom. “Knower of the world” refers to great compassion whose nature is prajñā; the prajñā sees sentient beings in the way just described and the great compassion acts as a sovereign for them, displaying itself in illusory ways in exact accordance with the fortunes[155] of those to be tamed. This compassion with a nature of prajñā looks at all worlds at all times, day and night, seeing, as has been said, “Whoever is in failure, whoever is in misery, whoever is to be tamed”, and, knowing all as it does, gives thought to those to be tamed without pausing for even a moment; all of this together is the cause of the perfection of others’ sakes.

Based in that sort of great compassion, he is an unsurpassed driver who tames beings. Given that beings are those to be tamed and that he is the one who has the capability needed to put them onto the path, he is the one “who tames beings”. The world speaks of anyone who has the job of steering chariots, horses, and so on as a “driver”[156]. In accordance with that, because he is the one who steers beings away from the dreadful abyss of becoming towards the place of emancipation, he is called the driver who tames beings. The way that he tames beings is not like the approach of a king who imposes sanctions on his subjects; he does not create suffering for beings but leads them to emancipation along the path of abandonment of the two extremes, a path which is a source of unending pleasantness[157] for as long as it is followed. There is no question either that he can tame even those who are extremely difficult to tame—such as the Buddha’s younger brother Nanda who had attachment, Aṅgulimāla who had fierce anger, Kāśhyapa who was overflowing with pride, and Lamchungwa who had very dull faculties—because he has infinite types of method. Given that throughout the whole of time and space there is not even one being to be tamed whom he carelessly disregards, his enlightened activity for all those to be tamed indeed extends throughout the reaches of space, therefore, he is said to be unsurpassed at this activity of taming.[158]

That covered how he tames beings in general. The next epithet, that he is the teacher of gods and men, concerns a specific point of that general activity. In general, the Capable One[159] teaches migrators as a whole, but there is the particular of who actually heard dharma from him then relied on the noble path, and who did not. Accordingly, although he acted to liberate the mindstreams of all migrators by teaching the noble ones’ four truths, he is called the teacher of gods and men because it was primarily those two groups of beings who were tamed through hearing him in person and actually following the path.

Thus it was that he did the deed of completing abandonment and realization for himself and then, out of love, became the teacher of dharma for others.

Is the buddha bhagavat draws a conclusion to those epithets. It shows that the Buddha who has finalized the two purposes in that way is called “the bhagavat”, thereby showing that “buddha” and “bhagavat” equally are terms which indicate the two good qualities of abandonment and realization. “Buddha” has already been explained earlier. In regard then to bhagavat, the root “bhaga” literally means “bcom ‹› defeat” and is further understood to mean “skal ba ‹› fortunate” and “legs pa ‹› goodness”. Thus, bhagavat, which literally translates as “bcom ldan ‹› defeat possessing”, means a person who has the good qualities that come from having defeated the four māras or, alternatively, a person who possesses the six qualities of “goodness” which are ascribed to Īṣhvara and others. However, the mere literal meaning was not made into the main consideration at the time of translation and a word was produced based on the uncommon meaning contained in the term.

The word “ ’das ‹› transcended” was simply added on to give “bcom ldan ’das ‹› defeat possessing transcended” causing it to be set above meaning the great god of the outsiders and others. That is how the terms bhagavat and buddha come to incorporate the meaning of higher abandonment and realization.

Some commentaries make the connection here between the bhagavat mentioned earlier as a feature of the Buddha and this mention of bhagavat which shows the person having the feature, though nothing special is achieved in doing so. The words “thus the bhagavat” at the beginning served to make the basis of the features known, so the way I have done it here works well.[160]

That tathāgata means the tathāgata of the sort just explained. The cause which is his source is that, out of great compassion for others and nothing else, he has finalized an immeasurable accumulation of merit. Thus it says that he corresponds to a cause of merits[161]. This is similar to what has been said in a sutra:
The tathāgata is the image of dharmas of un-outflowed virtues.

</d>
<d e="2">
The merit of which the tathāgata is a direct result was not spent on and exhausted in producing a result—as happens with the virtue of an ordinary beings, nor was it spent on and exhausted in arriving at being without remainder of aggregates—as happens with the roots of virtue of śhrāvakas and pratyekas. Thus that merit was not, and for as long as there is space never will be, let go to waste.[162]

Furthermore, at the fictional level he stays within the skill-inmeans that comes from the universal dedications made for others’ sakes and at the superfactual level he views via non-referencing the expanse of phenomena with equal taste. Therefore, at the authentic level, he arises from the blessings of having obtained the wisdom vajra kāya whose mode is unification of the two truths and then the form kāyas and the like of that wisdom kāya correspond to a cause of merit. That merit, moreover, given that it is never spent merely in a ripening that has a result just one time, never goes to waste.[163]

And furthermore, every one of his roots of virtue used in producing this vajra kāya is such that each one does not go to waste. As the Avataṃsaka Sūtra says,
Even hearing, seeing, or offering to those conquerors
Will develop an immeasurable pile of merit.
When the afflicted states, all the sufferings of samsara, are abandoned,
It is not thrown out and does not end with this compounded phenomenon[164].

As with the example of water drops joining a pool of water—an example which he taught repeatedly and in many ways in the sutras—the tathāgata aimed just one time at obtaining the vajralike body of the equality of the four times but, like being caught in the mouth of an alligator and unable to get free, doing that was like a drop of water put into an ocean[165].

He is fully ornamented with all patience. When his form kāya, the primary cause of which is patience, is seen, there is nothing unharmonious about it. That has been expressed in these words,

It will be beautiful, golden in colour, and a sight to be seen for migrators.

The form kāya arises from the pāramitā of patience having been completed in every way, therefore, with respect to its cause, it is “ornamented with patience”. Or, given that this kāya which is unyielding like a vajra and has strengths complete in every way is not dependent on conditions, it is “ornamented with patience”. In relation to this, even if countless third order worlds[166] batted him about, tossing him across immeasurable worlds, he would not react with harm to the migrators involved, and so on[167]. Also, even though he might sit for immeasurable kalpas while not receiving a single alm, his body would not be affected whatsoever by weariness, tiredness, and so on.

Moreover, the Hurling A Boulder Sutra says,
The merit of the sentient beings of this world totalled would not compare with even a one hundred thousandth portion of the merit of a wheel-wielding[168] owner of a single continent. Similarly, the merit of two continents would not stand up to even a fraction of the merit of a wheel-wielding owner of two continents, and so on[169].
The merit of one hundred thousand times ten million wheel-wielding owners of four continents would not stand up to a one hundred thousandth portion of the merit of the gods of the four strata of the Great Kings. One hundred thousand times ten million of the gods of the Four Great Kings compared to the Four Great Kings, and one hundred thousand times ten million of the merits of the four kings compared to the gods of the Thirty Three, and one hundred thousand times ten million of the merits of the gods of the Thirty Three compared to Indra, and then Free From Strife and Son of the Gods[170] Best of Free from Strife, Joyous and Son of the Gods Completely Joyous, Enjoying Manifestations and Son of the Gods Best of Enjoying Manifestations, Controlling Others’ Manifestations and Son of the Gods of Controlling, the Brahmā strata, Brahmā and so on, up to Akaniṣhṭha, all one hundred thousand times ten million compared to the top one of their type. And then, the merit of as many bodhisatvas in their last birth in existence as there are sands in the Ganges compared to a one hundred thousandth portion of the merit pile of a tathāgata, and that[171] in turn would not even go into examples, count, and causes[172].[173]

And it also says,
Again, the merit pile of all sentient beings multiplied by ten would produce one hair pore of the tathāgata. The pile of merit required to produce all the hair pores multiplied by one hundred would produce one minor sign and the merit required to produce all of the minor signs multiplied by one hundred would produce one of each of the major marks, except for the three of ūrṇā, crown protuberance, and dharma conch[174]. The merit required to produce all twenty-nine major marks multiplied by ten thousand would produce the ūrṇā. The merit required to produce the ūrṇā multiplied by one hundred thousand gives the crown protuberance. The merit required to produce the crown protuberance multiplied by one hundred thousand times ten million would produce the speech, the dharma conch.

Furthermore, while he was on the path, he perfected each of the levels of generosity, and the rest. Moreover, as much as he accomplished on any given level using the force of intelligence, miracles, and ripening, he accomplished in each and every moment of the next higher level. The ways in which he practised to develop this kāya and how it is a perfect accumulation of the profound and vast
—the domains of the two truths—is shown in the sutras and in the
Prayer of Aspiration for Excellent Conduct[175].

His kāya is based in immeasurable merits as just mentioned but more than that, it also forms a basis from which immeasurable merit will be developed. This can be known from his own statement, “From me, babies, youngsters, and golden-coloured ones of realization”, and others like it. Also, it is like what was said in a sutra,
He has the major marks of hundreds of merits,
Thus a trove of merit[176] acts in this world inclusive of the gods[177],
So that the seeing of it, hearing of it, or even its smiling Is something done to benefit all sentient beings.

Although the form kāya is his own fruition, the eighty minor signs of copper-coloured nails, and so on make it stand out to others, so the Sutra says The excellent minor signs adorn him. In addition, he is beautified by the thirty-two major marks, such as the design of a thousand-spoked wheel clearly marking the palms of his hands and soles of his feet, so the Sutra says the flowers of the major marks bloom on him. The flowers of the major marks are like delightful, fully bloomed flowers on him and that feature itself is enhanced by the fresh anthers of the minor signs, and that altogether rouses overt joy in all migrators.

The kāya of perfected qualities having cause and effect like that acts out the four kinds of conduct[178] but, beginning with even the subtlest movement of a hair in a hair pore, the whole of it never alters in the least from being for the sake of sentient beings, so what anyone sees of it is always in harmony with that person’s elements, faculties, and thoughts. Thus it says, perceiving his activity, it being just right, there is harmony. What is being communicated here is that there is harmony between the Buddha’s “activity as the object of some being’s perception” and the mindstream of that being “for which it is just right”[179].

<d e="2">
That was from the perspective of qualities that arrive in the mind of the person who is perceiving Buddha. Because of that quality, there is the additional quality that, when a person looks at the tathāgata’s kāya, it is not possible that even the slightest appearance of disharmony could arise in the person’s mind. Thus, from the perspective that faults have been abandoned, it says, seeing him there is no disharmony.[180]

The first consists of those persons who go to see a sight or who are compelled to go there by virtuous roots or who go to him out of trust to make offerings, and so on. When they see the tathāgata, their mental impurities are pacified and a lucid faith is born in them. That faith creates the cause for them to look on him with longing and they become so absorbed that they would not notice even if a monk were to strike them. Then a great joy, one free from impurity, develops in them. Therefore, he brings overt joy to those who long through faith[181].

Some might come with the thought of opposing the tathāgata but, once they have arrived in front of him, they will not be able to withstand his brilliance and will pale in comparison, like constellations pale in the light of the sun. With their haughtiness removed, he can bring them into contact with the pleasantness of peace[182].

Moreover, there is no impediment at all to the knowing quality of the tathāgata’s mind, so his prajñā can never be overpowered by anyone. For example, there was Devadatta with his many piles of charcoal powder each made from a different tree. And there was the important person from the Śhākyas with his piles of rice taken from each of the lay households where someone had died. The name indicating where each pile had come from had been written down and put inside each pile and the piles loaded onto elephants which were then led before the Buddha. The piles were pointed out one by one and the Buddha was asked to show his abilities by giving a prophecy, and so on for each. It was impossible for them to create grounds for a complaint against the Buddha because there was never a case where he did not know and did not see what was what[183]. Thus, his prajñā cannot be overpowered.

This is similar to what is found in the Hurling A Boulder Sutra,
There is an ocean eighty thousand yojanas deep and of unfathomable width. It fills completely with liquid of black ink[184]. The king of mountains, Meru, subsides eighty thousand yojanas into the water and rises back up eighty thousand yojanas. The four faces are the four precious substances. There are four continents in the four directions and these turn into paper of birch bark. All the abodes whichever there are of sentient beings on the four continents turn into letters. All plants and grasses whichever there are above the earth turn into bamboo pens. Now, if they were to write, the ink, paper, and pens would completely run out. Unlike that, bhikṣhu Śhāripūtra’s prajñā would not be spent in the slightest[185]. A great third order world filled with those having prajñā like Śhāripūtra would not amount to even a hundred thousandth portion of the tathāgata’s prajñā, and that in turn cannot be shown through example, count, or cause …

Just like the tathāgata’s enlightened mind has prajñā without limit, the tathāgata’s body strengths, and so on are higher than and unsurpassed by any other strength. Thus, given that nothing in the whole of time and space is able to challenge them, his strengths cannot be challenged.

Strength here is explained in some commentaries as the ten mind strengths and in others as the strengths of body only, but the ten strengths, except for being distinguished as ten on the basis of object are, in fact, prajñā strengths.

The strengths of the body of the tathāgata are measureless. Nevertheless, I will explain them just enough to give an idea of them. From the Hurling a Boulder Sutra,
Previously, when the bhagavat was staying in the forest of leeches, the strong men of that country went to offer him alms. Sitting on the road that runs between Kuśha City and the river Vasumat was a great rock fifteen fathoms high and seven and a half fathoms across. The strong men thought amongst themselves, “If this rock were to be moved aside, the road would be cleared, we could make offerings to the Buddha, and we would also become famous”. Therefore, they gathered together the strong men of Kuśha City who had very great strength, then brought up many hundreds of horses, oxen, camels, herd-leading elephants, and bulky elephants which they tied to the rock with rope. One person with a ramp tied it on with mixed grass and other types ropes, and hauled. One person used one hundred iron ploughs to try to extract it from its lodging. One person attempted to cut it with a battle-axe. One wanted to accomplish the task by pulverising it to dust with vajra strikers. And one person tried to destroy it with substances and mantra.
However, none of them could so much as budge it, so they gave up on it for the time being[186].

The bhagavat arrived there and, after receiving a joyful welcome, arranged himself to one side. The bhagavat said to them, “How did young men like you become tired by this?” They told him their story in detail, “We started twenty-nine days ago but could not even budge this big rock. Thus, with the thought, “How could we even think to move it to another place?”, we gave up on it for the time being”. The bhagavat offered, “Would you like to have that boulder moved off to another place?” They replied, “We request to the utmost that the bhagavat do so!” The bhagavat used the toe of his right foot to push it firmly and the whole thing was extracted from its lodging. He raised his left arm, then put his right palm on the boulder and, after thinking for just a moment, hurled it upwards as far as Brahmā’s world so that it disappeared from sight. The sound made the strong men panic, so the bhagavat said, “Do not be afraid!” And, as it was going up, the sound of,

The rock returned and the tathāgata rested the palms of his hands on it. Then the tathāgata blew on it, turning it completely to dust, and a rain of dust came down in all directions.

The strong men were amazed and asked, “Where did that kind of strength come from?

Making it into dust by blowing on it and then re-assembling it and putting it in a different place was the strength of meditation”.

He said, “The strength of ten men is the strength of one ordinary oxen, and ten of those that of a blue oxen.
Then, successively for each of herd-leader, rhinoceros, ordinary elephant, unyielding elephant, loud-trumpeting elephant, tusker elephant, blue mountain elephant, and similarly, yellow mountain, red, white, having supreme scent, having a gentle scent, having the scent of an Utpala[187], having the scent of a Kumud[188], those ones, and an elephant of lotus, and an elephant of great lotus, and one born in the snows, and Bal elephants[189] of greater and greater strength going ten times higher at a time is as follows. The combined strength of ten bulky elephants is one half strength. Ten of the strengths that are one strength come from adding two of those together is half of an overwhelming strength. Two of those make one overwhelming strength. The strength of ten overwhelming ones are one strength of supreme strength. Ten supreme strengths make a branch supreme strength. Ten branch supreme strengths make half a Nārāyaṇā[190] strength. Two of those make one Nārāyaṇā strength. Three hundred and twenty Nārāyaṇā strengths are the strength that came from the tathāgata’s father and mother. Each one of the places of the tathāgata’s kāya is created holding a Nārāyaṇā strength”.

Furthermore, he has immeasurable strength of miracles. A sutra says,
The bhagavat was dwelling at a place that had the grass Birana, at the base of a tree where there was a smooth hole like a yakṣha mud-hole. It was a time of famine and a beggarwoman was finding it difficult to obtain alms.

The great Maudgalyāyana asked the Buddha, “Under the great earth there is a splendid corpse, so if a being of strength changed this great earth to leaves of a Plantain tree, it would change the situation to one without difficulty. If as many sentient beings as there are on this earth were to join left hands then right hands and make a ring continuously around the great earth, they could change it in an instant”.

The tathāgata replied, “Even if it were changed like that, most sentient beings would become desirous and stupid over the food-providing corpse. Also, the corpse might be a splendid one but it will not stay for long and will disappear”, and he did not grant the request. He said, “Maudgalyāyana, even though a person with that kind of miraculous power were to clean this great order third order thousand-fold world system, doing so would not amount even to a one hundredth part of the tathāgata’s miracle strength, on up to would not amount to a cause[193]”.

Then, for the strength of meditation, it also says in a sutra,
A rain of the season of great clouds descended on the four continents and from it, the streams of the great rivers of the four continents ran down to the oceans. The tathāgata said of that, “From each of the drops of water, this whole situation—this continent’s towns and its meadows, and so on, and its trees with their branches, leaves, seeds, and so on—fill in their names—is so”.

In other words, he was saying that the tathāgata has the capacity to see all of the atoms that are distributed in a single drop of water. That gives an idea of it and then it can be fully understood from the sutras. For example, it is said in one of them,
The lesser number of gods and men of this kind of great order third order thousand-fold world system compared to the greater number of sentient beings seen to be present in one spot just the area of a chariot wheel by an outsider ṛiṣhi[194] possessing the five extra-perceptions and free from attachment, and the lesser number of sentient beings seen as a whole in the great thousandfold system by that one free from attachment compared to the greater number of sentient beings seen to be present in one spot just the area of a chariot wheel by the god’s eye of a śhrāvaka arhat, and the lesser number of sentient beings seen as a whole in the great thousandfold system by that śhrāvaka arhat compared to the greater number of sentient beings seen in the region just the area of a chariot wheel by the god’s eye of a pratyekabuddha, and all sentient beings seen in the great thousand by the pratyekabuddha compared to the many

Using that approach, how many sentient beings are seen in the third order thousand by a bodhisatva compared to the greater and countless number of sentient beings seen abiding in the region just the area of a chariot wheel by the god’s eye of a tathāgata?
Using that approach, the minds, mental events, and physical elements of the sentient beings as a whole dwelling in the universes of the ten directions is not easy even for the bodhisatvas who abide in levels of complete emancipation that are beyond concept[195] to count or comprehend during kalpas numbering the amount of sands in the Ganges but, spontaneously, the tathāgata knows in an instant and without mixup each and every one of all the minds and mental events of all of such sentient beings of the three times.

Moreover, in regard to this, the tathāgata comes from a cause of compassion. Being the nature of great compassion, the strength of his loving kindness, which follows the count and elements of sentient beings, is immeasurable. Even when he was training in this on the path, all of the completing, aspiring, and preparing[196] done then was done only because of great compassion for the sake of others. When those were finalized, the tathāgata had manifested inseparable emptiness and compassion, the wisdom of no
more learning—so how could the capacity of the particular strength which is his great loving kindness ever be fathomed? It could not because it spreads throughout the limits, whatever they are, of space and the limits, whatever they are, of time.

This sort of talk is also found in a sutra where it says,

And, moreover, that loving kindness does not become obscured with attachment. And it always arises spontaneously, covers the whole area, pervades every one of the world systems, and operates according to the thoughts of each of the sentient beings.

And,
He sends his loving kindness to pervade
All times and all fields and all worlds.
He sends his loving kindness to pervade
The thoughts too of all migrators.
Possessing knowledge and loving kindness,
The peerless muni’s love
Does not not pervade some directions and
Does indeed pervade the elements and thoughts[197]. Thus it is that the all-knowing one does nothing faulty; For example, for a gem to be cleansed with water so that It is very pure, completely pure water is needed,
Just so, the ṛiṣhi’s pure mind acts
To cleanse the impurity of beings to purity.

Furthermore, the atoms belonging just to the area of such a tathāgata’s body pores can show individually and without mixup or obscuration every single one of the whole of the dharmas of both peace and becoming contained within the ten directions and three times. And, he can put every single one of the containers and contents[198] that reach to the end of space into the area of a single atom without the atom having to change to something more gross nor the world having to change to something more subtle. And, he has the ability to display in that atom in one moment the knowables of the three times, the entire play of all the doings in the count of universes as many as there are. Again, these descriptions used here to give an idea of the subject are fully taught in the sutras.

A few men ride an iron chariot with supreme steeds whose strength exceeds the wind’s across a pond eight thousand yojanas in size filled with water and covered in lotuses. They run so fast that the horses’ hooves and the chariot’s wheel rims do not come in contact with it and the lotus leaves are not pierced by the hooves. A poisonous snake comes up from inside the pond. The chariot does not tip over; on this occasion the chariot circles it eight times. During the period of the first circling, Ānanda teaches the dharma teaching[199] eight times and makes the meaning understood. During the time taken for Ānanda to speak just one word, Maudgalyāyana teaches the dharma teaching eight times and makes the meaning understood. During the time taken for Maudgalyāyana to speak one word, Śhāripūtra teaches dharma eight times and makes the meaning understood. During the time taken for Śhāripūtra to speak one word, a pratyekabuddha teaches the dharma teaching an uncountable number of times. During the time taken for the pratyekabuddha to speak one word, a bodhisatva inconceivably, inexpressibly, teaches the dharma countless times. During the time taken for the bodhisatva to speak one word, Maudgalyāyana goes off to do miracles through eighty thousand world systems. During the time taken for Maudgalyāyana to go off on each of those miracles, the tathāgata has the capacity to show in all fields[200] without limit the total completion of all of his activities starting with his arousing of mind and going up to his nirvana[201].

Furthermore, Maudgalyāyana does miracles like that in each one of the fields individually of the ten directions and does so for seven days and nights without taking a rest, then makes an enclosing ring around those worlds as many he has journeyed to, then creates a common base, then heaps it up with mustard seeds to overflowing. In world systems more even than the seeds contained within that, the tathāgata’s eye sees all of the individual showings of performing the conduct up through the twelve deeds[202] of those sentient beings who have engaged in enlightenment—and that only in regard to the ones whose name and family are concordant. He also sees the ones more even than that, the buddhas and bodhisatvas whose name and family are not concordant, but why mention that when, in the world systems of that sort, the fields in which buddhas arise and bodhisatvas perform the conduct are lesser in number, similar to the sands of an ocean or the sands in the river Ganges and the rarity of gold grains within them.[203]

Then, in those immeasurable fields which he sees pervasively and without mixup in that manner, his mind shines forth as all the appearances of body and speech done for taming in the displays of miracles for those to be tamed. And, at the same time, in the manner of a wish-fulfilling jewel, he engages perpetually and everywhere in the deeds of benefit and bliss but does so without discursive thought, spontaneously, as follows. All knowables of space and time are present with a nature empty of truth and he has manifested that as it is. The tathāgata who has manifested the dharmadhātu purified of the adventitious stains in which space and the palm of the hand, and an instant and an aeon have been equalized is the wisdom that does not falter from the non-duality of becoming and peace, the vajra kāya, beyond phenomena of atoms and instants, the inexpressible superfactual. He is this inexpressible superfact yet, when evaluated with valid cognizers of the conventional[204], he is all faults exhausted and all good qualities complete; he is knowledge, love, and capacity without endpoint; he exists via a nature of being permanent, steady, peace, svastika[205]. He never wavers from that, yet all the while the inexhaustible appearances of his three secrets[206] permeate as many knowables as there are. Thus, no matter how much rational mind tries to distinguish them, like trying to measure space in fathoms, no end is found, so they have to be understood to be immeasurable. Moreover, the buddhas’ illusions might be immeasurable like this, but the different dharmas are present in one buddha’s nature, and one buddha himself is the inconceivable wisdom kāya that has each one of the individual appearances that are the displays done for taming that pervade all of space and time and which are divorced from the extremes of truth[207]. Because of all that, every single one of all the dharmas included in the buddha level, apparent yet empty, is never anything but the nature of equality wisdom. Thus, the qualities of even one hair pore and one light ray of the body pervade the space
element[208] and, based in that, the conquerors continue to speak all the way to the ultimate possible future limit but all for the purpose of generating a deep certainty about this unending state. To illustrate this, there are the examples of bodhisatva Shugchang examining the extent of the tathāgata’s body and Maudgyalyāyana examining the limit of Buddha’s speech, and others. It can be known through such examples.

The bodhisatvas, the ones who have a force of determination that does not turn back from seeking unsurpassable enlightenment, the ones who hold the family line of the conquerors, the ones who have mastery over the treasury of the holy dharma and protect beings to be tamed who have been left out, are the ones suitable to be led through to the coronation method of inconceivable wisdom[209]. Accordingly, they can be thought of as “the sons of the ones who govern the retinue” and because of that are given the name “sons of the conquerors”. For these beings the tathāgata first activates their family seed, then during the course of their development causes their abandonment and realization to grow, and finally, on the tenth level, bestows on them the empowerment which enacts their coronation as dharma kings[210]. Thus it is that the tathāgata from his side acts as their “father” and therefore he is called such.

For the noble persons who were the arhats, and so on, the bhagavat was like a king. He stayed together with those like the elder Śhāripūtra and great Maudgalyāyana, staying within his own command, the command of the bhagavat, king of dharma, no more and no less, not discarding the slightest training even at the cost of life specifically so that they could attain the fruition of their own path. Thus, he is a king to the noble persons.[211]

Further, the actual body with its ways of engagement in appropriate enlightened activity does the job of giving migrators a support; he gives them the support of the path, of setting them on to it, of causing making them follow it, and of making them finalize it. In that way, the tathāgata does the job altogether of making them go joyfully to the city of all three end enlightenments[212]. With that, he does the job of liberating them from samsara’s ocean of suffering, therefore he is like a captain who does the work of liberating like-minded beings. Thus he is a captain to those who journey to the city of nirvana meaning that he is, in that way, a captain who does the work that is involved in getting those beings who are going to the city of nirvana to that city[213].

From the standpoint of being the principal method for accomplishing the purposes of those to be tamed, wisdom is defined as the ten strengths, and from the standpoint of showing dharma to those to be tamed, it is defined as the four authentic insights[214]. After that, wisdom itself divided into its aspects is the five wisdoms, and then, entering the three times without impediment, it is the three wisdoms, and then summed up, it is the two wisdoms of knowledge of depth and extent, and then that summed up again is self-arising wisdom, the knowledge of all aspects incorporated in a single sphere. Taken from the perspective of the magnitude of the count of knowables included in space and time, that wisdom is immeasurable. Examples, count, syllogisms, and so on cannot ever come to a final assessment for wisdom, which means that his wisdom cannot be fathomed with rational mind. Therefore, it says his wisdom is unfathomable.

Because the tathāgata has attained that sort of inconceivable wisdom, even if a person tried to express it by starting with one word or one thing then continued on for unfathomable kalpas, the person could still not arrive at his level of knowledgeability[215]. Thus, his knowledgeability is inconceivable. A sutra says,

It is like this: if all sentient beings asked Many ascertaining questions all at once,
In one moment of mind it would be taken in,
Then a single intonation of speech would give reply to each one, and in each one’s own language.
The tathāgata proclaimed the four non-fears in the midst of his retinue with the roar of a lion[216]. Although this might seem to be an explanation of the enlightened activity of speech, the cause of speech is the enlightened activity of mind.

<d e="2">
Next is the extensive explanation, which concerns the way that he is liberated from the bases of suffering—the skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas.

The dhātus have the meaning “each one holds the seed of its own type”. Given that the tathāgata is divorced from the elaborations of birth and decay, he does not possess dhātus.[222]

</d>
<d e="2">
The outer six āyatanas are the referential condition and the inner six āyatanas are the governing condition. With the two, the consciousness goes out to the object and is ignited, hence the name āyatanas means “igniters”[223]. The tathāgata, due to having the quality that the elaborations have been utterly removed, does not have āyatanas that shift or move[224], thus they are called “restrained”. Migrators, whose āyatanas are not restrained, see visual forms with the eyes which produces attachment due to a pleasing aspect of beauty, aversion due to a displeasing aspect of non-beauty, or stupidity due to the neutral
feeling of what lies in between, and then everything follows on from that[225].
</d>

</d>
<d e="2">
In short, the skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas do occur for a buddha, but all of them belong to a buddha’s body which is, in every aspect, wisdom. Thus, a buddha’s skandhas, dhātus, and āyatanas are beyond those of ordinary beings, so he never has skandhas and the rest like those of ordinary beings.

Normally, knot is a general term for affliction. Here though, it is specifically being used to refer to the primary cause of engagement in samsara, which is craving. Craving, the thing that does the work of binding beings into three-realmed samsara, is likened to a tight knot. The Buddha has cut that knot using the prajñā sword that realizes absence of self, with the result that he is completely liberated from craving. The afflictedness of views, ignorance, and so on creates suffering, so it is called all-over torment. It has the
strength to carry beings off helplessly, like the current of a river. When the Buddha abandoned it, he gained complete liberation from all-over torment, therefore he has crossed over the river.[227]

The qualities of that wisdom are as follows. He does not abide in the extreme of a one-sided peace because he has realized the equality of becoming and peace and because he has great compassion free from meeting and parting[229]. That is called “a non-abiding nirvana”. Thus, he does not abide in nirvana. Rather than abiding in a one-sided expanse of peace like that, he abides perpetually in all world systems encompassed by space and time where he is the cause of benefit and ease. At the same time, his being does not waver in the slightest from the expanse of dharmas of equality in the three times or, one could say, the limit of the authentic, therefore he abides in the limit of the authentic itself[230].

Wisdom ascertained like that to be an equality of becoming and peace that does not abide in the extremes of becoming and peace is the actual buddha bhagavat’s wisdom body or vajra kāya. It can be divided up into two or three or four, etcetera, kāyas or bodies according to specific aspects that can be distinguished in it and it is as those that he dwells imperishable, as the cause of unending benefit and bliss in all spheres both worldly and beyond worldly. The mode of this permanent and pervasive and spontaneous tathāgata is that he abides on the level of looking upon all sentient beings. Thus he abides at a level on which he is looking at all sentient beings starting from the ordinary migrators and going all the way up to the mahāsatvas at the end of the line[231].

These things that have been explained so far are the true qualities of the greatness of the body of the buddha bhagavats[232]. Here, body or kāya has the meanings “assemblage” and so on[233]. In this case, it is used to mean buddhahood itself, so it would not be good to take it to mean simply the body alone, one the three secrets[234].

If we assess that sort of buddha of inconceivable wisdom-kāya using a fictional, conventional valid cognizer, we understand that its vajra nature of being permanent, definite, imperishable, and indestructible that spreads through all of time and space manifests in spontaneous existence which is a mine of unending benefit and ease[235]. And, if we assess it using a superfactual valid cognizer, because doing so goes beyond all elaborations of permanence, impermanence, and so on, we get to it in the authentic, where it itself is beyond elaboration. By doing all of that, we establish through the Reasoning of the Force of the Thing this inconceivable secret of the tathāgata, which is permanent, pervasive, and manifesting in spontaneous existence; if not, then it could not be what it purports to be. So, through application of logic in the form of Reasoning of the Force of Thing, we become people who decide to trust in the tathāgata’s immeasurable qualities.[236]

The way this is explained in Glorious Nāgārjuna’s Root Middle Way Treatise is that, if all these knowables have been ascertained to be without nature, then, even though they spread throughout immeasurable time and immeasurable regions, because they do not exist by way of self-entity, they could not, in the slightest, not be fitted into the confines of a single atom or moment. When you comprehend that the manifesting of all these appearances in space and time within timeless sameness[237] is the great point of inseparability amongst all the ones who have the wisdom body liberated from the four extremes[238], the buddhas, you will then obtain the specific certainty of the actual taking of refuge and, with it, an unfaltering faith in the good qualities of the never interrupted enlightened activity of the three buddha kāyas that arise as the selfappearances of the wisdom body’s blessings. In that way, you produce certainty; the Root Prajñā says,

An elaborator in the ones who are buddha
And who are beyond elaboration and unending
Elaborates, causing corruption,

Roots of virtue created in relation to such a buddha, starting with even the smallest things such as turning the mind toward such a buddha and making just one supplication, making one prostration, or offering one flower, or distractedly expressing his name one time, or seeing while irritated a drawing of his body on the face of a wall, are never lost. The reason is that the object in these cases is a buddha who, because of having perfected the wisdom of equality of the three times, is certain to be non-deceptive and unfailing. Therefore it does happen—just like beings who have been caught by potent hooking vidyāmantras or by a seven-headed snake and just like fish who have been caught on a hook do not need to add their own efforts in order to make the outcome happen because what is going to happen is being imposed outside of their control.

Thus the tathāgata of limitless benefits should always be turned to, day and night. It is extremely hard for the sound of the letters of the tathāgata’s name to come to ear causing devotion to him. The reason for that is that a buddha’s name, a source of inexhaustible, limitless merit, comes from the power of the dharmatā, interdependency, prayers of aspiration, samādhi, and inconceivable virtue, as the compounded phenomenon of a buddha’s name which becomes known and evident within becoming as a basis for the development of benefit and ease. If a jewel that produces the wishes of this life, a wish-fulfilling tree, drinking the nectar of an excellent vase, and so on are hard to actually have in front of you, what could be said of this? Jewels, and so on cannot elucidate the path of emancipation whereas the tathāgata’s name will definitely lead, at some point in time, to enlightenment.

In regard to that, the name which appears from the blessings of the tathāgata’s inconceivable secret is not only the dispenser of perfect ease but belongs to the reality of things with its inconceivable capabilities of interdependency that are always non-deceptive. For that reason, if this is carefully examined, we find that jewels, and so on are assemblages of many physical atoms and vidyāmantras of accomplishment are strings of many moments of sound of speech and, therefore, not one of them has the slightest true existence. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that they give the one who uses them great glories[242], and similarly, if, because of the nature of emptiness, you have trust in the capability of things which is their non-deceptive interdependency, then everything you do will be meaningful.

Also, it says in a sutra,
Compared to offering To sentient beings daily
For as many kalpas as sands in the Ganges,
Food and clothes of the gods,
Offering one buddhist layman one meal
Generates a countless amount of merit.
A full monk who follows with faith,
Stream-enterers who will return and not,
Up to a pratyeka arhat are then joined to this[243].
Some offer to pratyekas as many as atoms
In the ten directions, daily,
For as many kalpas as sands of the Ganges,
Food and clothes of the gods.
Compared to that, one who hears the sound buddha or
Sees a drawing of buddha’s form body or
One made from clay,
Has more merit, so what need to mention
Seeing the body, joining the palms,
Expressing even one word of praise, or
Making an offering?
For someone who apprehends the name buddha,
When there is trust, devotion, and no rejection,
The virtue of offering the ten fields filled
With precious things to the buddhas daily
For as many kalpas as the sands of the Ganges
Cannot compare.
Furthermore, for apprehending just the name
Infinite advantages also were foretold
For this life and later ones as well,
So what need to mention reading and directing the mind
To this kind of praise of the conqueror …
That gives an idea of it and it can then be known more extensively from the sutras.

Generally, the term dharma, which is produced from the root “ḍudha” meaning “holder of a fish”[244], has the ten usages of “knowable”, and the rest[245]. For each usage, a specific connotation of “holding” is understood: a dharma which is a knowable is so because it holds its own characteristic; dharma which is the ten virtues, and so on is so because it holds one back from the bad migrations; dharma which is the path is so because it holds one back from the two extremes; and so on. The wording here in the text is holy dharma which is understood like this: within dharmas that are knowables, the holy or best or outstanding ones are the two dharmas of causal path and fruition—which is cessation, nirvana and, together with the two, that which corresponds to their cause, the dharma of authoritative statement.

The holy dharma like that is good in the beginning because, at the beginning, when you hear it, trusting faith is born. It is good or fine in the middle because, in the middle, you taste the meaning through thinking about it and then, having become certain that it is a path of definite happiness, a special joy is born in you. And it is good at the end because, at the end when you meditate on it, authentic wisdom arises causing your definite reversal from existence. It is those three, as stated. Alternatively, this could be done in relation to what is being expressed there—the three principal trainings, taught as śhīla, samādhi, and prajñā. Done that way, “good in the beginning, middle, and end” is explained in relation to those three, a presentation which accords with the stages of the path, and the principal stages of practice in particular.

Its meaning is excellent. The holy dharma unmistakenly teaches the characteristics of the two truths, fictional and superfactual. Thus, it does not deal with subjects of passing benefit, either those of no meaning such as found in treatises that examine a crow’s beak[247] or those of lesser meaning such as ones that consider the count of leaves on trees or the count of micro-organisms in the body. Rather, it gets to the meaning that has the capacity to reverse stupidity in regard to the entire domain of what can be known.

Its wording is excellent. In terms of the words produced from letters, there are none of the faults of nonsensical wording, mixedup composition, and so on, nor of less-than-good expression in the composition built up from the words. Unlike what is found in the treatises of the outsiders, where various factions use incomprehensible wordings to express their dharma, the tathāgata’s mind of compassion used wording that fitted the minds of those to be tamed. Therefore, his wordings are easy to understand, easy to memorize, clear in meaning, and pleasant to hear[248].

From the perspective of the thing itself[249], the holy dharma possesses the four qualities of brahmacharya[250]. As a result it is not adulterated. This dharma which teaches subtle and uncommon impermanence, formatives’ suffering[251], lack of self, and so on is not mixed in with the dharmas of others, the Tīrthikas[252] and the rest, and does have an uncommon quality to it.

That has been said like this,

It is totally complete. It is not like methods that take a short-term approach and so only partially alleviate suffering. It is not like medicine for a specific disease that cures only that much of the problem, for example, it is not a cure for only one of the afflictions, such as desire. Instead, it is a totally complete antidote that removes the afflictions of the three realms in their entirety.

It is total purity. The nature of the expanse of knowable dharmas is complete purity, a purity of being primordially free of stains. The holy dharma is taught in order to express that purity. It is taught by wisdom that views that purity which is apart from the corruptions of elaboration[255] because it is in harmony with the expanse of dharmas.

It is total purification. The dharmadhātu or expanse of dharmas is pure of being a thing in itself. However, the mind possessing adventitious stains together with their latencies does not realize it that way. The path that leads to unmistaken cognition of the innate disposition[256] purifies the adventitious stains until they are purified. Thus, this statement about the holy dharma concerns its making actuality just as it is manifest, divorced from adventitious stains, through this process of purification[257].

The dharma taught by the Buddha was well-taught dharma. In what ways did he teach the dharma well? Firstly, it is authentic sight or, as some editions say, “it is the authentic shown”[261]. The Buddha views the actuality of phenomena unmistakenly, like an eye that is actually seeing the visual forms it is looking at. He then teaches in accordance with fact, with the result that those to be tamed who use his teaching also are able to see actuality unmistakenly. Thus, the Buddha’s dharma is authentic sight, which has to be understood in the final analysis to mean “is without confusion”.

It is free from sickness. Sickness is a word for affliction. This unoutflowed dharma that removes afflictions together with their latencies is, in itself, free from outflow or sickness, the afflictions. It is like the sun’s disk which, in itself, never goes dark. On the other hand, there are all kinds of treatises on worldly arts and crafts, and so on, but these are not the opposites of outflows or afflictions and so end up being equivalent to them. This dharma is superior to all of that[263].

Its time has no interruption. You might think, “Granted that this is free from fault and has good qualities, but if it were taken as a point of mental reliance, would there be a time at which its qualities did not provide refuge?” The answer is no, there is not. Good things that are beneficial in being able to provide some protection, such as jewels, excellent vases, and so on are not beneficial continuously. However, when what has to be abandoned has been abandoned through the use of this holy dharma, there is no return to that again; because of that, the type of realization that is attained to by means of the noble path does not degenerate. Thus, this holy dharma is said to be “uninterrupted in its time” or “unending in its time”.

This is meaningful to see. Those who have been wandering in samsara, a great ocean of suffering, from beginningless time will continue to flounder about helplessly in the mire of difficult-tobear suffering until they meet the holy dharma and practise it. When wise ones meet the dharma, it will be like meeting with a boat in the middle of the ocean, and they will rely on it and go, without the possibility of return, to the far shore of the great waters that are a reservoir of suffering. By doing so, they come to “see”, where see means to know, the whole vault of knowables. There is nothing of greater meaning than that, and in addition, the holy dharma has in it the ultimate, supreme meaning, so it is spoken of with this phrase.

Those who understand what this is saying—that the nature of this samsara is suffering and that its only antidote is the dharma—and who then rely on the dharma to eradicate their samsaric sufferings will develop an eye of trust that is very certain about the dharma.
They will say, “Oh my goodness! This speech of the buddha is a great truth!” Others who are stupid might have this holy dharma in their hands but, because they view it as words only and do not see it as the instrument that actually does the work of abandoning samsara, they never actually experience its meaning.

It is known to experts through personal self-knowing shows that the dharma is extremely profound and that it is not the domain of the ordinary rational mind of philosophers or worldly types.

Note that it is only the Buddha amongst them who is the ultimate wise one and who has fully made the factual situation into the object of the self-knowing.

In the phrase “personal self-knowing”: personal has the meaning “not mixed in with other”; self has the meaning “the entity of those objects un-mistaken”; and knowing has the meaning “to see”. When put together it goes like this. Consciousness that works by being conscious of other—like an eye consciousness registers vases, and so on—will not know this profound dharma by looking in towards itself. Rather, this profound dharma will be known only by a knower that knows itself. This is the object only of an uncommon type of rational mind[267]. Therefore, the meaning here is, “The dharma is the domain of those who have personal self-knowing wisdom[268]. Because of that, the places where you can put your hopes and which are places of unchanging trust are the non-ordinary, beyond-the-world qualities experienced through meditation”.
Thus the first part of this section has taught that the holy dharma is the excellence that could be gained or taken from within the vault of knowables. The second part presents the way that this dharma will, if taken up, be a definite reliance for mind.

The dharma spoken by the bhagavat serves well for taming[269]. In relation to this, one person had the thought, “It would be hard for the Buddha’s dharma to be a mental reliance given its infinite variety of presentation; he taught it to some as ‘the skandhas, and so on exist’, he taught to others as ‘they do not exist’, he taught it to some as both, to some as neither, and so on”. However, that is not the case. The buddha bhagavat, a being of valid cognition, knows well the elements, faculties, and thoughts of those to be tamed. Because of that, he taught each part of the dharma patiently, as one would do the work of wiping and rubbing a precious jewel. He began by teaching the two truths coarsely, then he taught them more precisely, then with great precision, and finally in their ultimate meaning[270]. Every bit of that teaching went to taming the afflictions of the mindstreams of those to be tamed and every bit of it was presented only for arriving at the meaning of ultimate enlightenment; it is not that the meanings involved contradict one another or that sometimes he did not teach the authentic meaning. Every word of the dharma without exception applies without contradiction to the one, ultimate enlightenment, therefore these words are used to describe it.

Some texts have instead of “legs par brten pa ‹› serves well” the words “legs par ston pa ‹› well taught”, though the basic meaning is the same. There is also a thread of commentary which, basing itself on the term “mental reliance”, explains these words to mean “caring for the restrictions that come with the Vinaya”[271]. This raises the need for examining the translation equivalents involved and commentaries on the meaning; doing so will let us to know what is and is not the meaning intended in the text itself.

You might wonder, “How could renunciation possibly be able to validly see the whole of the holy dharma, and arrive at a final understanding of it as one, ultimate superfactual type?” Renunciation—when taken to mean the renunciation that consists of various methods of renunciation in light of all of the things to be abandoned starting at the coarse level of total affliction and going up to the level of ignorance latencies[272]—is the cause of a perfect abandonment. Furthermore, when the stains of the two obscurations have been exhausted, that perfect abandonment itself is the attainment of the ultimate of realizations, unsurpassed complete enlightenment. Thus it is saying that renunciation causes one to go to complete enlightenment.

Having this final understanding of great enlightenment as the abandonment of the entirety of what is to be abandoned and the realization of the entirety of what is to be realized is the teaching of a single, ultimate vehicle. Following on from that, if the entirety of what is to be taught as the holy dharma is one thing, there being not the slightest contradiction over what needs to be abandoned, then everything is complete in one, non-contradictory, conducive path. Thus, although the Buddha’s dharma might be immeasurable because of the thoughts of those to be tamed, it is without any disharmony[273]. And it is not just free of all disharmony; all of the lower level qualities are contained in the higher level ones and do not falter[274], therefore all of them are complete in one key point, and so it is also the case that it has inclusion. Now, the individual meanings of some of the holy dharmas are contradictory. Following on from that, if one were not included within the other, then the dharma could not be suitable as an ultimate mental reliance. However, that it is not so; dharma of any stature[275] can withstand anything and because of that the dharma is said to be “suitable as a definite mental reliance”.

Generally, all of the composite dharmas with outflows, whatever and wherever, are in the end not “imperishable”. Thus, even though you attain the sovereignty of someone such as a wheel-wielder[276], Brahmā, Indra, or the like, it will be a situation that is without reliability. You, as the one who attains it, might want it and decide that you will not let go of it but, from its side, the position attained does not have reliability and is not suited to being taken up for that purpose. Dharma is not like that because, as long as you, the one reliant on it, do not let go of it, it cannot, anywhere or anytime, lose its ability to remain reliable or to stay on course.

The word “reliability” in the phrase here should be understood to mean that, when dharma is taken as a reliance, the support given to the one relying on it will not ever change. Then, the dharma is what the teacher spoke after he had produced direct perception of the knowables so, with that as the reason, there are the words “it has reliability”. One person says that the phrase here has to be taken to mean simply “dharma is reliant on buddha” and another says that it means “dharma is reliant on the tathāgata’s compassion”; understand that the meaning supplied here in some texts does not get to the actual meaning[277].

Concerning that, you might have this idea, “Such dharma is suitable to be taken as a non-deceptive mental reliance. However, in a world like this, where all enjoyments reaped in relation to doing good and obtaining a good result are cases of ‘exhaustion in a good result’, but where finalized good, about which it is said that, ‘at this time there is no known activity’, could not be suitable to be taken as an absolute mental reliance, and dharma too must be the same”[278]. However, it is not so. When you rely on dharma, activities done for the sake of a place of finalized good do connect you with the point of laying down the burden, the fruition of nomore-training. When that has been reached, the journeying involved in either having once again to do some other type of activity and connect with something else or having to continue on and on is truly cut, thus it does end the journey[279].

Certain commentaries have their own way of explaining how these words should be understood, such as “the movement of mind and mental events is cut” and “migrating about in samsara is cut”, and so on, but those are only partial explanations that do not get to the full meaning.

Given all of that and understanding that the only thing within this vault of knowable dharmas that could be cherished as an unchanging mental reliance is dharma, and given that the good paths of happiness of the conquerors of the past, present, and future, together with their sons and disciples, and of all migrators, arise only from the appearance of dharma, we have a need—we must make prayers of aspiration for holding to the holy dharma. This point was taught in the sutras, so prayers like that can be found in an enormous number of the conquerors’ sons’ prayers of aspiration.

Now that you have recollected the good qualities of the dharma in that way, the next step is to take up the dharma according to your own capacity with the thought, “How joyful I am now that I have met this appearance of the precious dharma”. Maitreya said this about taking up dharma,
Copying letters, offering, giving,
Hearing, reading, comprehending,
Explaining, reciting,
Contemplating it, and meditating …
which means that you should exert yourself at making this human life meaningful by practice founded in the ten dharma activities that Maitreya mentions[282].

The word saṅgha here in Tibetan is “dge ’dun ‹› intent on virtue”.

Nonetheless, the term really refers to those persons who are noble ones.[284]

The noble ones who are in the great vehicle, meaning either the Buddha Vehicle that is great because it transcends the world or the Great Vehicle that has the seven greats—reference, and so on— are like this[285]. Their mindstreams have been completely restrained through the principal training of discipline that has the style of separation from all types of faulty behaviour, therefore it is said that they have entered into good. Through having the principal training[286] of mind, they have the samādhi that goes with thoroughly ascertained fact. Therefore, it is said that they have entered into insight. Through not abiding in the extremes of permanence and nihilism, and so on, they have opened up the prajñā mindstream with its view of the authentic, so it is said that they have entered into straightness. All of them, moreover, have entered a nirvana in which there is no disharmony between view, discipline, migrators’ purposes, and so on, and that is referred to with they have entered into harmony.

</d>
<d e="2">
Alternatively, have entered into good can be seen as a statement of this group of epithets in summary. In that case, the noble saṅgha have entered an authentic path that turns away the entirety of failings[287], so “they have entered into good”, which is actually saying that the outsiders do not “enter into good” given that they do not have an authentic path.

</d>
<d e="2">
Now for the more extensive explanation of these four epithets. It says they have entered into insight; since insight here means nirvana, this epithet is about the fruition. Straightness means the noble one’s path. As a sutra says,
What is “straightness”? It is the noble one’s path …
Thus these two are taught from the perspective of path.

</d>
<d e="2">
Harmony means that all of those who have entered the noble one’s path are in harmony in that they are irreversibly going to the city of nirvana. Thus, this epithet is taught from the perspective of the persons who have entered the state of being, who are said to be, “without disharmony”.

Alternatively, the four can be taken to mean “the noble saṅgha have entered like this”, where “like this” refers to a progression of being without the four aspects successively of being lost, mistaken, side-tracked, or reversible. Their having entered a path which is true and un-mistaken because it has been freed of the four wrong approaches of not being good in relation to the meaning, and so on results in them being referred to as “persons in this world who have a purified mindstream”[288].

Being persons whose mindstreams have realized the profound dharmatā, they have become worthy of others paying them respect with hands moved into the pose of joined palms. Being holy guides of migrators, they have become worthy of others paying them homage with prostration, which is a greater show of respect again. And these ones whose mindstreams are now beautiful with their supreme qualities are fields of the glory of merit. Here “Glory” is a general name for that which is good or has some kind of perfection and their mindstreams are filled with merit, so their glory is the glory of merit. Since all perfections of the glory of merit arise in dependence on theirs, they are referred to as “field” for such.

In addition, they are divorced from faults and possess good qualities, so, worshipping them with offerings as large even as the third order thousand-fold worlds will not cause obscuration to arise in them.

And this is comparable to these words,
The supreme of what could be honoured due to worthiness of veneration,
Worthy of homage …[289]
In other words, this section is saying that the beings of the saṅgha “are worthy of worship through offerings by others” due to the fact they have thoroughly purified their own mindstreams.

In short, the path of holy dharma, when accomplished by insight into the authentic, will give rise to trust in the saṅgha and in the one who has finalized the training, the Buddha.

Having understood in that way the qualities of the precious jewel, the holy dharma, in relation both to the actual saṅgha and the one that merely bears its sign[292], one should perform as many acts of reverence and as much worship with offerings towards them as one is capable of, because doing so is a source of immeasurable merit.

The teacher said to remember the Three Jewels for a similar reason. And then there is the point that you gain immeasurable merit from doing so; in the Hurling A Boulder Sutra the teacher said,
Oh! You who have a mind to put something somewhere[294]! Roots of virtue created in relation to the Buddha will never be exhausted in samsara! They will not come to an end, so even though nirvana might be unending, they will cause it to be obtained. Roots of virtue created in relation to the dharma and roots of virtue created in relation to the saṅgha will never be exhausted in samsara; they will not come to an end and they will cause nirvana to be obtained.

And,
Similarly, Jambudvīpa has a height and width of seven thousand yojanas, Videha a height and width of eight thousand, the Western continent nine thousand, and the Northern continent ten thousand yojanas, and these can be measured by pacing them out. Yet virtuous roots created in relation to the Three Jewels cannot be measured. Similarly, Mt. Meru and its environs can be measured in srang-weights[295] and the great ocean can be measured in vase-fulls[296], but the roots of virtue created in relation to the Three Jewels cannot be measured.

Each of those provides just an illustration. In fact, the qualities of the Three Jewels are extremely vast—bigger even than space, are supremely stainless, and are unsurpassable. Even the measure of the benefits of just admiration and the like for them cannot be grasped.

For that reason, there is nothing not included in this set of Three Jewels, the authentic refuge. Thus, if intelligent ones remember the qualities of the three and then accept the three as the true, definite refuge, then at that point, those beings will have begun the work of putting an end to becoming and will have started the journey to definite ease.

It is like this. The mind of all the buddhas might be of one taste but, because their individual activities of arousing the mind and prayers of aspiration are immeasurable, the tathāgata himself could go on explaining the qualities of just one hair pore and one light ray from the body of one of the uncountable conquerors of the three times for as long as there is space but still would not be finished and still would have more to say. The benefits of hearing or reading the holy dharma contained in a single verse are explained as immeasurable, so imagine the benefits of seeing the entire holy dharma throughout space and time as the authentic path. There are immeasurable numbers of noble ones of the saṅgha in the ten directions and three times and the roots of virtue created by just one of them abiding in the samādhi of loving kindness also is immeasurable. Suddenly bringing all the qualities of the buddhas that have been mentioned above to mind, or bringing all of those of the dharma to mind, or taking interest in all those of the saṅgha has, each one, immeasurable benefits associated with it. But leave that aside; if even one recitation of this Sutra out of trust in these places of refuge is the source of the whole extent of the roots of virtue that have been explained for Three Jewels, then the benefits that come with explaining it, and so on are limitless! And again, leave that aside; even just being able to listen to this Sutra nicely one time will bring an understanding of the great meaning that comes with the attainment of this human body!

The Three Jewels are the supreme source of tens of millions of the glories of auspiciousness
And the banner of hearing them with its good explanations,
A mount for questions, takes one forward.
Then the intonations of never-ending auspiciousness
Bring the failings in all worlds to an end and as well
Show the door to the good path of interdependent origination,
A perpetual play of perfect glory,
And that auspiciousness having a warehouse of dharma opens the door.
The superior thought, a youthful new moon, together with
Supreme intelligence perpetually dwelling in the element of space
Envelops the world with the white light of benefit and ease[297].
Auspiciousness of total joy develops and
In the place known as The Auspicious Peak of Gods,
At a time when the auspiciousness of perfect teacher and retinue have come together,
Through the auspiciousness of many conditions marked with virtue,
The victory banner of the story of unwaning auspiciousness is hoisted.
By this goodness done here, may the excellent glorious guru Stay long and the saṅgha flourish, and
May the finalized activities that are the glory of benefit and bliss of the various beings
Never wane and always flourish!

The command of the holy guru of wondrous qualities of excellent learning and virtue was received at my crown, in which he urged me on, with an emphasis on auspiciousness. It was like boiling water on the body causing pain and upset but, having turned the mind to the nectar-like moon of the Three Jewels, the composition flowed easily and I, Mipham Nampar Gyalwa, produced a commentarial explanation which nicely settles the various issues of meaning. It was completed in two days, on the eighth and ninth lunar days of the waxing moon of Aśhvini[298]. May it be a cause for the thoughts in harmony with dharma of the various types of beings to be accomplished just as the beings wish.
